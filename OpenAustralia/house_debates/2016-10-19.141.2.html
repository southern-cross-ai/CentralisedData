        <p>
         I will make a brief opening statement. I am accompanied by my colleague the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment. Australia is currently confronted by an uncertain and complex international environment. Challenges include international terrorism, conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Ukraine, relative shifts in global economic and military power to Asia, and a growing protectionist sentiment that risks undermining global prosperity.
        </p>
        <p>
         The 2016-17 budget is part of the Australian government's plan to strengthen Australia's national security, promote prosperity and advance our interests as a liberal democracy and an open, export led economy. The Australian government is investing more than $9 million to continue the people smuggling and human trafficking task force, which is playing a key role in support of Operation Sovereign Borders and has restored the integrity of Australia's border protection system after the six years of abject policy failure by the then Rudd-Gillard Labor government.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are also investing over $6 million to establish Australia's first cyber ambassador and a cybersecurity program to fight cybercrime, one of the new frontiers of security challenges we face. The government have committed nearly $40 million to open two new diplomatic missions in China and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
          Papua New Guinea
         </a>
         to strengthen bilateral ties, increase market access for Australian businesses and enhance our ability to provide consular assistance to Australians travelling and working overseas.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since the budget was handed down, the government has announced a further $58 million over four years to expand Australia's overseas diplomatic presence. The government is committed to ensuring that Australia's diplomatic network matches our standing as one of the world's top 20 countries with global interests.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have strengthened our ability to respond to emerging overseas events, such as terror attacks and natural disasters, by establishing a Global Watch Office within the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
         </a>
         to monitor and respond to developments on a 24-hour basis.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government will continue to deliver an aid program that is effective and affordable. In 2016-17 Australia will invest $3.8 billion on official development assistance, making us the 12th largest donor among the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development comparable economies.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have committed an additional $220 million over three years to address humanitarian needs in Syria and surrounding countries and $100 million for gender equality programs and the innovation exchange that is developing new, exciting solutions to intractable developments problems in our region. The budget continues our commitments to other key government priorities, including the new
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombo_Plan" rel="nofollow">
          Colombo Plan
         </a>
         , which is supporting Australian undergraduates to undertake short- and long-term studies, internships and work placements in 40 countries across the Indo-Pacific. By the end of 2017, more than 17,500 students will have lived, studied and worked in our region under the new Colombo Plan that was only established in 2014 after we came to office.
        </p>
        <p>
         Trade, tourism and investment have played a key role in Australia's 25 years of consecutive, uninterrupted economic growth. We have delivered a trifecta of free trade agreements with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Asia" rel="nofollow">
          North Asia
         </a>
         powerhouse economies. Just last week, the amended Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement was signed. In the first year of operation, our agreements with Korea and Japan have delivered real benefits for our economy, including the agriculture sector. The value of Australian exports of fresh beef to Japan increased by 22 per cent to just over $1 billion. Exports of bottled wine to Korea increased 53 per cent. China's imports of fresh Australian lobster between January and March were triple those of 12 months ago.
        </p>
        <p>
         The 2016-17 budget is part of the Australian government's plan to provide Australian businesses with preferential market access and encourage utilisation of the agreements we have secured. As the minister at the table knows, the government has committed $16.6 million to continue to drive jobs and economic growth through trade and investment. Through the government's ambitious trade agenda, led by the Minister for Trade, Investment and Tourism, the government is ensuring that Australian businesses will have a significant advantage in capturing gains from the growth in Asia's middle-class. The government is connecting businesses with export markets through the online portal seminar series, training provider grants and professional services mutual recognition. The 2016-17 budget supports the government's ongoing efforts to advance Australia's national interests in an uncertain and complex global environment.

         <p>
          It is terrific that we have the opportunity today to talk about the foreign affairs portfolio, trade, tourism and so on. There is a lot of agreement across the aisle on issues around foreign policy—the importance of alliance relationships, the place of Australia in our region, the importance of the Indo Pacific region to Australia's future, and of course our support for international institutions like the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
           United Nations
          </a>
          and international laws and norms. Another area where there has been great support and bipartisanship over these last few years has been the support for the role that our defence forces are playing in Iraq and in Syria. I am sure all of us will be watching very closely during these next few days what happens in Mosul.
         </p>
         <p>
          But one of the questions that Labor have consistently put to the minister is: when will we have the opportunity in the Australian parliament to have a more detailed debate and discussion about what happens next? We have heard very concerning reports of the very brave Kurdish fighters, the Peshmerga, approaching from one side, Iraqi state forces approaching Mosul from another side. There are international concerns about what will happen between these two forces after the battle for Mosul. So I would like to ask the minister first of all: when will she lead a debate in our federal parliament about Australia's role in this conflict overseas? Particularly, when will we have the opportunity to address the 'day after' scenario for Iraq? And also, when will we have the opportunity to have a discussion about the role the larger powers—Iran, Russia and others—are playing in the region and what significance that has for Australia? When will we have that debate in the parliament?
         </p>
         <p>
          There are important differences between the government and the opposition, and the minister has alluded to one of them—our aid program. Labor committed at the last election that we would invest $800 million more than the Liberals over the forward estimates in the aid program. We would like the minister to address the fact that aid organisations, including the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Council" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Council
          </a>
          for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Development" rel="nofollow">
           International Development
          </a>
          , have said that this aid program under this minister has no vision, that this budget marks the Turnbull government as the least generous in Australian history. I would like to know whether the minister is proud of that achievement and whether she argued for those massive aid cuts or whether in fact she was rolled in the cabinet on those issues.
         </p>
         <p>
          We on this side have a similar position to the government—that the international laws and norms are absolutely critical to Australia's future. We do best in a world that abides by the rules. We have seen the minister urging China and other parties in disputes in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea" rel="nofollow">
           South China Sea
          </a>
          and the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_China" rel="nofollow">
           East China
          </a>
          sea to abide by those international laws and norms and by the decisions that are made in respect of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
           UN
          </a>
          Convention on the Law of the Sea. How does the minister continue to make that case publicly when Australia itself is being criticised globally for our refusal to come to a final arrangement with Timor-Leste on the seabed boundary dispute that has indeed been dragging on for so long? So could the minister also comment on how difficult it must be for her to be lecturing other countries on the importance of following the rules when Australia is not prepared to be judged by the same set of rules that we are urging others to follow.
         </p>
         <p>
          I have one final question. The minister mentioned the extra $9 million, I think it was, on issues around people smuggling and border control. I would like the minister to tell us whether she still abides by the decision she made to vote against an arrangement with Malaysia for Malaysia to accept asylum seekers from Australia or whether, like the former Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, she now admits that was the wrong decision to make.

          </small>
          <p>
           I am so delighted that the shadow minister for health has now shown an interest in Foreign Affairs, because when she was the shadow minister for foreign affairs not once did she come to the consideration in detail, not once did the shadow minister for foreign affairs—now health—attend this important chamber to discuss the foreign affairs and trade budget; not once. So this newfound interest is quite a novelty for us all—she is in the chamber.
          </p>
          <p>
           The shadow minister for health, the former shadow minister for foreign affairs, who never attended this chamber in that capacity, raised a whole raft of issues. First she asked when there would be an opportunity to discuss our involvement in Iraq. Obviously, she was not taking notice yesterday when the Prime Minister made a speech specifically on the Mosul offensive, on our military commitment in Iraq, and on the work that we are doing in training, advising and supporting the Iraqi security forces.
          </p>
          <p>
           Yesterday the Prime Minister spoke in the House about the humanitarian effort that the Australian government was providing, and indeed it is incumbent upon the opposition to ask questions in question time. Not once have I had a question from the opposition about the Mosul offensive, about what we are doing in Iraq.
          </p>
          <p>
           If the shadow minister for health, formerly the shadow minister for foreign affairs, was so interested in what is happening in Syria and Iraq, ask a question in question time. But of course she overlooks the fact that the Leader of the Opposition did have an opportunity to put Labor's position in relation to the Mosul offensive, our involvement in Iraq and indeed our involvement in Syria yesterday. He was given that opportunity, so I do not know where the member for Sydney was during that.
          </p>
          <p>
           Then she raised the issue of aid—yes, the aid budget is constrained by the budget legacy that we received from the Labor government, and Labor's now shadow minister for foreign affairs was indeed the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. When Labor's Senator Wong was the minister for finance—listen to this—she took a $1.5 billion forecast surplus in 2012-13, the member for Lilley's famous surplus, and turned it into a $19 million deficit. She then took a $23 billion forecast deficit to—

            Continuing with the issue of foreign affairs and trade—of which we have only just begun and of which we have only had 10 minutes for consideration in detail before we were interrupted by a division. Acting on the advice of the Deputy Clerk, who advises us that it is up to the chamber to make a decision about how long we proceed here, I think that we should be able to have, at the very least, half an hour for the important issue of foreign affairs and trade.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact that this government now wants to run away after 10 minutes of dealing with the issue of foreign affairs and trade and tourism tells you that this government is afraid of being accountable for the decisions that it has made in this budget. If the foreign minister and the trade minister do not come back to this chamber now for 20 minutes to answer questions, then it tells us that they are not prepared to be answerable for the decisions they have made.

              Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The fact is that 30 minutes was allocated for the entire portfolio of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Tourism. All we have had is one question from the representative of the shadow minister for foreign affairs to the minister. The minister responded, but we have had nothing about trade, nothing about tourism, nothing about any other issues before this House. That is entirely inappropriate. At the least we should be allowed to have the shadow minister for trade and me, as the shadow minister for tourism, put on the record the questions we would like answered and, if need be, the government can take them on notice and come back to us.

                   No, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have a point of order. We do not wish to challenge supply to the government. What we wish to challenge is the process here, and we can do that in a number of ways. We could do that through a dissent motion if need be, but we would ask that we be allowed to make a contribution and that it be put on the record. The member for Blaxland is about to put on the record his questions about trade, and I would like the opportunity to put on the record questions regarding tourism. Then we can move on, and you can put that resolution re the appropriation. That is a reasonable compromise to put forward on our behalf, which it is up to this chamber to determine. The minister opposite can be reasonable from time to time, and I would ask that this be one of those occasions, rather than our having a belligerent debate about procedures that will waste the time of this chamber.

                    I understand the frustrations of the member. Given that the standing orders in the Federation Chamber are not as definitive as we would like, the reality is that the minister has taken a different determination regarding the questions that you are asking—

                     It is my pleasure to speak on the environment portfolio and the energy portfolio—two very important areas of government attention. Let me start by saying that the coalition has a very strong and proud track record in relation to environmental matters. Go back to the time of

                     and Biodiversity Conservation Act, which is now in force. Prime Minister Abbott, during his time in office, included the banning of dredge disposal in the marine park of the
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef" rel="nofollow">

                     </a>
                     . Of course, the Prime Minister,

                      Malcolm Turnbull
                     </a>
                     , has been a strong proponent of effective and efficient action in emissions reduction, including going to Paris with a very significant target of a 26 to 28 per cent reduction on 2005 levels by 2030, which is going to place us in the upper echelon of the G20 in terms of targets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     In terms of the budget overview, I would like to make a few comments. Firstly, in terms of the Great Barrier Reef this budget strengthens the government's commitment with a $171 million boost. This includes a $70 million additional injection to the Reef Trust, which brings the government's total investment in the Reef Trust to $210 million. Obviously, this will be important for water quality projects and the like. There is also an extra $101 million for the National Landcare Program, which will help us implement the Reef 2050 Plan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     In terms of Antarctica, this government is making a very significant financial and resources commitment to research in that area. The centrepiece is the new icebreaker, and of course there is more than $200 million over 10 years from 2016-17. So that is a more than $2 billion commitment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     In terms of this portfolio, one of the most significant changes was the Prime Minister's decision to bring the portfolios of energy and environment together. That is important because climate change and energy policy are effectively two sides of the one coin. We are working to reduce our emissions. I am advised that we are on track to meet our 2020 targets by 78 million tonnes, having already beaten our first Kyoto target by 128 million tonnes of abatement. We have a number of policies, whether it is the Emissions Reduction Fund, with more than 600 projects, or whether it is what we are doing in terms of our energy efficiency program to try to get a 40 per cent boost in productivity and energy efficiency by 2030.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     I had the pleasure recently of going to Brunei for the Asia-Pacific Rainforest Summit, which was an initiative of my distinguished predecessor,
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Hunt" rel="nofollow">

                     , the member for Flinders. This meeting brought together representatives from 42 countries, including 600 different stakeholders. We talked about trying to reduce the amount of deforestation across the world as a way of boosting the environment and local communities and, of course, also reducing global emissions. Between 1990 and 2010, forests contracted in size by 3.3 million hectares, which is greater than the size of Vietnam.

                     This government is doing a lot of positive things. In fact, just the other day I was able to place the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Scheme as 107th on the National Heritage List, which is very significant. We were able to announce $5 million for a new conservatory at the botanical gardens here in Canberra. Of course, we were a leading part of the recent announcement of the phasing out of hydrofluorocarbons under the Montreal protocol by 85 per cent, which will be very significant in the future.

                     <p>
                      According to official government documents, Australia's actual emissions in 2020 will be 577 megatonnes of
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CO2" rel="nofollow">
                       CO2
                      </a>
                      equivalent. This is actually eight per cent above the minimum target of minus five per cent. In fact, the only way we will get to the cumulative abatement target is through projection improvements, which I will return to, carryover of credits from Kyoto period 1 and a hopeless Emissions Reduction Fund that only today has been reported that the Clean Energy Regulator has confirmed was not tested for additionality. Just imagine this for a moment: the Emissions Reduction Fund, the centrepiece of that
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Action" rel="nofollow">
                       Direct Action
                      </a>
                      dog, has not been tested adequately for additionality when it is paying for supposed abated emissions. In fact, regarding the Emissions Reduction Fund, the Prime Minister has said that it was a 'fig leaf' over doing nothing and, worse, 'fiscal recklessness on a grand scale'.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Returning to the improvement in the projections of Australia's emissions, which really is the heart of our abatement improvement, the minister's own department has stated that projections have fallen due to lower electricity demand, worse than expected agricultural conditions due to drought, lower manufacturing output due to industrial closures and weaker growth expectations from local coal production due to the fall in international coal prices.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      So, in fact, this government is claiming credit for a revision in our abatement task because they have killed manufacturing, particularly in the automotive industry, we have a drought that has reduced agricultural production, consumers are responding to higher electricity prices by reducing electricity demand and coal production was not as strong as expected because of lower coal prices. So we will probably achieve the minus-five per cent target, but we will have an economic structure of plus eight per cent which will make reaching for the 2030 target so much harder.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I have five questions for the minister. I ask that if he does not know the answers he take them on notice. Firstly, has any country or the
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
                       UN
                      </a>
                      questioned the additionality of the Emissions Reduction Fund and therefore the legitimacy of the abatement claim? Secondly, doesn't the latest revelation from the Clean Energy Regulator demonstrate that the Emissions Reduction Fund is a gigantic fraud? Thirdly, what happens if the coal price rebound is sustained and emissions projections have to be revised upwards? Fourthly, would this cause a blow-out in the cost of the Emissions Reduction Fund or simply allow the target not to be reached? Fifthly, how can the government be proud of reaching the minus-five target, if we do in fact reach it, through the deindustrialisation of Australia and the drought?
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      I will turn briefly to renewable energy. The renewable energy industry has faced relentless attacks from this government. The most recent example was the Prime Minister following his fossil of a Deputy Prime Minister in claiming renewable energy caused the
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                       South Australia
                      </a>
                      n blackout. Again, that was disproven today by the
                      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEMO" rel="nofollow">
                       AEMO
                      </a>
                      report. I ask again: what is this government's policy to support the development of renewable energy projects after 2020? The minister—and the Prime Minister—failed to answer this in the House of Representatives chamber. If he fails again to answer it now, I ask that he take it on notice.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      Also, can the minister answer the question regarding the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. What is the total dollar value of all concessional loans issued by the CEFC? What is the estimated return above equity in dollar terms that the CEFC has booked in its operations? Furthermore, given that there is very little additional cost to the taxpayer in maintaining the Clean Energy Innovation Fund, will the government consider retaining the Clean Energy Innovation Fund to complement

                      and the broader CEFC?

                       , because those questions are exactly the ones I want to answer. The member asked me about the Emissions Reduction Fund. The cost of abatement has been $12.10 a tonne. Do you know how much it was under the carbon tax? It was $1,200 a tonne!
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       The member asked about meeting our emissions target. When Labor were in government in 2012, they modelled how they were going to get to their own 2020 target. They were going to miss their target by a whopping 755 million tonnes. We are going to beat that target by 78 million tonnes. They were going to miss their target by 755 million tonnes, on their own modelling.

Those opposite have the hide to come into this chamber and talk about renewable energy when they had a 50 per cent target by 2030 with no road map to get there and which has been condemned by people on their own side, such as

                            Order! I am trying to give a ruling. The member for Blaxland will take his seat! I am trying to give a ruling. It is a fair comment that you make. There are 30 minutes allocated for the debate; the commencement time has expired. I understand the point that you make in and around the shortening of the time available and I can understand, completely, your frustration. However, there is a schedule.

                            Please, allow me to make a ruling so we can forge on. There are provisions within the House, for when this chamber suspends to go down for a division and that has played havoc. I suspect that it is something that the

                            needs to adopt into the future. Unfortunately, we have ministers now rolling in for their allocated timeslots. I do sympathise with the member, but I have made a ruling on this. The standing orders in the Federation Chamber are ambiguous and they do need attention, and I do take the frustrations on board.

                             I appreciate this opportunity to discuss the great things that we are doing in the Department of Agriculture and
                             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Resources" rel="nofollow">

                             , but obviously not. He is swinging with his Green mates. That is good; we will tell them all about it at the next election.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             It is very important that we understand exactly where we started with agriculture and water resources back in 2013: the department that was basically on its knees. Its funding had been cut by more than half. We had just come off the back of some catastrophic issues in the agricultural economy, especially in the live cattle trade, and we in the coalition wanted to make sure that we rebuilt this portfolio—that we rebuilt it and then maintained the respect that it deserves as one of the pillars of our economy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             We went into the white paper process and got a substantial funding injection, especially into the crucial areas of biosecurity. We brought forward accelerated depreciation for water reticulation, fencing and fodder storage of 100 per cent over three years.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             We got the Farm Management Deposits, which formerly
                             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Anderson" rel="nofollow">

                             had fought a torrid battle for and got through to $400,000. We doubled them to $800,000 and allowed them to be offset against loans on your place—basically giving you a tax deduction to pay off your loan on a place. We know that the best way you can survive on the land is to have strong equity in your business. This was to encourage people, especially young farmers, when they get onto a place—and I can say, as a person whose previous life was as an accountant, 'Pay off your loan; you will survive.' It is the same thing with everything. When you get a good season, jam it against your loan and get a farm management deposit.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             We also made sure that we made access to concessional loans--$250 million per year for drought concessional loans. And now, between that and the Dairy Support Package, we have loaned out well in excess of half a billion dollars to close to 1,000 people. We built on that through the last election by announcing the Regional Investment Corporation, which is going to be a facility to assist this—to make it more fluid and to make it work quicker—so that when an issue comes up, and it is for our government or any other government in the future, the Minister for Agriculture and Water Resources can act quickly.

                            <p>
                             We have better country-of-origin labelling that truly identifies where the product is made and what proportion of what is in the packet comes from our nation, because this is what not only the Australian people but also people overseas were asking for. They want to pay a premium for an Australian product but they want to make sure that it is bona fides—that what is in the package is from our nation. With an

                             commissioner in place, we put $25.8 million towards pest and weed control. Now when we go out we can actually start to see this tactile delivery. We can go out to Cunnamulla and say, 'These are the dog fences for which we have provided money. We now can bring sheep and shearers back into the area and bring commerce back into the area—making people's lives better.'
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             What is really important is the $2½ billion we put aside for the Water Infrastructure package. I am very frustrated at the moment with one state in particular, Queensland, which has been completely recalcitrant and not playing the game. You give them the money—in excess of $90 million—for feasibility studies but do not see one started. You put $130 million on the table for the Rookwood Weir—it could bring in an extra $1 billion the year and an extra 2300 jobs—and it is something that should be supported. People should get in behind it. Where has the vision that existed with people like Curtin, Chifley and Menzies gone? Why are we so scared of our own shadow? Why don't we get in there and make these things happen?
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             We have record prices in cattle and in sheep; we are turning around the wool market; the grow contracts are turning around. Pork is at record prices. Our protein grains—chickpeas—are at record prices, but people say, 'What about your wheat market?' I understand that, but that is why we are making sure there is investment in such things as the inland rail to allow intermodal movement.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                             The other thing that I know the member for Hunter will bring up is the process of decentralisation. We want to create centres of excellence. Just as when the minerals department was moved to Maitland, we are moving

                             down to Wagga. At estimates yesterday we saw a $1.2 billion a year saving through this form of decentralisation. The FRDC is going to Adelaide; a section of

                             is going up to Toowoomba. These are things we want to do because we believe in decentralisation. I look forward to this opportunity to tell the Australian people about the great work we are doing—

                               supports the relocation of the APVMA. I asked the minister: does he stand by that assertion? I ask him: how many staff have been lost to the APVMA since he first socialised his determination to relocate that body to his own electorate? Has he revisited the cost of the relocation? I think originally it was $24 million or so. Has he revisited that budget allocation and what is the revision? He is now hiding behind cabinet processes, but will he commit to releasing the cost-benefit analysis of the relocation to Armidale, once the cabinet has completed its deliberations?

                                I was going to wait until the end of the day, but just to show that we do not hide behind any of this, I think it is important to deal with this issue. What frustrates me so much is that the member for Hunter, who knows full well that Premier Bob Carr moved the department of minerals to Maitland because of the economic development it would bring to that region. I commend former Premier Bob Carr for doing that. He was a person of vision, but now the Labor Party has become so insular and so myopic that the only thing they can think about developing is developing Canberra further. Canberra is a wonderful city—God bless Canberra! We are going to spend $100 million on this building, but the largesse of government deserves to be spread further and wider than just Canberra. This is why we want to create these centres of excellence so people in the rural science department of

This is what we do with our negotiations. We are not going to be completely militaristic about this. We are not trying to just send people out to the country. We work with people, and we are working with the department and with the peak industry bodies to make sure that this lands properly. I do not know what Senator Anne Ruston said, but it would have been a reflection of the fact that we are in discussions with CropLife and that Matthew Cossey has shown me that he is now supportive of the process and wants to be part of the process, and I hope that gives the member for Hunter the answer to his question.

                                In regard to socialising the move and who is left, I have been informed that the turnover is no different from what has been happening at any other time. In 2015-16, 48 people left APVMA—seven resigned, 19 transferred, seven retired and 15 completed their contract. From the people who provided a reason for departure, six of the 48—12.5 per cent—said relocation was an issue. Unless you say 12.5 per cent of the people who have actually moved on is somehow a disastrous number, you do not really have an argument. When you talk about revisiting the costs, we are going to make sure that we do this in the most effective way. Through the white paper, and through the process of running our department effectively, we have money put aside so that we can get this process happening.

                                The honourable member went through the cost-benefit analysis. They always grab these things as if they are a smoking gun—'It's Watergate!' Basically, the result of the cost-benefit analysis is neither massively for it nor massively against it—it is basically impartial but there is a slight benefit. There you go. I imagine it would have been the same result when

                                moved the minerals department to Maitland. Of course, Premier Bob Carr was a substantive person, a person of vision. He had the capacity to deal with issues such as that. That is what we will be doing here, because we are people of vision. We are the same people of vision who want to build dams, who believe in decentralisation, who believe in inland rail, who have put money on the table to seal the road from Laverton to Winton—we are the sort of people who have that vision to make our nation a stronger place. In the past Labor have had the vote in Armidale but, by gosh, they have lost it now.

                                      I thank the minister for his answer. He just told the House of Representatives of the Australian parliament that the relocation of the APVMA is going to create jobs outside Armidale. I will now ask him, when he next gets to his feet, to expand on that. How is it that the relocation of a regulatory agency to Armidale—an agency which does not interface with farmers but an agency which interfaces with the chemical companies, is going to create benefits for Australian agriculture—remembering that those farm chemicals and veterinary medicines are critical to productivity in our—

                                      Listen to the ignorance of these people on the other side! This agency approves crop protection, for example. It approves veterinary medicines—the things that are critical to agricultural productivity. It interfaces with the big multinational chemical companies which come here to Canberra hoping to have their new products registered, approved or re-approved in a timely manner. Already they have difficulty doing so, largely because of under-resourcing at the APVMA and workforce issues. When that workforce walks away from the APVMA—when those very highly-trained professionals walk away because they have their children in schools in Canberra, rather than go to Armidale—that workforce will be destroyed, and the minister knows it.

                                      Only this week I spoke to a proponent of a chemical to do with rodents on farms, who wants his organic chemical approved. Usually, that is a 10-week process. He has been told he will have to wait until April, Minister, because your workforce is already in decline. So the minister says that the relocation of this regulatory authority from Canberra to Armidale is going to create jobs in the agriculture sector. To save time, I will sit down and simply ask him again: where are those jobs in the agriculture sector? How is this relocation going to benefit the agriculture sector? Are you going to have approvals more quickly as a result of this move to Armidale?

There are concessional loans and the farm household allowance, where $1.1 million a week is being paid out on average, and there is the Rural Financial Counselling Service—

                                        But I want to refer specifically, if I could, to the concessional loan products. In the 2015-16 financial year the government made available $250 million in drought concessional loans and drought recovery concessional loans. Due to the election caretaker period, we extended those loans to 31 October so that a new scheme could be established on 1 November 2016. These loans are currently being delivered on behalf of the Commonwealth by the states and territories.

                                        But let's just focus on why he is no friend of farmers in hardship in South Australia, and this is the so-called minister for agriculture in South Australia. We made a whopping $10 million available for drought concessional loans in South Australia and $10 million for the drought recovery concessional loans. Mr Deputy Speaker, you have heard that his agency, PIRSA, was responsible for managing that process.
                                       </p>
                                       <p>
                                        Now, these are loans where farmers get access to a concessional 2.66 per cent interest rate for 10 years, with interest only for the first five years and P&amp;I for the second five years. Loans are available for up to 50 per cent of total eligible debt, or $1 million—whichever is the lesser.
                                       </p>
                                       <p>
                                        You would have thought that, if the minister for agriculture in South Australia was a fierce advocate for farmers in South Australia, particularly those suffering hardship, he would have ensured all of that $20 million was made available to them. But, sadly, Minister, I can report to you, and you know well, that a paltry $2 million was made available to farmers in South Australia in hardship—a paltry $2 million.

                                        The sad thing in South Australia is that farmers have been deterred from making these applications, because of the actions of the

                                        minister and his ineffectual agency PIRSA. We now have a situation where only three farmers have accessed these drought concessional loans but, more disturbingly, under the new dairy loans, farmers have further concerns in South Australian. One of these concerns is with PIRSA and the way they are approaching this. Whereas water entitlements are accepted as security in other jurisdictions on a case-by-case approach, PIRSA have told the industry that they will not accept water as security for loans. This is nonsensical with respect. Every banker I know in the agrispace understands that these entitlements are tradeable and are a security for a loan. So my question is to the minister for agriculture here federally: what is our government doing to make concessional loans available in my state of South Australia so that we ensure farmers get the assistance they need?

                                         Firstly, I would like to say, with respect to the shadow minister's questioning, I note that the minister did not commit to the release of the

                                         after the cabinet had completed its deliberating in relation to the APVMA. I would also like to talk about the dairy industry. In my electorate of Mayo, I have many dairy farmers who do not sell to Fonterra and Murray Goulburn. These farmers do not currently have access to loans under the Dairy Recovery Concessional Loans scheme, despite being just as heavily affected by the recent drop in farmgate milk prices. Will the minister be extending the Dairy Recovery Concessional Loans scheme to farmers who to not sell to Fonterra and Murray Goulburn? Many farmers have told me they are hurting even though they do not sell to those two providers.

                                         , security valuations are only based on land and not the full value of farm assets such as lands, livestock and water. I met with the state minister for agriculture who said to me that he needed greater clarity in relation to this from the federal minister. So my question to the minister is: can you provide some greater clarity so that we can have a national position in relation to this?

When the previous Prime Minister was around they were going to build submarines in Japan and of course we had a defence minister who said that

                                                  I have a number of questions about the ASC reform implementation—in particular, the separation of ASC into three companies based around shipbuilding, submarine maintenance and support and infrastructure. I would like to know who has been consulted as part of the review; what the terms of reference of it were; whether any consideration was given to the possible privatisation of ASC; whether the government has received any advice regarding the privatisation of ASC either in whole or in part; and whether the government has been approached by any organisations or private sector entities, businesses, sections of industry or others—middlemen or whoever else—interested in purchasing any part of ASC. Could the minister also advise how long their commitment not to privatise ASC is good for? Is this a time based thing? Is it good for this election or is it a standing bit of government policy? I would be most interested to hear the minister's views on the contortions that are this government's shipbuilding policy.

To ensure that the ASC has the best possible structure to pursue future shipbuilding opportunities and to support the government's naval shipbuilding objectives, the government announced on 11 October that the ASC will be structurally separated into individual shipbuilding, submarine sustainment and infrastructure businesses. The infrastructure company will hold and manage significant upgrades of shipbuilding and infrastructure assets to support future shipbuilding and submarine programs, and the shipbuilding company will employ the skilled shipbuilding workforce and complete the air warfare destroyer project, while the submarine sustainment company will employ the submarine sustainment workforce and sustain the

The structural separation is, in fact, designed to ensure that the ASC is in the best possible position to pursue future shipbuilding opportunities and to support the government's long-term plans for the Australian naval shipbuilding industry. It will deliver a more efficient and flexible approach. It will facilitate the necessary investment in infrastructure and in workforce capability and facilitate the significant ramp-up in shipbuilding related jobs as required to better support multiple build programs under our naval shipbuilding plan.

Those opposite cut our investment in defence to the core. It cut to the core to levels that we have not seen since about 1938, I think it was. So it is no wonder that those opposite were not actually able to build anything during their time in government. It is no wonder that those opposite are quite ashamed of their record. Not only have we announced an investment plan, we are also delivering it with funding.

                                                    I appreciate the opportunity to ask some questions of the Minister representing the Minister for Finance in relation to the proposed sale or other commercialisation of the ASIC registry business. The terms of reference for the scoping study that was undertaken into the ASIC registry business included a requirement that the report for the study address, among other things, identification of any national security issues and mitigation strategies. So I ask the minister: which national security agencies and which national security oversight agencies or entities have been consulted in relation to the possible sale, lease or other commercialisation of the ASIC registry business?

                                                    On a related note, the government obviously has a public data policy, released in December 2015, as part of its National Innovation and Science Agenda. This proposal appears to be somewhat at odds with that policy. It is also at odds with a comment from the Prime Minister previously that it was 'regrettable that ASIC's data is behind a paywall'. Accordingly, I ask: has the Digital Transformation Office been consulted in relation to the possible sale or other commercialisation of the ASIC registry business? Has the public data branch of the

If the ASIC registry business is sold, leased or otherwise commercialised, is it anticipated that price regulation would apply to new products? If the ASIC registry business is sold to a corporation, leased to a corporation or otherwise commercialised by agreement with a corporation, will there be any requirement that that corporation be and remain majority Australian owned? If the ASIC registry business is sold to a corporation, leased to a corporation or otherwise commercialised by agreement with a corporation, to what extent will it be possible for the government to ensure the security of the data held by the corporation? Finally, to what extent does the minister believe a new, non-government operator of the ASIC registry will be able to increase search volumes? Has any modelling or prediction work been undertaken to assess the possible additional revenue that could realistically be generated by increasing search volumes for currently existing searches, or is it, instead, intended to be the case that the additional revenue would primarily be generated from the creation of new products under a monopoly arrangement?

They are not so noisy now! While Labor were busy destroying our economy, under their watch at least 1,200 people died at sea and, of course, we have all heard about the pink batts disaster.

                                                        We are focused on growing our economy outside of a resource based, bulk-tonnage economy and are placing an emphasis on instead growing a diverse economy reliant upon the skills and resourcefulness of our people. Infrastructure and education are means that are proven to promote growth in the economy and they are measures this government is very proud to fund.

                                                        This government is delivering on commitments to increase education infrastructure funding in regional centres such as the capital grants scheme, which is committed to a new $800,000 funding package for the Geraldton Grammar School, which is my electorate. Since 2015, the capital grants scheme has committed over $3 million to funding school infrastructure projects in Durack. This is indicative of the hard work being done to increase not just the gross amount of students studying but the quality and employability of the graduates who are coming out at the other side. This clearly demonstrates our commitment to building a new economy based on an educated and intelligent workforce.

This is fantastic news for the electorate of Durack, which includes the entirety of the north-west of

                                                        . This government has committed $600 million for the improvement of roads throughout northern Australia, a much needed injection of capital that will improve accessibility to remote communities and foster regional growth even further. There is also an extra $200 million available for water infrastructure throughout northern Australia—much of which will come to the west, I am pleased to say. This government has demonstrated an effective and energetic response to the mining downturn, and I am sure the members present will be aware that my electorate was one of the hardest hit with respect to the downturn in the mining industry. But we are resilient and we progress. This government is committed to remaining financially responsible and managing this deficit with the care and consideration that is expected by us, by the taxpayers of Australia.

In fact, one of the election commitments the Turnbull government made was a commitment to Indigenous entrepreneurship, and this government has tabled a $90 million fund for Indigenous entrepreneurs seeking to give an equal opportunity to those innovative people in the Indigenous business sector.

I ask the minister: what further action is the government taking to reduce spending growth and get the budget back to surplus? What real-world impact will this have on families and businesses in my electorate of Durack? What other progress is the government making—

                                                          I thank the members for their questions. Let me start by addressing the member for Griffith's question about the ASIC register. She has asked about the process that has been put in place and about the evaluation of the potential sale of the ASIC register—how that has been conducted and who has been consulted.
                                                         </p>
                                                         <p>
                                                          Let me say that the government announced in the 2015-16 budget, following consideration of a scoping study, that it would undertake a competitive tender process to market test the capacity of a private operator to upgrade and operate the ASIC registry and to develop value-added products. The government have always said that we would maintain ownership of ASIC's registry data. The government have also said that we are absolutely committed to open data in this government—absolutely committed. Before any decision is made about the sale of the ASIC register—and that decision would need to be made by cabinet—we would need to be completely sure that it met those very high standards we have set and that it would be in the national interest to do so. It is going through the evaluation process, and all relevant stakeholders have, in fact, been contacted for their views.
                                                         </p>
                                                         <p>
                                                          Going to the member for Durack's question about spending, debt and deficits, she makes a very excellent point. She knows that, when the last coalition government—the Howard-Costello government—was elected and came into government, they inherited a $96 billion black hole from the Labor Party. There was no money in the bank but, certainly, money needed to be paid back, and so that is what they did. They steadily worked away at repaying the $96 billion.

He does not like the fact that, since coming into government in 2013, we have announced over 500 measures that improve the budget bottom line. These measures have improved the budget bottom line over the relevant forward estimates period by almost $100 billion. But our biggest challenge in government, in reining in spending, is those opposite. It is those opposite who believe that you can tax your way to prosperity. Of course, there is no-one who would actually support this view.

It is very easy to announce something, but it is actually very difficult to fund it. So we have taken the difficult decisions to ensure that it is not simply a cruel hoax on some of the most vulnerable people in our society. We have taken those decisions so that those people can be confident that the National Disability Insurance Scheme will be able to be delivered and delivered in full. It is only through our savings measures that we are able to ensure that that can occur.

Her own department—the macrodivision of Treasury—said, 'The underemployment result in the August 2016 quarter is 8.7 per cent.' That is the highest result since the start of the series in 1978. We have the worst underemployment in Australian history on this statistical series, and this minister does not have a clue about it, despite the fact that her own department stood up a couple of hours ago and said this was a fact.
                                                               </p>

                                                                As I said, this is disappointing, but not entirely surprising. This is a minister who is single-handedly responsible for the biggest parliamentary gaffe since Federation. We should not be surprised. We should not be surprised when this minister, who struggles with even basic details like the underemployment rate, cannot do some of the more important things in her job.
                                                               </p>

                                                                The first time this government were elected in 2013, they said their main task was to improve the budget bottom line. When they were re-elected in 2016 they said their main task was to give this $50 billion ram raid on the budget to big multinational corporations. Both of those policy objectives, whether you agree with them or not, are now in tatters. When it comes to improving the bottom line, it has not dawned on those opposite yet, after three years in government, that the deficit and the debt have blown out substantially. It is disappointing, but, again, not entirely surprising that it has not dawned on those opposite.
                                                               </p>

                                                                A couple of Fridays ago the government put out what is called the final budget outcome for the financial year just finished. They put it out on a Friday afternoon. There was no press conference from the Treasurer. There was not a word about it—just a sneaky little press release on a Friday afternoon, so ashamed were they of that outcome. Let me tell the chamber what that outcome was: the final budget outcome for the year just finished was $39.6 billion. That is a blowout eight times bigger than what was inherited. They stand up and they have the gall to talk about debt and deficit. The deficit has blown out substantially on their watch. This was supposed to be their reason for being, yet they have blown out the deficit substantially. They want to talk about debt. In the same final budget outcome net debt is blown out to $296 billion—$77 billion more than they inherited. They stand up and they talk about debt and deficit. I want to know from the minister: what will be the impact if this ineptitude leads to a downgrade in Australia's credit rating? What work has been done by the Treasury to understand the impacts of any downgrade? What would that mean for the people that we collectively represent?

The minister likes to raise my former employer—someone I am deeply, deeply proud of, having served us through the global financial crisis. You can say it over and over again. I am so proud to have worked for a Treasurer who did such a great job for Australia during the global financial crisis. Let's talk about former employers.

                                                                You can say what you like about the finance minister, but he has a lot more credibility in this space than the minister opposite. When he was asked whether the company tax cut was the centrepiece of the government's so-called economic plan, Minister Cormann said: 'Just to remind ourselves, you are quite right, it is our centrepiece, not just of our budget but the centrepiece of our national economic plan, our plan for growth and jobs.' We know now that this plan is in tatters; Peter Costello is bagging it; the Senate looks likely to knock it over. So I want to know: if this was the centrepiece of the government's jobs and growth plan and it is now in tatters—and if the other centrepiece was supposed to be budget repair and that it is tatters with these big budget blowouts—what now with the company tax cuts? Will you enact a humiliating backdown or will you stick to a policy which will hollow out schools and hospitals to give a big tax cut—a $50 billion ramraid—to the biggest multinational companies in this country?

He knows that corporate tax cuts are expected to return a business investment of around 2.6 per cent in the long term.

I find it very curious that he neglected to mention the unemployment rate—the fact that the unemployment rate fell by 0.1 percentage point to be 5.6 per cent in August, which was better than the medium market expectation for the rate to remain steady at around 5.7 per cent. This is the lowest unemployment rate since September 2013, almost three years ago.

Around 180,000 of those jobs have been created in the last 12 months. This is a government that believes it is important to create jobs. We believe it is important to encourage investment and we believe it is important to do that through our tax plan. In particular, we are encouraging small businesses, through the way that our tax plan operates, to make increased investments in their businesses. Through the cut to the company tax rate and through the equivalent tax discount that will be provided to unincorporated entities, they will be able to invest more in their business, to grow their business and to create more jobs in this country. Because, at the end of the day, that is what it is all about.

That is why they have a credibility problem over there.

Because she had not read her note before she started speaking, she said 'Look, we have gone so well that the unemployment rate is currently what we inherited from Labor in September 2013.' So her grand claim is: 'Look how well we have done; we have done as well as we inherited from Labor.' She really should read her stuff before she reads it out publicly. How embarrassing that the minister does not have a sense in her own mind—from her own community or from around the country—that we have a substantial underemployment problem in this country. Her Treasury officials understand this. They said at estimates, two hours ago, that the underemployment rate is the highest it has ever been—in my lifetime—since 1978. Since 1978, it has never been lower. It speaks volumes that the minister does not understand or appreciate this not just in a numerical sense but in a community sense. She does not understand that people are struggling to get the hours that they want. She then stands up and says, 'Hey, but our big defence is'—wait for it!—'the unemployment rate is so good, it's what Labor handed to us'. What a fizzer.
                                                                    </p>

That is one thing, and we have all had our fun—her own colleagues have had more fun with it than we have, frankly, with the whispered conversations on her side of the parliament. That is one thing, and people make mistakes. But it is another thing to really not understand the underemployment challenge and to quote back at us as if it were some great big policy achievement, with all the slogans about jobs and growth, that the unemployment rate—her chosen stat—is around the level that it was in the immediate aftermath of the
                                                                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GFC" rel="nofollow">

For a Treasury minister to not understand these basic things, to not have even a skerrick of a clue about underemployment or unemployment in this country—it is very troubling. If you take the politics out of it, I think most people on the street would like their cabinet ministers to have some understanding of the pressures that are in the labour market. That is my first set of points.
                                                                    </p>

If these blowouts in deficit and debt, which are in the government's own budget papers—they are not my opinion; they are the facts in the final budget outcome which were released. They are the facts in the budget papers that the Treasurer and the finance minister released. We know that at least one of the ratings agencies has said that they are concerned about the trajectory of the budget. In July, Standard &amp; Poor's warned the government that there was a one-in-three chance our rating would be downgraded. Moody's said that, without revenue measures to help fix the budget, there would be a credit negative for Australia. There are a whole range of alarm bells ringing from the ratings agencies.
                                                                    </p>

If the sovereign rating is downgraded then, in all likelihood, the banks will get downgraded as well. There are implications for borrowing costs. There are big implications, of course, for confidence in the economy. There are a range of implications. If one of those triple A credit ratings, which were won for the first time in our history from all three agencies under Labor—not under

                                                                      </a>

That is around a four-hour round trip each day. Around one in four adults in the workforce on the Central Coast leave their families early in the morning and return home late at night because they have to go where their jobs are. That means they need to juggle the demands of work, commuting and families.
                                                                     </p>

This was certainly highlighted last week in the Baird government's 20-year regional plan for the Central Coast which set out the state government's priorities for action and is a great blueprint for a vibrant sustainable region. One of the primary statistics used to drive this plan is the significant population growth. The document revealed that there will be more than 75,000 more people on the Central Coast by 2036, taking the population to well over 415,000. But the number of total jobs will rise from around 116,000 to 141,000, an increase of only 25,000. This underlines the need for more local jobs for local people on the Central Coast so that our region becomes not only the most beautiful place to work, live and visit but also a thriving hub of business and innovation that is driven by economic growth.
                                                                     </p>
                                                                     <p>
                                                                      This is particularly vital after six years of Labor which ended in 2013 when the then Labor government failed to deliver a clear plan for the Central Coast that could lay the economic foundation that our local families and businesses so desperately need. Under the coalition and the budgets that have been presented under this government, we are finally starting to see some projects delivered, business precincts established and Australian-first initiatives taking shape right in the heart of Gosford. For example, in the coalition's growth plan for the Central Coast in 2013 we committed to delivering 250 to 300 new government jobs in a Commonwealth agency building in Gosford. Then we doubled that to 600 jobs. We know that will boost the local economy, particularly for Gosford.
                                                                     </p>

There has been a petition posted online in support of our initiative, to make sure that we see our region thrive, with community figures now determined to see our city transformed at last, while major business people are speaking up in local media about the need to bring our city into the 21st century.
                                                                     </p>

The project is being delivered in partnership with all levels of government, the

                                                                     </p>

Part of this is the Turnbull government's legislation to provide personal income tax relief which has passed the parliament, confirming 500,000 average full-time wage earners across Australia will have more money in their pockets. This tax relief increases the middle-income tax bracket from $80,000 to $87,000, providing tax relief of up to $315 per year.
                                                                     </p>
                                                                     <p>
                                                                      To make it easier for businesses to expand and create more jobs, the budget proposes that the company tax rate be cut, with small and medium businesses benefiting first. It calls for small and medium businesses with annual turnover of less than $10 million to have their company tax rate cut to 27.5 per cent. This will reduce the tax rate for more than 5,000 companies in my electorate of Robertson.
                                                                     </p>
                                                                     <p>
                                                                      Since many small businesses are not companies, the government will also increase the unincorporated small business tax discount to eight per cent and extend the threshold from a turnover of $2 million to $5 million. This will enable more than 15,000 businesses in Robertson to access these concessions. But these changes must be part of a wider economic plan built on strong budget management, so my question to the minister is this: how does the 2016-17 budget, through these bills, promote jobs and growth? If the government's priority to repair the budget was not being pursued, what would be the alternative?

I know how committed she is to her electorate, to being a champion for her electorate and making sure that she can advocate particularly on behalf of those more than 5,000 small businesses that will be beneficiaries of our company tax cuts as well as the unincorporated businesses. Ninety-seven per cent of small businesses in this country are unincorporated, but they too will get the benefit through tax discounts.
                                                                       </p>

Those opposite, of course, do not support our threshold change to the definition of small business. It has not been changed in a great number of years. They would keep it to less than $2 million in turnover; we are raising it to $10 million. Why would we do that? Because we do not want to put a handbrake on aspiration. We want people to be able to do well. Those opposite would like to penalise them. We think it is a good thing when people do well, because when they do well they can grow more. When they grow more, they can encourage even more employment. The member for Robertson has seen that in her own electorate; in fact, I had the opportunity to visit a number of small businesses in her electorate not so long ago.
                                                                       </p>

Again, that is because we believe it is important not to penalise people for doing well. We believe it is important to give them a hand up and we think it is completely ridiculous to think that, in the next 10 years, the majority of Australians will be in the top two tax brackets, unless we do something about it. So it is our down payment on how we can reduce the personal income tax rates for those people.

He took a guess at 15 per cent and, of course, had to be put out of his misery and be told that it was, in fact, 19 per cent. Those opposite have no credibility on these issues and they should not stand in the way of company tax cuts that will benefit small business in this country. He asks me whether or not we are going to proceed with these changes. I would say instead to him: why is it that the Labor Party is so committed to blocking—

Those opposite would be very, very well aware that we need to get our spending under control in order to satisfy the ratings agencies, and the biggest blocker to getting spending under control, again, is those opposite. While we did have some assistance with the Budget Savings (Omnibus) Bill, frankly, that was not enough. Because of the debt trajectory that we were left with and because of the baked-in spending from those opposite, it was critically important that we address and arrest the spending, and those opposite have been complete blockers.

It was a very high profile trip and a notable announcement, and you got to spend time with the President of the United States, no doubt. Only this week during Senate estimates representatives from your very own department confirmed that it was the lead agency in the refugee deal and it was 'very involved' in the process, to quote them. Yet when it came to the details of the refugee deal, your department was unable to answer a single question on the basics of the agreement between the Australian government and the United States government.
                                                                           </p>

What was your personal involvement and role in the development of the refugee deal? When did the negotiations start for this agreement? When was the deal actually reached by the Australian government with the American government? When will refugees start to arrive in Australia? By when will they all have arrived? The department said there will be a small number of refugees, but precisely how many refugees will arrive in Australia? When did the department brief you on the deal? How long will the deal actually last? Tell us about the duration of the deal. What will be the cost to the Australian taxpayer? Will this impact on the overall intake, or is it included in the 18,750 commitment you re-announced in the United States of America? Do you have any other pay-to-play deals in the offing? Minister, unlike the department, do you know the answers to these questions and will you give them today?

I know how busy you are and what an effective job you are doing in your portfolio. The Immigration and Border Protection portfolio has a direct influence on things that happen in my electorate, and the coalition's success in stopping the boats has definitely had successful flow-on effects in my electorate of Swan.
                                                                            </p>

                                                                             </a>

As part of the federal budget, the Turnbull government announced that the Redcliffe housing would be one of the four detention facilities in Australia to close, saving $39.1 million over four years, which enhances the budget, of course. This is just one of the many success stories that show how stopping the boats has had dividends for the nation's finances. It is also a reminder of the importance of border security to this country. Our border security is one of the finest in the world, protecting Australia not just against illegal arrivals but also from numerous other threats such as drugs, weapons and fire arms. I have had the good fortune to go out to Perth airport and see the massive amount of illegal weapons, drugs and other things that have been taken by customs agents during their processing of packages coming into Australia.
                                                                            </p>

Contained in this package were 335 vials of performance- and image-enhancing drugs. The Border Force investigators executed a search warrant at this man's address and subsequently found prohibited weapons. Minister, this highlights the Border Force's commitment to protecting Australia from all types of threats.
                                                                            </p>

Minister, under Labor, 10,000 people, including 2,000 children, entered detention. In the September update of Operation Sovereign Borders, no illegal maritime arrivals were transferred to Australian immigration authorities and no illegal maritime arrivals were transferred to the regional processing centres. Stopping the people smugglers has been a key part of our border security. Indonesian authorities recently arrested one person for their alleged facilitator involvement in people-smuggling activities. The coalition works with the Department of Immigration and Border Protection to continue the delivery of counter-people-smuggling efforts with counterpart agencies in Asia, including Indonesia, Malaysia and

His particular story was as follows. When I asked him how he got to Australia, he said he had arrived by boat during the Howard years. It was one of the three boats that arrived after the policy on turning the boats back was implemented. I asked him, 'How did you find the people smugglers?' He said: 'I didn't find the people smugglers. They actually came to our village and promised that they could get us into Australia.' I said, 'What did that cost you?' He said, 'It cost
                                                                             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">

He said, 'Yeah, it was quite risky, but the people smugglers assured us they could get us into Australia.' So he paid the $10,000 and eventually arrived in Australia on one of the three boats that actually got into Australia. At the end, I said, 'So you found a way to beat the system.' He agreed, 'Yes, we did find a way to beat the system.' That is a story from one of the refugees who came in at that time, actually confirming that it is the people smugglers' trade and nothing more than that.
                                                                            </p>

There is broad support for a strong immigration program in this country, as long as it is through legal means. I know we still have a few people in Nauru and on Manus, but we have reduced those numbers. There are only 873 people in the Manus Regional Processing Centre and even fewer people in the Nauru Regional Processing Centre—well below the 10,000 people whom Labor put in detention.

Minister, I am keen for you to explain to the people of Far North Queensland and the Torres Strait: what were those production glitches, will those glitches impact on the effectiveness of the vessels, what was the cost of these vessels and will the delays result in additional expenses? The two vessels are being produced in the United States of America. Has the department purchased other vessels from the company in the United States before? What operations were those two vessels to undertake, precisely? Has the delay in delivering these two vessels resulted in any gaps in the Australian Border Force network in Far North Queensland, North Queensland or the Torres Strait? If so, how is that gap being managed?

I want to say thank you to other colleagues, including the shadow minister, here today. There are a number of issues that have been raised. To go to the first directly: it is true that the Prime Minister and I had a very productive trip to the United States only a few weeks ago. There, we were able to talk about the success that Australia had enjoyed over the course of the last several years in stopping deaths at sea.
                                                                              </p>

                                                                               One of the proudest achievements of this government is that we have been able to clean up a mess of Labor's making: 50,000 people arrived in 800 boats. Labor has apologised for that, and we welcome that apology, but it seems that they have not learned from the lesson, because their policy, ultimately, has not changed. If they were elected tomorrow, the difficulty for Labor is that the boats would recommence, because the people smugglers can sniff out a weak Labor leader 10,000 miles away. They did it with Rudd, they did it with Gillard and they are doing it again with Mr Shorten.
                                                                              </p>

Mr Neumann presides, along with the Leader of the Opposition, over an opposition which is squarely divided when it comes to this important issue. We can go through each of the contributions of members on the backbench who would add to the failure which they would again preside over, if they were to come back into government. It is a very important point to make because, when we went the United States, we were able to talk about the successes—and there are many European nations who have a lot of interest in the success that Australia has been able to achieve. My department has worked with some of those agencies and some of those countries to work through not just the success that we have had in Operation Sovereign Borders but also the intelligence picture that sits beneath that.
                                                                              </p>

We have diplomatic engagement with a number of countries, which has resulted in significant success. The point of that is that we have had, as part of that success, interaction with countries, including the United States. It is why we took a decision to support the United States in relation to the settlement of a limited number of people under the program that the honourable member opposite spoke of in his contribution.

We have relied necessarily on the United States and that partnership to deal with the security checks that we asked to be undertaken so that we did not end up with the sorts of problems that we have seen in Europe. We have scrutinised every application to the best of our ability. We have done that with the support of the United States and with the support of our

There is no secret to the process, there is no secret to the detail. Costa Rica, the United States and Australia have been very transparent about the process, and it was an important summit that

I am talking about backpacker 417 and 462 visas, about skilled migration and skilled temporary worker 457 visas; and about international students. There are about 1.3 million people in this country on temporary work visa arrangements. That is a lot of people to have in our country. Do we know at this moment where they are and where they are working? Do we know where every one of these 1.3 million people is working? Leaving aside the favourite topic of the government, do we really have control of our borders when it comes to temporary workers who are in this country? There are about 200,000 people in Australia on a 417 visa at the moment.
                                                                               </p>

I would like to know the minister's comments on how the government is going to follow up those findings, particularly those in relation to the 417 visa and the treatment of people here on this visa. The report says:

Minister, I want to know specifically whether you believe that this could be a case of visa fraud, where 14 per cent of people surveyed had to pay to secure regional work and six per cent had to pay their employee to sign-off on regional work. How does this interact with your department? Specifically, do we have a case of unscrupulous businesses requiring backpackers to pay for visas in terms of employment?
                                                                               </p>
                                                                               <p>
                                                                                The report highlights that visa holders from Asian countries are more likely to have a low awareness of workplace rights, are more likely to have money deducted from their pay without verbal or written consent, are more likely to have paid to obtain a second-year visa and are more likely to paid an agent to secure regional work to meet the eligibility requirements. Is the department going to provide information to such workers when they enter this country to let them know what their rights are? Such behaviours are grossly undermining this visa program if people have to pay for it in an unscrupulous way. This report is damning on the 88-day regional requirements that we have with this visa. The report's findings are damning and it paints the visa program as exploitative.

This is not the first report on the problems with this class of visa. There have been media reports and government reports—time and time again. The Fair Work Ombudsman in its report said it has a problem with this class of visa. When will the government clean up this visa and make sure that it is fixed?
                                                                               </p>

There was the tragic death of a backpacker last Monday. She was working on a workplace and she fell to her death. There was also a tragedy, 12 months earlier, when two other backpackers died at their workplace. Minister, there have already been, sadly, 132 fatalities in Australian workplaces. Just how many of those were visa holders? How many of them are visa holders working here in unsafe working conditions?
                                                                               </p>

In relation to 457 visas, it was a great script from which she read—it would have been great had she attributed it to the union boss that sent it to her; nonetheless, I am happy to do my best to respond to it. The 457 visas are quite an interesting study, because the point missed out in the script from the union, honourably read by the member for Bendigo, is that we have seen a dramatic reduction in the number of 457s under this government compared to Labor's period in government. It is a point that the Labor Party continues to brush over. The same arrangements that applied under the Labor Party apply under this government. If there is a problem with the system I would be happy to hear from the honourable member, but the reality is that the number of 457 visas has dropped dramatically. If the honourable member has questions of particular organisations in relation to their own private affairs, then I suggest she go back to the union and asks them to make those inquiries specifically with those organisations themselves. Similarly, in relation to 417 visas, working holiday visas, we are happy to act on information that honourable members can provide. There is a considerable amount of work being undertaken, including in relation to Taskforce Cadena. It is telling that the member for Bendigo, having delivered her script, done her work, done her bidding on behalf of the union bosses, now leaves the chamber.

He has an impressive interest in these areas, and it is the case, as we have documented before, that Labor opened 17 detention centres and this government is closing 17 detention centres. When we came into government Labor had had 2,000 children in detention, and we have got those children out of detention. We have been able to reduce the numbers of

It is very clear that, had Labor been successful at the last election, by now the boats would already have recommenced. There is no doubt about that, because they see Labor as weak and divided. They saw it during the election, and that is the reason the Leader of the Opposition sought not to speak about this at all. The reality is that we have not had new arrivals—it has been well over 800 days since we have had a successful people-smuggling venture—and that means we can keep people out of detention.
                                                                                </p>

We want to do that because people have been there too long, and it is the case that we have built up success in stopping people smugglers, in breaking their business model, in convincing would-be passengers that it is not worth paying their money, and because of that success we can enter into discussions about implementing this in a way that will not result in new arrivals. There is a lot of work that goes on behind the scenes but, to go to the member's question directly, we have been able to close a number of centres. I will make some other points shortly when I have a little more time.

Today, reports indicate that around 4,000 people have actually arrived in Australia. Canada, during the same time period, has resettled more than 30,000 Syrian refugees. Effectively, they have done that in the same period that we have resettled 4,000 refugees. Why is it taking the Australian government so long to meet their commitment, and what instructions have responsible ministers issued to the department which bear on the rate in which Syrian refugees are being processed to meet the target?

                                                                                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">

My understanding is that Canada has a scheme that will allow families in Canada to billet, to sponsor, refugee families, particularly families from Syria. Will our government consider the option of a similar program for families here in Australia? That would assist refugee families to more easily connect with the Australian community and would, I am sure, considerably reduce the cost of resettlement.

My understanding, from certain reports that I have read, is that there are lower rates of engagement for children who are studying, children who have since moved from studying within the detention centre to out in the community, and that they are not going to school for a number of reasons. Will your government commit to ending the long-term detention of the children on Nauru? We understand that the gates are open in the detention centre; however, these children are in a camp. They are not in homes—homes that your children, that my children, live in. They are not in an environment that is conducive to learning, to having a good quality of life; an environment that is conducive to good wellbeing and the kinds of opportunities that our children in Australia have—to go to university, to study further. I would like to ask what the plans are to get those children off Nauru.

The honourable member first raised the issue of the Syrian intake. As a general comment, let me say that, as the

That is understandable for a number of reasons. In Syria, for example, there are 6½ million people who are displaced, and the thought that a country like Australia—or even the United States, the United Kingdom or France—could take all of those people is just not realistic. So Australia has announced that we would take 12,000 people as part of an international effort, which put us—even in real terms, but certainly on a per capita basis—pretty close to the top of the tree. Each year, along with the
                                                                                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_and_Canada" rel="nofollow">

As we have seen in Belgium, as we have seen in Germany only in the last fortnight and as we have seen in France and elsewhere, people are passing themselves off as refugees when really that is not their background and it is not who they are. They are going to cause disruption and we are not going to allow that to happen in our program. I am not making any other comment about other countries' screening processes or the way in which they have conducted their intake, but it is the case that because we have been scrupulous about each of the applications that have been made we have discovered people of national security interest and risk. I think, had we not conducted the thoroughness of the process, we would have ended up with some of those people here.
                                                                                   </p>
                                                                                   <p>
                                                                                    The difficulty for all of us in the modern age, and this will be with us for our lifetimes, is that it just takes one person who has crossed our border with ill intent to go into a shopping centre or public place or—speaking of our children—playground or school or somewhere else. We have seen this overseas. The tragedy of such circumstances carried out would not only disrupt and destroy lives but also undermine the confidence the Australian people have in the intake of migrants into this country. What all of the longitudinal work shows is that the Australian public's confidence in an increased number of migrants coming into this country each year tracks very closely to the government of the day's competence in maintaining control of our borders. So we have been meticulous in the process and we have been able to bring people in.
                                                                                   </p>
                                                                                   <p>
                                                                                    I am advised that between 1 July 2015 and 7 October this year 14,047 visas have been granted. There are the 12,000 within the program, but within the 13,750 base program we already have 4,850 who come from Syria and Iraq—8,313 of those go towards the additional 12,000 places, and there are 884 under the 2016-17 humanitarian program. In this time, 10,244 people have arrived in Australia—5,235 as part of the additional 12,000 places and 1,816 arrivals in 2016-17. As at 7 October, a further 6,126 people have been interviewed and assessed as meeting the threshold requirements for a visa and are awaiting the outcomes of health, character and/or security checks. So the program is going well, but we are not going to rush it. We were encouraged by the Labor Party early on to push through this program and get these people here. We have been very clear—I was very clear to our people in the posts as I have been to the officers within the department here—that we are not going to compromise, (a) because we have the potential of bringing a security risk in and (b) because we would displace somebody who was actually a refugee and deserving of that place and would be left to languish.

It is the absolute priority of me, the Prime Minister and the government. We have no control over who Nauru issues visas to, as the honourable member would well know. I do not accept advice from the

I would mention that of course the arrangement was set up in 2012 under Prime Minister Gillard. We have tidied up that mess. We have stopped the 1,000 people a week arriving on boats and we have presided over a much more humane arrangement than Labor set up in the first place.

                                                                                    </p>

No matter how much media noise or activist politics from the Left surround our immigration regime, the fact remains that Australia's record is something we should all be very proud of.
                                                                                    </p>

                                                                                     Australians are an open, tolerant and generous people. We know our history, and that all of us, except our Indigenous peoples—our first peoples—are relatively newcomers. That includes me, with a mix of convict blood and free settler blood. As a nation and as a people, we naturally want to help those who are more vulnerable than ourselves. But we are also a pragmatic lot; I have never heard any Australian suggest that we should invite all 21 million refugees to settle here in Australia, nor that we should invite all 65 million displaced people here to take refuge. While we want to do all that we can, there will always be a limit to the resources that we can commit to and how many people can emigrate.
                                                                                    </p>

This is where Labor got it so drastically wrong in losing control of our borders. They oversaw a humanitarian disaster that resulted from Australia's greatest public policy bungle, certainly in my lifetime, with 50,000 people arriving on 800 boats and over 1,200—at least, those we know about—who lost their lives at sea.
                                                                                    </p>
                                                                                    <p>
                                                                                     Restoring integrity in the system has fallen to the coalition government, and it has done so. It has restored integrity with a range of measures, and none more important than stopping the boats. Restoring control to our borders requires (1) Labor's mess to be fixed and, (2) building new capacity so that our humanitarian intake may increase. These two challenges are not mutually exclusive. Rather, that they are sequential and interdependent—one is a prerequisite for the other, if you like.
                                                                                    </p>

And it is within this context that I wish to ask the minister the following question: Minister, how has stopping the boats helped restore integrity to our humanitarian intake?

He is doing a fine job as the new member for Fairfax, and he is making an enormous contribution to this debate because, like all Australians, he wants to make sure that we continue the generosity and that we continue the support to new families who come to our country, in many cases from very difficult circumstances. As a government, we do have a lot to be very proud of and as a country we have a lot to be very proud of.

And there are a lot of Australians who are very interested in this topic, from both sides of the debate. There are people who argue that we should take fewer and there are people who argue that we should take more. I would point all of those people to the information which details, country by country, the number of refugees taken in by Australia and those taken in by countries like France, Germany and many others
                                                                                     </p>

And, in addition to the 13,750 people we will take through the humanitarian and refugee program this year—and we have committed to the 12,000 Syrians, as the honourable member noted in his contribution—we will take 16,250 next year and 18,750 in 2018-19. Between 1 July 2015 and 7 October 2016, as I have pointed out before, 14,000 visas were granted to people displaced by conflict in Syria and Iraq alone.

Many communities have established themselves through the contribution of a number of families who, over one or two or more generations, have been able to contribute philanthropically to the betterment of their own communities. They are now in a position to sponsor people coming to our country through the refugee and humanitarian program. We are very proud to be able to work with those communities, and it is part of the success that we have had in settling almost 850,000 people as refugees since the end of the

One of the most shameful periods of our country's history was during Labor's period in government when we lost control of our borders and 1,200 people tragically drowned at sea. I am very proud that we have not had one person drown at sea since the commencement of Operation Sovereign Borders. We have been able to get children out of detention and we have been able to bring in a record number of people through the refugee and humanitarian programs—and long may that be the case.
                                                                                     </p>

It demonstrated the corruptness of Labor's process and it demonstrated why, in this debate even today, they do not have the credibility to talk about what they might do tomorrow. They are completely and utterly divided. The people smugglers have this worked out. We saw it reported in the run-up to the election that people smugglers were rubbing their hands together, anticipating the return of a Labor government and a weak Prime Minister in Shorten following weak prime ministers in Gillard and Rudd. That is the reality. Labor's inability to accept this underscores that they still have not learnt the lesson.
                                                                                     </p>

It is only the coalition government that can maintain the integrity we have within the humanitarian and refugee programs.

He had the ability to deal with very tough issues, particularly after the period when Labor first came into the opposition. He admitted the mistakes that Labor made. He admitted that the arrangements on Nauru were set up by Prime Minister Gillard. He admitted that there was an undoing of the successful Howard government arrangements and he at least had the ability, which is not demonstrated here at all and is reinforced again today by the shadow minister, that he could ask questions and conduct himself in a way that was not a threat to these prospective arrangements.
                                                                                                        </p>

Asking us today to publicly talk about where sensitive negotiations might be at at this point in time, asking us to disclose who it is we are talking to—having no regard to the interests of whoever that particular partner might be—demonstrates that he does not have the ability to carry out this portfolio in government. It has been evidenced on a day-by-day basis but reinforced in this chamber today.
                                                                                                        </p>

It is unbelievable that he would seek to come here to lecture us about people that he put on Nauru that we have sought to get out to third countries or to return to their countries of origin. In actual fact, do you know the reason that Labor have no credibility on this issue? It is because half of their back bench still advocates that they should still come to Australia. Half of Labor's backbench demonstrate that this Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten, has no ability to show the leadership required to send a purposeful and definite and clear message to people smugglers that if there was a Labor government in this country that somehow they would not allow the boats to restart. Because if you allow a crushing of one of the successful legs of Operation Sovereign Borders—that is, the operation of regional processing centres—and if you allow people smugglers, as Labor would, to say to people, 'We have again cracked the code to get people to Australia,' you would end up with deaths at sea again. You would end up with 2,000 kids in jail and those opposite should be ashamed of their track record.

                                                                                                          </p>

                                                                                                           Of course, the minister at the table is aware of the circumstances around the resignation of Vice President Lawler of the Fair Work Commission. There was of course an independent assessment of his conduct by a former Federal Court judge, appointed by the Minister for Employment, to look into whether in fact he had been in breach of his duties as vice president over the most recent years.
                                                                                                          </p>
                                                                                                          <p>
                                                                                                           I will just remind the House that of course Vice President Lawler was appointed to the Fair Work Commission at the time when the former Prime Minister, the member for Warringah, was the Minister for Employment in the Howard government. So Mr Lawler was a longstanding commissioner of the Fair Work Commission and there were some questions around his performance and him discharging his responsibilities as a vice president of the Fair Work Commission.
                                                                                                          </p>
                                                                                                          <p>
                                                                                                           We are seeking to have the information about his entitlements disclosed publicly. We do know, of course, that the former Federal Court judge found that he was in breach of his duties as a vice president in his report, commissioned by the Minister for Employment. Then the vice president subsequently made a decision to resign, so no action had to be taken either by the parliament or by some other means.
                                                                                                          </p>
                                                                                                          <p>
                                                                                                           However, on 16 March, on behalf of the federal opposition I sought to have information about the entitlements that Mr Lawler will be afforded, given his resignation. I asked then that the minister immediately disclose such matters in the public interest. We said at the time that the public has a right to know the difference in the entitlements Mr Lawler will receive as a result of his resignation, rather than being dismissed.
                                                                                                          </p>
                                                                                                          <p>
                                                                                                           I sought at the time, and it is enclosed within the letter, that the Minister for Employment responded to the matters raised in the report that relate to the application for leave and termination proceedings in order to prevent a matter of this nature rising again. We have not really been provided with such information and we thought it was an opportunity today for the government to provide that information. We think it is in the public interest that a most senior officer of the Fair Work Commission—in fact, arguably, the second-most senior officer of the Fair Work Commission—who was found to be in breach or in dereliction of his obligations as an officer who has subsequently resigned, be required to publicly disclose his entitlements upon that resignation.
                                                                                                          </p>
                                                                                                          <p>
                                                                                                           We believe that the minister would be aware of the details of such entitlements afforded to Mr Lawler and yet, despite the letter of 16 March from me to the minister, we have not been in receipt of any information and would ask the minister at the table, the minister acting on behalf of the Minister for Employment, to provide answers to this question—namely, what are the details of the entitlements afforded to Mr Lawler upon his resignation?

Just turning to a more substantial matter in so far as public policy is concerned: today the House passed the registered organisation legislation, or proposed legislation, and the opposition moved some significant amendments to that bill. In December last year, the Labor leader and I announced a suite of reforms in relation to registered organisations, and those announcements informed the amendments that we foreshadowed today.
                                                                                                            </p>

So, Mr Deputy Speaker Buchholz, I just want to touch on them, if I could go through the more important amendments proposed. Firstly, the federal opposition believe that we can support a new way of regulating registered organisations in so far as serious breaches are concerned. We have suggested that, rather than establish a separate commission to regulate registered organisations, we believe that ASIC, a mature and significant regulator, would be better charged with the responsibility to regulate the conduct of officers of registered organisations. For that reason, we propose that rather than the so-called
                                                                                                             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROC" rel="nofollow">
                                                                                                              ROC
                                                                                                             </a>
                                                                                                             being established, we would rather see ASIC be the regulator. We believe it is likely a mature regulator that is highly respected in the community that currently regulates and examines whether in fact there is misconduct by companies is better placed to also regulate employer bodies and unions.
                                                                                                            </p>
                                                                                                            <p>
                                                                                                             For many years now, the government have been saying—rhetorically, at least—that they want the same set of laws and forms of regulations that apply to companies to apply to registered organisations. In fact, I have heard many government members rhetorically argue that that should be the case. How could there be a better way of ensuring equality before the law, if you like, than having the same regulator regulate registered organisations that regulates companies? We also believe that it is far less likely that any government—this one or any future government—would interfere with the running of ASIC in the way in which they may interfere with this smaller body that is being proposed by the government.
                                                                                                            </p>
                                                                                                            <p>
                                                                                                             So we would like to hear from the government as to whether they are seriously entertaining that amendment and whether, in fact, they can see the merits in allowing that an existing regulator that has been around for a very long time and that has a corporate memory in dealing with such matters could be the better regulator, as opposed to setting up an entirely new bureaucracy to deal with the regulation of registered organisations. That is one point.
                                                                                                            </p>

We ask whether the government would consider the whistleblower protections that we have proposed? We believe that there should be greater levels of support for whistleblowers in registered organisations. If we are going to reduce the likelihood of corruption occurring, we should enshrine the principle of protection and it should be afforded to whistleblowers. We ask the government to seriously entertain that proposition. We would like at least a preliminary response by the minister, if at all possible.
                                                                                                            </p>
                                                                                                            <p>

                                                                                                              It is good to see that the opposition is constructively engaging on the registered organisations commission bill and proposing amendments in the Senate. Obviously, today the House passed the registered organisations commission bills, and we did so with a debate management motion. It did not afford the opposition—particularly new members of the opposition, including the member for Bruce—the opportunity to speak on this bill. But, as I pointed out to the House today, this was the fourth time that the House had considered the registered organisations commission bill. It has been through an exhaustive committee process in both the Senate and in the House of Representatives. The bill that was presented and has now been passed by the House today is in exactly the same form as it was on the other three times it was passed by the House of Representatives. So there is nothing new under the sun in relation to this particular bill.
                                                                                                             </p>

Of course, the nature of the 45th Parliament is that the coalition has a majority in the House of Representatives—which has been proven time and time again this week—but not in the Senate. Therefore—

But I am pretty confident that we might have learnt that lesson, shadow minister. In the Senate, negotiation is the name of the game, so I am glad that the opposition is prepared to put forward constructive suggestions.

The government did not propose these measures because there was not a problem to be solved—there was a problem. The problem was dishonest union leaders ripping off their members—in the Health Services Union's case amongst the poorest workers in the work force such as cleaners in aged care homes and hospitals all around Australia. None of them could be accused of earning expansive incomes, and they were ripped off by Craig Thomson in a heinous way, and also by Mr Williamson before him. The government introduced the registered organisations commissions bill and we think it is the best mechanism to solve the issues. I doubt very much that the Labor Party's amendments will make it a better bill but I am sure that Senator Cash, when she deals with these matters, will deal with them in an even-handed way and give the Labor Party their fair due.
                                                                                                             </p>

We all know what happened last time. When the Hawke government introduced the disclosure thresholds, businesses that had previously given to the coalition were visited by union bosses all around Australia and told, 'You don't have to give us the same as you give the coalition, we know you support the coalition, but you must at least give us half.' Businesses that had never dreamt of giving money to the Labor Party to campaign against the coalition were forced, essentially by extortion, into funding a political party that they had had absolutely no intention of ever supporting. As a consequence, that has skewed the system. We do not get the same out of the unions, obviously, and as a consequence we will not be considering the Labor Party 's amendments to the disclosure requirements.

The government commissioned a royal commission, one of the recommendations of which was to create a threshold of $1,000 for candidates in elections of registered organisations. Whilst the government has been praising the work of its former royal commissioner and has continually referred to the royal commission's work in dealing with corruption and other potential offences within registered organisations, it would appear the government wants to apply one set of laws for candidates in some elections and another set of laws for candidates in federal elections.
                                                                                                              </p>

It would appear inconsistent at best, if not hypocritical, to argue that we want to tighten threshold disclosures for those candidates under this bill for registered organisations and yet not apply such a principle to candidates. Whilst I have heard the comments of the minister, we would implore him and his government to reconsider that position. We know that the crossbench understands the merits behind the proposition and I think the government might find that many crossbench senators would support the view that if we are to have a law about threshold disclosure for registered organisations it should also apply to candidates in federal elections.

Let's not pretend that somehow there should be a different standard—a lower standard—for candidates who want to be in this place, if they are successful at an election, than for those who are seeking to be officers of registered organisations and go through an election to do so. We think that is highly inconsistent and unfair and, I would argue, hypocritical in relation to the government's current position.
                                                                                                              </p>

In fact, I would contend that we have announced policies that, if you look at the amendments in combination, would strengthen the bill. I think there is an opportunity here for the government and for the opposition to come together on a set of changes to the current bill which will match the rhetoric of the government. It would mean that companies and registered organisations would be regulated by the same regulator. It would mean that whistleblowers would be protected, that auditors would have to comply with a higher standard and that transparency in elections would be improved. How could that possibly be a worse situation?

I certainly believe that the crossbench senators like what they hear in relation to the opposition's recommendations. I will not give up. I think the minister at the table, the Minister for Defence Industry, the most senior Defence minister in the government, acting on behalf of the Minister for Employment, should reconsider his earlier answer in relation to that. We think it is important that we get these regulations right. We will never be apologists for corrupt unions officials. We are ashamed when we see a corrupt union official. We should be ashamed when we seek corrupt corporate people too. That is why there has been hypocrisy in relation to the banks and the unions—they are not looking at misconduct in the banks in the same way they are looking at any misconduct in unions.

I am glad I have had some opportunity to question the minister in relation to them, given that we were gagged in the parliament earlier today. I can assure the minister and this place that we will continue to pursue them with the crossbenchers.

I am happy to make the point that I think the shadow minister's five-minute contribution did not ask me any new question. I feel like I have answered the question in my previous contribution, and I really want to hear the contributions of the members for Chifley and Moreton, who I know are very keen to ask me questions.

I wanted to draw his attention to the performance of the program which, according to the government's own figures tabled in response to questions on notice, shows that roughly 90 per cent of the young participants in that program fail to be in full-time employment three months after exiting the program. I also refer the minister to the statement today by Renee Leon, the secretary of the department, who told estimates 'the purpose of Work for the Dole is not necessarily to lead directly to a full-time job'.
                                                                                                                </p>

Can the minister outline what plans the government has to ensure that Work for the Dole will not just get young people ready for work but actually get them work? Or does the minister acknowledge the Turnbull government has given up on the ability of the Work for the Dole program to help young Australians get jobs?
                                                                                                                </p>

I understand that the department has undertaken an internal review of the matter as it relates to the operation of the deed with respect to the maintenance of appropriate workplace health and safety standards for both the providers and the hosts. I note that the government has acknowledged today that this internal review has been completed and that the minister has seen the report.
                                                                                                                </p>
                                                                                                                <p>
                                                                                                                 Also, if I may through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and through the minister, I thank Minister Cash for two in-depth briefings—verbal briefings—that I received into that internal review and its findings. I have previously asked for copies of that report, which I am waiting to receive. I ask the minister when that report will be made public? Does he accept that the release of the report will help build confidence that the Work for the Dole program is maintaining appropriate workplace health and safety standards? And can the minister advise why an internal departmental review that concentrates on the application of the deed, without in-depth reference to the particulars of the incident and the fatality itself cannot be released ahead of the issue of the Queensland workplace health and safety regulator releasing its report?

It was a tragic accident, taking the life of a young jobseeker, Mr Joshua Park-Fing, who was a participant. Any workplace accident is a tragedy. Unfortunately, they usually occur entirely through accident and through no fault of any particular person. I think in the case of this accident, it was a situation that could easily have been avoided. But it was not avoided on this occasion and this man's life has been taken, which is a great tragedy for him and for his family and friends.

WorkSafe Queensland is still currently conducting its investigation into the accident, and the

Of its own, the Department of Employment has investigated the matters that fall within its responsibilities as the program owner, including compliance with the deed requirements by the jobactive provider.
                                                                                                                 </p>

Any of the findings from the Department of Employment's review and the outcomes of the formal investigation will be considered to determine future policy, contractual requirements and operational processes that it has been advised might need to be revised.
                                                                                                                 </p>

On this occasion the Work for the Dole activity at the Toowoomba Showground was suspended immediately. The activity was never reactivated and has now ceased. The Department of Employment has advised me that the participants who were present or in the vicinity of the incident were offered counselling.

You were conferring with your colleagues—or your advisers, I should say—and you may have missed one element of my question. It was that my understanding is that the internal review—without giving anything away of the internal review, and respecting the confidentiality of the briefings I have received—focused very much on the particulars of the application of the deed. It does not necessarily, as I am led to believe through the verbal briefings—because I have not been afforded the benefit of the written brief or the report—refer to the particulars of the incident per se, which as you have rightly advised the House is being managed by the Queensland regulator. I am just trying to appreciate why a report into the deed itself and the application of the arrangements relating to the provider and the host cannot be made public. I would certainly welcome any advice you can provide on that.

The Minister for Employment will make a decision about whether that will be made public at the appropriate time. I am confident that she will offer the member for Chifley a briefing on that matter at the appropriate time, but I understand it has only just been received by the Minister for Employment, so she probably has not formed a view about that at this stage.

They may well release their findings—in fact, they usually do in these sorts of situations where there has been a workplace accident. They will do that, I assume, when they finish their investigation and make that decision.

I am sure that the Minister for Employment will correspond separately with the member for Chifley on that matter as is appropriate. I do not have the answer to that in my briefings, so I will let her deal directly with you.

Firstly, can I ask: has the department undertaken any assessment of the impact of automation and technology on the Australian workforce and the labour market in coming years? How many jobs does the department believe will be made obsolete by automation in the next 15 years? Also, what advice has the department provided the Turnbull government about how to manage the impact of automation and technological change on Australian jobs? What funding in the department is dedicated to finding out what kinds of jobs will disappear due to automation, what jobs may replace them and what can be done to assist people in transition?

I am also well aware that he is a person very much across this issue, given previous portfolio areas he has occupied. I would certainly welcome any input he may have on those matters.

I would direct the member for Chifley to the voluminous number of reports that exist from the excellent think tanks in Australia that we have around the job impacts of automation and high-tech, advanced manufacturing versus old-fashioned manufacturing.
                                                                                                                         </p>

                                                                                                                          I have left the portfolio, but I can tell him that the first two quarters of this year were the two best quarters for manufacturing since December 2004. That was in terms of new jobs, new businesses, export opportunities and investment. In those areas, in 2016 manufacturing had the two best quarters that it has had since 2004. So the economy is transitioning and there is no doubt that, for many Australian workers and their families, automation and manufacturing technology represents a threat to their livelihoods. The responsibility of this government—and it would be his responsibility and his government's responsibility if they had won the election—is to move our economy in a direction that provides new work opportunities for those workers in industries that are shrinking—in terms of old-fashioned manufacturing industries—whether it is Ford, Toyota, Holden or others. For that reason, the creation of the defence industry part of the Defence portfolio is a very genuine attempt by the Turnbull-Joyce government—as I understand we call it these days—to address some of those concerns. We have $195 billion of Defence spending heft in Australia in the next 10 years to create a domestic defence industry that employs tens of thousands of Australians in high-tech, advanced manufacturing for both our own needs and also for export. And that is particularly my task as the Minister for Defence Industry. Any facts or evidence that we can provide the member for Chifley to respond to his specific questions, I have no doubt that the advisers from the Minister for Employment's office has made a note and we will get them to him.

And, obviously, coming from Adelaide, that is very much the case in northern Adelaide and, to a lesser extent, southern Adelaide. But, of course, in areas of
                                                                                                                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">

As a consequence, we need to use the resources that are at our disposal to get the Australian defence industry to a capability level where we can confidently spend as much of that Defence dollar here in Australia and drive the defence industry as a very significant pillar of our economy. I think as that happens—and it is already happening as that industry continues to grow and kick more goals, if you like—those people who are concerned about where their jobs will be in the future, for themselves and for their children, will see that the opportunities are there in high-tech, advanced manufacturing. One of the tremendous things about the defence industry is that it is very valuable; it requires high skills; and we have very skilled workforce in this country. We can compete because, even though the labour costs are high, it is in very high-tech, advanced manufacturing and it is not making T-shirts in other parts of the world where labour costs mean Australian cannot compete. It is in making products—whether they are submarines, future frigates, offshore patrol vessels, pacific patrol vessels, parts for the

It is good to know. As I indicated in my question, it would be great if some of those answers could be taken on notice. I would like to move on to another area within the portfolio area: in particular, a program that was announced during the federal budget this year relating to the establishment of the PaTH internship program, which the opposition has indicated some concerns with. I will keep my question as short as I possibly can, given the time constraints we have.
                                                                                                                          </p>

There is no outline of guarantees to ensure interns will not displace jobs; there is no outline of guarantees to ensure interns will not be used to cut wages; there is no outline of guarantees to ensure that PaTH will not experience the same outcomes as Work for the Dole that I referred to earlier, and whether or not the bulk of interns will fail to get full-time work. I would like to get an indication from the minister as to whether or not he is able to provide the chamber with some assurances in relation to those matters I have raised.

                                                                                                                           of Ireland found that only 27 per cent of interns were placed in full-time jobs after their internships. I would be interested to know if the Australian scheme will have a higher hiring rate, and what the government's hiring target is for this new program. Can the minister also remind the House of the total amount of public funds dedicated to PaTH over the forward estimates? And has the minister seen or been made aware of a line of questioning that was enthusiastically pursued by Senator James Paterson in estimates today? He was very interested to know whether a potential advantage for this new program is that if an intern does not work out, a business would not be subject to any unfair dismissal claims or costs in that respect. He seemed to indicate that this would be an advantage of the program, that it would sidestep unfair dismissal laws.
                                                                                                                          </p>

                                                                                                                           Can the minister advise whether or not he shares that same enthusiasm, and if this is actually a program to get people to work or to get people out of work? It seems to be at odds. So I would be interested to get some more details on this, given that the opposition has had some concerns with program designs to date.

The concept of getting young people into jobs through pathways that they might not previously have considered is a very sensible program, a very sensible policy. It was wildly popular in the election, as Deputy Speaker Buchholz will remember—certainly in my electorate and, I assume, in his as well.

This will give the young jobseekers a chance to show what they can do in the real workplace. Both businesses and eligible young jobseekers will be able to choose whether to participate in an internship and, to encourage eligible young jobseekers to undertake such an internship, participants will receive a fortnightly incentive payment from the

The fortnightly incentive payment will be paid in addition to the young jobseeker's social security payments and will not be counted as remuneration for work. So we are making every effort to ensure that young jobseekers will want to take part in these internships, because they will not lose any money—in fact, they will gain money.

An equivalent amendment to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 is also necessary to ensure that the incentive payments are not counted as income for veterans' entitlements purposes. This is a program being administered by the Minister for Employment, and I have absolutely no doubt that it will be a great success that will lead to real jobs.

But as this is the first that I have heard of it, I would be unwise to comment on it.

Let me start by saying that, when it comes to the area of defence industry and indeed defence, what has characterised this government since it came to government in 2013 has been total confusion. Let us start with the number of ministers: we are now onto the third Defence minister. We had Minister Johnson, Minister Andrews and now Minister Payne—although, we will get to this a bit later, it does seem as though we have now got two ministers for Defence; although exactly what the order of seniority in respect of those two appears to be unclear, however, with the Minister for Defence Industry here, he may be able to answer that question.
                                                                                                                             </p>
                                                                                                                             <p>
                                                                                                                              We have had a number of assistant ministers—Assistant Minister McCormack, Assistant Minister Chester and Assistant Minister Robert—go through the portfolio. We now have Minister Tehan operating in the space. This has been a merry-go-round in terms of who has been representing the government in this space.
                                                                                                                             </p>
                                                                                                                             <p>
                                                                                                                              The confusion goes beyond that. What characterised again in respect of the question of procurement is a complete failure of a strategy around exactly where this government wanted to take procurement. If you look at the question of submarines—and there are a number of questions that need to be answered here by the government—we had Minister Johnston referring to Australian shipbuilders as unable to build a canoe. We had, in the course of the leadership contest with the former Prime Minister Abbott, the single largest procurement in Australian history being tossed around the government party room as a matter of collecting votes to save Mr Abbott. Out of that came the competitive evaluation process, which was a process unknown to Defence at that point in time and still cannot really be explained as to what it was about.
                                                                                                                             </p>

Then we ended up where we are now with the design being done by

I think the other point to make is that, in the context of a significant increase in procurement, we have been over the last few years something in the order of 10 per cent of

That speaks to the significant expenditure which is occurring in this area and yet, despite that, there has been precious little effort on the part of this government to leverage that expenditure to build a domestic defence industry. That would appear to be the reason why the minister was called in to save the day, and we now have two Defence ministers—a Minister for Defence and a Minister for Defence Industry.

I guess the first question that I ask the minister is: has a preferred design partner been chosen for both of the those projects? And, if it has not, when is it intended to be so and can there be certainty that the dates in respect of cutting steel will be met?

That is in the midst of its operations right now—it is being done right now. There are three bidders for both the

The decision about that will be made at the appropriate time. One of the critical responsibilities that I have as Minister for Defence Industry is to keep the schedule on track. As a consequence, much of my effort on a daily basis goes into ensuring that the decisions are being made in a timely way by the Minister for Defence Industry—being me, obviously. It's not good to talk about oneself in the third person; it sounds slightly crazy!

Those decisions are being made, and I am surprised that the member for Corio would venture into this particular part of public policy.

That was the Rip van Winkle period of defence policy in Australia's history, and the only saving grace for the member for Corio is that he was not given responsibility for that area of government policy when he was on the front bench in the Gillard government. It is one of the great failures of those six years. I am glad that the member for Menzies is here in the Federation Chamber—although he may not be—because, when he and I taking over in 2013 as part of a new government, he as the Minister for Defence had to try and get these decisions back on track after six years of absolute inertia in the period of the Gillard and Rudd governments.

In the six years of the Rudd and Gillard governments they made not one decision to build a naval vessel here in Australia—zero in six years. In the three years that we have been in government we have decided to build 54 vessels over the coming decades: 12 submarines, nine future frigates 12 offshore patrol vessels and 21 Pacific patrol vessels—54 vessels. We are investing $195 billion over the next 10 years in building defence capability—not all, of course in naval shipbuilding. About $90 billion of it is in naval shipbuilding. This entirely transforms our defence capability, and it is a decision that this government has made. The previous government created the valley of death, which is leading to real people, not numbers on papers, losing their jobs at Osborne, at Williamstown, at Henderson and, for that matter, at Newcastle—across the naval shipbuilding industry—because the government that the member for Corio was a part of did not have the gumption, the capacity or the desire to make the decisions necessary in these projects, which are long-lead-time projects, to keep the workforce intact.

The member at the table, the member for Menzies, initiated the Defence white paper process. That was handed down in February this year. With it was the integrated investment program and the defence industry policy statement. These three documents are the basis for the government's plans for building defence capability, the strategy behind it and the purpose of it over the next several decades. One day, potentially, the opposition may well be in government, and I hope that they will recognise that this foundation the current government has put in place is worthy of being supported into the future.

The reality is that what we have seen since this government came to power is a wholesale loss of jobs in the Australian shipbuilding industry. The shipbuilding yards in Williamstown and the Forgacs shipbuilding yards are now bereft of work. As the minister absolutely correctly said, 1,500 real people, with real families, are no longer working in this industry. A key part of this was the consistent approach by this government that there is not the capability in this country to perform indigenous defence work, which is absolutely incorrect. That is what has led to a situation where supply ships are now being built in Spain that could have been built here, and in fact it is quite clear that there would be the capacity for that to occur.
                                                                                                                               </p>

This is the single biggest procurement in Australian defence history. It is a critically important procurement for Australia's future capability and it is one that has been treated with scant regard by this government since they came to power. The idea that a procurement of $50 billion up front and many tens of billions more in maintenance through the life of the project gets tossed around a party room over a leadership contest is absolutely astonishing. It is very much to this government's shame that they treated a procurement of that significance, both in terms of the amount of money which goes into it but also in terms of our nation's defence, with such disrespect by not considering it strictly in terms of what was the best public policy in the national interest but making it a matter of internal politics within the government party room.

That of course is not a contract to build the submarines as such—it is a contract to provide a design for the future submarine. We have very long time lines in place in relation to the procurement of the submarines—we will not be seeing steel being cut until 2021, and we will not see the first submarine in the water engaging in activity until 2032. The implication of that is the requirement for a significant upgrade of the

There are a whole lot of issues that need to be addressed and risk that needs to be managed between now and then. Given that we are talking about the continued operation of the Collins class through until that time, inevitably there will be significant expense at the back end of that period in maintaining the Collins class.

Can the minister absolutely guarantee that all the future submarines will be built in Australia—not just the first off the line, but that none of them will be built in France? Will the timelines, as lengthy as they are, be able to be maintained on the basis of all of these submarines being built in Australia? The minister has said that 90 per cent of the submarines will have Australian content in them. That appears to be a figure which has not been backed up by either the Minister for Defence or the secretary of Defence in Senate estimates, so how can the minister assure us that 90 per cent of this build will be done in Australia?

When his party was in government, they had so little confidence in the Australian industry they made not one decision to build anything here in Australia—not one decision to build a navy ship here in Australia. So if any political party has no confidence in Australian defence industry, it is obviously the Labor Party. If the Labor Party believed that the Australian industry had the capability to deliver, they would have made those decisions.
                                                                                                                                </p>

This is the government that in three years has taken Australian defence industry from the very sad state it was under the Labor Party into having an incredibly bright future, where we are putting behind that the push of $195 billion of spending to build defence industry capability over the next 10 years.

It has done vandalism to the Australian shipbuilding industry. If they seriously believed that they had any credibility on submarine building, why didn't they make a decision in that six-year period of government under Rudd and Gillard to sustain a shipbuilding industry—a submarine building industry— into the future? They totally neglected to do so.

I am sure the Labor Party supports it—a $50 billion program on just the building part of the program will make a tremendous difference to the Australian economy.

He made that statement on the radio, and I think you will find, if you return to any of my comments that I have made on this subject, that every time I have referenced that figure I have said the DCNS themselves say 90 per cent will be done in Australia. Therefore it is not my figure; it is DCNS's figure and Sean Costello's figure.

I thought you were going to ask me about the life cycle of the Collins class submarine and an assurance that there is no capability gap. You did not ask me that, but I will answer it anyway. It would have been an interesting question for you to have asked. Of course, the government is taking the measures necessary to ensure that there is no capability gap between the Collins class submarine and the Australianised Shortfin Barracuda and we will be monitoring all the time to ensure that the schedule remains on track for DCNS.

We announced that about two or three weeks ago. We are getting on with the job. If it ever appears at any point that that will not be the case, the government will take whatever measures are necessary to ensure that there is no capability gap.

The competitive evaluation process is not something that is understood by Defence and the military, because it was a new process imagined out of, essentially, a leadership dispute within the government party room in order to deal with certain circumstances. The reality is that the procurement process for the submarines has left a lot to be desired, and a feature of this government's procurement has been delay. We have consistently seen key procurement decisions delayed under this government. The integrated investment plan, which the minister speaks of, is far less detailed than the Defence Capability Plan, which was in place under Labor. Under this government, the time lines in the

The minister has indicated that 90 per cent is not his figure. I am keen to understand exactly what his figure is, then, in relation to the expected percentage of Australian build in the submarines. This is a critical matter for building Australian capability and, indeed, building an Australian defence industry. The supply chains that are put in place for the submarines will provide significant opportunity in Australia, or at least they have the potential to do that if there is a significant component of Australian build within the submarines. Obviously that is good in terms of jobs; it is also important in the strategic sense of building sovereign capacity. I am keen to understand that, and it is critical that the first submarines are built in Australia. I hear the minister's answer to the question—

Can the minister advise if there are any plans to close down any more Veterans' Access Network offices? Does the minister have any more plans to move veterans' services to DHS? More specifically, can the minister provide further reassurance to the veterans and families of Newcastle, in my electorate, that their office will not close down? Can the minister provide a detailed breakdown of the cost per annum of each open, standalone Veterans' Access Network office?

For a number of months now there have been rumours that the VAN office is about to close when the lease terminates next year, in 2017. There are very strong views around the co-location of these offices in Centrelink. Indeed, veterans who have come to see me, particularly those from the Vietnam veterans community, have some grave concerns. There is a co-located Vietnam veterans counselling service with the VAN office in Newcastle and there are a number of shared facilities, including the boardroom and kitchen facilities. There are grave concerns about what will happen to those veterans who rely on the counselling services there and to groups, like the Men's Health Peer Education, which are running important mental health and counselling services from those offices.

It is a very active community.

I seek your assurance on all of those questions I have just asked, Minister.

A recurring theme of representations from these veterans includes the level of access and funding for mental health care. I have heard multiple cases where a veteran has attempted to receive white card status for mental health treatment only to be denied or delayed because a link was required between their condition and their service.

Since coming into the portfolio in February I have done wide-ranging consultations. I have visited over 30 ex-service organisations around the country in every state and territory—as I have in your electorate, Deputy Speaker Wicks—to get feedback from our veterans on the ground on what matters are really important to them and what they are looking for when it comes to the government. The feedback was very clear. To start with, they wanted to make sure that they would have a standalone

There were a lot of anecdotes about how a system which was still, in part, paper based needed to be updated for us to have a department which could service the veterans clientele in a proper way. On this point, I think the feedback was extremely valid—and this goes back, I think, over the last decade, goes back over successive governments—because we have failed to give the Department of Veterans' Affairs the

One of the incredibly important things which we did in this year's budget was allocate money so that, for the first time, we could begin an upgrade of the IT system in the Department of Veterans' Affairs. This will mean that we can make the most significant changes to the way the department operates and make sure that everything they are doing is absolutely centred on the veteran.

What we did—and I know this is something which the member for Canning has been extremely pleased about—is we have said that from now on, if you have

It is non-liability health care. We introduced this in the budget, and it came in on 1 July. That has made a big impact, and I would call on all members to make sure they are going out and promoting that within the veterans community. It means that you do not have to prove anything to get help—help is there. If you have served one full day in the armed services, then you are eligible for this. It, in part, fits with all the advice we get in this area which is that the earlier the intervention, the better the outcomes and results.

There are no plans to close the VAN office in Newcastle. We are obviously looking at ways to make sure we are maximising the use of those VANs, and this is something that we will continue to be examining.

I am wondering whether we can find $30,000 per annum to make sure that veterans in the Northern Territory are represented the same as anyone else in this country. If you refer to the organisational chart of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, which has a blank in the Northern Territory, it is because we have not got a deputy commissioner for veterans' affairs. I think it would help veterans in the

I have made various communications with your office and just ask that, on behalf of veterans of the Northern Territory, we get some answers as to when that reappointment will occur.

Since his appointment as Attorney-General in 2013, Senator Brandis has brought nothing but trouble for this government, for the legal assistance sector and indeed for the rule of law in this country.

Mr Turnbull knocked him off as arts minister but, mystifyingly, he kept him on as Attorney-General, a decision which I am sure that he is ruing now.

His disgraceful treatment of the Solicitor-General, the second law officer of this country, has shocked not just the legal community but also many Australians who did not even know that the position existed before last Friday's Senate hearing, but they do now.

On 4 May 2016, Senator Brandis tabled a new legal services direction in the Senate which severely limits the ability of the Solicitor-General to do his job. Instead of quickly responding to requests for advice from a government department, a government minister or even the Prime Minister, the Solicitor-General must now submit a request for written consent from Senator Brandis. Let me step this out: the Solicitor-General receives a request for urgent advice from the immigration department, for instance, at 11.30 pm at night. He cannot respond until he can find the Attorney-General, who might be anywhere or out of the country, and he has to wait to receive written confirmation, a written consent, with Senator Brandis' signature.

He said that the concern over this conflict introduced by Senator Brandis has kept him awake at night since 5 May.

They were certainly the rudest men in the room on Friday. But we should not be surprised after their disgraceful treatment of another fine statutory officer, Professor Gillian Triggs, in previous estimates hearings and, I have to say, in the current estimates hearing. This is not, as the Prime Minister likes to describe it, just a fight between two lawyers, to be duked at in the bar common room—whatever the Prime Minister intends to mean by that phrase. This actually matters.

The Prime Minister repeated that mistruth, and let us not underrate the significance of this: Senator Brandis and the Prime Minister have misrepresented the advice that they received on the constitutionality of a bill that is now likely to be subject to a High Court challenge. Because of the Attorney-General's arrogance, the parliament may have passed a bill that will be struck down, and that, if it occurs, is no-one's fault other than Senator Brandis's.

This is a bill unprecedented in its nature in Australia, which would allow the Attorney-General to keep people in prison beyond the term of their sentence. It is absolutely right that Labor does due diligence on this bill. I would like to ask the Minister for Justice on behalf of the Attorney-General what the answer is to the question I asked in a letter that I have just sent to the Attorney-General, at the end of a correspondence starting on Sunday. The question is: has the Solicitor-General advised on the final version of the Criminal Code Amendment (High Risk Terrorist Offenders) Bill 2016? If not, why not? And how many of the current bills before the parliament has the Solicitor-General been given the opportunity to advise on in their final versions?

If he is saying that he has just sent it today then I do not know whether there has been a response or not, but I can give him some general points about the issue that he is raising. We have heard a lot about his concerns regarding the Solicitor-General, and the facts about what he is alleging are very well known. As we know, the Attorney-General issued a direction that established a procedure that gives effect to paragraph 12(b) of the Law Officers Act 1964, which provides that a function of the Solicitor-General is:
                                                                                                                                           </p>

Very importantly, these arrangements do not limit the independence of the Solicitor-General, as the member for Isaacs appears to be alleging.
                                                                                                                                           </p>

A consultation occurred in the Attorney-General's office on 30 November 2015, at which the Attorney-General invited the Solicitor-General to provide further feedback in writing about the issue. The 30 November meeting was requested by the Solicitor-General to discuss the process for seeking and acting on Solicitor-General advice in significant matters. The Attorney-General considered the Solicitor-General's views before finalising the amendments to the direction and the guidance note that accompanies that direction. I think it is very important to note that, since that direction was made, the Attorney-General has considered 10 requests for the Solicitor-General to provide an opinion pursuant to paragraph 12(b) of the Law Officers Act, and all 10 requests have been approved. He has also made one direct referral to the Solicitor-General himself.
                                                                                                                                           </p>

This is a vitally important initiative of the government to secure community safety. He is right to say that this is quite an extraordinary power that we are requesting the parliament to approve, but of course we are living in an extraordinary time where we do need to give our agencies the powers that they need to do the job that we require of them. This bill provides for the continuing detention of high-risk terrorist offenders. Our decision to introduce a regime of post-detention for serious terrorist offenders is based on the fact that if they were to continue to present an unacceptable risk to community safety then we would continue to detain them. We have had a conversation with all of the states and territories. Every single jurisdiction in Australia endorses the Commonwealth's approach to this.

The Solicitor-General has provided advice on the draft bill. Amendments were made to the draft bill that take into account the views of the Solicitor-General, as well as feedback that we received from our partners in the states and territories. Consistent with the longstanding practice of this government and previous governments, including a government of which the member for Isaacs was a member, we are not going to comment on the content and nature of the government's legal advice.

I urge him to continue in this parliament the very constructive approach that was taken in the last parliament. On questions of national security, between 2013 and 2016 we were able to work constructively with the opposition to ensure that we updated the powers that were available to our agencies. The terror threat that we are facing now is vastly different than that we faced previously and we do need to police it in a different way. That requires resourcing for our agencies. We have been providing that. It also requires powers to our agencies. We need to make sure that they can intervene early. If somebody continues to pose a risk to the Australian community, I think the expectation is that we will continue to detain them.

I accept those compliments on behalf of all 11 members of the intelligence committee, a committee which I was very proud to be a member of in the last parliament. The minister is quite right to point out that there was a very cooperative approach brought by all 11 members of the committee to the work of that committee, which resulted in five reports on counterterrorism bills and some 100 recommendations, all of which, demonstrating the work of the committee, were accepted by the government.
                                                                                                                                            </p>

                                                                                                                                             Perhaps while we are here the minister could answer the questions I have just asked. I will explain again what the purpose of the questioning is. I wrote to the Prime Minister on Sunday, 16 October—and I am happy to provide these letters to the minister if he has not come armed with them—because there were reports that the citizenship bill was about to be used by the government and that it was about to be almost certainly the subject of a High Court challenge. This citizenship bill is the bill on which the Attorney-General of Australia misled the parliament and the intelligence committee by falsely claiming in a formal letter to me, which is annexed to the report of the intelligence committee, that the Solicitor-General had advised on the bill.
                                                                                                                                            </p>
                                                                                                                                            <p>
                                                                                                                                             The Solicitor-General himself, in a letter dated 12 November 2015, has made clear to the Senate committee that is inquiring into the dealings between the Solicitor-General and the Attorney-General that that was a misrepresentation by the Attorney-General of his advice. To get over the problem, because the Attorney-General has already misled the intelligence committee on a previous occasion, I wrote to the Prime Minister to ask him to confirm that the Solicitor-General had, in fact, advised on the new counterterrorism bill, a very difficult and unprecedented counterterrorism measure, that is before the committee and the parliament at the moment—the

That is the question I am still asking, because Senator Brandis was asked by the Prime Minister to write back to me, which he did on 17 October—the Monday of this week—informing me that, exactly the same as the citizenship bill, the Solicitor-General had advised on some earlier draft of the high-risk terrorist offenders bill but has not, it seems, advised on the bill now before the parliament. Naturally enough, I wrote back to the Attorney-General the same day. I will read out, for the assistance of the minister, what I said: 'I seek further clarification from you that the Solicitor-General has been given the opportunity to advise not just on the draft but on the final version of the bill which is currently before the parliament and the intelligence committee.' That is the answer I am looking for. In addition, I want the minister to answer the other question which he could not answer—that is, how many of the current bills before the parliament has the Solicitor-General been given the opportunity to advise on in their final versions? I hope he has got those questions clear. I am happy to provide the correspondence if he needs it.

Can he explain why he agrees with this new legal services direction, which is unprecedented, which breaks with a convention that is 100 years old and which is disagreed with not just by the current Solicitor-General but by the former Solicitor-General Dr Gavan Griffith, who served the Commonwealth for 14 years under the Hawke, Keating and Howard governments. I could also ask the justice minister: has he ever sought the advice of the Solicitor-General without going to the Attorney-General first? If he has, why would he not support others doing the same?

It is effectively abolishing the Australian Institute of Criminology and merging it with the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission. This is very much a government that does not want to listen to the experts. We heard yesterday that the government is prepared to water down our gun laws in order to secure votes in the Senate for its antiworker legislation. Australians en masse were rightly horrified at the possibility that rapid-fire weapons might be let into Australia. Today, we have been hearing righteous indignation—

Of course I completely and utterly reject the ridiculous assertion that this government in any way, shape or form has sought or would seek to water down Australia's gun laws. That is complete and utter rubbish. I am very happy to go through what has been going on with that. The government has been taking proactive action to ensure that lever action shotguns over a magazine capacity of five are not allowed to be imported into Australia. The shadow Attorney-General was the Attorney-General for a short and rather inglorious period, but I would still expect him to know something about the way we govern gun laws in this country and the way we regulate guns in Australia. It has been absolutely clear to me, from the questioning in the House—not by him, admittedly, but by others on the opposition frontbench—that they would not have a clue about the way we regulate guns in Australia. I am happy to provide a very quick crash course, given I have got limited time. This is a very important question.

I will go back to what I was saying before I was rudely interrupted. Under your protection, Deputy Speaker Kelly, I will continue. The way we regulate guns in Australia is very simple: the Commonwealth regulates the import of guns and the states are responsible for the classification of guns. This is, of course, where we have our leverage; it is in relation to the import of guns. As the Minister for Justice, I have used that to ensure that we would not have a large-scale import of lever action shotguns with a magazine capacity of over five. That is in keeping, I think, with the spirit of the

The thing about category A is that all lever-action shotguns were placed in there regardless of their magazine capacity. It is also the case that in category A you could own as many of these guns as you like.

That has taken longer than I would have liked; I would have like to have concluded that conversation before now. But the reality is that not every jurisdiction agrees, and so we have been using our good officers to try and get a national agreement. There are nine jurisdictions in this country. To keep the NFA intact, we all need to move together. That takes a little bit of patience and understanding, but I do feel very confident that over time we will get the states to agree amongst themselves about where to classify lever-action shotguns with a magazine capacity of over five and also with a magazine capacity of under five. Again, I want to explicitly reject the suggestion that the member for Isaacs just made that we would seek, or have sought, to water down Australia's gun laws. It is nonsense, and I am sure he knows it is nonsense.

First, I absolutely reject the assertion that he made that somehow the Attorney-General has misled the House in any way, shape or form. That is not correct. He knows it is not correct and yet he continues to assert it. The Attorney-General has, as I raised in my previous answer, taken a direction and regarded the administrative process by which we get advice from the Solicitor-General. I think I am as surprised as everybody else in the country that it has caused the shadow Attorney-General to feel so aggrieved. It is an administrative process. It is a mere formality. When the Attorney-General has been asked if the Solicitor-General can provide advice, in every single case that he has been asked he has acquiesced to the Solicitor-General providing that advice. Again, I think this is a very straightforward issue and I am surprised it has taken up so much airtime.

There is no convincing evidence to prove that mandatory minimum sentencing acts as a deterrent. Despite that, the government is pursuing this measure. It is ignoring concerns expressed repeatedly by state and territory prosecutors. It is ignoring the concerns and opposition to mandatory sentencing expressed repeatedly by bar associations across Australia, by law societies across Australia and by the

Extraordinarily, it is ignoring even the government's own Attorney-General's Department's formal guidelines, which oppose mandatory minimum sentences. Of course, this government refuses to listen to all of those experts.

The minister knows that, and the government knows that. We want to stand with the government to implement sensible crime and justice policy, but this is a government which does not want to listen to the experts. We are deeply concerned that actions this government is taking in that regard will do more harm than good.

At the same time as the government is thinking, at least, about watering down our gun laws and talking to people about watering down our gun laws—particularly senators, in exchange for votes in that House—and ignoring law enforcement experts, this government is also destroying our ability to collect independent expert research on crime. A quieter, but very concerning policy proposed by the government over the past year is the merger of the

For over 40 years the Australian Institute of Criminology has produced expert research on gun control, including research on firearms and violent crime to firearms trafficking and armed robbery. The research has been critical to developing sensible and robust policies to tackle illegal weapons on our streets. Part of the reason why we in this parliament can trust this research—and why Australians generally can trust this research, and why we can rely so heavily on this research—is that it comes from what is seen to be an independent and highly respected source. Its independence allows it to talk to offenders, to talk to law enforcement, to talk to the courts and to talk to victims. It has a broad overview and a unique insight into crime and justice, and it helps policymakers and law enforcement to stop crimes before they occur.

Without independent, evidence-based data our gun control policy initiatives will be compromised, as will many of the other initiatives in the criminal justice area. Already the research on armed robbery has been cut. We have seen large reductions in staff and, for the first time in years, the Australian Institute of Criminology is failing to reach its research targets. Now is not the time to be making policy in the dark. This government's refusal to listen to experts or to commit to independent criminological research is very concerning. If this government wants to be tough on crime it first needs to understand crime. Labor will never water down our world-leading gun laws, and we will also stand by our internationally-renowned criminological research institutions. We call on the government to do the same.

How much has the merging of back-office operations saved? And, as to the breadth of research: under the proposed merger, who is going to clear

The member asked me about the determination of their priorities, but it is not up to me as minister to determine their priorities. It is up to the ACIC board.

We are dealing now with the fact that the ARC has been merged into the ACIC. If it were to be the case that the opposition were to take a different view, that would complicate things and provide enormous unnecessary bureaucracy for the ACIC. Quite frankly, the ACIC has got very important things to do—tackling national security priorities and organised crime. We need to ensure that the ACIC is focused on what it needs to do—and that is protecting the security of the Australian people.

The gun laws introduced by the Liberal government in 1996 are gun laws of which we are justifiably proud. We would never do anything to dilute the vital importance of the national firearms agreement. I do not know whether the member understands anything about the way we classify guns or not but he needs to understand that the current situation is that all lever-action shotguns are in category A—every single one. If you have a category A, licence you could literally have a 110 lever-action shotgun with a magazine capacity as long as the technology allows you. That is the current situation. That is the situation we are seeking to address.
                                                                                                                                                   </p>

I am hoping we will conclude that conversation. The only thing we are dealing with is the anomaly whereby a relatively high-powered gun in the form of a lever-action shotgun that could have a significant magazine capacity—in this case, over five—is going into the least restrictive category. We are addressing that.

I am very pleased that we have got a Minister for Justice who takes this very seriously. If you look at the welfare of a country, you have to have a country that does not have corruption and that has security so people can go about and live their lives. The thing that has been an issue particularly in the electorate of Mallee has been ice. Ice is being run by bikie gangs, and it has been a really significant issue. I have taken great comfort in the minister's strong interest not only in limiting the trafficking of ice but also in limiting the criminal activity that has surrounded that.

In that, we were also able to have a discussion around what is happening. One of the questions I have got for the minister is: what is the action the government is taking to ensure the safety and security of law enforcement and intelligence officers?

People in my electorate are shooters. They are responsible shooters. The great thing about the Howard gun laws, which often gets lost in the discussion, is the cooling-off period—the fact that you cannot get up a head of steam and go out and purchase a gun; you have actually got to wait a month or more. You have got to have a justifiable reason for it. You have got to pass a good character test. That has been very welcome.

I commend him for the work that he has been doing so far. I have particular interest in what he is doing around the topic of ice, because that is an area where, unfortunately, we seem to have people involved in that trade and partaking in illegal firearm importation as well. It disappoints me that the opposition has been very limp-wristed instead of backing the coalition on closing that down. I look forward to a very worthwhile response from the minister.

On the issue of crystal methamphetamine, better known as ice, we are facing a very serious problem in Australia, on which the government has taken significant national leadership. We have been concerned for some time around the reports we get from our own law enforcement agencies and from state law enforcement agencies. If any member of parliament were to go and talk to their local emergency department in a hospital, if they were to talk to emergency services workers in other sectors, they would know that the use of crystal methamphetamine has exploded. The last figures we had suggested that there were about 200,000 users of ice in Australia, but it is almost certain that that figure would be significantly more today.
                                                                                                                                                                </p>

They travelled the country, talking to people who have been addicted, talking to treatment services, talking to police, talking to people in hospitals, talking to other frontline service workers, and they provided that advice to the government in the latter half of last year. The government has responded with the most significant investment in drug and alcohol rehabilitation in Australia's history. We know that we need to tackle the supply side, which is policing. We are pulling more drugs off the streets; we are locking up more people who are peddling drugs; and we are confiscating more of the assets of serious drug criminals. But we know the supply side is not going to be the only answer here. We need to get people off this drug. We need to make sure that, if they are addicted and they seek treatment, they can get treatment. We have made a $240 million investment in drug and alcohol rehabilitation. This is an extra investment—on top of the investment that we already make and on top of what the states and territories already make—to make sure that help is available to people when they need it.
                                                                                                                                                                </p>

We need to make sure that we have rehabilitation services that are actually dealing with the specific issue of crystal methamphetamine. That money flows from 1 July this year, and I hope some of it flowed into the coffers to some people in the electorate of Mallee.

Last year we had the murder of Curtis Cheng out the front of the Parramatta police station. We know that police are specifically targeted by those who would seek to do harm in the community. In fact, the Director-General of Security upgraded the terrorism threat level specifically for law enforcement to probable, which is a reflection on the fact that we need to protect our police better.

This measure will see a range of measures implemented across Australia. The AFP received additional funding of $19.8 million over four years and will redirect $28.7 million over four years from within existing resources. The ACIC also received just over $5 million for their security. Yes, the member for Mallee has identified a very serious problem; yes, we have been taking action to make sure that our law enforcement officers have appropriate protections. We are very proud of the fact that in a very constrained fiscal environment we have been able to find the money for something that is so vitally important.

The tone these devices emit can only be heard by people who are less than 25 years of age, including babies and children, because of their ears and the hairs in their ears. It irritates and can cause pain and other symptoms such as dizziness, headache, nausea and impairment. It can have even more serious effects on children who have autism.

This would have expanded fibre to 40 per cent of households. This was less than the original 93 per cent target in our 2009 policy, but it recognised where things stood. The policy was thoroughly costed, and would have delivered fibre access across Australia at a rollout cost of between $49 to $57 billion. Our policy objective has remained consistent: to connect fibre to as many homes and premises as possible.

If only this government had the conviction to stay the course, Australians would have had access to a better network for largely the same cost! As I have outlined previously, the root cause is that this government lacks a coherent policy vision. This confusion has led the government to take its hands off the wheel. There is clearly a lack of comprehension and interest from the current communications minister in the project, and his vision could be described as pedestrian, to say the least.

So, come the next election—whenever that is held—regrettably, an incoming government will not be dealing with a blank slate. Engineering decisions will have been made, contracts will have been entered into and the network footprint will have taken shape. So what we will have is a patchwork of some form. It is a question of how that patchwork can best be shaped by what we do in the present.

What does a fibre-enhanced middle path looked like? The cost of deploying

In comparison, the cost of fibre to the distribution point is estimated to be around $2,700 per premises. For consumers, the prospect of more fibre and less copper means better speeds to support the applications of the future. It is also good news for retailers, because they will earn more revenue over the faster network and can deliver a better experience for their customers over newer infrastructure.

The Vertigan panel did not model the incremental costs or benefits of fibre to the distribution point versus FTTN in 2014. And, in fairness, fibre to the distribution point was not as developed then as it is now, and so perhaps the costs were not sufficiently known to enable this type of analysis to take place. But if this government insists on locking in copper as the primary infrastructure delivery mechanism, they should do so in a responsible way that preserves a viable upgrade path to fibre in the future.

The comparative merits of fibre to the distribution point and fibre to the node should be analysed in an objective way to evaluate the best path forward. These decisions cannot be outsourced to NBN Co. We cannot expect NBN Co itself to be guided by public interest, as this is not its mandate. This does require policy leadership and it is the government's job to lead.

I do emphasise the point—despite some of the ill-informed rhetoric that we hear—that all of those modes involve fibre at different stages of the network.

If then Prime Minister Gillard had a desire to appear in a photo op with a hard hat and a high-vis vest, then the NBN was at her service. If then Minister Conroy had a desire to be photographed or videoed feeding fibre into a pit, then the NBN was at his service. But when it came to actually rolling out fibre—rolling out the National Broadband Network—it turned out that the company charged with doing that had done a truly dismal job.

And the chief executive, while certainly with distinguished experience running one of the largest telecommunications equipment vendors, was not an experienced networks executive.

One of the key considerations was getting the rollout achieved and delivered quickly. And, of course, that is now what is happening. Look at the rate of rollout compared to the performance of the previous Labor government, which, as I have mentioned, managed to connect barely 50,000 people to the network in six years.

We are now at a point where some 3.2 million premises are able to connect and the total number that are actually activated is 1.417 million.

If it were question time, the questions to the executive would alternate between opposition members and government backbench, with a minister responding on each occasion. In the time I have been in this room tonight, that is what you have been following. What I am advising you, Deputy Speaker, is that is the way the standing orders work for question time. We are not in question time. The Federation Chamber is debating a question. Between each speaker you have been repeating to the chamber the question we are debating. That means the speeches from the minister, even if they amount in their content to a response to a question, count as speeches from the government. If government backbenchers are to make speeches and occupy time during this, then it can only happen if the minister does not seek the call immediately after an opposition question has been made and defers to a government backbencher. But the call must alternate because we are debating a motion.

What I have done is put the question—the question that the proposed expenditure be agreed to—and then I have given the call to whoever has been standing. I have not put that question again when the minister has answered the question.

It does not change the fact that the House is debating at this point. We are not in question time; we are in Consideration in Detail debating a matter, and the call should alternate. When the call goes to the government side, if you want to give the call to the member for Corangamite, so be it. But when it was the turn for the call to go to the government side, you repeatedly, across two ministers, gave the call to the minister. Having done that, the next call should go to the opposition.

Now, I refer to the provisions of the standing orders that the Manager of Opposition Business has read out today. The standing orders do not provide for what the Manager of Opposition Business is arguing. There is no specific provision in the standing orders which reflects what the Manager of Opposition Business is arguing. So I would put to you that it is a matter of discretion, and previous practice is—and it certainly was on the last occasion that I spoke on these matters—that there has been an alternation. It follows as a matter of logic that if you do not make that ruling then government members can readily be denied any opportunity to ask a question. So I would ask you to stay with your ruling.

The purpose of the consideration-in-detail debate is for the minister to answer questions. It is totally proper. To the extent that there is any concern about the interpretation of the standing orders—because it does not provide what the member for Watson is actually saying—I would ask you to use your discretion on this occasion.

However, the practice in this place has been, as I understand it, that the chair takes from the opposition first, the minister has an opportunity to answer and the chair then defers the next question to the government and so it goes. If the minister chooses to answer at any time through the exercise—and I put this process to the member for Watson—he can take three or four interventions or propositions from either side and then answer all of those. It has been done in different ways. But, if the member for Watson is trying to say that the minister answering a question is therefore a government speaker, that has not been the practice. For the information of the room, we had a very long meeting on this with the chairs and deputy chairs of both sides of the House and we agreed that this was the process up here as it was explained to us—and that is my understanding of the practice.

Originally, when this practice first started, the only people who would come in and question ministers were opposition members. That is how it used to happen. It used to be very, very rare for anyone from the government to stand up. So then the question and answer format just flowed.

But we cannot have a situation where it is debate, as this is, and the opposition is getting less than half the time.

But it does not mean that government members cannot play a role in the process.

The consideration-in-detail process is something that I have had some concerns with since I have been here as far as the allocation of time. My concern is that members from both sides should have equal opportunity to ask a question of the minister. Ultimately, if I read the standing orders, 'the allocation of the call is a matter for the discretion of the chair.' After that there are a whole lot of advisory points. It is my opinion that I should take it alternately. If the minister chooses to answer, he can. The minister may also choose not to answer and so he will take another question. Therefore, what I propose to do is give the call to the member for Corangamite. If the minister does not want to then take the answer, I will go to the member for Whitlam.

I am not going to continue to argue. I have put my case. I just want to make sure that I know what your ruling is. You are saying that, if a minister responds to an opposition question, that speech will not count as a contribution from the government side?

However, the administration of the program has been quite wanting. This is a $220 million program—$220 million worth of Commonwealth government funds, taxpayer funds, are dedicated to the shared objective of ensuring that mobile phone services are available to people in rural and regional Australia on the same basis as they are for people who live in the cities. That is a very laudable objective that enjoys broad support across the House.

The first round, worth $110 million of taxpayer money, was allocated to provide funds to build base stations in up to 500 locations that were nominated as black spots throughout the country. By way of background: there are currently 10,000 nominated black spots throughout the country. That is right. Deputy Speaker Kelly, I know you come from a rural area. A lot of them will be in your electorate. There are 10,000 mobile phone black spots throughout the country.

On its face, that stacks up. But, if you look at the allocation of the funds under the Mobile Black Spot Program, the overwhelming majority of the funds went to the largest incumbent: Telstra. Is it any wonder that this report, in its damning conclusion about the administration of round 1 of the program, found that substantial consolidation of existing coverage by the big telecommunication players, particularly Telstra, resulted from round 1 of the program? So they cannot say that putting $28 million worth of mobile black spot funding into towers that provided no or minimal benefit to consumers was okay because it was increasing competition. The audit commission has already dealt with that issue. The minister has questions to answer on this. Today he is the minister representing the minister from the other place, but he was the parliamentary secretary who was responsible for designing and administering the program. The parliament deserves some answers on this question.

I have spoken to the minister. One thing that is not in dispute is that this chamber adjourns at 7.30. So I propose that questions can be asked until 25 minutes past seven. I will call whoever is on their feet at 25 minutes past seven and allow the minister the last five minutes. That is the best use of everyone's time.

I would also like to put to the minister a question in relation to our Mobile Black Spot Program. I note that, in my electorate in round 1, 10 base stations were funded. None of those areas had any proper mobile coverage. I have to say that Labor, in the previous six years, did not provide one dollar to fix one mobile black spot anywhere in the country. In contrast, our program has been absolutely applauded throughout all rural and regional communities right across this nation. I know that when we turned on the mobile base station in Carlisle River—the first base station to be turned on in Corangamite—a tiny settlement for the first time felt that somebody was listening. Dereel, where there was a terrible bushfire in February 2013—again a community that felt completely isolated because they did not have access to mobile coverage—has also been funded, along with Gellibrand, and base stations have been fast-tracked there. I also want to briefly mention Bellbrae, Anglesea,

I ask the minister to update the chamber on the rollout of the Mobile Black Spot Program and the extent to which this is making a real difference in rural and regional communities.

The services provided by community radio bring diversity to the broadcasting sector and deliver services that are not delivered by commercial stations, particularly in regional areas of the country. In my electorate I have several community radio stations, and they provide an urgent and important service.

This will mean that community broadcasters cannot proceed with the rollout of digital radio, even though commercial stations are committed to moving in this direction. Can the minister please advise what evidence was used to support this decision to cut such funding? I ask that question in the light of the fact that a reduction in the forward estimates for commercial broadcasters is around $163 million, so it would appear to me that, while lending a hand to commercial networks, this government has, by cutting the funding of community radio, hurt community broadcasters and hurt communities.

However, it is also my understanding that the Community Broadcasting Association wrote to Minister Fifield seeking such extra funding and received a reply indicating that the government would deny that. Can the minister advise on the evidence used to make this decision, given the impact of the lack of digital resources and the effect that would have on community radio?

My letter remains unanswered, so I am using this opportunity to talk about this. The radio station is the only one based in the Adelaide Hills. It provides crucial support to the community, including broadcasting of local sporting fixtures and, most critically, it provides advice in relation to weather and bushfires—and we are a high-risk bushfire area. My understanding is that in order to gain a permanent licence, which it is very keen to do, Adelaide Hills FM must be invited by the

The funding commitment from the Commonwealth government was $100 million. The ultimate amount of money which is being expended to deliver base stations is $385 million. That reflects the fact that the program was carefully designed to attract private sector investment from the mobile operators, and both Telstra and Vodafone put significant dollars on the table. It also attracted significant funding from state governments.

One way we could have designed this program would have been to say, 'We will allocate all of the money in one big lump.' We chose not to do that. We very specifically designed a base-station-by-base-station competitive selection process, and we specifically allocated points in the process for co-funding from other sources. So the member for Whitlam is right: there is an important competitive issue to address. The program was designed very carefully to try and maximise competition, and it succeeded in that regard. Vodafone came in and put competitive pressure on Telstra, and that secured a much better outcome for taxpayers: 499 base stations was well at the top end of anybody's expectations. This was a great outcome for rural and regional Australians.
