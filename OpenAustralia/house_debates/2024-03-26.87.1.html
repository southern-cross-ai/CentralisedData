        My question is to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel. How is the Albanese Labor government delivering cost-of-living relief, services and support for defence personnel, veterans and their families?

         I want to thank the member for Makin for this very important question. I also acknowledge the support that he provides in advocating for the over 4,800 veterans across his community, many of whom work in the very important area of defence industry across Adelaide. Of course, that's an area that is only going to expand with the announcement last week by the Minister for Defence of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASC" rel="nofollow">

         It's all part of how the Albanese government is committed to delivering the best possible supports for our defence personnel, veterans and families. Labor wants to ensure that people earn more and keep more of what they earn. That's why we are delivering a tax cut to every Australian taxpayer, including our veterans and members of our Defence Force. Indeed, 87 per cent of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         personnel will receive a higher tax cut than they would have under the Liberals' plan. Further to that, any serving member of the Defence Force, no matter what industry they're working in, whether it's defence industry or any other area, will now also be receiving a tax cut.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our veterans make great employees, supporting businesses across Australia, because they bring those great skills of teamwork, leadership, agility and being able to work under pressure. They are all great skills that support any industry across Australia. But some veterans do need assistance to be connected to work. Work is of great benefit for those transitioning into civilian life to make sure that that transition is successful. That's why employment and connection to employment is a key feature of our veterans and families hubs that we are rolling out across the country. Over the last few weeks, I have been very happy to announce funding for hubs in the Surf Coast and Geelong region, in the Hawkesbury and south-western Sydney, in the Hunter, in Ipswich and in Tweed, and last year in northern Adelaide and in Rockingham in

         .
        </p>
        <p>
         We're also working to improve supports for veterans through our reform to the veterans compensation legislation system. We are now consulting on an exposure draft of the Veterans' Entitlements, Treatment and Support (Simplification and Harmonisation) Bill 2024, delivering on the first recommendation of the interim report of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Royal Commission
         </a>
         into Defence and Veterans Suicide. This will deliver a movement, from three different pieces of complex legislation to one ongoing piece of legislation, so that veterans get better access to service and supports, advocates can support them, and
