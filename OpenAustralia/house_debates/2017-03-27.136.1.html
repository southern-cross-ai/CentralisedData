        The extraordinary Spirit of Anzac Centenary Experience exhibition recently visited the Calare electorate. It is presented during the Anzac Centenary, spanning 2014 to 2018—the most significant period of commemoration in our nation’s history. It is the largest travelling exhibition in Australia since the 1988 bicentennial exhibition, and it serves as a moving and dignified account of the actions of not only our

       </p>
       <p>
        One of the most important legacies of the Anzac Centenary period is an increased understanding and awareness of our wartime history, particularly amongst younger Australians. Over 40,000 school students have visited this exhibition. Orange was the 21st location for the exhibition. In an important milestone, it welcomed the 300,000th visitor to the Spirit of Anzac Centenary Experience since it opened in September 2015 in Wodonga—an amazing achievement. I was delighted to not only welcome the exhibition to Orange but also officially open it, representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs.

        left virtually no Australian family untouched by its horror. From a population of fewer than five million, over 416,000 men enlisted, of whom more than 60,000 were killed and 156,000 wounded, gassed or taken prisoner. Like so many communities across Australia, the central west region of

        On 10 October 1915, Captain Bill Hitchen and 25 men marched from Gilgandra to Sydney on the Coo-ee March—named after the cry used to enlist more than 260 men for the war along the way. The community zone of the exhibition—a highly popular feature—showcases historical artefacts from the local region. A photo of the Coo-ee Marchers at the

William Edwin Agland, former assistant town clerk in Orange and the son of the Orange mayor, wrote from England to express his disgust at the no result in the October conscription referendum. He said that they 'should be over here, up to their bellies in mud and slush and fighting for freedom, instead of waltzing up and down Summer Street, making eyes at the pretty girls.'

        sub-branch boasts 120 members. It played an important role in putting together the community zone at the exhibition, and I would like to make mention of the committee members. They include Les McGaw, the honorary secretary, treasurer, custodian of the cenotaph, and recruiting and membership officer; and Lindsay Wright, the president and also the recruiting and membership officer. It should be noted that I have undertaken to procure for Lindsay a new hat this Christmas, as he badly needs one. The members also include: Ros Davidson, vice-president; Chris Colvin, vice-president; Allister Kable, pension and welfare officer; Tony Gosper, trustee; and

        During the Centenary of Anzac, so many of our RSL sub-branches across Calare are paying tribute to the service and sacrifice of our ancestors. We acknowledge the vital contribution that these sub-branches make to our country communities.

        I do not have an opportunity to name all of our wonderful sub-branches tonight, but the Spirit of Anzac Centenary Experience exhibition is a poignant tribute to the service and sacrifice of the men and women who went to war for Australia. I pay tribute to them and to the RSL sub-branches and their important work.
