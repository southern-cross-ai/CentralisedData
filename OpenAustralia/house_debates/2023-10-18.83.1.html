       <p>
        Australians have enthusiastically embraced the digital economy over the past decade. Many millions of us regularly get around with ride-sharing services, like Uber, Ola and Ingogo; order meals through platforms like DoorDash, Menulog and Uber Eats; find someone to help with jobs around the home or our business using services like Airtasker or Freelancer; or get specialist disability support via a platform like Mabel. Hundreds of thousands of Australians are providing their services over these platforms, and they've made this choice because it allows them to work flexibly when it suits them. Often they'll combine the work they do as an Uber driver or disability support worker with other time commitments, such as study, family responsibilities or building a business.

        An Ipsos poll commissioned by Uber last year found that 93 per cent of its workers want laws that preserve their flexibility. As the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">

        But the Albanese government is actively hostile. Workplace relations minister
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Burke" rel="nofollow">
         Tony Burke
        </a>
        called the gig economy a cancer and has introduced draconian laws that will adversely impact the sector. Rather than jumping to the tune of union bosses, the government should consult carefully with platform operators, consumers and service providers; respect the choices millions of Australians are making every day; and take great care to avoid destroying the extraordinary benefits that this sector and the digital economy have brought to all Australians.
