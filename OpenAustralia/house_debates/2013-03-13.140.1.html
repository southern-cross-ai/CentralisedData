        On Wednesday, 6 March, I hosted an interfaith forum at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingle_Farm" rel="nofollow">
         Ingle Farm
        </a>
        Recreation Centre in the Makin electorate. The forum was attended by about 200 people, including religious and community leaders from across diverse sectors of the Adelaide community. Keynote speaker at the forum was the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">
         Kevin Rudd
        </a>
        . The former South Australian Premier,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Arnold" rel="nofollow">
         Lynn Arnold
        </a>
        , who had the role of forum moderator, brought his own extensive expertise on matters of faith to the discussion. Those attending were able to ask questions or simply express their views about religion and matters of faith.
       </p>
       <p>
        Throughout the world, faith communities have been at the forefront in responding to social disadvantage, poverty and human suffering. In my own community, I am continually heartened by the extensive humanitarian work faith communities are associated with both in Australia and abroad.
       </p>
       <p>
        Relying extensively on volunteers and without being judgemental, they have led by example in extending a hand of friendship and bringing comfort to people, regardless of who those people were or where they came from. Through their generosity and compassion, faith communities have overcome cultural barriers and they have become the voice of social justice for people who often have no-one else to turn to. Yet they have mostly worked independently of each other, with each maintaining their individual identity.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to their humanitarian work, I believe that there is another equally important role that faith communities can serve in today's world where so much tension exists at local and international levels. Racial prejudice lies at the heart of so much of that tension. Racial prejudice often stems from a lack of understanding of others. Cultural values, customs, traditions and behaviour of people have many origins, but where religion or spiritual beliefs are present within a culture those beliefs are likely to be the most influential factors.
       </p>
       <p>
        Spiritual beliefs and culture are inseparable. One need only look to the Indigenous people of Australia, whose culture is built from their spiritual attachment to our land, to understand that. If we are to understand culture we therefore cannot ignore the faith that underpins it. We embrace another's culture only superficially if we do not respect and understand the spiritual beliefs on which it is founded. Yet we make little effort to do so. In fact we do the opposite and tend to steer away from discussions about matters of faith. That appears to be changingâ€”and it is our faith communities and religious leaders who are leading the change. In South Australia the Oasis project at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_University" rel="nofollow">
         Flinders University
        </a>
        and the Abraham Institute are shining examples of how interfaith dialogue is breaking down cultural barriers. In breaking down those barriers we make Australia a better society, not by being tolerant of others but by being accepting of them.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to the most recent ABS statistics, over three-quarters of the Australian people associate themselves with a faith but the mix is changing and it will continue to change as people come to Australia from different parts of the world. For example, whereas 100 years ago about 96 per cent of Australians identified with Christianity, that figure is now 61 per cent. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Constitution" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Constitution
        </a>
        specifically ensures freedom of religion. It was a considered decision made by the founding fathers of our nation which has served Australia well and which I believe has made the transition to Australian life by new settlers much easier.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hon" rel="nofollow">

        . Kevin Rudd made this point so well at the forum when he said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We actually have something uniquely precious here. I think one of the great hidden strengths of Australia is our embrace of diversity.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We have an ability to absorb the traditions, and consider respectfully, the traditions of faith which have come to these shores through successive waves of migration, creating for us an enormous national strength of resilience in ourselves, as a community and a nation, and frankly a strength in engaging the world today.
       </p>
       <p>
        The importance of faith and its relevance to culture cannot be ignored if we are to live in peace with others in Australia and overseas. Regrettably, perceptions about faith are often drawn from the actions of extremists but, just as extremists do not reflect the wider community on other matters, nor do they on matters of faith.
       </p>
       <p>
        In a world with so much cultural conflict, where international migration is commonplace and where international trade sustains economies, interfaith discussions and cultural understanding make good sense. Former British Prime Minister Tony Blair understood this when in 2008 he set up the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Blair_Faith_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Tony Blair Faith Foundation
        </a>
        to promote understanding and respect between the world's main religions and as a vehicle to alleviate poverty in developing countries.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank all of the people who participated in the interfaith forum at Ingle Farm, and I thank people for their contribution on the day. The feedback that I have received from them subsequent to the forum has all been positive, with many requests for more similar events. I also take this opportunity to thank Pastor Terry Williams and his team from the Ingle Farm Baptist Church for setting up the venue on the day and providing morning tea for those who attended.
