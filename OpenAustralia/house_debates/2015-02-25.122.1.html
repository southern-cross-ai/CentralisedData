        On 25 April this year, Australia will mark the centenary event of the Anzac landings at Gallipoli. Our nation's identity was shaped by the service and sacrifice of Australian men and women at Gallipoli and on other battlefields of that war. The former federal Labor government established the Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program, and I commend the current government for continuing that program. I want to thank the local committee, which I established, chaired by Jim Runham
