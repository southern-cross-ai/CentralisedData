        The Charlestown Caring Group is a very important part of the electorate of Shortland. It provides services to frail aged people. In September I attended their annual general meeting. At that annual general meeting I heard about their achievements for the past year, how their business had grown and how they had gone from strength to strength. All this happens while they are providing a fantastic service to the people of Charlestown and the surrounding areas. It is important to note that there are many volunteers that are working with Charlestown Caring Group. It is through the fantastic effort of these volunteers coming in week after week, that the Charlestown Caring Group can provide support and service to the elderly.

        This year, Charlestown Caring Group was a finalist in the Lake Macquarie Business Excellence Awards. But it was not a one-off; they were finalists in 2014 as well. They are an organisation that has put in place quality improvements, and they are very much in tune with the changes to the Aged Care Act. I congratulate the coordinator, Margaret Morgan. I know that they will continue to go from strength to strength and provide this outstanding service to the people of Charlestown and the surrounding areas.
