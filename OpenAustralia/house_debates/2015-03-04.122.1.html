        The Cancer Council's Stars of Lismore Dance for Cancer event will launch in May of this year. Money is going to be raised for, obviously, a very important cause, Cancer Council's research for a cure. I would like to introduce you to the 12 dancing identities and their teachers who will be part of this night.
       </p>
       <p>
        Firstly, we have Angela McCormick. Angela is the Southern Cross University Alumni Relations Coordinator. Her style will be ballroom, which I think is very fitting for Angela; she will look great. Her instructor is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Devoy" rel="nofollow">
         John Devoy
        </a>
        of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JRN" rel="nofollow">
         JRN
        </a>
        Ballroom Dance Tuition. The form on Angela is:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It's not all strictly ballroom for this multi-tasking mum of three. The qualified lawyer also squeezes in a Masters of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Administration" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        degree, cooking, sewing, philanthropy—all while whipping up Cup Day winning garments.
       </p>
       <p>
        Contestant No. 2, Garth Brown, is the Nurse Unit Manager of the Oncology (Cancer) Unit at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Vincent's" rel="nofollow">
         St Vincent's
        </a>
        Private Hospital. His style will be jazz.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angela_Reid" rel="nofollow">
         Angela Reid
        </a>
        of Sharp Dance Lismore will be his instructor. The form on Garth is:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Although a hesitant contender, Garth has already attracted a huge following from St Vincent's hospital staff. Having managed the oncology unit for six years, he will need to swap his safe hands for jazz hands.
       </p>
       <p>
        Contestant No. 3, Adam Berger, is the owner of the Goonellabah Tavern. His style will be ballet, so that will be interesting to watch. His instructor is Rhiannon Beardow of Karen Ireland Dance Centre. The form on Adam is:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This lovable publican manager is a footloose favourite at weddings, parties, anything.
       </p>
       <p>
        Contestant No. 4 is Ashleigh Saunders. I have known Ashleigh for many, many years. She is a journalist at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        News. Her style will be swing and her instructor is Alex Sexton of Swing On in. The form on Ashleigh is:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Ashleigh is no stranger to being in front of the camera and the local girl is bound to be a popular entrant. But is swing her thing?
       </p>
       <p>
        Contestant No. 5 is Jason Mumford,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Centre" rel="nofollow">
         City Centre
        </a>
        manager. Jason's style will be pole—pole dancing. Lots of kudos goes to Jason for being happy to do that! The form on Jason is:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Someone had to have the chutzpah to brave the pole. The best-dressed man at the council will remain in pants at least for his pole dancing debut.
       </p>
       <p>
        Contestant No. 6 is Mayor Jenny Dowell. Her style is tap and her instructor is Megan Phillips of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INXS" rel="nofollow">
         INXS
        </a>
        Dance Academy. Her form is:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Despite claiming she has 'two left feet' our high-profile mayor is the one to beat when it comes to attracting interest and donations via social media. A few weeks into a personalised fitness regime … Cr Dowell could really 'turn on the tap' in May. Look out.
       </p>
       <p>
        Contestant No. 7 is Jessica Daley. Jessica works as a radio announcer at both
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZZZ" rel="nofollow">
         ZZZ
        </a>
        and 2LM. Her style is belly dancing. Her instructor is Danielle Sansom of Barefoot Gypsies. Her form is:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We don't know if Jessica can dance but we think she is capable of anything. Prior to her reincarnation as an announcer she worked in the air force as both a linguist, and as an airborne electronics analyst on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AP" rel="nofollow">
         AP
        </a>
        -3C Orion aircraft. She toured Iraq, travelled 40 countries, speaks three languages fluently and is a keen runner. Surely belly dancing should be a breeze.
       </p>
       <p>
        Contestant No. 8, Laleynya Ryan, is a police officer in Lismore. Her style is rock 'n' roll. Her instructor is Robert Weis of Summerland Rockers. Her form is:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If it's murder on the dancefloor, Lismore police believe Laleynya to be the number one suspect.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As a mum of two and a police officer with 13 years experience, she reckons it would be a crime to pass up the opportunity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Contestant No. 9, Leah White, is a journalist at
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Northern_Star" rel="nofollow">
          The Northern Star
         </a>
        </i>
        . Her style is flamenco and her instructor is Serena Joy of Serena Joy Flamenco. Her form is:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        What this pocket-rocket journo—
       </p>
       <p>
        and she is a pocket-rocket journo, Mr Deputy Speaker—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        lacks in height she makes up in the courage to let herself look like a goose. This former Lismore High School girl once made a lion jump over her head for a story, so who knows what she'll do on stage.
       </p>
       <p>
        Contestant No. 10, Mel Carrero, is marketing manager at the Lismore Shopping Square. Her style is hip-hop—I think that will suit Mel—and her instructor is Lynda Rose of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_Dance" rel="nofollow">
         Just Dance
        </a>
        . She is 'happy to turn dancing queen for a cure for cancer'.
       </p>
       <p>
        Contestant No. 11,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Warren" rel="nofollow">
         Robert Warren
        </a>
        , is a solicitor at Somerville Laundry Lomax Solicitors, his style is 'modern' and his instructor is Roisin Francis of Jump Shake Dance. He is 'building quite a case for dancing' and finds 'any loophole' but 'will do anything for a good cause'.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lastly, contestant No. 12 is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Manley" rel="nofollow">
         Stephen Manley

        . Latin is his style and Jacquie Connolly of Sendero Latino is his instructor. He believes in 'no pain, no gain'.
