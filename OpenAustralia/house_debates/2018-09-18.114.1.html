        I want to alert the House to the federal financial grants and other grants to local government bodies in the Lyne electorate. The federal coalition government will contribute $2.4 billion to 546 councils around the nation. Financial assistance grants, roads to recovery, bridges renewal, federal black-spot money and heavy vehicle safety and productivity funds are the lifeblood of many these regional councils. For instance, Maitland will receive $6.9 million this year, including $864,000 in financial assistance grants—general purpose grants.

        -Hastings Council will receive $9.2 million this year, including $1.14 million in general purpose financial assistance grants. MidCoast Council, one of the biggest combined councils in the state of

        </a>
        , in my electorate of Lyne will receive $17.8 million this year, including $2.23 million of financial assistance grants.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently, I was proud to announce that the coalition government, under its signature policy Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program, has committed $5 million to the upgrade of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bucketts_Way" rel="nofollow">
         Bucketts Way
        </a>
        , a very important artery for commerce in the Lyne electorate. At the MidCoast Council, similar programs in the last round of Bridges to Renewal provided co-funding for 13 regional small bridges, and another million dollars, roughly, for a similar bridge at the bottom end of the Port Macquarie-Hastings Council local government area.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungog_Shire_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Dungog Shire Council
        </a>
        has been left behind in the local government stakes, with a huge area to cover and no roads that are under the responsibility of the state government—they are all local government roads. It received in total $2.56 million. It has a huge road and bridge liability, but the formula is not working for some of these local government bodies. I met with the mayor. She has advocated around the corridors in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_Street" rel="nofollow">
         Macquarie Street
        </a>
        and she is turning to the federal government for help. She went to the New South Wales local government minister and various other ministers to seek help for their bridge and road funding, and was told that perhaps they could source commercial loans from a bank. I couldn't believe it; I had to resuscitate myself!
       </p>
       <p>
        Black spot funding is another source of funds, and I would like to see much more money go into this, but we've already increased funds to local government and I look forward to fighting for more in the future.
