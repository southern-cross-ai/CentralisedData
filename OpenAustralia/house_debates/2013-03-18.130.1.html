        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Salvation Army
        </a>
        has had an official presence in the Ipswich area since 1885. Apart from a significant spiritual ministry in the region, the Salvos have provided aged-care services; chaplaincy to prisons, hospitals, court and the defence forces; crisis support, including housing; drug, alcohol and gambling addiction rehabilitation; emergency and disaster servicesâ€”on display far too often in Blair over the past two years; family support; legal services; and overseas aid. One of the most important aspects of their work has been youth employment and training services, which I want to focus on tonight.

        In August 2012 the former Governor-General,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_William_Deane" rel="nofollow">

        , officially opened the Salvation Army's Riverview Farm chapel, an event delayed due to the 2011 floods. As it turned out the eventual opening coincided with the 100-year anniversary of the chapel, which had been relocated from Blackbutt to the Ipswich site. Its erection and restoration became an ideal opportunity for the Skilling Queenslanders for Work program, run by the Salvation Army at the Riverview Farm, Canaan and funded by the then Queensland Labor government. Canaan had hosted up to 250 clients on 360 acres of land near the junction of the Brisbane and Bremer Rivers so it experienced flooding in recent years. The farm has been the site of training services for long-term unemployed youth

        with a focus on Indigenous people. The farm provided emergency housing, community services, along with conference and retreat facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The farm's manager is Brad Strong. He has been a strong advocate for the Skilling Queenslanders for Work program and is a large part of the program's success at Canaan. He is proud of the successful Indigenous program, which has seen 100 per cent of the intake find full-time work. Today, Brad Strong is not so happy.

        The Queensland
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        government heartlessly slashed $500,000 in funding for the Skilling Queenslanders for Work program in July 2012. Last week the Riverview Farm was forced to lay off 12 of its staff. Staff members who were responsible for successfully assisting some of the most disadvantaged young people in Blair were sacked. Brad and the Salvation Army locally have done everything they can to replace the Queensland LNP state government funding, but finally they were forced to lay off the staff. The rebuilding program and the training programs which utilised long-term unemployed people to help in flood restoration projects in Ipswich are no more, but they were greatly lauded. They met their demise at the hands of the Queensland LNP state government.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have seen the work of the Salvation Army training programs, met many of the young people and seen the difference it has made in their lives. I have talked to councils, community groups and businesses who have benefitted from these young people working around the electorate. They played a big part in restoration works following the 2011 floods. Even though the Bundamba Salvation Army headquarters store and their church were flooded as well, the Salvos worked hard. I worked alongside Brad Strong and other Salvation Army officers in evacuation centres during some of the hardest days in the Ipswich region. I recently met the new captain in the Bundamba Salvation Army, Captain Ben Johnson, and talked about the consequences for his congregation and for the long-term unemployed people in Ipswich, particularly on the eastern side of Ipswich. He outlined to me the challenges that the Salvation Army will face and those people will have to endure.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am appalled to see the Queensland LNP state government put an end to these services. But I want to draw attention to some local journalists who have faithfully reported the activities of the Salvation Army in Ipswich and the events surrounding Riverview Canaan Farm. You have to appreciate the depth of the love and appreciation of the local Salvation Army to understand also the great work that the
        <i>
         Queensland Times
        </i>
        has given in their faithful reporting over the years. I commend former
        <i>
         Queensland Times
        </i>
        journalist, Paul Smeaton, for his coverage of the Salvation Army. In 2011 he reported the need for charity following a tough year in the region. Last year Paul wrote an excellent article highlighting the impact of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Newman" rel="nofollow">
         Campbell Newman
        </a>
        's LNP razor gang cuts, including $7 million cut from training programs in Ipswich alone. I applaud
        <i>
         Queensland Times
        </i>
        journalist, Joel Gould, for his article on the fate of Riverview Farm thanks to the LNP cuts. Joel's story was printed in Saturday's newspaper under the banner 'Newman Axes Salvos Staff'. Likewise, the now-defunct
        <i>
         Ipswich News
        </i>
        had also attempted to keep the LNP state government accountable, but not a word or a peep or a whisper from the LNP members for Ipswich, Ipswich West and Nanango, to their disgrace and shame. I thank the local media for their work in relation to this. I thank the Salvation Army for the work they do, and I call on Campbell Newman to stop blaming the previous Labor government, and I say, '
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thank_God" rel="nofollow">
         Thank God
        </a>
        for the Salvos.' We should be helping them help others.
