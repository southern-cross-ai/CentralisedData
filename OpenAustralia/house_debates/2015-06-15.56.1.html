       <p>
        It gives me great pleasure to welcome to parliament today Principal Timothy Hall and the leadership team from Mansfield Secondary College. I would like to acknowledge the fantastic role of schools and education in Indi. Mansfield Secondary College is an outstanding example of academic and cultural scholarship, agriculture through its school based apprentice and its

        annexe.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, I would particularly like to acknowledge four of the leadership team: Liam, who has a desire to study a

        </a>
        and he values the opportunity to look at a range of careers; and Ruby, who has set her heart on going to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_University" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        to also complete a Bachelor of Science majoring in mathematics. There is Jessie, whose goal is to become a police officer—a dream she has had since grade 5. She plans next year to have a gap year in Malta and return. Also, there is Tim—I would especially like to welcome Tim. This morning, Tim received his blazer as part of the Australian Science and Mathematics Olympiad team, which is heading overseas in July. Tim is also from Mansfield Secondary College and is one of the leadership team.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would particularly like to thank the community of Mansfield for the wonderful work they do and the parents. In particular, Tim's parents, Pat and Dave, have come up today to be part of that team. I wish all the Australian Science and Mathematics Olympiad team well. We are really looking forward to hearing of your results and reporting back to parliament as you represent us overseas.
