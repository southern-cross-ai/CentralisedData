        As you know, my community's the epicentre of the Queensland outbreak, with many local schools impacted. I want to thank everybody in our community for complying with the state government's lockdown requirements, particularly the 20,000 families who are in quarantine right now as close contacts. They are really going above and beyond to support their community and their families. I know there have been long wait times for testing, but they are coming out in droves so we can get on top of this outbreak. They're also leading the way when it comes to vaccinations. It was reported this week that Brisbane's western suburbs are leading the state's fight against COVID-19, with the most vaccinated population in Queensland. Well done to my community. I want to particularly commend the many young people in the Ryan electorate who are coming out to get their

        jab. I'm 35. I went out and talked to my

        and got the AstraZeneca jab. I really recommend people get it right now. There are appointments available right now, and they can get in without delay. It's a reasonable excuse to leave the lockdown requirements.

        My team and I have spent the last couple of days calling as many of those in lockdown and quarantine as we possibly can to offer our support. We can connect you to local grocery stores and local businesses who can home deliver. We can connect you with mental health support and provide you with assistance to connect with financial assistance payments that are being made available from the federal government. Thank you again to my entire community for supporting and protecting each other.
