        The business community in my electorate will be celebrating the achievements of local entrepreneurs over the coming week with both the Wanneroo Business Association and the Joondalup Business Association holding their respective annual business awards nights.
       </p>
       <p>
        Small businesses account for 96 per cent of all Australian businesses, employing 4.5 million people and producing $330 billion of Australia's gross domestic product. Our region can be described as an emerging economic powerhouse. In the June 2015 quarter the unemployment rate in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Joondalup" rel="nofollow">
         City of Joondalup
        </a>
        was 2.9 per cent, less than half that of the national average of 6 per cent. Our gross regional product was $5.88 billion in 2014, growing 6.2 per cent since 2013.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2013-14 the City of Joondalup contributed 3.6 per cent of Western Australia's total employment. Similarly, in that year total tourism and hospitality sales in the City of Joondalup amounted to $850.7 million. The total value added was $371 million. Retail trade is the largest employer in our region, generating 9,270 local jobs, whilst the construction industry had the largest output by industry, generating $3.19 billion in 2013-14. We have a highly educated workforce, with 35.5 per cent of our local labour force holding tertiary qualifications.
       </p>
       <p>
        As someone from a business and commercial background who has been involved with the Wanneroo and Joondalup business communities for nearly 20 years, I am always looking for practical and meaningful ways to assist small business through advocacy in government. One key strategy involves increasing market access for Australian exporters to boost revenue from the supply of goods and services into emerging economies with significant populations of increasingly affluent consumers with purchasing power. In effect, this allows demand driven economic growth to occur and is being actively achieved through a series of free trade agreements successfully being implemented, with Korea, Japan, China and the latest, the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, adding to the existing agreements already in place. By building upon our strong diplomatic ties and contacts we are able to promote the trade and investment necessary to boost local businesses.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recognising the importance of transport and logistics in maintaining efficient supply chains for businesses in our region, the federal government has this year invested heavily in upgrading the local road infrastructure, with $209.1 million in federal funding towards the northern extension of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_Freeway" rel="nofollow">
         Mitchell Freeway

        and associated construction of Neerabup Road to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanneroo_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Wanneroo Road
        </a>
        providing a logistics link via the newly realigned Flynn Drive to the Neerabup industrial area. This will establish Neerabup as an important economic hub with capacity for the creation of up to 20,000 new jobs. Further south, the federal government has also contributed $67.2 million towards the $108 million upgrade of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Reid Highway

        , which includes widening between

        and

        and grade separation at the Malaga Drive intersection.
       </p>
       <p>
        The federal government is also working with states and territories to promote deregulation across all levels of government. Many regulatory instruments fall within the area of responsibility of state and local governments, so it is essential that all levels of government cooperate to reduce red tape. The time frame to process applications for planning and development approvals must improve if we are to attract investment and deliver a higher standard of living. Deregulation reforms are much needed to promote greater productivity, make our exports more competitive and attract investment to Australia.

        Investment by government in telecommunications infrastructure through the
