       <p>
        I rise today to speak on a very special matter close to all of our hearts. Today is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine's_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Valentine's Day
        </a>
        and I want to pay special tribute to all those fly in, fly out families in my electorate, many of whom I have had the pleasure of meeting. I would also like to pay particular tribute to the families of our Defence servicemen and servicewomen currently serving overseas. These members of our community make many sacrifices in the line of work to provide the best possible support and opportunities for their families back home. Any job that takes someone away from their home for an extended period of time takes its toll and I commend the strength of all of those families, which are often in unique or difficult circumstances.
       </p>
       <p>
        Likewise, I would like to thank all of our partners and children, who support us in our roles as members and senators. We owe a lot to our partners, who often do not see us for weeks on end. When we are in our home cities, they accompany us to community events and functions and assist us in our roles as much possible. This support is invaluable to me and, I am sure, to all of us within this parliament. To have a supportive partner means everything to me, and that is why I would like to pay particular tribute to my wife, Anna. Similarly, our children make huge sacrifices to support us in these roles. My sons, Aaron and Brendyn, have always supported me and I am particularly grateful for that. Today for Valentine's Day I pay tribute to all of our partners and families back home who we all cherish incredibly.
       </p>
       <p>
        To the electors of Hasluck, I say this: whether our family members are working up north in the mines or in Afghanistan putting their lives on the line for our country, I am sure that you will all join with me in celebrating the strength and support of these family members, which they provide every day, not just on Valentine's Day. The beauty of Valentine's Day is the time that we take to cherish someone who we love. We give words of kindness and love but we also bestow flowers such as red roses and chocolates. All of those things make a difference. I know that in this parliament there are many who work here who equally cherish Valentine's Day. I even acknowledge the journalists who sometimes give us a hard time. They equally look forward to Valentine's Day. It is a tremendous day. It is a pity that we are not with our partners and families. On this day, I want to acknowledge all of those who are important to us.
