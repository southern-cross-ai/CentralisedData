Will the minister update the House on how the government is guaranteeing lower energy prices and a more reliable supply through a national approach to energy policy? Is the minister aware of any alternative approaches that will adversely affect the hip pocket—

         The member for Mackellar will resume his seat. The members for Perth and Chifley will leave under 94(a). The members for Chifley and Perth aren't engaged in a sitcom. They'll be named if they don't leave immediately. The member for Mackellar will begin his question again.

           I thank the member for Mackellar for his question. I know that he strongly supports the efforts by the Turnbull government to create a more reliable and affordable energy system. The efforts that we have undertaken with the gas supply, which have seen more gas—

            Could the member for Lindsay and others cease

            </a>
            . The minister will just resume his seat for a second. It's very clear what the member for Lindsay and others are doing, in trying to mimic the minister from an earlier answer. Frankly—no, let's just call it as it is. You've made the point. It might have been funny the first time. But I'm going to be blunt back. It actually becomes really juvenile. It's not what people come to question time to see. The minister has the call.

             The people of Australia who want lower energy prices don't want the juvenile policies put forward by those opposite. They don't want the juveniles in charge; they want the adults in charge. They want the adults in charge who are driving lower prices and a more reliable system by entering into agreements with the

              LNG
             </a>
             suppliers to get gas supplied to Australians before it is exported overseas; passing legislation through this parliament to stop the ability of the networks to game the system—the poles-and-wire companies; getting an agreement with the energy retailers to offer a better deal to millions of Australians, who are saving hundreds of dollars on their power bills; and taking the decisions to invest in major storage projects, like Snowy 2.0 and projects in Queensland and
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
              South Australia
             </a>
             , which will see us create a more stable system. And, for the first time, the Turnbull government is undertaking the difficult challenge of integrating energy and climate policy through the National Energy Guarantee. It has taken the advice of the experts from the Energy Security Board. It has had modelling undertaken which will show the Australian average household will save about $120 a year and the wholesale electricity price will come down by about 23 per cent. So if you are a big paper manufacturer, you could save some $10 million a year. If you own a large supermarket, you could save more than $400,000 a year. If you are a chemical factory, you could save more than $1.4 million a year. And that is why this policy has been well received, right across the board.
            </p>
            <p>
             But I am asked: are there any alternative approaches that would hurt the hip pocket of the people of Bennelong? Well, just two words:
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristina_Keneally" rel="nofollow">
              Kristina Keneally
             </a>
             . When she was a powerbroker in New South Wales Labor, energy prices went up by 60 per cent between 2006 and 2011. That's not good news for the people of Epping. That's not good news for the people of Eastwood. And we know that the Leader of the Opposition, with his policy of an emissions intensity scheme, will see Australian average households more than $300 worse off. That is the policy being put forward by the Labor Party.
            </p>
            <p>
             So if you want higher energy prices, support Kristina Keneally. But if you want a more stable system and more affordable power, get behind
