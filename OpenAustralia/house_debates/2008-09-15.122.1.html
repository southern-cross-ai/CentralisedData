       <p>
        I am particularly pleased to have moved this motion in relation to the situation in Tibet, which is entirely unsatisfactory. My personal view is that the Chinese invasion of Tibet was no more justified than was the German invasion of Poland at the commencement of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         Second World War
        </a>
        . However, the Chinese now occupy Tibet, and the world has recognised Chinese sovereignty over Tibet. We have a situation where dialogue is going on between the Tibetan authorities and the Chinese authorities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Five minutes is not really very long—and I have only three minutes left—to talk about the situation in Tibet at the moment and the situation between Tibet and China. I personally believe that the Chinese authorities agreed to this further dialogue only as a way of getting the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing_Olympics" rel="nofollow">
         Beijing Olympics
        </a>
        out of the way. The seventh round of the Sino-Tibetan dialogue, held on 1 July, has been described by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dalai_Lama" rel="nofollow">
         Dalai Lama
        </a>
        ’s special envoy as one of the most difficult sessions held so far. In keeping with their policy of engagement with the Chinese government, and with no other options presenting themselves, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Tibetan_Administration" rel="nofollow">
         Central Tibetan Administration
        </a>
        —that is, the Tibetan government in exile—have agreed tentatively to a further round of dialogue in October. However, the Tibetans are concerned that in the absence of serious and sincere commitment on the Chinese government’s part the continuation of the present dialogue process would serve no purpose. The Tibetans have worked very hard to try to make sure that this process works, and they have indicated that at the next discussions they will attempt to progress negotiations by tabling at the October session a detailed plan for Tibetan autonomy.
       </p>
       <p>
        It really is important that the Chinese recognise that the world is not prepared to have the human rights of Tibetans overridden roughshod. We have a situation where Tibetans have been murdered.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chinese" rel="nofollow">
         The Chinese
        </a>
        are acting like a brutal occupying force and they are simply not recognising that Tibet is a nation.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Holiness" rel="nofollow">
         His Holiness
        </a>
        the Dalai Lama is saying that he is not seeking independence. Honestly, Tibet historically has been an independent nation, but His Holiness is prepared to work with the Chinese to seek a form of autonomy which would be satisfactory to the Tibetan people and, hopefully, satisfactory to the central Chinese government. But, unfortunately, the Chinese are simply not prepared to play ball.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have to make it very clear as a world community that we are not prepared to accept this continued prevarication by the Chinese authorities. We cannot accept a situation where Tibetans are murdered. We cannot accept that human rights in Tibet are somehow less valuable than human rights in other parts of the world.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Holiness_the_Dalai_Lama" rel="nofollow">
         His Holiness the Dalai Lama
        </a>
        is one of the most incredibly sincere people on earth. He is a person I greatly admire. He is a person who has made concessions to the Chinese authorities that he ought not to have been required to make. He is a person who is seeking the best for his people. We as a nation salute him. I call on the Chinese authorities to bring about real and meaningful change and to bring about sincere negotiation with a view to better outcomes for the oppressed Tibetan people.

         I second the excellent motion on Tibet moved by the member for Fisher. For 16 days last month we saw an unrelenting display of Chinese might—sporting, organisational and economic might. Unfortunately, the

         machine is also unrelenting in its verbal war with the leader of the Tibetan people, the

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGO" rel="nofollow">

         s to Western governments—and, perhaps more dubiously, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOC" rel="nofollow">

         —had high hopes that the world spotlight would pressure China to make some genuine steps towards a just resolution of the Tibet question.
        </p>
        <p>
         Amongst other governments who have raised the issue of Tibet with the Chinese authorities in recent months, as the motion indicates, the Australian government has been one of the most persistent—a fact I welcome. The Prime Minister, having already raised human rights issues in Tibet with China’s
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Hu_Jintao" rel="nofollow">

         The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acting_Prime_Minister" rel="nofollow">
          Acting Prime Minister
         </a>
         both met the Dalai Lama earlier this year. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has also called on China to respect the human rights of Tibetans, to allow greater access to Tibet and to engage in substantive dialogue before the end of the year.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Holiness" rel="nofollow">
          His Holiness

         the Dalai Lama had a highly successful function in Sydney with many new members of parliament when he was here in May.
        </p>
        <p>
         It seems that calls for dialogue and a genuine attempt at resolution of the Tibet problem have so far fallen on deaf ears amongst the communist regime in Beijing. On 7 August, on the eve of the Olympics,

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Kristof" rel="nofollow">
          Nicholas Kristof
         </a>
         published an article where he argued that he had found at a meeting with the Dalai Lama in June a more flexible and pragmatic position on the resolution of the conflict. Kristof argued that the Dalai Lama recognised that time was running out and was signalling a willingness to deal comparable to the way
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Nixon" rel="nofollow">
          Richard Nixon
         </a>
         sent signals to Beijing in 1972. According to Kristof, the Dalai Lama said he was willing to state that he would accept Communist Party rule in Tibet—something that Beijing has always demanded. In the words of the Dalai Lama:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The main thing is to preserve our culture, to preserve the character of Tibet. That is what is most important, not politics.
        </p>
        <p>
         So this influential tribune of liberal Western opinion, Kristof, said China should reciprocate. Unfortunately, the events of the last year have shown that the current talks between the communist representatives and the Dalai Lama’s representatives are not making progress. Kristof’s view was that direct talks between the Dalai Lama and either the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_President" rel="nofollow">
          Chinese President
         </a>
         or Prime Minister were the best way of ensuring that a deal could be reached.
        </p>
        <p>
         Important concessions from the Chinese might have been to issue residential permits to stop the wave of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Chinese" rel="nofollow">
          Han Chinese
         </a>
         migration to Tibet, to cease the restriction on monasteries and to allow the Tibetan language in government offices in Tibetan regions. Tibetan regions of China currently encompass several provinces. While the Tibetans have to concede their desire to create a central government, as Kristof suggests, a regional authority for Tibetan affairs could administer key aspects of life in all Tibetan areas, particularly education, culture and religion. This is the kernel of what would be a compromise. In terms of Tibetan concessions, the Dalai Lama said that he would play no political role after such a settlement and that other existing Chinese communist controls would remain in place. It would not be a one country, two systems approach, as exists in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong" rel="nofollow">
          Hong Kong
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         A successful deal would be beneficial to China’s reputation and the Tibetan people.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dalai_Lama" rel="nofollow">
          The Dalai Lama
         </a>
         is 73, and once he passes away a deal might be impossible as there is no Tibetan leader to unify the people behind such a plan. Frustrated Tibetan youth have in some cases already turned to violence against the Chinese. Prolonged repression along the current lines of China’s stance in Tibet without the Dalai Lama’s moderating voice is a powder keg with the potential to explode—in the form of greater violence and terrorism.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, despite the potential for such an outcome, the Chinese stance has so far been very disappointing. On 21 August, in the full glare of the Olympic Games, the English language mouthpiece of the Chinese government, the
         <i>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_Daily" rel="nofollow">
           China Daily
          </a>
         </i>
         , published a response to Kristof’s suggestions. Rather than seizing on dialogue or constructive criticism, they launched a tirade against the Dalai Lama in classic neo-Stalinist language, calling him ‘the so-called Dalai Lama’, ridiculing the fact that he talked through an American journalist et cetera, et cetera.
        </p>
        <p>
         I agree with the member for Fisher: let us hope against hope that, at the resumed October session of the dialogue between Tibet and China, the regime in Beijing realise that, at the end of their economic boom, the West will still be there pressing for Tibetan cultural autonomy and that the Tibetan people deserve the right, guaranteed under the Chinese constitution, for Tibetans to practise their religion and culture without interference from the communist regime.
