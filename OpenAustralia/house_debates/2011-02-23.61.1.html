        My question is to the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. The minister would be aware of a letter dated 6 March 2000—and I will seek to table it—which states, ‘The current milk price of 59c after deregulation will be 41c.’ Within two years of dairy deregulation, an Australian farmer was committing suicide every four days. Consumers did not escape either—retail prices ‘greedied up’ to 41c, with ‘piggy in the middle’ taking an extra $1 billion a year. Currently, Coles and Woolworths are offering milk at $1. This is facilitated by parties slaughtering farm prices down to 47c in

        and less elsewhere. Minister, don’t these realities prove that advocates for the free market in this place are loathsome hypocrites and that those parading themselves as

         I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. I think it is important to acknowledge that the member for Kennedy has been absolutely consistent in his objection to dairy deregulation ever since it was first introduced by a National Party minister at the time and, in fairness, introduced with the support of both sides of parliament at the time.
        </p>
        <p>
         It should be made clear, and I do have some information here from the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, that lower milk prices should not be at the cost of Australian dairy farmers. I am pleased that Coles have publicly confirmed that they are honouring their assurances that these price reductions would not drive down farm gate prices for dairy farmers.

           want to pretend that it was not their own leader who was the minister for agriculture when dairy deregulation came in, then go right ahead. I think that both sides should be consistent in acknowledging that the person who has been consistent in his objection to dairy deregulation is actually the member for Kennedy. I think that members of the National Party should just own up to that.

           , the managing director of Coles, has written to members of parliament and published in the media that, when Coles renegotiated milk supply contracts in January of this year, the dairy processors received higher prices. The government does expect that dairy processors pass these price increases back onto dairy farmers.
          </p>
          <p>
           The question also deals with some very serious issues relating to mental health situations in rural and remote communities. Mental health is an issue of deep sensitivity to all members in this House, and a major issue for Australians in any time of crisis—particularly in those areas which have been through natural disasters. We refer to cyclones and floods, but are all very mindful of what happened among the farming community in particular during the long period of the drought, and the member for Kennedy has referred to those issues directly.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Australian government does provide a range of initiatives and social support services for farmers. Front line service providers, including Centrelink’s rural service offices, are often the first point of contact for farmers or their families. They provide referrals to support services and to local social workers and specialists. The Australian government also has its National Suicide Prevention Strategy supporting suicide prevention initiatives at both the state and national levels.
          </p>
          <p>
           Those mental health issues leading to suicide are always incredibly complex. There are always a range of issues that can affect them, financial pressure very regularly being one of them. I acknowledge the support for those measures from members of all sides of the House, but also acknowledge the particular links that the member for Kennedy has made for a long period of time on that issue.
