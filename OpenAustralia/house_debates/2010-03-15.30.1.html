        My question is to the Prime Minister. It follows his previous answer telling the opposition to seek information through
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOI" rel="nofollow">
         FOI
        </a>
        . I remind the Prime Minister that late on Friday afternoon his department released extracts of stimulus plan progress reports provided to Minister Arbib during the second half of last year in his role as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Government Service Delivery. Can the Prime Minister explain why details of the home insulation scheme appeared more than 30 pages into the first four of these monthly reports but appeared on page 1 of the reports in November and December last year? Can the Prime Minister also explain why the report extracts released on Friday for November and December have been blacked out by his department to prevent their content from being disclosed? I ask the Prime Minister: what is he and what is his government trying to hide?

         I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I notice the questions on the paid parental leave revolution seem to have died on Tuesday of last week and after one question in question time today. The Leader of the Opposition asks me about the pagination of a report. I cannot comment on the pagination of a report. I cannot present on the order in which it is presented. What I can comment on is that, as Prime Minister of the country, I accept full responsibility for the problems which have arisen in the implementation of the Home Insulation Program, and the government intends to get on with the business of dealing with these problems in a practical way.
