        Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Project

        3029 Phase 2â€”Defence Space Surveillance Telescope Facilities Project.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        with the capability to identify space based threats. The facility will also demonstrate a commitment to closer space cooperation between Australia and the United States of America.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee has conducted an inquiry and is of the view that the project signifies value for money for the Commonwealth and constitutes a project which is fit for purpose. It is expedient to carry out the proposed work. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for once again undertaking a rigorous and a timely inquiry. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence in early 2015 and be completed by late 2016. I commend the motion to the House.

         Hamilton Island Airport
        </a>
        . The proposed works will include new fire tender bays, maintenance facilities, a fire control centre, office facilities, amenities and associated storage. The project is valued at $13.4 million, excluding
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        , which includes all development and delivery costs, management and design fees, construction costs, information communication technology, furniture, fittings and equipment, contingencies and an allowance for escalation.
       </p>
       <p>
        While the project is under the medium works threshold, I have agreed with the Public Works Committee's request that this project be referred for a full inquiry. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is scheduled to commence in mid-2015 and is planned to be completed by mid-2016. I commend the motion to the House.

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        This Department of Finance proposes to fit out the new leased premises at 1 Canberra Avenue, Forrest, in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Capital Territory
        </a>
        . The department currently owns and leases space in seven tenancies across the ACT. It is desirable that the department be located in, or close to, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Triangle" rel="nofollow">
         Parliamentary Triangle
        </a>
        so that it can provide crucial support to its minister and the Expenditure Review Committee of cabinet in the budget process. As a central agency the department has traditionally been located in the Parliamentary Triangle.
       </p>
       <p>
        The department's proposed fit-out of the new leased premises will provide capacity for the co-location of all of its ACT based staff, with the exception of COMCAR, and opportunities for significant benefits in relation to functionality, operating efficiencies and reduced administrative overheads.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finance has estimated that the total cost of the proposed fit-out will be $32.066 million plus GST, including builders' costs; consultant costs; furniture; fittings and equipment; and workstations. The co-location will support the department's business needs resulting in savings in property operating expenses and lost productivity due to travel between tenancies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subject to parliamentary approval, the proposed fit-out works are scheduled to commence by April 2015 with staged practical completion scheduled from 1 July 2015. I am sure the committee will undertake a rigorous inquiry into the project and I look forward to reading its report in due course. I commend the motion to the House.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cox_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
         Cox Peninsula
        </a>
        Remediation Project.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Finance is proposing to undertake remediation of contamination on sections 32, 34 and 41 on the Cox Peninsula,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        . The remediation project will involve the construction of a containment cell on section 34, which will then be used to store approximately 28,500 cubic metres of contaminated material, including asbestos from all three sites. Non-contaminated material will be recycled, as appropriate, at existing facilities in the Northern Territory. The project will address the risk of contamination to local bore water, which supplies the local population at Wagait with drinking water. Once concluded, the project will enable the land to be transferred to the traditional owners, as part of the long running Kenbi land claim, lodged in 1979.
       </p>
       <p>
        It will also minimise Commonwealth liability for contamination on Commonwealth land, which has resulted from its use over 70 years. The estimated cost of the project is $31.5 million, excluding GST. This includes the construction of the containment cell, collection treatment and disposal of waste, as well as escalation. Subject to parliamentary approval, the works are expected to commence in March 2015 and to be concluded by 2018.
       </p>
       <p>
        The wet season in the Northern Territory generally occurs from October to April, so remediation works to the Cox Peninsula will generally be concluded between April and October in each year for the duration of the project. I commend the motion to the House.
