       <p>
        It's been a very sad week for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geelong_Football_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Geelong Football Club
        </a>
        with the sudden passing of Vic Fuller. In an era of professionalism and in a win-at-all-costs environment, there is little room for sentiment within an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
         AFL
        </a>
        club. However, when you've been part of that club since 1975 and you've spent most of that time building friendships with the players of the day, it's easy to see why Vic will be so sorely missed. During my 10 years at the Geelong footy club, Vic was always there as a team manager, a match-day manager, interchange steward, water boy or doorman. It never worried Vic what his role was, but, if there was a job that needed doing, Vic would put his hand up and do it.
       </p>
       <p>
        The news of Vic's death will hit hundreds and hundreds of past players, as well as the current players, especially hard. He was a gentleman and he loved a laugh. He was a larrikin, and he leaves behind a wonderful family and a wonderful wife, Nola. In 2015, Vic was awarded the Alec Gillon award for his services to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VFL" rel="nofollow">
         VFL
        </a>
        football. In recent years, Vic would always be on the door, deciding who would come into the rooms before and after the games. This was fantastic for the past players because, as soon as Vic would spot you, he would usher you and your mates through to the rooms, always with a smile and a recollection of some funny story that was always slightly embellished.

        , has just said, 'We've lost the soul of our footy club.' Vic wouldn't agree with that because he would be far too humble and far too modest, but the Geelong footy club has just lost a wonderful, wonderful person.
