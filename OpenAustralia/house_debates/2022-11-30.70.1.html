        My question is to the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Social Services
        </a>
        . I refer to the minister's visit to Ceduna last Friday, where she confirmed that she witnessed firsthand the direct result of the government's policy to scrap the cashless debit card, which saw street brawls and a large number of intoxicated individuals arguing and fighting. Is this the tragic but predictable outcome for Ceduna because the government has scrapped the cashless debit card?

        <p>
         I'd like to thank the member for his question. I was very pleased to visit Ceduna last Friday, where I was able to engage with a range of different organisations and services to talk to them about what they needed going forward to make sure that they were supported and properly provided with services. One thing that was made very clear was that the council—I met with the mayor and other services—were very clear that they wanted a positive vision for Ceduna going forward. They wanted to make sure that I understood that there was a positive message in the town.
        </p>
        <p>
         So, yes, I was able to also speak with the police, and they made it very, very clear that they could not attribute antisocial behaviour that happens from time to time to the abolition of the card. In fact, I did want to pick out a little bit of misinformation. There have been a number of anecdotal comments and reports made—I understand that this is a very emotional issue—but we've got to deal with the facts when it comes to this issue. On one site there were reports of antisocial behaviour two days after royal assent—of an increase in the number of people sleeping rough in a particular town. Of course, no income or other changes had actually happened two days after royal assent, so that was absolutely inconsistent with the actual evidence.

           My point of order is on relevance. We are one minute and 45 seconds into this answer, and there has been no confirmation from the minister—

             What I did speak with a number of organisations about is what support they need to address longstanding issues in the community that have existed for some time.
            </p>
            <p>
             And I must say, if the member actually got out to Ceduna a bit more often, he might understand that on that day there was a funeral in town and there were a number of people that had come from outside the Ceduna area—indeed, from outside the five different communities surrounding. There were significantly high tensions and grief in the town. So it was a particularly sad day in Ceduna and the surrounding communities for this significant sorry business.
            </p>
            <p>
             I was also very pleased to be in town to deliver a commitment of $17 million for economic development in the town. This was money that the former government announced and never delivered, and I was welcomed in that town because we are delivering money to those communities.
