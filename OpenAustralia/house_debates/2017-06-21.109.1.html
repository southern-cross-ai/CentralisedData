        My question is to the Minister for Defence Personnel. Will the minister update the House on the progress being made for Australia to host the

         I thank the member for his question, and I know that he is a strong advocate of serving Defence personnel and our veterans. Today I had the great honour of announcing our team for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invictus_Games" rel="nofollow">
          Invictus Games
         </a>
         this year. They will travel to Toronto. I did that with the co-captains, Emma Kadziolka and Peter Rudland. It is incredibly moving that today is the seventh anniversary of the tragic
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hawk" rel="nofollow">
          Black Hawk
         </a>
         accident where we lost three commandos. During the press conference we paused, and I know I speak for all members of the House in remembering those brave commandos who lost their lives seven years ago. It is also truly inspirational because three of the commandos who were involved in that accident seven years ago were announced as members of our Invictus Games team that will go to Toronto in October, including Peter Rudland, who is one of the co-captains.
        </p>
        <p>
         We deal with issues in this House and we deal with trials and tribulations of life as they confront us, but to be there today with Emma and Peter, to hear about their stories and what they have been through and to see the way they are going about making sure that team will go to Toronto and represent us as a nation is—I know I speak for all members of this place—nothing short of what is great about this nation.
        </p>
        <p>
         We also spoke about Australia hosting the Invictus Games next year in Sydney. Some of us were lucky enough to be there—and I know there were members from both sides of the House there—when
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry" rel="nofollow">
          Prince Harry
         </a>
         came over to begin the countdown for the Invictus Games being hosted in Sydney. The Prime Minister was there and spoke eloquently following Prince Harry. He thanked him for his initiative in starting the Invictus Games and what it has led to in recognising those current Defence members and those veterans who will participate not only in Toronto but in Sydney.
        </p>
        <p>
         The competition for these spots is ferocious and fierce. I was lucky enough to have a go at the wheelchair rugby two weeks ago, and I can tell you they do not mess around once they get into the sporting environment. Every single one of those members who will represent us this year will do our country proud. I know I speak for all members when I say that we wish them the very, very best of luck.

           On indulgence I would like to join with the minister to congratulate those who have made the team for Toronto. I met many of them a couple of weeks ago at
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Admiralty_House" rel="nofollow">
            Admiralty House
           </a>
           , and they are a real inspiration to so many.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry" rel="nofollow">
            Prince Harry
           </a>
           spoke about the ferocious competition, but he also talked about the comradeship the team has together and the role that sport plays in the healing process. I certainly wish our team proud and I also wish those putting together the games in Sydney all the best. Both the team and the organisers have the support of this House, this parliament. We wish them all the best.
