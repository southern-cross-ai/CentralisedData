        On Saturday I read Ramsey’s column, surprised to find that I was its subject. Good manners, if not the journalists code of conduct, should have meant that Mr Ramsey contacted me. I have attempted to get a letter to the editor published in the
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Morning_Herald" rel="nofollow">
          Sydney Morning Herald
         </a>
        </i>
        but to no avail, so I take this opportunity in the Main Committee to set the record straight.
       </p>
       <p>
        I totally reject the theme of the article that I have failed to represent my constituents in the area of public education. Prior to being a member of parliament, I was on the initial advisory committee of the Mount Druitt
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        . I have seen it grow through eight expansions, and I am very proud of the contribution that that TAFE makes to my constituents. For the record, I was at the forefront of the campaign that resulted in the establishment of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         University of Western Sydney
        </a>
        , and I savour the memory of a Labor minister who, seven seconds into a conference on the matter, said that we would never get a University of Western Sydney.
       </p>
       <p>
        Together with my state colleague
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Amery" rel="nofollow">
         Richard Amery
        </a>
        and the then
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Premier" rel="nofollow">
         Deputy Premier
        </a>
        , I campaigned in my electorate to establish a senior high school. I very much regret that the Labor government did not implement it. The Greiner government did. It established the first-ever senior high school at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Marys" rel="nofollow">
         St Marys
        </a>
        . It is a wonderful institution that has reversed the drift from public to private and receives twice the number of applicants for the positions available. When the
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daily_Telegraph" rel="nofollow">
          Daily Telegraph
         </a>
        </i>
        ran the notorious front-page story on Mount Druitt High School, again a campaign was relaunched for a senior high school with my colleagues Richard Amery, the state member, and the late
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Anderson" rel="nofollow">
         Jim Anderson
        </a>
        , state member for Londonderry. It resulted in the Chifley College with its five member campuses—and it is doing very well.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Teachers Federation has viciously fought and resisted these initiatives, which have proved to be an outstanding success. Notwithstanding Mr Ramsey, I will continue to fight for education reform until such time as student outcomes match the potential of the youth in my electorate and I will not kowtow to the Teachers Federation. Whilst I would like to see more resources go to public schools in my electorate, I totally reject the Teachers Federation’s proposition that this should be at the expense of private schools in my electorate. Teachers unions in other states abandoned such ideas decades ago.
