        Limbs 4 Life is Australia's peak organisation for amputees and persons with limb difference. This month, they launched a new program—Limbs 4 Kids. For the first time, all Australian children and young people with limb differences and those who care for them have a program and a website to call their own—www.limbs4kids.org.au. It is a source of great information, contacts and resources for parents and healthcare workers who care for children and young people who are born with a limb difference or who have had a limb amputated during their childhood. The website features a learning centre, online forum, stories, videos, and

        magazine, together with networking and training opportunities.

        Australia is estimated to have over 2,500 children and young people with a limb difference. My beautiful grand-daughter Sarah Victoria is one of them. Sarah was born with a missing forearm as a result of the umbilical cord cutting off the circulation in-vitro. Sarah has not let this stop her in life. She is as active as any other child and enjoys riding horses and quad bikes. She is now 10 years old and wants to be able to ride a dirt bike like her father. She recently tried on her first prosthetic arm, which was very exciting and very successful. She got up for the first time recently with this new arm to ride a bicycle and now she is very confident to getting on these quad bikes. I commend the Limbs 4 Kids program and the Nib Foundation for its generous support.
