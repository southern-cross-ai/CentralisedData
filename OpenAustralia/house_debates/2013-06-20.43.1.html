       <p>
        I would like to acknowledge a very special member of the Macarthur community who was acknowledged in this year's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Birthday_Honours" rel="nofollow">
         Queen's Birthday Honours
        </a>
        . Jim Marsden, a proud local, received the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        for his service to the Campbelltown community. Not only does Jim have a long list of successful business achievements in his role at Marsdens Law Group, but the list of his contributions to and involvement in the Macarthur community is just as long. His contributions to the arts, sporting organisations and local bodies in Macarthur have been of great service in supporting essential social, economic, physical and creative aspects of community life.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jim has touched many through his involvement at the

        , Casula Powerhouse Arts Centre, Apex, the chamber of commerce and the Macarthur Economic Development Advisory Board. Jim has also demonstrated that he is always willing to extend a helping hand to a range of local organisations that exist to benefit and assist others in Macarthur. He has contributed time and expertise to

        . Just a few years ago Jim shaved his head for charity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jim's longstanding devotion to the Macarthur community sets a great example of the wonderful things that can be achieved when locals give back to the community. I feel very proud to have such a fine citizen in my electorate, and I admire the great advocacy work he does to make Macarthur such a great place to live. Jim, you are always putting your community before yourself. Thanks, Jim. You are a legend. Keep up the good work. You are an absolute champion.
