       <p>
        I wish to put before the nation the concerns of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goulburn_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Goulburn Valley
        </a>
        Water Action Group which has circulated a petition expressing ongoing concern about the objectives, processes and impacts of the Food Bowl Modernisation Project in northern Victoria. Mr Robert Danieli states on behalf of the action group that their petition has been signed by 829 concerned citizens from the small area in the Goulburn Valley around Kyabram, Stanhope and Tongala, but he also recognises that there is much wider concern from all areas reliant on irrigated agriculture throughout Victoria. The communities remain concerned that the plan to decommission or privatise half the channel supply system and the manner in which it is being implemented will have significant detrimental effects on the region's social and economic viability and the ability to produce food. They are also concerned that irrigators serviced by backbone supply channels will face massive increases in supply and service charges which will, in time, threaten their economic viability.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of major concern is that off-backbone irrigators and stock and domestic users may be forced to sign agreements called 'community water supply access agreements' with Goulburn-Murray Water that appear to be flawed and could lead to legal and financial disasters for those that sign. The Goulburn Valley Water Action Group therefore calls on the Victorian government to stop further decommissioning works, farm buybacks, dewatering of irrigated farms, the implementation of the above agreement and to concentrate on improving the viability of the irrigation system and the efficient operation of Goulburn-Murray Water in a manner which does not decimate the economic and social fabric of our communities.
