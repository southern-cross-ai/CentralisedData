        As I speak, family and friends are celebrating the life of 27-year-old Jane Bryant, a nurse from the

        who last week lost her battle against metastatic breast cancer, having made the most of every single day that she had. My thoughts are with them in their grief.

        trivia night fundraiser, there has been a big commitment to raising money for vital research and supporting people who are experiencing cancer.

        So often the people involved in raising funds and providing support have their own lived experience. And so it is for Jodie at Pink Finss, whose team of volunteers and health professionals now finally have a place to call home in Windsor. Women going through cancer treatment will have a safe, warm, nurturing space to go. I was thrilled to be at their opening. The Pendragons Abreast team are another example of inspiring women from the Hawkesbury, Blue Mountains and Penrith areaâ€”with a few blokes who come along for the ride supporting women with breast cancer. I know they share tears, but what you take away from any event with them is a huge feeling of hope. I wish them well at the international breast cancer survivor regatta in Italy.
