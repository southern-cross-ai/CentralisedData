       <p>
        This Albanese Labor government is deeply committed to listening to communities, supporting communities and partnering with communities and that is evident right around the country, particularly in my electorate of Kingston. I want to highlight a number of really important projects that are going along, funded in part by the federal Labor government.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to acknowledge that work has begun on the Hub Gymnastics complex. The Hub Gymnastics complex is a community club that is offering hundreds of young people, particularly girls and women, the opportunity to participate in their passion of gymnastics. The government has committed to partnering with both the state government and local council to see that facility really fit for purpose, to ensure that my community gets the best facility possible, so seeing that work start has been really important.
       </p>
       <p>
        My electorate has many, many kilometres of beach. I have
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_Life_Saving" rel="nofollow">
         Surf Life Saving
        </a>
        clubs that patrol the beach and make sure that people are safe, so I'm so pleased that work is beginning for the Southport
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_Life_Saving_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Surf Life Saving Club
        </a>
        's extra training and storage place in Waring Street. That facility will also support the Onkaparinga Canoe Club, which, once again, is a partnership with local council, with the Surf Life Saving Club and with the federal governmentâ€”a really important good investment.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have seen the opening of the Yellow Gate domestic and family violence prevention hub in the southern suburbs of Adelaide, a project that was campaigned for by the local community. We are really pleased to be partnering with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        government to make sure resources are available. This is a really important facility. It is at the Noarlunga shopping centre so that people have easy access to go and get advice, early intervention and, hopefully, prevention of family and domestic violence.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the weekend, we are going to have the first sod turning of the Witton Bluff pathway at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Noarlunga" rel="nofollow">
         Port Noarlunga
        </a>
        , joining Christies Beach and Port Noarlunga communities together. This is an incredibly important project. I have been campaigning for this for years. The community has been campaigning for this for years. There have been some stops and starts, but we are going to see that sod turn, and nothing will keep me away from that sod turn. It is an exciting project for our community, and I look forward to when our two communities of Christies Beach and Port Noarlunga are finally connected.
