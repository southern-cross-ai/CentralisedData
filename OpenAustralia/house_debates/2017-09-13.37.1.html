        Last week I hosted a group in Canberra who were taking part in the National Student Leadership Forum. I sponsored two students in Gilmore, Tori Jones and Emily Bristow. This forum is a wonderful opportunity to meet young leaders and everyday people who are making a difference. Thank you, Emily, Alan, Elle, Intisarul, Jakob, Rebekah, David and Jenny for joining the program. It was a pleasure to meet you.

        On Friday I had the opportunity to judge the Shoalhaven Art Society exhibition and see our local talent on display. The artworks were incredible and quite unique.
       </p>
       <p>
        I then visited St Georges Basin Public School's spring fair, which was terrific. Team Sudmalis shared a cupcake stall with the students. We handed out educational posters and colouring-in books, and cupcakes were sold for the school.
       </p>
       <p>
        The next visit was to Huskisson Public School where it was an honour to present the principal, Mr Sansom, and school leaders with organ donor jerseys. One of the leaders, Lauren, had previously asked for help in raising awareness for organ donation. She's a wonderful young girl with a bright future, and also a double lung transplant recipient of five years. I'm sure she will be encouraged with the help from her principal.

       <p>
        As I've been a strong supporter of the Nowra Jets, Carol also presented me with a thankyou certificate. They've worked hard and made a great success of the two blended teams.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Milton-Ulladulla Rotary business awards acknowledge a number of businesses down at the southern end of the Shoalhaven, and I commend each and every one of the businesses that were either nominated or became finalists. They are doing a fabulous job down there.
