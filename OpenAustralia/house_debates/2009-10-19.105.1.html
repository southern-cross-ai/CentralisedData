        On 15 October, I announced the 2009 Paterson Citizen of the Year Awards, which were presented by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Bishop" rel="nofollow">
         Julie Bishop
        </a>
        . It was fitting to acknowledge some of the unsung heroes in the Paterson electorate who assist so many people in their day-to-day lives. I would like to share with you a brief background of each of the category winners, outlining just a small sample of their extraordinary contributions and achievements.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2009 Paterson Citizen of the Year is Vacy resident Doris Brooker. Doris is a wonderfully generous lady, who for over 30 years has opened her home to small groups of women in isolated rural areas. These women, coordinated by Doris, make small craft items to sell to raise money for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Red Cross
        </a>
        . Doris served as president of Vacy Red Cross for 18 years, vice-president for three years, publicity officer for four years and has been the patron since 1991. An extremely selfless individual, Doris has always gone out of her way to empower the many women she comes across, assisting them to realise their own potential.
       </p>
       <p>
        Doris has also served as the secretary for the St Johns Anglican Church Ladies Guild and is very active in her local

        </a>
        branch, where she has been treasurer for approximately 30 years. An outstanding community member, 96-year-old Doris is an inspiration to everyone she meets. When asked why she continues to give so much back to the community she simply replies, ‘I do it because I love it.’ What a wonderful lady.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Paterson Young Citizen of the Year, Skye Bortoli, should serve as an inspiration to us all. It has been said that when Skye speaks, the world listens. Skye, a young teenage eco-warrior, has a list of achievements that any diplomat would be proud to claim. At the age of 11 she quickly decided on her primary goal: the protection of whales. Skye has been around the world in a bid to protect whales, visiting places as far a field as Japan, Chile and even Alaska. Skye has ensured that Australia’s anti-whaling stance is being heard far and wide. I congratulate Skye on her proactive stance and wish her all the best in pursuing her passion.

        The Corporate Citizen of the Year is the Tilligerry
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        Sports Club, which has been described as a small but friendly club that is extremely generous to all the groups on the Tilligerry Peninsula. As a very socially aware club the RSL often assists the Cancer Council, Torchbearers for Legacy and the RSL Women’s Auxiliary as well as its own theatre group. In the past 12 months the club has donated to Legacy,

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation_Army" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and the Port Stephens Rural Fire Brigade. A very big thank you goes out to everyone who in some way contributes to the RSL, as it is your contribution that assists the club to be such a wonderful community staple.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Paterson Sports Person of the Year, Callum Leahy, is an exceptional sportsman and outstanding competitor. His chosen sport is canoeing, in particular the slalom. This year Callum has competed in a number of competitions, including the Australian white-water championships in Tasmania, and I congratulate him on his continued dedication and commitment to achieving his personal best.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Paterson Young Sports Citizen of the Year, Allix Jones, is a true equestrian champion and endurance rider. At 16 years of age, Allix has been selected to represent Australia at the world youth championships and has competed overseas. She is one of just five riders selected. She has been riding for over 10 years and Allix regularly competes in a range of distances, including the 160-kilometre endurance rides. This accomplishment is the first step in realising her dreams of one day representing Australia at the

         Summer Olympic Games
        </a>
        . Congratulations, Allix—I have no doubt that you will conquer all that you set out to achieve.
       </p>
       <p>
        An honourable mention also goes out to the finalists: Lynette Batterham, Reverend Frank Duffy,

        and Shane Illgen. It goes without saying that each of the finalists and winners of the Paterson Citizen of the Year 2009 awards is a truly exceptional person who was nominated for their outstanding contribution to their local community. I thank them all for making Paterson a better place in which to live and also thank those who live in the electorate and are committed to assisting others but have not been mentioned. To selflessly assist others is a truly noble gesture.
