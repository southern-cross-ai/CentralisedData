        I wish today to pay tribute to 21 remarkable Australians, local residents from my electorate of Wentworth, whose contribution to our nation was recognised as part of the

         in senior management and command roles; Greta Moran AO, for distinguished service to the visual arts through philanthropic initiatives and as an advocate for Australian art and artists, and to the aged-care sector; Gretel Packer AM, for significant service to the community and to the visual and performing arts; the Hon. Graham Richardson AO, who is well known here, for distinguished service to the people and the parliament of Australia, and as a political commentator; Ryan Stokes AO, for distinguished service to business, particularly in the media, mining and construction sectors, and to cultural institutions; and, lastly, Raymond Whitten AM, for significant service to the law, particularly to legal reform and consumer protection. Our country is a more culturally rich and prosperous country, and my community is a safer place, because of the efforts of these Australians, and the efforts of so many other Australians who serve our community every day. I congratulate each and every one of them.
