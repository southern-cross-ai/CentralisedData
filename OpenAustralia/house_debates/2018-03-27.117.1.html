        I present the report of the delegation to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
         Papua New Guinea
        </a>
        in November of last year and seek leave to make a short statement in connection with the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        Having spent a large number of years working and living in Papua New Guinea, I was pleased to return with the delegation in November. I would like to thank the members of the delegation, including Senator Ian Macdonald, our delegate leader; Senator Kimberley Kitching; and the member for Herbert, Ms Cathy O'Toole. I thank the delegation secretary, Julia Agostino. I thank officers from the

        , and representatives from the Crawford Business School at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANU" rel="nofollow">
         ANU
        </a>
        , for some pre-delegation briefings. I make special mention of His Excellency the

         High Commissioner
        </a>
        , Mr Bruce Davis, for his support, and his staff who helped the delegation throughout the trip.
       </p>
       <p>
        The delegation arrived on a landmark day for

        , the national Rugby League team, were victorious. It was a great opportunity to meet many ministers, who celebrated the victory with us and the guests from the High Commissioner. We had the pleasure not only of meeting parliamentarians but also significant administration people in PNG.

        Our group attended a very productive meeting with the
