       <p>
        I want to refer today to the good work of not just the schools but also the school committees and boards within the electorate of Flinders. In particular I am delighted to be able to announce to the House 17 Investing in Our Schools grants, which I have only just received notice of, for primary and secondary schools within the electorate of Flinders. I think these are tremendous rewards in recognition of the work done by these primary and secondary schools.

        </a>
        received $142,000 for a building extension. Bayles Regional Primary School, a small school at which the staff do a tremendous job, received $144,000 for building refurbishment and extension. Bittern Primary School received $82,000 for a range of activities. Cowes Primary School, which suffered a catastrophic fire only a small number of years ago, received $149,000 for playing field development. Dromana Secondary College got $150,000 towards an upgrade of the oval, which will be used as a community sports facility and in particular as a synthetic running track, and I think that is an outstanding outcome for

        , the principal, and for the students, parents and community around Dromana Secondary College.

        Eastbourne Primary School received $150,000 for a hard court playground and classroom upgrade. Lang Lang Primary School got $142,000 for a shade structure, playground equipment and sporting infrastructure, and as it is a rural primary school it is extremely important that it has full support and these community services. Mount Martha Primary School received $85,000 for music and building construction. Osborne Primary School received $32,000 for airconditioning, furniture upgrades and pathways. Pearcedale Primary School received $100,000 for classroom construction. The Peninsula Special Development School, which does such wonderful work for children with disadvantages, received $79,500 for hall refurbishment and sporting equipment. Rosebud Primary School received $122,000 for airconditioning and walkways. Rosebud Secondary College received $150,000 to contribute towards the Performing Arts Centre refurbishment, which is an outstanding community asset. San Remo Primary School received $69,500 for building refurbishment and playground upgrade. Summer School Camp received $61,000 for play equipment. Tooradin Primary School got $106,000 for the playground redevelopment, airconditioning and heating, and Tyabb Railway Primary School received $95,500 for grounds and building upgrade. Next round we will look at those other schools that have not yet been successful. Congratulations to all 17 schools involved. $1.8 million, and each of them deserves the grant. They do a fantastic job.
