        Teenage driver Nikky Youngberry completed a sensational passing move to steal the show at the Castrol Edge Lismore Speedway on Saturday night. Youngberry took out the junior sedan feature race after shocking the

        champion, Brady Haynes, in the run to the chequered flag. Haynes looked on track to win the event but Youngberry pulled off a spectacular inside pass to snatch the lead just five metres from the line.

        finished third. It was the first feature race win for Youngberry, who is in her third season of competition.
       </p>
       <p>
        While Youngberry was notching her first win, veteran driver Mick Santin claimed another win in the wingless sprint car division to move into the lead in the Driver to America series rankings. But it was not all smooth sailing for Santin, who was forced to navigate his way from the rear of the field after an incident with rival Mick Reid left his car idle on the track. Regulations dictate that any car that stops on the track but can still continue the event goes to the rear of the field for the restart. Santin delivered a magnificent drive through the field to claim victory from

        The 25-lap wingless sprintcar feature race was also not without incident. Seven laps into the event, Mitchell Randall made a move on the inside of David Eggins. The pass proved costly, with Eggins forced to watch the rest of the race from the infield after the front end of his car was damaged. Trent Disson was also sidelined by the incident. Eggins and Kevin Willis lead the points score at the end of the heats with 39 points each, ahead of Warren King on 38, and Mick Reid and Mitchell Randall both on 37. Meanwhile, Jamie Usher walked away uninjured after a ride on the wild side in a wingless heat race. Usher ran over Adam Bailey's rear wheel and launched his car high into the safety fence at near full speed.

        Litre Sprints made their first appearance of the season during Saturday's race meet and did not disappoint. Former Lismore junior Kurt Wilson set a blistering pace from the rear of the field in the feature race. Wilson moved from the rear to third in seven laps and into the lead two laps later. Wilson is the holder of nine track records at the Lismore circuit, which is more than any driver on the current Australian speedway scene. The father and son team of Glen and Ethan Eyears filled the minor placings.

        Nationals again turned on excellent racing and Geoff Hayes headed into the feature undefeated with three wins in the heats.

        , however, took out the main event from Queenslander Luke Geraghty and Lewis Gamble. Ford driver Nick Chilcott had a night to remember in the Production Sedans, winning three heats and the feature in a very impressive performance.

        driver Luke Watt took out the four-cylinder sedan feature race. I congratulate all involved in what was a very entertaining night.
