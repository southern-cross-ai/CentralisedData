        It is always wonderful to stand in this place and recognise some of the wonderful efforts of those in our community. I think we would all recognise that 70 years is a long time. It is a lifetime for many people. For two of the great constituents in the electorate of Forde, that is the number of years they have been husband and wife.
       </p>
       <p>
        In a wonderful display of what married life really means, it is interesting to reflect on history. I think many new husbands today would find it difficult to reconcile that shortly after they were married, Mr Luther was sent off to serve in World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . That was just one day after they were married on 17 February 1945. He served in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and spent two years in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        before he was finally reunited with his wife and his married life. Sadly, there are not enough of this kind of good-news stories. I think it is an opportune time to reflect on the wonderful commitment that Mr and Mrs Luther have shown each other over those 70 years. I would like to congratulate them on a wonderful milestone. I hope that it continues for many years to come.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to take this opportunity to reflect on the wonderful work that the Chambers Flat Rural Fire Brigade have done in flying to Perth recently to help battle some of the bushfires in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        . The volunteers from this fire brigade were among 82 Queensland firefighters who travelled across the country to assist those local firefighters. I thank the members of the Chambers Flat Rural Fire Brigade for the support they have shown to fellow Australians, particularly to those facing extreme difficulty.

        In other great news from our local electorate more than 100 locals have got new jobsâ€”with the opening of a new shopping centre at Loganlea. The centre includes a Woolworths, which is employing some 90 people. One of our great local business families, the Lane family, have opened their fourth
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_Club" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        store in Logan, employing an additional 20 people.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately I was unable to attend the official opening last week, but I am sure I will visit the centre regularly. I know the Lane family and their wonderful Coffee Clubs always do a great job looking after people in our community and providing a place for people to catch up, have a coffee and spend some time relaxing in the busyness of life.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are blessed in our community with a wonderful group of people who volunteer and contribute so much. We thank them for their wonderful efforts.
