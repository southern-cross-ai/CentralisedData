        I recently attended the annual ball of the Kids of Macarthur Health Foundation, a locally based organisation which essent­ially raises money for the local community. In a period of 12 years they have raised $2 million from their efforts and each year they contribute $250,000 between Camden and Campbelltown hospitals. Also, they created the children's gardens at Campbelltown Hospital, updated the training of medical employees and raised money towards community health centres. Under the leadership of Bruce Hanrahan they have managed, with the support of Bottlemart, Macarthur Travel, various clubs in the region, Woolworths and the

        </a>
        of Narellan, to become a very strong organis­ation.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the cultures of the Campbelltown region which I have not previously witnessed is an attitude that money raised within the region should stay there. The Macarthur area is very separate and endeavours there should go to local purposes, thereby engendering far more local support. The latest venture is to build a charity house which will later be auctioned. This project has had help from Fairmont Homes and Dart West Develop­ments, who are basically doing things at cost. There is also significant support from some volunteers in the region.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was interesting at the function to hear from Professor John Whitehall, the new professor of paediatrics at the Western Sydney University—and the creation of a medical faculty there is a major step forward for this institution in gaining national recog­nition. Again I commend the Kids of Macarthur Health Foundation, a locally based organisation doing worthwhile things in the community.
