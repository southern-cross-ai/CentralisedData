        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development. Will the Deputy Prime Minister update the House on how the government is continuing to invest in water infrastructure across Australia, particularly in my electorate of Herbert?

         I thank the member for Herbert for his question. What a fantastic inaugural speech he made last sitting week. He's going to make such a great contribution to not just his own electorate but indeed the nation. It's an important question he's asked today. It's about water investment. Investing in more water infrastructure right across the country is a top priority for this government. It's been far too long since we built a dam in this nation, and we will build dams to build water security, drive economic prosperity and create jobs right across the nation.

           I hear a raucous cry from those opposite. They are not interested in dams, Mr Speaker. I would hope that the enthusiasm they are showing carries across to their state Labor counterparts.

             I hope they show the same enthusiasm, Member for Watson, as you are in this place.

             During the election campaign, we made a commitment to provide more secure water for Townsville. The difference between that side and this side is that when we say we're going to do something we do it. We get on and we do it. The government will fully deliver on its commitment to provide up to $195 million for the construction of stage 2 of Townsville's Haughton pipeline project. That's what we'll do. That's what the member for Herbert fought for, and that's what he will deliver. He will deliver, because he is a doer. He is a builder. That's why he's on this side of the House.
            </p>
            <p>
             It means jobs, jobs and more jobs—indeed 700 jobs during construction and up to 30 ongoing roles once completed. The Townsville Haughton pipeline means that the agricultural channel will not be needed for urban supply as this channel capacity can be made available to irrigators to grow more food, to grow more fibre, to grow the local economy and to grow local jobs. It will boost the value of ongoing agricultural output by up to $3 million a year. That's a significant investment into Townsville and into the overall electorate that the member for Herbert represents.
            </p>
            <p>
             We're also delivering the $180 million Hughenden irrigation scheme. It's a project that has the potential to establish the town located between

              Mt Isa
             </a>
             and Townsville as a new frontier in growing crops, such as grapes, as well as producing high-value cattle.
            </p>
            <p>
             Reliable water is something our regions need. They want and, most importantly, deserve it. Only last week I attended
             <i>
              The Daily Telegraph's
             </i>
             Bush Summit in Dubbo in the member for Parkes' electorate with the Prime Minister. Farmers there made it very clear to us that they want dams. They want pipelines. They want water infrastructure. They want to heighten, lengthen and strengthen weirs. That's why we're getting on with doing just that. We put half a billion dollars into the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund last year. Those opposite are not interested in regional Australia. They're not interested in water infrastructure. It shows every day of the week.
