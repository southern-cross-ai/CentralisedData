        On Sunday, 21 February 2010 I visited the Kingsway Junior Football Club registration day. The Kingsway Rockets provide boys and girls from the Landsdale, Darch and Madeley suburbs an opportunity to play Australian football. I understand that between 450 and 500 young people have registered, with 200 just for the Auskick program for five- to eight-year-olds. I know that there will be teams for year 4s and year 5s, a team for 11-year-olds, a team for 12-year-olds, two teams for 13-year-olds and teams for 14-, 15- and 17-year-olds. A strong club, the Kingsway Rockets are in their 11th year. I pay tribute to the strong support provided by the Kingsway Football Club, the senior club. I also met the senior club’s president, Jayson Bennett. In speaking to members of both clubs, it was clear to me what a strong relationship the senior and junior clubs have. The committee of the Kingsway Rockets is led by President Gavin Oliphant. The vice-president is

        . Ian Brotherton is the junior vice-president,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Carter" rel="nofollow">

        is the secretary, Ray Buscall is the registrar, Sharon Southall is the treasurer and Craig Nylander is the coaches’ coordinator. Beyond those main positions, there are a great many people helping with the day-to-day running of the club, including coaches, managers and volunteers who have been getting the job done over several years. The oval at Kingsway Sporting Complex is undergoing some modifications and, when it is completed, I understand that it will be able to host visiting
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">

        clubs for training sessions. It is a big oval, the same size as Subiaco, and lights will make it an excellent and much sought after ground.
       </p>

        I quickly gained the impression that the Kingsway Rockets are going well and have an even greater future ahead of them. The benefits in health and fitness for local young people cannot, however, be achieved without dedicated volunteers. I therefore thank Gavin Oliphant and his dedicated team of volunteers, past and present, for adding great value to the community.
