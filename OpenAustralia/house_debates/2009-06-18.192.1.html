       <p>
        I rise today to inform members of the progress of the delivery of infrastructure projects to the residents of my electorate of Robertson through the Rudd Labor government’s economic stimulus plan. The electorate of Robertson has been for many years an area of rapid population growth. The accompanying growth in demand for community services has not been matched by the provision of community infrastructure. The Nation Building Economic Stimulus Plan introduced by the government has set out to redress this lamentable backlog in infrastructure provision.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased indeed to report to members that Robertson is currently benefiting from a massive infrastructure boom as a result of the stimulus plan. At present there are 635 local projects already announced under the plan that are currently being delivered to the people of Robertson. This represents one of the biggest ever injections of funding in my region. This rollout begins the process of building local projects that are vital to the proper functioning of our community. Of equal importance, however, is the massive boost it provides to the economic activity of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        . This economic stimulus means jobs for local small businesses, tradespeople and contractors who work, live and raise their families locally. The plan is helping to protect the Robertson community from the full impact of the global recession by investing in local infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p>
        It should be remembered by all members that nearly 70 per cent of the economic stimulus plan is being invested in infrastructure. In my electorate this includes building roads, social housing and much needed community infrastructure projects such as new parks, playgrounds, upgraded community halls, better sporting ovals and club facilities. The most beneficial aspect of this historic funding measure for Robertson is the enormous number of renewal projects underway in our 43 schools. This is part of the largest school modernisation program in Australia’s history and is transforming both the physical and the educational landscape of the Central Coast.
       </p>
       <p>
        The figures for new community infrastructure projects currently underway in Robertson are also impressive. I have already mentioned that there are 635 projects being rolled out at the moment. This represents a direct investment by the government of more then $76 million in my electorate alone; something that is being replicated all around Australia. $42.5 million is being provided for 18 Robertson primary schools under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_Schools" rel="nofollow">
         Primary Schools
        </a>
        for the 21st Century program, part of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BER" rel="nofollow">
         BER
        </a>
        . This program is now building new multipurpose halls; covered outdoor learning areas—vergolas; new classrooms; and new libraries to equip our students for the future. The remainder of our primary schools will be upgraded under the future rounds of this program. An additional $7 million is being delivered to each of the 43 primary and secondary schools under the National School Pride Program to provide much needed repairs and maintenance.
       </p>
       <p>
        Social housing is another feature of the stimulus plan that is impacting in a real and positive way in Robertson. Seventy-three new social houses were built locally and 476 dwellings are undergoing repairs and maintenance in our local community. Backlogs in basic community infrastructure are also being attended to. Gosford

        has received a total of $4.428 million to build local community infrastructure. More than $1.3 million of this funding is being invested in nine projects across the electorate that will refurbish and rebuild our parks and playgrounds and provide state-of-the-art sporting facilities for the families of Robertson. The remainder of this funding to the council, more than $3 million, will see the building of the Peninsula Recreation Precinct. This will be a world-class, multiuse sport and recreation facility that will address a real need for families in Robertson. A total of $905,000 has also been delivered to make the roads of Robertson safer under the Rudd government’s

        road funding.
       </p>
       <p>
        Meeting the challenges of climate change has been a priority of the Rudd Labor government. Our homes are being made more energy efficient through the measures contained in the stimulus package. The package provides households with up to $1,600 for home insulation and for solar hot-water systems. To date some 84 applications have been made for insulation and another 232 applications have been made for the solar hot-water rebate.
       </p>
       <p>
        These are just some of the highlights among the 635 stimulus plan projects the government has delivered to Robertson. The plan is transforming schools, roads, housing and community infrastructure in Robertson.
