        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his comment yesterday in the context of a strike by Qantas staff and a sixfold increase in strike action since the election of a Labor government: ‘We will watch this closely.’ Prime Minister, how will watching strikes reduce the inconvenience and disruption to airline passengers?

         I am aware that Qantas’s licensed aircraft maintenance engineers took protected industrial action on Monday, 23rd, and that further protected action comprising work stoppages and overtime bans has been notified for today, Tuesday, 24th, and Friday, 27 June. This action has been taken as part of collective agreement negotiations between the licensed aircraft maintenance engineers and Qantas.

             this action is occurring under the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act that were passed by the previous government. That is the first point. Furthermore, I understand from reports that there is no dispute, that the work stoppages have been notified in accordance with the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act and therefore this industrial action is lawful and protected under that act. This is ultimately a matter that can be determined by the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Industrial_Relations_Commission" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Industrial Relations Commission
             </a>
             under the law if that becomes necessary.
            </p>
            <p>
             As I said yesterday in the House, when it comes to the impact of this and other factors on the tourism industry across Australia it is important for this government to engage in appropriate forms of further advertising Australia as a desirable international tourism destination. That is really important. I ask those opposite to reflect seriously on their campaign, ‘So Where the Bloody Hell Are You?’ In every place I have visited in the world, that campaign has been basically described as an absolute rolled gold disaster. I think those opposite should reflect on their expenditure of government funds on a campaign which did not yield a significant benefit to the Australian tourism industry.

                This government is now seeking to re-examine that because Australian tourism deserves better than that which the honourable member up the back there gave to us when she was minister for tourism. That campaign was a rolled gold disaster. I am talking about the research upon which this campaign was actually engaged. This is a major industry for Australia; it deserves considered and reasonable and substantial support from government over time. We will be doing that. As an interim measure we have done that in part in
