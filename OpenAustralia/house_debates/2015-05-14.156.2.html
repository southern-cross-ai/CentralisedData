        Sixty-three tests; 2201 runs at 24.45, including three test centuries; 248 test wickets at 27, including a best return of seven for 72—the figures do not really compare with what happens in today's busy test cricketer's life. More than that, they do not speak to the nature of the play, the aggression and the thought that he put into his game and how he changed the game for the better.

        I have played some rugby in my day. I was never any good but I also judge all things sport by how it was perceived by me as a young person, playing the game I loved. The difference between me and Richie Benaud, apart from talent and dedication, is that he never looked at the game from the perspective of what it was like in his day. He marvelled at a young Tendulkar. He spotted
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Lara" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        as this wristy left-hander and told everyone how great this boy would be. He saw

       </p>

        I always wanted to ask

        . Richie played with both Miller and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Davidson" rel="nofollow">
         Alan Davidson
        </a>
        , and all three were great all-rounders for our country, but none had the absolute brilliance of Miller. I wanted to know who he would pick in his team out of Davidson and Miller, knowing full well it would be Miller, but to have him explain to me what it was like to be on the field with this man would have been something. I will now have to wait until I get an interview with

        Watching the documentary of the West Indies tour of the 1960-61 series versus Australia is an insight into the man and the competitor that was Richie Benaud. He was never in awe of batsman, the man, but respected the greatness of his cricket. We all know now and look back on this tour with the romanticism of a game reborn. The likes of

       </p>
       <p>
        We remember with great fondness the tied test in Brisbane—this magnificent game of cricket. When Bradman came down to congratulate Richie on what was a first for test cricket, and something that would see the coffers of the

        swell to overflowing, Richie lamented that it was a game that got away that they should have won. Oh, how I love a man who loves to win.
       </p>
       <p>
        You cannot discuss the life and times of Richie Benaud without mentioning his sense of humour.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Birmingham" rel="nofollow">
         Billy Birmingham
        </a>
        , the twelfth man, has been on the commentary team for over a generation. You would swear by Richie's deadpan manner and the professionalism with which he always did his job that this was a serious man, devoid of a sense of humour. I am told that in a room of very strong personalities, he knew exactly what to say and when. He did not have to say a lot; he just knew what to say and when to do it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Richie Benaud and I could never have been friends. He always said the secret of great commentary is knowing when to say nothing—and there are a few of us in this place who could learn a thing or two from him in that respect.
       </p>
       <p>
        Summer will never be the same without him. But I reckon Richie would just say that his place will be taken by someone else sooner or later and that he would wish them all the best. I think that he would be up there now talking with
