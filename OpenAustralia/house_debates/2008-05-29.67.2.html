       <p>
        On pages 46 and 47 of yesterday’s
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        there is a record of events that occurred after the suspension motion for the member for O’Connor. The member for O’Connor would have been due to return to the House at about 2.14 pm this afternoon, as I understand it. I first of all apologise for two things. You will find at the top of page 47 I got a little carried away with myself and used the royal ‘we’ in saying:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We will deal with him when he returns.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also apologise for making the Chief Opposition Whip’s task in keeping the member for O’Connor in town a bit more difficult. But, upon reflection of the events following the decision of the House, it would have been my intention to indicate to the House that I would not be taking any further action. At the time, the member, in progressing out of the House, made comments that I believed to be a reflection against the chair. It was on that basis that I sought that he return to apologise. After further consideration, I understand that it was not a reflection on the chair. There is therefore a lesser transgression that occurred—that is, the member for O’Connor did not go quietly! But I explain to the chamber that, if that had been the case, I would have applied standing order 271, which applies to common sense: I would have ignored his comments and let him go, and there would have been no record in the
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        . I do not see this as a precedent—and I hope that others will not undertake to use it as a precedent—but I believe that, to my mind, this suffices to conclude this incident.
