        I rise today to highlight an exceptionally brave individual from my electorate of Dawson: former warrant officer class 2

         Keith Payne

        , VC, AM. A born-and-bred north Queenslander, Keith dedicated his entire life to serving our nation and was one of only four Australians awarded the

        as well as the Vietnam War.

       <p>
        While serving in Vietnam in 1969 and commanding the 212th Company of the 1st Mobile Strike Force Battalion, Keith and his men came under heavy mortar fire and rocket fire. Filled with adrenaline, Keith ignored the shrapnel that had become lodged in his skull, arms and hands from a hand grenade burst. His company isolated and surrounded, Keith's only thought was getting his surviving men out safely. Ignoring his severe injuries, Keith ran across exposed ground, hurling grenades and firing his gun in an attempt to save his troops. For the next three hours, at great personal risk and in the dark of night, Keith searched tirelessly for the remaining members of his scattered unit, managing to avoid heavy fire. He miraculously rescued 40 men. With the area now heavily dominated by enemy forces, Keith bravely led his unit back to his base. It was no surprise that, on his return to Australia, his bravery was acknowledged, and Keith received the Victoria Cross from Queen Elizabeth

        Settling in Mackay and traumatised by active duty, Keith turned to helping fellow veterans and their families, especially those suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder due to their military service. I also acknowledge the tremendous advocacy work for veterans in my electorate of Dawson. Keith Payne's story is an inspiration to us all. Due to Keith's advocacy, he secured an election commitment from the previous coalition government for $5 million to go towards veteran and first responder wellness in Dawson and neighbouring Capricornia. I call on the Labor government to please support this very important project.
