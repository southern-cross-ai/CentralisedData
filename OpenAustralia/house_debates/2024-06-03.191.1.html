        The Filipino community is one of the fastest-growing communities in western Melbourne. There are almost 100,000 people with a Filipino background in Victoria, and that number has increased by 13,000 since the last census. The Filipino Community Council of Victoria Incorporated is based in my electorate and is very active in Fraser. The FCCVI is integral to building a strong

        I was very pleased to host senior leaders from the FCCVI and other members of the Filipino community in

        Recently, in the Filippino community's TaxSmart Cafe's Best of the Best awards, in which there were six awards for social entrepreneurialism and leadership, Roxanne received the award for Business Mentor of the Year for her selfless support of others. She has long been building up others in her community to help her in providing critical services for that community. I look forward to the next FCCVI event, to celebrate the 126th
