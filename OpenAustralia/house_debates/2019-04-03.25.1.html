       <p>
        How do you judge the contribution that you have made in this place? It is not by numerical standards, such as the number of speeches, or by the rank you attain or, indeed, whether you table the world's largest petition or deliver the first speech in sign language—both of which I have done. Nor is it by column inches, by the power you accrue, by the power that you or your faction attains or, indeed, the success of your political party. All of these things may be achieved, but real results can only be measured by their impact on people and on our nation, and, may I say, are best judged by others.
       </p>
       <p>
        First, let me acknowledge the honour and responsibility the electors of Ryan granted me. From a national population of now more than 25 million, they elected me to be one of only 150 Australian citizens entrusted to serve in the House of Representatives. As the 31st female coalition member elected to the House of Representatives from Queensland, and only the sixth Queensland female coalition government minister since Federation, some 118 years ago, I feel immense pride in having served my constituents and my nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Almost nine years ago I stood in this place, although on the other side of the chamber, next to my friend and colleague the member for Bennelong, as I do today, to deliver my maiden speech. My principles and beliefs have not changed since I first joined the Liberal Party as a junior member in 1968. I believe in the individual and that by empowering the individual we will unlock the potential of our society. I believe in maximising individual rights and minimising government intervention in the marketplace. That is why I sought election in the first place, to serve the people of Ryan.
       </p>
       <p>
        With election comes enormous responsibility: a responsibility to make decisions in the best interests of all Australians and our nation. It sounds dramatic, doesn't it? And so it is. At a time when people are disillusioned with mainstream politics and are tempted by demagogues and at a time when people, particularly younger Australians, are no longer joining political parties, it is important that they know that we do seek to govern in their best interests—that we do not regard politics as a winner-takes-all contest, with the winner being a major party and not the people of Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I came to this place from years of real experience: raising a family, building one of Queensland's largest event management companies and, then, spending 10 years as a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_City" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane City
        </a>
        councillor. My business experience taught me the importance of a strong economy, that you are only as good as your staff and that our economy depends on successful businesses. I digress briefly to congratulate the government for delivering an outstanding budget for all Australians last night. As the Treasurer said, small businesses are integral to every local community. My experience also taught me that individuals are the cornerstone of our economy, be they staff or employers.
       </p>
       <p>
        So, what does this mean to my role as a member? It means that I cannot be a mere delegate for my party. I must exercise my judgement in this place, in my party room and in my community. My time as a councillor on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane City Council
        </a>
        reinforced the importance of people in communities when it comes to achieving outcomes. While I can lay claim to significant achievements, there is nothing quite as rewarding as helping an individual, a family or a community group. As I have said many times in this place, we are so fortunate in Ryan to benefit from the invaluable contribution of so many dedicated volunteers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Federal government is an unwieldy beast and frustratingly slow when it comes to getting things done. I reflect on the many cases where I, and others alike, have raised the need for change. Years later, we are still working our way through committees, reviews and consultants. We must do better. We must, as a parliament, recognise that delays in this place ultimately limit the ability of ordinary Australians to conduct their daily lives and achieve their aspirations. Every day, as the member for Ryan I have fought to deliver local projects as well as funding for medical and other research at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         University of Queensland

       </p>
       <p>
        There are a number of issues that have occupied my time in federal parliament. Of all portfolios, the area of disability services highlights our responsibility to help the most vulnerable in our community. I thank
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull" rel="nofollow">
         Malcolm Turnbull
        </a>
        for his trust and confidence in appointing me as Assistant Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Social Services
        </a>
        and Disability Services. The National Disability Insurance Scheme has the potential to deliver, but it is crucial that we get it right sooner rather than later. The reason the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        is needed is the very reason it is so difficult to deliver: everyone is different and requires complex support services. Time-consuming and challenging, it is also a remarkable example of what a bipartisan approach can bring to our political discourse. However, it is still a work in progress and a massive task, with much to be done. The potential rewards are life-changing for Australia's most vulnerable, who are least able to support themselves. I am disappointed that I did not get to finish the job, but I appreciated the opportunity to meet so many amazing people with challenges in their lives far greater than I hope to ever face. It does put things into perspective at times.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my first speech, I spoke about defence. I did so from a background of my great-grandfather, Sir George Pearce, Australia's longest serving defence minister; my late father, Alan Righetti, a World War

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIMPAC" rel="nofollow">

        in the middle of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Ocean" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific Ocean
        </a>
        , and most recently with the 1st Signal Regiment at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallipoli_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
         Gallipoli Barracks
        </a>
        . My visit to Afghanistan was both confronting and rewarding. It provided me with a firsthand insight into the numerous challenges facing our troops. These observations, whether in peace or war, could never be achieved with even the most detailed briefings or white papers. I strongly recommend the ADF Parliamentary Program to all my colleagues. In an increasingly challenging region where international law is sometimes ignored, the importance of our Defence Force cannot be underestimated.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I have said before, we must not take our Pacific neighbours for granted. We must work with them to strengthen our region. As Minister for Foreign Affairs, the member for Curtin bolstered ties and directed our aid to focus on support for the empowerment of women and girls, and for health and education. And I congratulate the Prime Minister and Senator Payne on the announcement of the $2 billion Australian Infrastructure Financing Facility for the Pacific. But we cannot rest; there is still so much more needed. And we must work smarter. There are, for example, outstanding
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGO" rel="nofollow">
         NGO
        </a>
        s such as the remarkable
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YWAM" rel="nofollow">
         YWAM
        </a>
        and the community ranger program organised by the wife of the member for Leichhardt. Other
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGOs" rel="nofollow">
         NGOs
        </a>
        should take a leaf out of their books—practical, hands-on services where they are most needed. I am often torn when I hear and see the inconsistency of approaches in the Pacific by some well-meaning NGOs. This is not to say that their intentions are flawed, but we could achieve so much more by everyone working together. Australia's role in the Pacific has long been a beacon, a friend, and a neighbour who can be called upon at any time. The clear message to our Pacific neighbours is: we have your back.
       </p>
       <p>
        But as a friend our relationship can also be strengthened through the provision of accurate and timely reporting of current affairs that affect our region. This in turn leads me to call for the reinstatement of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">
         DFAT
        </a>
        Australia Network contract for the ABC's Asia-Pacific broadcasting services.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_ABC" rel="nofollow">
         The ABC
        </a>
        has a charter obligation to provide international services. This is best achieved by having in situ correspondents in our region to report and engage directly. Sean Dorney was a quintessential ABC correspondent who worked for decades to inform Australians. Whilst Brexit and President Trump have dominated our headlines every morning for more than a year, Australians are genuinely interested in our near neighbours. It is of the utmost importance that honest reporting and news services are afforded to the people of the Pacific. We need to replicate Sean's inspiring independent journalism.
       </p>
       <p>
        As part of the Asia-Pacific family, we are always ready to support our neighbours through the tough times. But we also need to speak up when our friends do the wrong thing. We cannot continue to ignore the human rights abuses in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Papua" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Obama" rel="nofollow">

        said so well when he addressed a joint parliamentary session in this chamber:

        —security, prosperity and dignity for all.
       </p>
       <p>
        As with our politics, our nation is built on a remarkable history—history not always well recorded. In 2010, the great promoter of the Dig Tree, Dr Denver Beanland of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Historical_Society" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Historical Society
        </a>
        of Queensland, encouraged me to take an interest in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Archives" rel="nofollow">
         National Archives
        </a>
        . I have been honoured to represent the coalition on their advisory council for the last eight years and have served with some remarkable colleagues from all over Australia who are committed to preserving the history and records of our country. Whilst we trust and rely on the National Archives to store the memory of our nation, we must support and fund them in the new digital age. The digitisation of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" rel="nofollow">
         World War II
        </a>
        records is in great demand. But it doesn't happen by magic, and there are many other records urgently requiring restoration before we lose them forever.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_National_Archives" rel="nofollow">
         The National Archives
        </a>
        , a foundation institution, must be supported.
       </p>
       <p>
        Clearly, I am disappointed to be leaving in this way. Contrary to misleading stories at the time, there was no deal. Impatient ambition, treachery and lies are now more than ever part of our political fabric. For the only response to be, 'Oh, come on, that's politics,' is actually very sad. It is also sad that we are increasingly seeing candidates and elected members whose primary focus is not a desire to serve their communities but to serve themselves. Personal ambition seems to be replacing an ambition for our nation. As
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimi_Hendrix" rel="nofollow">
         Jimi Hendrix
        </a>
        , of all people, said, 'We won't start to do better until we turn the love of power into the power of love.' We need members who understand what it is to start and run a business—representatives like the member for Forrest and the member for Hinkler, who know what it is to put their livelihoods on the line. As the Treasurer said last night, like so many small-business owners, they know what it is to start early and finish late—people who manage the front desk and the back office, people who pay their workers first and their wages last. We need members who understand small-business owners, whose families also go without. And the coalition last night delivered for these people in the budget.
       </p>
       <p>
        We need members who understand that every new piece of legislation invariably introduces yet more regulation and red tape that strangles and chokes enterprise and entrepreneurship. Good government is not about politicians; it is about the people we represent. When government fails, the most vulnerable in our society suffer. There is a growing distrust and cynicism in our community when it comes to politics, a frustration made worse by internal division. There is a yearning for the clarity and unity of John Howard's broad church. In this place we should not be constrained by short-term political necessity. It is, in essence, the responsibility of this place to govern for the longer-term betterment of Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are so many people I wish to thank—people who inspired me, people whose wise counsel was so necessary when my heart would overrule common sense and people who, by necessity, were so often the interface between me and my electors. I recognise my colleagues on both sides of the House and in the other place. While we often take a swipe at one another and interject across the chamber, we remain committed to our constituencies. Our views, policy and political beliefs are often at odds with one another, but we do find similarities in our equally important commitment to doing the right thing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let me not forget my appreciation for the work of the press gallery, which includes many friends.
       </p>
       <p>
        Every member in this place is supported by a range of both personal and parliamentary staff. As I said previously, a member is only as good as the team that supports them. I want to place on record my appreciation to the many dedicated workers in this building, who ensure everything runs smoothly and who support our many demands and idiosyncrasies. I thank the Clerk and the Serjeant-at-Arms and their officers and, indeed, all the parliamentary staff.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most importantly, I want to pay tribute to my staff. I would like to recognise the contributions of all those who have worked in the many capacities, both paid and voluntary, needed to facilitate my time as both the Member for Ryan and the Assistant Minister for Disability Services. To all my staff past and present: thank you. Your support and guidance, even when I wandered off track on occasion, was invaluable. We had many robust discussions and disagreements, but your input was essential. There are too many to mention individually today, but I will single out those here in the chamber—my first staffer, the forensic Luke Barnes; the ever tolerant Tristan Bick; and my long-serving manager, Christine Cahill, who has been an integral part of my office. I also thank my ministerial staff for their tremendous support in a challenging portfolio—David, Tony, Annabel, Michael, Ruth and Rohan. And I give a special call out to Max.
       </p>
       <p>
        I believe I have done my best for my constituents and for my nation. I must thank my constituents and the wider Ryan community for their trust and support through these past nine years. To those who have reached out since my preselection: thank you for your kind words of support.
       </p>
       <p>
        And, finally, my family: in a job that involves the complex life of a public figure, in this case a member of parliament, family is both support network and a haven from the slings and arrows of outrageous social media fortunes. Like all families, we've had our challenges during these years. I have lost my father and my mother-in-law. My sister survived a life-threatening health challenge. On the upside, I have gained a wonderful daughter-in-law, two fabulous grandchildren and, in keeping with the idiom of 'if you want a friend in politics', two fur family members of the kelpie variety—Rocky and Nyssa.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ian, Mum, Caitlin, George and Eboney, Katy and Peter: thank you for your unconditional love and for the backup. Zara and William: Nonna hopes that you will continue to believe that your
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        is a very special place and that one day you might carry on the tradition of service, gifted to you by five generations of your family, beginning with the very first parliament of our nation.

         Mr Speaker, I also seek to speak on indulgence. In the world of politics it's not always possible to express a farewell message. I'm pleased that I have such an opportunity. After 5½ years of serving my community, I want to say thank you for the unique experiences that have been part of this unusual life journey. Being any kind of leader in any aspect of social fabric is about service—at least, that has been my priority for many years.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would like to start in an unusual place, and that is to thank the cleaners, the security men and women and the House attendants, whose collective service to this place is amazing. Luch, you deserve a special mention for the unending supply of glasses of water 'on the house'. Thanks for that gesture of friendliness. It has been appreciated. The team in Aussies, especially Bridget, knows my coffee better than I do. This is a welcome addition every day, often more than once, and their friendly service is such a plus.
        </p>
        <p>
         I reread my maiden speech just to make sure the goals I set were not completely unrealistic. Those targets were put in place by an idealistic woman, and that was me. I had no complete understanding of just how difficult advocacy can be. Together with input from the community, we have had a great run in Gilmore. Almost all of my targets have been met and many more achieved to make living in Gilmore just that much better.
        </p>

         Roads and youth unemployment levels have always been priority issues—not enough of the first and too much of the second. Well over $250 million has been delivered for roads and transport infrastructure, and youth unemployment has been brought down from almost 30 per cent to hovering around and sometimes below 10 per cent. Only a government that has financial responsibility as the guiding principle can get such results.
        </p>
        <p>
         When the Prime Minister,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Morrison" rel="nofollow">
          Scott Morrison
         </a>
         , was Treasurer, I cannot tell you how many times I heard the words: 'We're not changing the envelope. If you need investment for projects, go and negotiate with the relevant ministers.' It's my true belief that the Liberals and Nationals are best placed to keep a sensible approach to the budget for Australia. I'm old enough to have endured Labor-driven recessions that we 'had to have' and interest rates of 17 per cent while trying to make ends meet with mortgages, business loans and employee wages, and I'm pretty sure that's why I stand with the Liberal and National members of parliament, because we do know how to keep Australia financially strong, with a long-term vision.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, as this is most likely my last chance to put on record just how hard my government and I have worked to deliver for the people of Gilmore, let's just recap on some of my favourites. Because I've never been one to fully exploit these achievements, this will be the formal record of my work and the efforts of those living, working and serving in the Gilmore community.

         In 5½ years, over $2 billion has been invested, building on a similar amount under the previous member for Gilmore, Jo Gash. Some were tiny amounts, but changing accident-prone intersections throughout the electorate, from roundabouts in the Nowra CBD to the

         —those are examples of improvements. There is still more to do, but it's improving in every quarter. The funding for the Tomakin roundabout was a massive injection of $3.4 million, making everyone very happy, locals and tourists alike. And, finally, we've had $25 million invested and committed to match the state funding for the

Their passion and advocacy inspired me to push hard for their projects. That was so too for Anne Minato at Muddy Puddles for children with developmental difficulties. Then of course there was

That vision was almost interrupted by a Queensland MP, who wanted the Helicopter Aircrew Training System in his electorate. This was the first of many projects where my tenacity paid off, and we kept that project—keeping hundreds of our locals and Navy personnel employed in the Shoalhaven. Over half a billion dollars have been invested in the base already, and there are significantly more to come. I never did get the hang of all the acronyms; I would've needed a book the size of the Webster dictionary!

         Speaking of Vince Di Pietro, he has become a friend and was integral in igniting my passion for the work done at Triple Care Farm, a drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility for youth in the northern sector of Gilmore, now the outstanding location of a detox unit, due to the investment of $2 million by this federal government—thank you, Greg—to complement the funds already raised by the Sir David Martin Foundation. Triple Care Farm is making exceptional headway for lost youth and distraught parents. In fact, this model rehab facility is the inspiration for a Triple Care facility to be established in Cairns and another in Batemans Bay for rehabilitation. These are not just promises but commitments by this government. They will change the lives of these young people who are seeking to take a different direction in their journey of life. I thank the Sir David Martin Foundation, Gabriella Holmes,

         Many of my local Indigenous organisations have prospered and grown during the last five years—the Waminda women—especially with the behind the scenes support of Raj and Sophie Ray, the families and workers at Cullunghutti, and especially the Jerrinja, with their growth and self-pride youth training initiatives and exploration of their natural skills as saltwater people. The number of young Indigenous year 12 students continues to grow each year and they make everybody so proud. I was particularly pleased when I was made aware of a title deed hurdle for Jerrinja and I was able to resolve this for them, leading to marine-culture ventures, eco-tourism, residential expansion and, above all else, employment and training for our Indigenous youth.

         The injection of the $20 million job package into regional development has been transformational for productivity, employment and innovation. From dairy to engineering, to training and botanic gardens, from aquaculture to airport expansions, this has been terrific and I compliment every participating business for their efforts. They have all paid off. I wish to thank all our small business owners for their vision, growing the local economy and employing more people, and my government for investing so well in this region.

         Unemployment in Gilmore, particularly for youth, has been stubbornly high. This is absolutely not the situation now.

         -National government has delivered in every respect and plans to continue this after the next election, given the chance by a well-informed voting public. Yet the local media has said very little about reduced unemployment. In the early years they were quick and strident in their criticism. I guess good news just isn't newsworthy.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, today should be a celebration for the people of Gilmore striving to make things better for the local people. It has been my driving force. It is my belief that each of us in our different roles has the ability to inspire others to be the best that they can be, whether this is in media, business, politics or parenting. We have a responsibility to inspire for good. I thank the journos who share this ethic—and they know who they are. I'm glad there are more of them than those who dwell in doom and disaster. I am reminded often by a quote now pinned on the wall in my office. It has been helpful when I see the wrong actions of others. In the words of

She is practical, talented, no-nonsense, funny, loyal and a great friend. We have been bound as mates since the first time I laughingly told her about a house I door-knocked where I could distinctly hear the clip-clop of horse's hooves inside the house and a whinny as I trod on the verandah. That horse was her pony and it had broken the back door to the neighbouring house, also owned by the family and unoccupied at the time. We have so many funny stories that have occurred since then—like seagull splats on fish and chips and adopting three-legged goats. They just go on. I think we'll write a book—

They have an uncanny knack of knowing just what strategy will work best during a campaign. That included getting rid of bats in Batemans Bay—thank you, Greg Hunt; tempering and, in some cases, insisting on subtle changes to my campaign media that made a softer landing and a better effect; helping to fundraise; and booth worker lists. And, before I forget, thank you to every single booth worker, permitter of signs, person handing out shopping lists and to-do lists and all the other related activities of keeping my

         So what else have I learned while being the representative of a community of over 150,000? Well, firstly, be careful where you doorknock, dodge the horses and, when informed that there are residents with guns in a particular street, dodge that street too. True story! Learn to walk, not rush, in trying to get to meetings and deadlines. After several falls, I have tallied three broken toes, two bruised ribs and a break in the main shin bone after launching myself and crash-landing on my knee when trying to get to a photo shoot for the Princes Highway funding. It's a pity I didn't realise it was broken; the pain over Christmas may not have been so bad!
        </p>
        <p>
         In this hurly-burly world of politics, the best part is the work you can do for single cases where bureaucracy has complicated the circumstances and where, as the MP, you can help unravel the barriers. I will never forget a village visit at Wandandian, a very small village in my electorate, where a community transport bus pulled up and a single person stepped down, clearly not in good health. Her problem was that she had gone into hospital for bypass surgery—I could see the top of the scar; she had died during the operation, been revived, experienced kidney failure during that period and now she had dialysis three days a week, hence being on the community transport bus. She'd been chatting to the driver and said she'd been refused access to the disability support pension and didn't know what to do next. The driver had seen my flyer advertising my visit to Wandandian, so he drove to the village and said, 'Go see her.' A single phone call to the minister's office and a quiet demand to have the situation resolved before 10 o'clock the following day, with back payment to be calculated and deposited, made the difference for that woman. She rang me in tears of joy the next afternoon. These are the wonderful memories that make all the other rubbish of being a member of parliament worthwhile. I don't look at my Facebook anymore and I know I'm not alone in that.

         I would like to thank some of the women MPs and senators for their inspiration, dignity, political leadership or words of friendship and genuine encouragement:

         The electorate of Gilmore is named after Dame Mary Gilmore, a teacher, a poet and a woman with social justice ethics. She was born in

         in 1865. Ninety years later, I was born. I have social justice ethics, I was a teacher and I am a poet. One of the more stressful events while being an MP surrounded my citizenship, so I have taken a couple of lines from Dame Mary Gilmore's poem called 'Nationality'—it seems a natural fit—and I have followed on with my own lines. She says:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I have grown past hate and bitterness,
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I see the world as one;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         But though I can no longer hate …
        </p>
        <p>
         I have added:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I see my daughter and my son
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         As equals in the future world
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Where each of us is valued as part of our cultural whole
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Where our conscience, efforts and ambition reflect the goodness of our soul.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         For fifty years ago, which seems so very far,
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We girls were wearing mini-skirts and yelling 'burn the bra!'
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         And yet we still don't have equality in any field I know
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         And the gap between you blokes and us just simply seems to grow.
        </p>

         When men and women see compassion as a reflection of moral courage, when we shed tears and we're not judged for doing so but recognised as having the ability to share experiences and reach out to others, when we all realise that empathy is the energising force that helps make a difference for others and when we search for news and views from different sources and evaluate from many sides, then we'll be the unpolluted ocean of humanity that will be the better way forward for our sons and daughters and grandchildren. Then our extended families will be part of a social fabric that connects, reconnects, shares and cares, offering help while not inferring that if someone accepts your help then they are somehow weaker. When we can do this in our families, in our towns and perhaps, dare I say, even in our nation, we will be so much better than we are—for these are the strengths of women, and these strengths are needed.
        </p>

         I remain an idealist. I consider others as being essentially good—well, at least most others. I'm still working on some, but I'm only human!

         Finally, I will finish by saying thank you to everyone for the rare chance to be in this place and serve the community. I recall a phrase which had less meaning in my youth and a lot more meaning now. It was one of my dad's: 'I was complaining about my journey until I saw my sister walking with no shoes; I was complaining about my shoes until I saw my sister with no feet.' I've changed the gender in that phrase because I want young women to think into the future of their 'sisters' and their journey. While in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA" rel="nofollow">

         , I met a woman who is part of the 50x50 group—advocating for fifty per cent of leadership positions to be held by women by 2050. I sure hope it happens around the world before then. I'll be 90 years old and that's way too long to wait.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the meantime, I look forward to the next chapter of my life—a time line from daughter to mother to teacher to sweet manufacturer—everybody knows about my fudge business—to volunteer in India to politician. I wonder what will be next, though I am grateful for the journey so far.
