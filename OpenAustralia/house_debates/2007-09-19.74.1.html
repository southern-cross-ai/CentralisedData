        On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on

        , I present the 10th, 11th and 12th reports for 2007 of the committee, which relate to

         CSIRO
        </a>
        co-location with the Queensland government on the ecosciences and health and food sciences precincts, Brisbane;

       <p>
        Ordered that the reports be made parliamentary papers.
       </p>
       <p>
        by leave—The committee’s 10th report relates to a proposed co-location of CSIRO ecosciences and health precincts with those of the Queensland government, and in this sense represents an important strategic alliance between the Commonwealth and the state of Queensland. It will have the effect of harnessing the extensive research being undertaken—by the CSIRO, by scientists of the Queensland government’s Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries and Department of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_Resources" rel="nofollow">
         Natural Resources
        </a>
        and Water and by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_Protection_Agency" rel="nofollow">
         Environmental Protection Agency
        </a>
        —and avoiding duplication of research. The new facility will enable the CSIRO to dispose of three sites on which it occupies buildings that are currently over 40 years old and that will require significant Commonwealth funding for refurbishment and modification to meet the basic scientific and safety requirements of the CSIRO. Furthermore, these properties are dispersed across the Brisbane metropolitan area, with buildings fragmented across the individual sites, precluding the opportunity to realise benefits from the critical mass created through the co-location of CSIRO divisions and its scientific collaborators.
       </p>
       <p>
        By electing to co-locate, there is considerable potential for financial savings to accrue to the Commonwealth not only in terms of the avoidance of the need to maintain buildings that do not meet acceptable standards but also through the capacity to co-locate a critical mass of scientific research with the capacity to deliver the best return on investment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new facility is to be constructed on a cost-share basis with the Queensland government meeting the majority of the total cost of $371.23 million. The estimated cost to the CSIRO is expected to be $85 million. This will be derived from the sale of three properties with the balance coming from CSIRO capital funds.
       </p>
       <p>
        I turn now to the committee’s 11th report, which relates to the proposed
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF_Base_Amberley" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF Base Amberley
        </a>
        redevelopment stage 3 project. These proposed works build on works undertaken in previous stages of the redevelopment of RAAF Base Amberley. Stage 1 was the subject of a committee report to parliament in 1998 that addressed a general upgrade of facilities needed to enhance operational, training, aircraft maintenance, logistics support, improvements to engineering facilities and the demolition of redundant facilities. Stage 2 was the subject of a committee inquiry in 2005 that focused on the development of facilities associated with the introduction into the ADF of new multirole tanker transport aircraft and other related infrastructure works.
       </p>
       <p>
        The current works reflect the changing operational requirements of RAAF Base Amberley. It has recently been announced by the government that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FA" rel="nofollow">
         FA
        </a>
        18F Super Hornet bridging air combat capability will operate from Amberley from 2010. Amberley also supports elements of the strategic lift capability with the introduction of the multirole tanker transport aircraft and the C17, about which I will have more to say shortly.
       </p>
       <p>
        New training accommodation, a new headquarters building for the Combat Support Group, the provision of additional fuel storage facilities, an upgraded RAAF Security and Fire School, the rationalisation of maintenance facilities and the demolition of some facilities that are now inappropriately located are some of the works proposed.
       </p>
       <p>
        While the committee recognises the importance and the need for the current project, it is equally important for Defence to recognise the need to ensure that projects of this magnitude take into consideration the range of issues that have a bearing on the wider community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee was particularly concerned to ensure that Defence address a number of issues related to the provision of infrastructure services associated with the sustainability of the base. These include water and power. While the committee is satisfied that the department will exercise responsibility in terms of water consumption and energy use, we have asked that it report to us in due course on the measures it has implemented to conserve the use of water and energy.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposed works will have some impact on the local community. The Amberley state school that will be brought within the proposed new medium security fencing will need to be relocated, and a new school will need to be provided. Recently, the Prime Minister announced that the federal government would contribute $26.8 million toward the cost of a new Amberley state school to replace the existing school. Other issues affecting the local community are the subject of ongoing consultations with various community groups by Defence and will hopefully be resolved. The committee has requested that Defence keep it informed of the progress of these consultations.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee has recommended that these proposed works, to be undertaken at an estimated cost of $331.5 million, proceed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I would like to address a few words to the committee’s 12th report, relating to the C17 heavy airlift infrastructure project. Works for this project will be undertaken at RAAF Base Amberley,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF_Base_Darwin" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF Base Darwin
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF_Base_Edinburgh" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF Base Edinburgh
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF_Base_Pearce" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF Base Pearce
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF_Base_Townsville" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF Base Townsville
        </a>
        . The decision to acquire four
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C17_Globemaster" rel="nofollow">
         C17 Globemaster
        </a>
        aircraft was taken by the government in 2006. The first two of these aircraft are already in service, with the remaining aircraft due for delivery in February and March 2008.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee considered the proposed works as ‘repetitive works’ since the nature of the project is similar at all bases. The works largely involve the strengthening and widening of runways, taxiways and aprons, to take into account the weight of the aircraft as well as the increased payload it is able carry, and some modifications to cargo-handling facilities. The exception is the proposed works at RAAF Base Amberley, which, because it will be the home base for the new aircraft, will need to incorporate additional features, including new and larger warehousing and cargo storage facilities, an aircraft simulator, a new headquarters building for No. 36 Squadron, which will operate the aircraft, and additional training facilities for load masters and maintenance crews.
       </p>
       <p>
        Until the new facilities are provided, some of the previous redevelopment works associated with RAAF Base Amberley will be shared with the multirole tanker transport aircraft. At those bases identified as deployment bases, tests are currently being conducted on the strength of existing airstrips and taxiways so that operations of the C17 are able to continue, albeit at less than full operational capacity.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee has recommended that the works associated with the C17 heavy airlift infrastructure at RAAF Base Amberley, RAAF Base Darwin, RAAF Base Edinburgh, RAAF Base Pearce and RAAF Base Townsville proceed at an estimated cost of $268.2 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        In conclusion, I would like to thank all those who contributed to these inquiries, particularly my fellow committee members, who have made themselves available to try and clear away a considerable amount of work, officials of the CSIRO and officials of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Defence
        </a>
        . I would also like to thank the committee secretariat for their assistance and, of course, Hansard, who travel and keep a record of our meetings as we go.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the reports to the House.

           Mr Deputy Speaker, this will be the last opportunity for me to express the appreciation of opposition members, so I do so. I concur with the member for Pearce that the three reports before the parliament are, indeed, worthy of support. I again emphasise the very valuable contribution by the secretariat and, indeed, Hansard.
