        More than 1,600 jobs were on offer at Townsville's jobs fair hosted in the electorate of Herbert earlier this month. That equated to around four jobs per person for the people who came through the doors. These jobs fairs are a fantastic government initiative which aims to bring together employers and employees, connecting them with job opportunities. Jobseekers not only had the opportunity to meet with potential employers but also took part in workshops and were able to receive individual support to help them brush up on interview skills and resumes. It was pretty encouraging to see a lot of younger jobseekers walking around in suits and ties, looking at the jobs board and going over and speaking to potential and future employers.

        At this event, it was really good to speak with businesses that are looking for staff. It was good to see the people out there wanting a job, asking: 'What are you looking for? What do I need to do to be competitive to get this job?' I think it's pretty encouraging to see jobseekers out there at the jobs fair asking what the employer wants. It was good to get employers to look at resumes and say: 'Have you thought about explaining this better? Have you thought about explaining that better?' I think that's what we need to be doing, especially in my electorate, to be able to get these 1,600 jobs filled. These were skilled and unskilled jobs, but there were jobs for everyone, and I encourage job fairs to be active around the country.
