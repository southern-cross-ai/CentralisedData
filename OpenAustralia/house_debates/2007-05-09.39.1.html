        My question is directed to the Treasurer. Is it the case, Treasurer, that over the last 11 years government investment in education has fallen from two per cent of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
         GDP
        </a>
        in 1995-96 to 1.6 per cent of GDP, even after the measures announced in last night’s budget?

          I am sorry, there are traps for middle-aged players. I have heard this being recounted on radio over and over again. Let me put the facts on the table. Australian government expenditure on education has increased by 38 per cent in real terms from 1996 to 2007. What the honourable member for Lilley has been unable to fathom, and the Prime Minister explained it to him in the answer to the last question on this, is that Austudy was absorbed into
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_Allowance" rel="nofollow">
           Youth Allowance
          </a>
          in the 1998-99 budget and thereafter Austudy—which was about $1.5 billion and had previously been classified as an education outlay—was classified as family and community services outlay. If you add in that $1.4 billion that moved classifications then in fact you do not get that decline at all. A modicum of research would have actually disclosed this to the opposition. But the opposition is not worried about research; the opposition is more worried about tomorrow’s headline.

             The claims made against the budget have gotten more and more shrill as the last 24 hours have proceeded. First of all we were warned that we should not cut taxes; and now these are tax cuts that were required for working people. We were warned that we had to invest in education; and then when we invest in the biggest build-up of education ever it is not in the right areas. We were warned that we had to have investment in road and rail; and when we have investment in road and rail it is in the wrong areas. If you want to run a $1 trillion economy, you have to get up early and you have to do some work—and that is what the member for Lilley cannot do.

              <p>
               I thank the honourable member for his question. Last night I announced cuts to income tax for all Australians—for all Australians that pay income tax. We will do that in two stages. In the first stage, we will lift the threshold for paying 30c in the dollar from $25,000 to $30,000, and in the second stage we will lift the threshold for the 40c rate from $75,000 to $80,000 and the threshold for the 45c rate from $150,000 to $180,000. All Australians get an income tax cut as a consequence of that. For those that are on average wages—between $40,000 and $50,000—this will be a tax cut of $16 a week. That will be helpful for families, it will improve work incentives and it is consistent with our policy.
              </p>
              <p>
               The shell press release that the Labor Party delivered to all its candidates has been sent to me, and I will table it in a moment. I am pleased to see that it starts off as follows:
              </p>

              </p>
              <p>
               That is good. That is in the shell press release that the Labor Party has put out. It continues:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               “Make no mistake, all

              </p>
              <p>
               How do you like that? You have got a cynical shell press release which accuses the government of cynicism. You have got to say it has chutzpah. As
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Burns" rel="nofollow">
                George Burns
               </a>
               famously said, ‘Sincerity is everything. If you can fake that, you’ve got it made.’ Cynicism is everything, and, if you can cynically accuse someone of cynicism, you have got it made. There is the shell press release. That is about all the work that the Labor Party did on the federal budget. I table it and will take further questions from that shell press release.

                My question again is to the Prime Minister. It refers to my earlier question where I asked the Prime Minister to confirm whether Budget Paper No. 1 disclosed that education spending as a proportion of total government expenditure will fall from 7.7 per cent in 2005-06 to 7.4 per cent in 2010-11. Prime Minister, I refer to your answer to my question where you said that it was based on the wrong premise because it failed to take into account the different treatment of Austudy back in the late nineties—which had nothing to do with my question at all. Prime Minister, will you in fact answer the question I asked you, which is a future comparison about your government’s commitment to education outlays, not the answer that you gave me before which is about the past.

                 By reminding the Leader of the Opposition of what I said in answer to his first question—it has been validated and supported by what the Treasurer has said—the truth is that the provision made for education in this year’s budget represents a historic turning point in supporting all levels of education.

                  My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Will the Deputy Prime Minister inform the House how the budget will deliver the infrastructure that Australia needs into the 21st century? How does this compare with previous funding?

                  <p>
                   I thank the honourable member for Hinkler for his question. As he has been for some considerable time the chair of the House of Representatives transport committee, I know that he takes a great deal of interest in investment in transport infrastructure in Australia for today and into the future.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   As the Treasurer has indicated, the budget is about locking in future prosperity in the Australian economy and capitalising on the work that has been done in this country over the last 11 years. There is no aspect of the budget that is more important than the investment in future transport infrastructure in Australia, particularly in our roads and rail networks. Giving certainty in all the areas that we participate in funding and giving certainty to funding partners, both at state and local government level, is well into the future. Last night’s announcement in the budget by the Treasurer that we would be committing $22.3 billion to the second stage of
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AusLink" rel="nofollow">
                    AusLink
                   </a>
                   funding for road and rail infrastructure in Australia is a historic increase and a historic commitment to that infrastructure investment in Australia.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   We have invested $15.8 billion in AusLink 1 and $22.3 billion in AusLink 2, if you want to call it that. A 41 per cent increase in AusLink 2 will take the total 10-year investment of this government in land transport infrastructure to $38 billion—$38 billion over a 10-year period. Part of the budget announcement includes $15.8 billion on the national roads network—significant funding to start planning and detail work on rail infrastructure in Australia. We are already investing and we need to continue to invest. We need to continue the economic growth that is delivering the prosperity that we have in this country and we need to lock that in into the future.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Put very simply, the programs that are contained within AusLink build better highways, safer highways and more efficient highways across the nation. They improve local roads, so mums and dads taking their kids to school are much safer. They build safer roads in local communities. They build road and rail systems that will be more efficient in getting our exports to marketplaces across the world. These are serious investments that secure the future prosperity of the Australian economy. As I indicated, we have funding partners in this. We have arrangements with the states and with local government. We expect those arrangements to share the costs and the risks. Commonwealth taxpayers are not going to carry the burden of all the risks. We need to engage with the states. We need to have a serious discussion with them about how this $22 billion will be delivered in the future.

                  <p>
                   There have been some very interesting comments on last night’s budget from some interested observers—and from some who have not always been supporters of this government, I might add. The first quote is from a press release from the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRMA" rel="nofollow">
                    NRMA

                    New South Wales
                   </a>
                   . The president of the NRMA, Mr Alan Evans, said:
                  </p>
                  <p class="italic">
                   This strong investment in Australia’s road network is key to sustaining a growing economy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   He went on to say:
                  </p>
                  <p class="italic">
                   Tonight’s budget is great news for motorists, businesses and industry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The Australian Trucking Association—obviously an organisation that is very interested in the infrastructure investments of the future in Australia—said:
                  </p>
                  <p class="italic">
                   We applaud the Australian government on its commitment to land transport.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   It went on to say:
                  </p>
                  <p class="italic">
                   This is a clear sign the Australian government is listening.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   That is absolutely right. We are working with industry; we are consulting industry. We are also working with communities to address their infrastructure needs in their local areas. I say again: this investment in infrastructure, in the future of Australia, is all about locking in the future growth and the future prosperity that we expect to see in the Australian economy.

                     My question is again to the Prime Minister. It refers to my two previous questions of the Prime Minister. It relates to the government’s outlays on education as a proportion of total government outlays, and it compares government outlays in 2005-06 against those in the government’s own budget papers for 2010. Again I ask the Prime Minister: will the Prime Minister make reference to his own Budget Paper No. 1 and, to table 3 in statement 6 of the budget papers, and confirm to the parliament whether or not outlays on education as a proportion of total outlays go down over that period?

                      I always analyse what the Leader of the Opposition puts to me, but nothing can gainsay the fact that this education announcement made by the government has been applauded across all sectors of education. Some of the vice-chancellors have said that it is far ahead of anything they ever dreamt of receiving. The truth is that the Leader of the Opposition, who has talked long and hard about an education revolution, now finds himself in the embarrassing position that this government has done far more for education than he has ever promised to do. That is the dilemma of the Leader of the Opposition.

                        I thank the member for Solomon for his question. I can confirm that, last night, the Treasurer announced an unprecedented investment in our universities—a $1.7 billion package of funds for our universities, plus a $5 billion Higher Education Endowment Fund. The income from this fund, which we estimate to be about $300 million a year, will be distributed to universities. They will be able to use this fund to invest in capital works and research facilities. We believe that over time all universities in Australia will be able to build world-class facilities so that our students will have the opportunity to study in world-class institutions.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Our universities will be able build state-of-the-art facilities, science blocks, computer laboratories, libraries and lecture theatres. This will apply to universities across the country, including universities in the member for Solomon’s electorate, particularly

                        </a>
                        University. Charles Darwin will also be eligible for a range of other initiatives contained in this higher education package. The raft of reforms will give our universities the freedom, the flexibility and the funding to manage student demand and to offer courses that students want to study.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Last night the Treasurer announced that almost $560 million in additional funds will be available for universities to deliver high-quality courses in areas of national need—in science, maths, engineering, allied health, medicine, dentistry, nursing and teaching. I want to point out that our universities will receive more funding for our teaching courses and more funding to improve the practical experience of student teachers so that our universities will be able to produce high-quality teaching graduates for our schools.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        We are also going on to support teachers in schools. Teachers will be eligible to apply for Australian government summer schools, where they can upskill their qualifications and abilities in areas and receive a $5,000 bonus on completion. We will also reward schools that make a significant improvement in the literacy and numeracy standards of their students. These schools will be eligible for rewards of up to $50,000.

                        With a total package of $3.5 billion for schools and universities, plus the $5 billion Higher Education Endowment Fund, we have put our schools and universities in a strong position. This was possible only because of the strong economic management of the Howard-Costello government; it was possible only because we had budget surpluses. The Labor Party can only dream of coming up with initiatives that put our universities on a sustainable, long-term footing. This is unprecedented.

                         My question is directed to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer confirm that productivity growth when the coalition took office in 1996 was 3.2 per cent per annum, at the turn of the decade it was 2.2 per cent per annum, in the

                         it will be just 1.5 per cent this decade and in the budget papers last night it is zero for 2006-07? Doesn’t the Treasurer agree that these figures show that the productivity performance of his government is one of abject failure?

                          I think the record speaks for itself: continuous economic growth of 3½ per cent per annum, inflation averaged at 2½ per cent per annum, two million additional jobs, unemployment falling from 8½ per cent to 4½ per cent, interest rates falling from 10½ per cent to eight per cent, a budget deficit of $10 billion turning into a budget surplus of $10 billion, $96 billion worth of debt paid off, $100 billion of superannuation liabilities now provisioned with $50 billion of the

                          and an endowment fund that will rebuild Australia’s educational capacity forever. I think that, if Australians look at the record of this government and compare it with the record of the predecessor government of the Labor Party, they will draw their own conclusions.

                          Having said that, let me make a couple of points in relation to productivity. The first point is that productivity will be enhanced in the Australian economy by a better industrial relations system. There would be nobody in Australia who would believe that by going back to collective bargaining and getting rid of

                              One of the reasons that productivity in the mining industry at the moment looks as though it has actually turned down is that the mining industry is going through a huge investment phase. If you go through a huge investment phase, if you are in a phase where large investment of capital is going out before you get volume, it shows as productivity declining. Does that mean that the mining industry has suddenly become unproductive? No, it means it is going through a huge investment cycle which, when it leads to more volumes, will actually dramatically increase productivity.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              One of the other reasons you find that at times of full employment you get temporary downturns in productivity is that you begin to bring back into the workforce people who were previously marginalised—people who have been locked out, people whose skills are not great. But, as you bring them into the workforce, as they learn those skills over a period of time, their productivity matches that of other employees. So you always find that at a time in the cycle when you have near to full employment.
                             </p>
                             <p>
                              With good industrial relations, with good investment, as we make sure that we increase the capacity of the Australian economy, I believe that we have more productivity to unleash in this economy. But I tell you this: we will only unleash productivity in this economy if we are flexible and forward looking. If we go back to centralised industrial relations, if we go back to the old conflict between labour and capital that the

I have to say that the new measures in last night’s budget are possible only because of the great economic management that has been delivered to this country by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. New measures in last night’s budget will add $4.6 billion to federal government health spending. They will take total health expenditure to $52 billion next year, and they will take health spending as a percentage of total federal government spending to 22 per cent. That is up from just 14 per cent back in 1996. But we are not just spending more money; we are getting better results. According to the

                                 , since 1996 there has been a three-year increase in the life expectancy of average Australian males and a two-year increase in the life expectancy of females. That is because of the sensible investment of this government in better health services.

                                 s, people with multiple conditions will soon benefit from longer consultations with specialist physicians, and that measure is estimated to cost some $291 million. But even more importantly, for people with chronic conditions whose poor oral health is impacting on their general health, there is now greatly expanded access to Medicare funded dentistry. Instead of just three consultations a year, under Medicare those patients will be eligible for an initial consultation and up to $2,000 worth of subsequent treatment a year.

                                 We are not relieving the states of their responsibility for public dentistry but we will not leave people in health crisis. Many of the 650,000 people on those public dental waiting lists will be eligible for a team care plan. My message to them is this: the Howard government will not let you down. It is a tribute to the way the Treasurer has managed health that it was only after question time began that we finally heard from the member for Gellibrand who, after two o’clock, finally surfaced with a press release that said: ‘Dental program lacks bite.’ Well, I tell you what: Medicare has a lot more bite than ever before; it has a lot more bite than it ever had when Labor was in charge. The Howard government is proving by its actions, not just by its words, that it is the best friend—the very best friend—that Medicare has ever had.

                                  Mr Speaker, my question is to the Prime Minister. How can the Prime Minister claim that this is an education budget when it has no plans to underpin education through the rollout of a high speed broadband network? Does the Prime Minister believe that it is acceptable for children in countries like Singapore, Japan and Korea to have access to high-speed broadband infrastructure for their education, when Australian children do not?

                                   While I am on my feet, can I say that the member for Lilley asked me to validate the argument I made that this was an education budget. His leader had asked me some questions and invited me, and I have now had an opportunity to look at the paper from which he quoted. It is a very revealing examination. Let me read from under the title ‘Education’, 6.10 of Budget Paper No. 1. Bear in mind that the Leader of the Opposition asked me two questions that were calculated to demonstrate that expenditure on education, so far from rising, had actually fallen.

                                    I see. To start with it was 7.5 and 7.4, but that 7.5 and 7.4 was not a percentage of

                                    . It was not an attempt to compare education spending from one year to the next; rather, they were percentages of aggregate government spending and made no allowance for the fact that expenditure in other areas may have increased at an even faster rate than education—such as expenditure on defence and expenditure on family benefits.

                                    I would like the member for Lilley to leave question time with a feeling of tranquillity and peace about the subject of education. I will quote from Budget Paper No. 1. It reads as follows, and I invite the member for Lilley and the member for Griffith to listen to this:
                                   </p>
                                   <p class="italic">
                                    Total expenses under the education function are estimated to increase by 9.0 per cent in real terms from 2007-08 to 2010-11, or 3.4 per cent annually on average. The major drivers of this growth are the significant new measures for schools and universities announced in the 2007-08 Budget ...

                                    This is specifically on the point that I know worries the member for Lilley; I know he worries about this. It goes on to say:
                                   </p>
                                   <p class="italic">
                                    Higher education funding is estimated to rise by about 9.7 per cent in real terms from 2007-08 to 2010-11 or 3.7 per cent annually on average.

                                       I am broadbanding my answer. I will repeat it because I think the member for Grayndler may have missed it. This really is the thing that I know bugs the opposition. They have been talking about education for the last four or five months. Everywhere they go: ‘Education revolution!’ Everywhere they go: ‘The way forward is education.’ That is absolutely right, and the way you go forward in education is in part to spend more money on it, which we are doing. It is also to raise standards, which we are doing. It is also to acknowledge the professionalism of teachers in Australia, which we do. It is also to recognise the passion of parents to make certain that our schools actually teach children how to read and write and add up. That is what the Australian public wants and that is what this education revolution will deliver.

The Treasurer last night, in ‘Locking in the gains, investing in Australia’s future’, announced the largest increase in defence investment over the past 30 years for a single budget. Last night it was announced by the Treasurer that defence expenditure will increase by 10.6 per cent over the next year, which will take it to $22 billion. Over the last 11 years, since this government came to office, defence expenditure has increased in real terms by 47 per cent. In fact, when this government came to office in 1996, the deficit inherited from the Labor Party was almost as large as the defence budget in that year alone.

                                         Last night an additional $14 billion was committed by this government to defence over the next 10 years, investing not only in equipment but also in people, who are indeed our most important asset. The $2 billion announced for recruiting and retention includes, for example, a significant increase to the home loan subsidy for Defence personnel, both regulars and reservists. Whereas the home loan subsidy was $136 a month for eligible diggers, it is now going to as much as $470 a month tax free. In addition to that, 18,000 nonofficers, the lower ranks in our military, will receive pay increases of up to some $5,000.

                                          My question is again to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister now confirm, firstly, that in 2005-06 education outlays as a percentage of total government outlays stand at 7.7 per cent of budget, according to the government’s own papers; secondly, that in 2010-11 education outlays as a percentage of total government outlays in fact stand at 7.4 per cent of budget according to the government’s own papers; and, finally, that 7.4 per cent is less than 7.7 per cent? Prime Minister, haven’t you simply got your answer to this question fundamentally and totally wrong?

                                           No, because the answer to that question is that I confirm all of the figures in the budget paper, and those figures reveal that expenditure on education is going to increase in real terms very significantly over the next three or four years as a result of the measures announced last night.
                                          </p>
                                          <p>
                                           What I think the Leader of the Opposition is getting at is the proposition that, although there has been an increase in expenditure on education, in other areas of government expenditure there may have been an even bigger increase than has occurred in the area of education and, therefore, the percentages of total expenditure from one year might be lower than in a later year, or the other way around. That does not prove, as the Leader of the Opposition is trying to allege, that we have cut government spending. The whole point of this tawdry exercise—and it is a tawdry exercise—by the Leader of the Opposition is to try to establish that we have  reduced spending on education. We have in fact done the complete reverse, and education spending is going to rise over the next four years by more than 3.5 per cent a year in real terms as a result of the measures announced by the Treasurer last night.
                                          </p>

                                           I say to the Leader of the Opposition: yes, I confirm these figures; yes, I confirm that from one year to the next, because there will be differential rates of increase in expenditure, there may be a situation where a given area as a percentage of total outlays will fall from one year to the next without the real level of that expenditure falling at all. There is nothing remarkable about that, and the Leader of the Opposition is just trying to be too clever by half.

                                             I thank the member for Moreton for his question. This budget unashamedly puts families at the centre of the priorities of the Howard government. This is an additional $4.5 billion commitment to Australian families over the next five years. Of course, there are tax cuts for all Australians who are in the workforce. Those who are retired are getting their superannuation tax free but high-income, self-funded retirees will get a tax cut. Beyond that, we have taken into account childcare costs, and we have dramatically reduced that burden on Australian families.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                             For the member for Moreton, about 6,600 families in the Moreton electorate will benefit. For an average family on a low income with one child in care, that means about $20.50 less in the cost of child care as a result of the increase of 13 per cent in childcare benefit. The member for Moreton, along with all other honourable members, might like to tell families that are in child care that this year they will be able to claim two lots of childcare tax rebate. That means they will be able to claim up to $4,000 of their out-of-pocket expenses between now and the end of the year. That is as a result of the Howard government listening to families who said they really appreciated childcare tax rebate, but they would like it to be a bit more timely—and the Howard government has delivered.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                             We have not forgotten those families who have disabled children. We have increased our spending by an additional $62 million to assist some 3,000 families to have their disabled children, those kids with slightly higher needs, supported in child care. I think that is a really important measure.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                             For those in the bush, sometimes child care becomes quite marginal as far as viability is concerned. Regional and rural members on both sides of this House can go back and say that the Howard government is committing an additional $43 million for those families so they can access a quality childcare place.

                                             said she welcomes the government’s initiatives on child care and education—the minister for education will be happy to hear that—which are targeted at low-income Australians; not those ‘Mr Rudd battlers’ on one-quarter of a million dollars but the real battlers. ACOSS said that, rather than cutting taxes, they were looking for the government to invest in these sorts of things—and that is why Lin Hatfield Dodds is right; we have actually cut taxes for those people and we have improved their access to child care.

                                             There are other important families that the Howard government has paid attention to: for example, older families. In the electorate of Moreton, some 11½ thousand older families will receive the one-off $500 bonus before 30 June this year to help them with their out-of-pocket expenses.

                                                 It exists. I know the member for Lilley thought that the family tax supplement was not real. I can tell him that that was real. This is real. It will be appreciated by those families out there, who say that the Howard government is listening and helping them share in the wealth of this nation that they contributed to. In the past, the Howard government has given larger families—those who have been blessed with triplets or quadruplets—a bonus, whereby they got $3,000 for a family with triplets and just over $4,000 for a family with quadruplets. That used to cut out at when the children were six years of age but now it will go right through to 16 years of age or when the children turn 18, in their last year of education.

We have shared the prosperity of this nation, and we have allowed everyone to benefit from the strength of the Australian economy.
