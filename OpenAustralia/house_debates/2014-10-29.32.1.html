        Earlier this year, the Beenleigh Theatre Group held the Beenleigh Festival of One Act Plays. The Beenleigh Theatre Group has brought hundreds of live productions to the Beenleigh community, including musical presentations, plays, revues and pantomimes. Since 1986 the Beenleigh Festival of One Act Plays has produced unique, never-before staged works. This year there was a resurgence in the number of local youth entries, as well as new volunteers coming on board.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank festival coordinator, Roslyn Johnson, and all the members of the One Act Play Festival Committee, as well as the volunteers, as events like this would not be possible without their support.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to congratulate the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        of Loganholme, who had a very busy year with a number of activities, including the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCYC" rel="nofollow">
         PCYC
        </a>
        Car Show, the Logan City Charity Bike Ride, the Science and Engineering Challenge, the Pride of Workmanship and the many donations in kind to our local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to these events and activities, the Rotary Club of Loganholme also assisted Loganholme State School with their Christmas Carols event. They joined with Logan and Beenleigh clubs in holding a Neighbourhood Day 'Picnic in the Park' at Shailer Pioneer Park. They were also involved in the running of Beenleigh Relay for Life, which was a huge success. The work that they do for our community is outstanding, and I would like to acknowledge the efforts of all the office bearers for their wonderful work over the past 12 months.
