        in my electorate of Barton last Friday. It was a proud day for the community, and no less so for the acting principal, Mrs Stacey Potts; students; staff; and parents of St Ursula's. New facilities are a real cause for celebration, because learning at schools happens in classrooms, in music rooms, on the stage, in the library, in science laboratories, in the schoolyard and on the sporting field. We want students to acquire the skills they need to pursue their passions and their goals and to contribute to our nation.

       <p>
        The new teaching facilities provided for under the Capital Grants Program for Non-government Schools allows schools to improve capital infrastructure where they may not have access to sufficient capital resources. State-of-the-art facilities enable leading teachers to enable students to reach their full potential. This is important if we want students to be innovative, to be leaders and to be the entrepreneurs of tomorrow. The government is committed to helping provide the best quality education for school students and I am absolutely delighted that we on this side have been able to provide $3Â½ million for St Ursula's College for new learning facilities. For many years St Ursula's has enjoyed a strong reputation for academic success and pastoral care, not just in Barton but across

        . I have no doubt that these facilities, when coupled with a robust curriculum, are drivers of continued quality education.
