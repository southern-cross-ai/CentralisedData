       <p>
        Unlike the previous speaker, I'm going to talk to the aspiration of the nation for its sense of unity and purpose and those people who make that happen every day. Since 1921 Australian Rotary clubs have united men and women with a shared belief in securing a more inclusive society which promotes fellowship, integrity and goodwill. Building our social fabric is critical to securing our nation's great future.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our government has invested a record amount of money in local projects that help associations build that sense of community, because at the heart of this government—at the heart of liberalism—is an understanding that the success of our nation does not come down from Canberra and bureaucrats; it comes up from citizens and communities through strength, empowerment and possibility. Critically, as Liberals, we realise these values must be put into action and we must work with our community partners to be able to do so. It is for this reason that we celebrate the Rotary clubs of Australia. All of Australia's 30,000 Rotarians deserve recognition for their incredible contribution day in, day out, year in, year out. Today, I would like to acknowledge some of the leaders of Goldstein's exceptional Rotary club community whom we are all in awe of. We thank them for their incredible service to our community.
       </p>

        At the Sandringham
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        , I'd like to congratulate Ian Wells and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garry_Thompson" rel="nofollow">
         Garry Thompson
        </a>
        who were elected president and vice-president of the club this year. I understand they've done a role switch, which shows you their commitment to their club and, of course, to the Sandy community. And I know I was lucky to attend, only last week, their Rotary club meeting to discuss the development of a community garden just behind the Sandy bowls club. The friendly atmosphere and community spirit on display from the Sandy Rotary club community has always been a joy, and I've enjoyed going when I can to their changeover evenings to see the peaceful transition of Rotary club power from one committee to the next. I'm sure they are an exemplar of all the Rotary clubs who do great work.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the Rotary Club of Beaumaris, I'd like to give particular thanks to the outgoing executive including, but not limited to, President Heather Chisholm and Secretary Roy Seager. Their commitment and dedication to the club does not go unnoticed. They regularly organise a local market at Beaumaris North Primary School, and, from time to time, I'm a visitor at that Rotary market. It's always a joyous affair, particularly if the weather is pleasant, with not just coffee but also local produce. And there always seems to be somebody there who sells an enormous amount of strawberries, which is not a criticism! I congratulate their work and the money they raise in supporting the Bowie community. I congratulate the new leadership team consisting of President David Hone and Secretary Trish Smyth. David has an illustrious past as the head of Bayside U3A, so I'm glad to see him continuing his important community work. I'd also like to acknowledge Treasurer Lynda Doutch for continuing her role into the new year. I'm sure this new team will continue to lead the Bowie club from strength to strength, working with other community organisations like the traders and schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the Rotary Club of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Eira" rel="nofollow">
         Glen Eira
        </a>
        , I'd like to acknowledge the outgoing president, Alan Samuel, who has done a fantastic job leading the club over the 2018-19 year. The new executive team of President Lili Teichman, President-elect Martin Verhoeven and Secretary Joan Luscak. I'm sure they will have an exciting year of events and campaign activity planned to enhance and bring together that community to be able to do good charitable works. Furthermore, I would also like to acknowledge Treasurer Geoff Asher for continuing his role into the new year. As I'm sure you will understand, there's always something about the treasurer in a community organisation; it is a thankless task, often doing the hard yards with the other committee members, and we always thank them for standing up and taking on that important responsibility.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the Bentleigh Moorabbin Central Rotary Club which regularly organises the local Bentleigh markets, I would like to thank the outgoing president,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Ballantine" rel="nofollow">
         Ian Ballantine
        </a>
        , for his tremendous service last year and welcome the newly elected councillor, Geoff Gledhill. I have known Geoff for many years now and I know he'll perform a wonderful role as president of the Rotary club. It builds on his past experience as a councillor in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Kingston" rel="nofollow">
         City of Kingston
        </a>
        and, of course, as a vibrant broad community contributor. I wish all success to him and his executive. Just recently the Bentleigh Moorabbin Central Rotary Club held a night where club member Tony Grusd spoke about the experience on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_of_the_Living" rel="nofollow">
         March of the Living
        </a>
        , which is an annual educational program in Poland and Israel that seeks to inform participates about the scourge of bigotry and prejudice through exploring the remnants of the Holocaust.
       </p>
       <p>
        Like with the Sandy and the Beaumaris clubs, I have also spoken at the Bentleigh Moorabbin Central Rotary Club and always enjoyed the opportunity to share moments with them. This is one of many examples of the work these Rotary clubs do and particularly the work the Bentleigh Moorabbin Central Rotary Club does in promoting Rotary's values and taking them into practice.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the Rotary Club of Hampton, I would also like to congratulate the new executive consisting of President Stuart Le Gros, Treasurer Rosalind Bodley and Secretary Liz Ware. Already the Hampton Rotary Club along with the Beaumaris, Cheltenham and Sandringham branches have taken an initiative and planted 200 trees in Bayside. This fantastic project demonstrates the impact grassroots campaigns can have and highlights the important role that the Rotary movement has in the environmental stewardship of their community. And I have a soft spot for Hampton Rotary because, almost the day after I was first elected to this parliament, I attended an event with them and with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Gate" rel="nofollow">

        to explain the wonders of travelling France and cheese and wine—something I'm sure we can all become accustomed to.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the Rotary Club of Brighton—the mighty and very strong Rotary Club of Brighton—I'd like to give thanks to the outgoing executives: president
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Thomas" rel="nofollow">
         Norman Thomas
        </a>
        , vice president Barry Hickman, treasurer Kien Teh and secretary John Schmoll. And congratulations are in order for the new leadership team, consisting of president

        and secretary Anthony Langley. Only a month ago the Rotary Club of Brighton received not one but two Rotary District Awards. The club received recognition in vocational service for their

        Club of Brighton is also famous for its annual art exhibition at Sandringham Yacht Club, which is coming up. As always, it's an exciting opportunity not only to celebrate local artists and those people who particularly like to capture the beauty of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Phillip" rel="nofollow">
         Port Phillip
        </a>
        but also to lighten your wallets to contribute towards the good charitable works that they engage in. They have a long history, with other Rotary charity groups, in supporting important community works locally and as part of the global projects that Rotary work on, like the eradication of polio. Whether I can get to the opening night or not, because it's often on the Thursday of a parliamentary sitting week, I always endeavour to get down to Sandringham Yacht Club to celebrate this important art show—and celebrate the success of our Rotary clubs. It's initiatives such as these that highlight the integral role that Rotary clubs play, and will continue to play, in the wonderful Goldstein electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, at the Rotary Club of Brighton North, I'd like to congratulate the incoming leadership team consisting of president John Blangiardo, president-elect Peter Killey, vice president
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Harris" rel="nofollow">

       <p>
        The Rotary movement has a cherished role in the Goldstein community. I've spoken at the Rotary Club of Brighton North on some of my experiences in my former capacity as Australian Human Rights Commissioner and as the federal member for Goldstein. I've always found them, as I have found every other Rotary club, to be warm, embracing and full of model citizens—people who stand on their own two feet and understand that the greatest responsibility of doing so is to assist others to do the same. That goes to the core values and beliefs that I represent in this chamber, the values that underpin the community of Goldstein, the values that underpin the cause and the mission of Rotary International, and, of course, the role and aspiration and values that we should want for our great country. It's with these congratulations that I send my best wishes to all the Rotary clubs in Goldstein—to their outgoing executives and to those who have stepped up to the challenge. You embody the best of our nation. You stand up where others won't. You give of yourself—your time and your resources—to the benefit of our community, and for that we give our thanks.
