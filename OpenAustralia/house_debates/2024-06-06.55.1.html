       <p>
        I rise today to recognise the achievements of three swimmers from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Esk" rel="nofollow">
         South Esk
        </a>
        Swimming Club, who've qualified to compete at the upcoming Australia swimming trials in Brisbane, which is to select the Olympic team for Paris. These three hardworking athletes, Sophie Hills, Bella Shaw and Abbie King, being just 17, 16 and 15 years old respectively, have already achieved a swag of wins between them and all three rank in the top 10 in Australia for their ages in several events. Their coach, Ketrina Clarke, said this will be their first opportunity to experience open competition at an Olympic trial and they're exited about the opportunity to compete alongside some of the best swimmers in the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sophie Hills is Swimming Tasmania's current multiclass champion, holding several S9 state records, and dominated her class at the Tasmania sprint and long course championships, earning 12 individual gold medals. Abbie King won 10 individuals golds and is the Tasmanian age champion in individual medley, butterfly and freestyle. Bella Shaw achieved two national qualifying times and won six backstroke gold medals. The girls have all shown great dedication to their chosen sport and worked very hard.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations go also to their coach and the South Esk club, who guide and support them. I give a shout-out also to their parents and families, who do so much to support their dedication, with many mornings, late nights and long drives to training. Good luck with the next challenge, girls. We wish you every success in Brisbane and beyond.
