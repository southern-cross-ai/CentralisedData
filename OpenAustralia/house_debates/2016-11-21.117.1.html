        I thank the opposition for their support of the bill and also of these amendments. These amendments are purely to accede to a request, from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        government, that we received last week. The amendments ensure that the bill supports the full range of oversight functions of the Law Enforcement Conduct Commission and the amendments expand the purposes to which the inspector of the conduct commission can communicate, make use of or make a record of telecommunications interception information under the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 to include maladministration by the conduct commission.

         We welcome the government's proposed amendments to fix its original drafting to ensure that the inspector of the LECC is able to undertake the same oversight role as the former inspector of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Integrity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Police Integrity Commission
         </a>
         . I do want to make the point that it is actually through the PJCIS review process that the error was identified and raised by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         government. The review of legislation like this via the PJCIS is a reform that Labor fought for and won as a condition of our support for the government's data retention legislation. Again, it is really great to see that process working so well and picking up the error that the government has made here. The inspector is going to perform a very critical role overseeing the LECC, and we are pleased support this amendment.
