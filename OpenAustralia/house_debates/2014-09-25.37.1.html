       <p>
        Yesterday during question time, Madam Speaker welcomed three remarkable women to this chamber—the Hon. Rose Pihei, the Hon. Joan Jerome and the Hon. Elizabeth Burain. These women are members of parliament from Bougainville—the autonomous Bougainville government. They have been quite remarkable in their endeavours in bringing peace to Bougainville and to empowering the women of Bougainville. Under the peace agreement, there became 41 seats—33 seats elected at large; three seats allocated to women and three seats allocated to the ex-combatant, the speaker and deputy speaker of the house. For these three women to represent the women of Bougainville is a truly remarkable achievement—and they have not rested, also taking on other roles. For example, Rose is also a minister and Elizabeth and Joan have also taken on a wide range of activities. They have been empowering other women in Bougainville. Next year we look forward to seeing women run for the open seats in Bougainville and to seeing more women represented.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to pay particular tribute to these three women who were part of bringing peace to Bougainville. These were the women who, with other mothers, stood up and said 'Enough is enough—the conflict has to end.' They called on their own men and their own boys to stop the war and to bring peace. They are truly remarkable people. They have brought together many projects in Bougainville—a beautiful country with beautiful people.
