        On behalf of the parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Works" rel="nofollow">
         Public Works
        </a>
        , I present the ninth and 10th reports for 2006 of the committee relating to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
         HMAS
        </a>
        <i>
         Cairns
        </i>
        redevelopment, Cairns, Queensland and construction of housing for Defence at Fairview Rise, Ipswich, Queensland.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordered that the reports be made parliamentary papers.
       </p>
       <p>
        by leave—Defence submitted that the purpose of the proposed works is to provide facilities at HMAS
        <i>
         Cairns
        </i>
        for the berthing and effective operation of the new Armidale class patrol boats and to refurbish and reinvest in ageing base infrastructure. This will be achieved by the acquisition of increased berthing access at the adjacent commercial wharf and the refurbishment of existing shore facilities at HMAS
        <i>
         Cairns
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        One issue raised in submissions to the inquiry was with regard to proposed property acquisition by Defence. At the public hearing the committee heard evidence from representatives of Defence, the Cairns Navy League and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_Ship" rel="nofollow">
         Training Ship
        </a>
        <i>
         Endeavour
        </i>
        on this matter. After questioning witnesses, it became clear to the committee that there were still unresolved issues and that further consultation and negotiation had to be undertaken by Defence. At the hearing, Defence reaffirmed its commitment to the Training Ship
        <i>
         Endeavour
        </i>
        and to working with all stakeholders to resolve the property acquisition issue in the best interests of the cadets. As a result, the committee recommends that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Defence
        </a>
        keep it informed of progress and the outcome of negotiations in respect of the acquisition by Defence of the Training Ship
        <i>
         Endeavour
        </i>
        land and facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Defence submitted that an environmental impact assessment undertaken at HMAS
        <i>
         Cairns
        </i>
        had identified certain requirements for the construction work that would be incorporated into the project’s construction and environmental management plan. Defence added that, in addition to the project specific construction and environmental management plan, HMAS
        <i>
         Cairns
        </i>
        already had a base environmental management plan, which is currently under review. The committee recommends that the Department of Defence supply it with an updated copy of the HMAS
        <i>
         Cairns
        </i>
        base environmental management plan, which will be amended to include the new works. Having given detailed consideration to the proposal, the committee recommends that the proposed HMAS
        <i>
         Cairns
        </i>
        redevelopment proceed at an estimated cost of $76.3 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee’s 10th report of 2006 presents findings in relation to the proposed construction of housing for Defence at Fairview Rise, Ipswich, Queensland with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Housing_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         Defence Housing Authority
        </a>
        as the proponent agency for the work. The purpose of the proposed work is to provide modern community standard housing to meet the operational needs of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        and the requirements of Defence in south-east Queensland, particularly for Australian Defence Force members located at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        Base Amberley. The long-term Defence planning for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF_Base_Amberley" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF Base Amberley
        </a>
        has contributed to the increase in the Australian Defence Force housing requirement forecast for the Ipswich area. Fairview Rise is located close to community facilities, shops and schools and is approximately six kilometres from Ipswich and eight kilometres from RAAF Base Amberley. All proposed 162
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHA" rel="nofollow">
         DHA
        </a>
        residences will be four-bedroom detached houses with ensuite, family room, double garage and at least 18 square metres of covered outdoor living area.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee inspected the site of the proposed development and conducted a public hearing in Ipswich on 16 May 2006. Issues explored at the hearing include house design, project delivery, traffic considerations, consultation and a range of environmental issues. At the public hearing, the committee sought assurance from DHA that adequate water, electricity, gas and telecommunications connectivity would be provided to the site. While DHA were able to confirm the provision of these site services, they could not at the time confirm broadband internet facilitation for the site. Given the growing demand and importance of this service, the committee recommends that DHA advise it on the provision of broadband connectivity within the Fairview Rise estate.
       </p>
       <p>
        DHA stated in their statement of evidence that an extended bus route could be introduced to the site, bringing the majority of residents to within 400 metres of the nearest bus stop. After further questioning, DHA confirmed that the main arteries are sufficient to accommodate a bus route. However, they are still in discussion with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipswich_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Ipswich City Council
        </a>
        on an extended bus route. In this regard the committee recommends that DHA advise it on the provision of an extended bus route for the site. Having examined all the evidence presented to it, the committee recommends that the proposed construction of housing for Defence at Fairview Rise, Ipswich proceed at an estimated cost of $50.7 million. I wish to thank my committee colleagues and all those who assisted with the public hearings. I commend the reports to the House.
