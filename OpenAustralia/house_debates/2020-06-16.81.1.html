         I thank the member for Berowra for his ongoing interest in the work we're doing in our portfolio, and, more importantly, for his interest in Indigenous children and families. One of the key foundations of life is the beginning journey for a child in a family environment, which consolidates the way in which nurturing love is the basis for a great opportunity. I want to acknowledge the member for Barton, because she and I, many years ago, worked on a document called
         <i>
          Solid foundations,
         </i>
         which went to a number of aspects not just of education but of social and emotional wellbeing—the elements of the way in which children were given an opportunity that gave them a better future. The Morrison government has invested a further $243 million under the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAS" rel="nofollow">
          IAS
         </a>
         Safety and Wellbeing program, which includes funding for social and emotional wellbeing support for families and youth; violence reduction and victim support for families; crime prevention, diversion, rehabilitation and reinvigoration activities; and youth alcohol and substance misuse prevention and treatment activities. One of the things we need to think about in the protection of families and children is that, when they experience a disruptive life in which domestic violence or sexual abuse is part of their life, it leaves an indelible scar that carries on into their future years and often is a barrier to the success of their journey in life. It impacts on their education. And so the interventions that we're putting into place are being done by working with community, working with our women, who are our leaders in so many fronts in health and education and family violence, and also working with our men so they can take their place in the protective role that they have to share and be involved in. If we are to change the dynamics, then it's important that all of us in this chamber build on those strategies.

         We're focused every single day on getting more children to school, reducing suicide rates, which are a scourge on our communities, and creating jobs and economic opportunities for all

         —because all of those have flow-on effects that will make a difference. And we are succeeding. Successive governments have built success. We should celebrate success, not always focus on the gap. Whilst the new

         report has significant targets, we must celebrate every achievement. By celebrating achievement, we give people the opportunity and aspiration for a better future.

          on indulgence—I want to associate the Labor Party with the comments of the minister. The truth is that we as a parliament, on all sides, have failed on these issues in the past. We need to do much better and we need to work together wherever possible to achieve better outcomes and, indeed, celebrate the wins that are here. There are two wins sitting here in the chamber—the fact that the minister and the shadow minister are the first
