        I rise today to put on record my disappointment at comments made in the House of Representatives chamber on 2 September with regard to the performance of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        police force. While not wanting to get into a debate over the statements made, I do, however, as a Territorian, feel compelled to make a comment on them. I also wish to support the comments made by the federal Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs when she said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On the issue of policing in the Northern Territory, I think it is an extraordinary statement on the part of the member for Warringah.
       </p>
       <p>
        She went on to say:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The police in the Northern Territory do an extraordinary job in very difficult circumstances and, of course, have access to communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish to put on record my absolute support for the Northern Territory police force.

        police force have a proud history, a history which has been forged in the most extreme of weather conditions, in unimaginable isolation and in the unequalled variety of duties they are required to perform. Like police across the entire country, they are faced with personal danger on every shift. In the Northern Territory, whether they are stationed in major centres or in remote communities, these dangers are real. I have many friends in the Northern Territory police force. Some of them have been and continue to be stationed in communities, and I can assure people that they are diligent, hardworking and fully committed to the job they have taken on.
       </p>
       <p>
        I support the comments made by Mr Vince Kelly, the President of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory_Police" rel="nofollow">

        Association:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If Mr Abbott was honest it has been complete under-resourcing of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NT" rel="nofollow">
         NT
        </a>
        Police for over thirty years by successive Territory and Federal governments that has restricted our ability to enforce the law.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Northern Territory police force is apolitical. I know that Mr Kelly does not want the Northern Territory police force to be a political football during this debate. All levels of government on both sides of politics have to continue to support police forces across the country so that they are able to keep our population safe. The challenges they are currently facing are no different from challenges faced by many professionsâ€”the challenges of recruitment and retention.
       </p>
       <p>
        The police in all communities of the Territory are involved in far more than just policing the law. Many of them take on extra activities such as coaching sporting teams, coordinating blue light discos and taking groups out fishing and camping. They are part of the community. They are a very important part of all communities and they need to be supported and respected for the role they play.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know the police force are not immune from being held accountable. They are not exempt from being criticised. However, on this occasion, they have been attacked in the most inappropriate manner. I applaud the commitment of police officers in Australia and I encourage all members to be constructive in their dealings with this very underappreciated but essential public service sector group.
