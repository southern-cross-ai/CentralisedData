        My question is to the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. Will the minister update the House on the measures the government is implementing to improve the mental health of our

         I thank the member for Gilmore for her question and note her ongoing concern for the welfare and wellbeing of the veterans in her electorate.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today, the government released the preliminary findings of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare's study,
         <i>
          Incidence of suicide among serving and ex-serving
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Defence Force
          </a>
          personnel 2001–2014
         </i>
         . The figures released today are the first accurate, robust data ever produced on the incidence of suicide amongst the serving, reserve and ex-serving populations. One suicide is one too many, and the government is committed to addressing suicide in our community. This is the start of an ongoing, long-term project that will help us better understand the extent of the incidence of suicide in the defence community and inform our efforts to ensure that the people who need help can get it.
        </p>
        <p>
         The AIHW's study found that between 2001 and 2014 there were 292 certified suicide deaths amongst people with at least one day of ADF service since 2001. Of these: 84 occurred in the serving full-time population, 66 occurred in the reserve population, 142 occurred in the ex-serving population, 272 were men and 20 were women. When compared with Australian men demographically, the incidence of suicide was 53 per cent lower for men serving full-time in the ADF, 46 per cent lower for men in the reserve ADF and 13 per cent higher for ex-serving men.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the wider community, suicide is the leading cause of death for Australians aged 15 to 44. Men make up 75 per cent of all suicides. It is a problem we all need to confront. The government is acting. In the past six months, we have implemented non-liability health care for ADF members and veterans. This means that any man or woman who has served for a single day within the defence forces is eligible for treatment for depression, anxiety,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTSD" rel="nofollow">
          PTSD
         </a>
         , alcohol abuse or substance abuse. It is free and it is uncapped. In the first three months since this has been implemented, over 1,000 people have taken up this help. We can and are doing more to treat mental health issues within our defence community, but this issue is something that all of us need to do everything we can to address.
