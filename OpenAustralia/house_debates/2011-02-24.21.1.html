        , it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Proposed fit-out of new leased premises for the Attorney-General’s Department at 4 National Circuit, Barton,

       <p>
        The Attorney-General’s Department proposes to undertake a fit-out of new leased premises at 4 National Circuit, Barton, Australian Capital Territory at an estimated turnout cost of $18 million plus
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        . The national office of the department is located in the recently completed building at 3-5 National Circuit, Barton. The department still occupies five leased properties, three of which are over 20 years old and require major refurbishment to meet Commonwealth environmental efficiency and space utilisation standards.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new building will be constructed on the southern portion of the former

        offices site. The patents office building, which is located on the northern portion of the site, is heritage listed and has been recently refurbished. The development will provide approximately 29,800 square metres of high-quality office space, of which the Attorney-General’s Department will occupy approximately 8,000 square metres.

       <p>
        In its report, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PWC" rel="nofollow">
         PWC
        </a>
        recommended that these works proceed, subject to parliamentary approval and to the satisfactory pricing of the tender trade packages. The fit-out will be undertaken concurrently with the base building construction, which commenced in September 2010, and is scheduled for practical completion in June 2012. Occupancy is expected to occur in July 2012. Current leases have been structured to expire no earlier than mid-2012, to avoid the risk of penalties associated with short-term holding leases. On behalf of the government I would like to thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House.

        <i>

        , it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Fit-out of new leased premises for divisions of the Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research at Buildings 2 and 3, Precinct Corporate Centre, 105 Delhi Road, Riverside Corporate Park,

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Innovation, Industry, Science and Research proposes to undertake an integrated fit-out of a new leased facility at North Ryde, Sydney, to accommodate fully-serviced laboratories, testing and analytical facilities and support office space. The fit-out will ensure the building is appropriately tailored to the scientific and operational needs of the department and will allow three leased Sydney properties to be replaced with a single, new fit-for-purpose facility.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposed development will conform to all relevant building and laboratory codes, including compliance with laboratory occupational health and safety requirements. The facility will accommodate about 240 staff when complete. The building will have 10,270 square metres of floor space, including offices, laboratories and sample receipt areas. The total estimated cost of the proposal is $25.66 million plus GST. It is proposed that the building be fitted out to accommodate the activities of the National Measurement Institute, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Astronomical_Observatory" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Astronomical Observatory
        </a>
        and an Enterprise Connect manufacturing centre.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is subject to parliamentary approval. Fit-out customised to the department’s specific needs will continue as the building construction progresses. Occupancy of the building is scheduled in two stages with stage 1 commencing late May 2012 and stage 2 in August 2012. In its report the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed. On behalf of the government I would like to thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House.
