        On Friday, 25 August, I was delighted to meet several of my constituents: Jo and

        </a>
        and their lovely son Ethan; Dr Ann Long; and Zhi Yan, who have been busy arranging for a community climate change petition to be signed by Sydney residents. This petition campaign has been organised by a number of faith-based groups including Micah, Caritas,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Vision" rel="nofollow">

        and TEAR Australia. It is being driven by community members who recognise that climate change is disproportionately affecting poor and marginalised communities around the world. The petition calls on the government to take stronger action to reduce our emissions, transition away from fossil fuels, move towards renewable energy and support our poorest and most vulnerable neighbours as they face the increasing impacts of climate change.

        Jo was the principal petitioner in my electorate of Sydney. She is a community worker, a committed Christian and a mum, who got involved with the community climate change petition because she believes that most people want the government to act on climate change to protect our children's future. The Labor Party agrees. Jo, her family and other concerned locals went out and gathered signatures at street stalls and church events in Newtown and nearby suburbs. I'm pleased to say that over 1,481 other caring Sydney residents signed this petition. I know that many Labor MPs around the country have been delighted to accept these petitions, but I'm shocked to hear that several coalition members have refused to accept them from their electorates. It is a great shame and it reflectsâ€”
