         I thank the member for Menzies for his question and acknowledge the incredible support that he has given to the men and women of the ADF, especially during his very long tenure in this place. Right across the nation, through Operation COVID-19 Assist, defence personnel are playing an essential role to support our response to COVID-19. Since March last year, some 20,000 ADF personnel have been deployed right across our nation, with more than 1,750 currently deployed across Australia. In
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         we see the ADF supporting a variety of activities, including home-engagement activities and contact tracing. We know from people on the ground that the ADF's involvement has been extremely welcome in local communities. There's no doubt that seeing our men and women in uniform on the ground in communities gives us all an enormous lift. In Victoria ADF support continues, with over 400 ADF personnel helping out the Victorian authorities with such activities as hotel quarantine and also home-engagement activities. And of course the ADF stands ready to support the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
          ACT
         </a>
         , should that help be required.
        </p>
        <p>
         With respect to the vaccination rollout, up until May this year the ADF had administered some 6,800 COVID vaccines in aged-care and disability care facilities, playing an important role to make sure that our most vulnerable Australians received their much-needed vaccines.
        </p>
        <p>
         From a defence industry perspective, this afternoon I spoke with the deputy secretary of my department who is in charge of the COVID-19 Defence Industry Support Cell, Mr Tony Fraser, to ensure that the defence support cell is now gearing up to expand its support to the defence industry here in the ACT, just like we have provided it to defence industry in Victoria and New South Wales more recently. This support cell has been in operation since March 2020. It's played an incredibly important role during COVID to make sure that Australian businesses can continue to provide not only very essential services but also equipment that the ADF needs. This cell stands ready to assist and support with border crossings for essential personnel and the delivery of equipment and supply and with access to workplaces for essential workers right across the country. So I'd like to encourage defence industry here in ACT. If you need assistance, please make sure that you reach out to the Defence Industry Support Cell.
        </p>
        <p>
         I know I can speak on behalf of every member of this House to say how proud we are of the men and women in uniform who are doing an outstanding job helping our nation through these difficult times, but I'd also like to acknowledge those people in the

          on indulgenceâ€”I join with the government in thanking the men and women in uniform who are assisting on the ground, and I thank the defence minister as well, for going out of his way, for example, to provide a Defence Force person to be part of Zoom calls taking place with leaders in the community so as to assure them of the role of the Defence Force and make things certainly much better on the ground.
