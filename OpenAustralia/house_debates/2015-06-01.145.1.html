        I have the incredible privilege of being actively involved with men's sheds, firstly in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
         NSW
        </a>
        , and in my role with men's sheds in my electorate of Hasluck. Men's sheds are accessible to all men and provide a safe and welcoming environment in the company of other men. Colleen Bitmead attended the Men in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Ball" rel="nofollow">
         Black Ball
        </a>
        in 2012 which supports men's health. Those attending talked about the importance of men's sheds and how successful they were in assisting men with depression, loneliness, companionship and the need for social inclusion to prevent increasing suicide rates. Colleen thought about what she had heard and reached the conclusion that women faced similar issues and nothing was in place for them. The women of our community need somewhere to feel connected. Collen said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As a mother working from home while the kids were at school, I found socialising with others at events was difficult; I had nothing to talk about except my kids. I had lost my identity and was invisible. People would often talk over the top of me. Was I that boring? That was how I felt.
       </p>
       <p>
        For her the issues facing women were similar. Women in her community face social and community isolation, lifestyle changes with partners who are fly-in fly-out workers so many are without adult conversation at night, the loss of a loved one, health problems, children or a partner with a disability, young single mums, and other ethnic and culturally diverse backgrounds. Whilst change has improved women's status the challenge facing women today is striking the right balance between work, self and family. We collectively expect women to take care of their children and the house and work hard at their job. Despite living in modern times, equality in all fields of life is still beyond reach and takes its toll on female achievement. Colleen said that while she was listening she wondered if there was anywhere similar for women to attend, and the name 'Women's Powder Room' popped into her headâ€”so now she had a name and a plan but she needed a building. That is when she came to see me, and working with shire president Sue Bilich, the

        and Fiona Lander from

        , her dream has become a reality.

        To women the powder room can be a means for them to come together to provide support to enhance personal empowerment and the ability to build strong personal and professional relationships. Recently the powder room has commenced a series of programs. Importantly, they asked the Prime Minister's wife to open the building for them. Margie made the comment that it enabled women to spend time together, and she told the Women's Powder Room members and guests that there was a time when she was a young mother in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">

        and she missed the conversations, cuppas and cuddles with close friends and family. She added that the Women's Powder Room is filling that role and is providing an opportunity for women to catch their breath and keep going. She commented that it is a place for hugs instead of handshakes. Congratulations to Colleen and all those involved in the establishment of the powder room.
