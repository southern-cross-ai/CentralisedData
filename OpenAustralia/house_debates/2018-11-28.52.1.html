        You know the Liberal Party's in complete disarray when I, the lady who wears the red jacket, receive in my inbox the unofficial newsletter of the members of the Victorian Liberal Party's summary of the state election. What does it say? It has, for example, 'Victorians just don't like, trust and respect

        It's rare that I actually stand in this place and say that I agree with the member for Higgins, but I agree with her comments that have been reported that the Liberal Party are simply anti women, homophobic and climate change deniers. That's exactly what we saw in the state election. People voted in numbers to say that this Liberal government are out of touch, that they are mean, tricky and not engaged with voters. That is why Liberals, their own people, were not turning up to hand out how-to-votes on state election day.

People want a government that acknowledges and acts on climate change. And people want a government that is truly embracing of our
