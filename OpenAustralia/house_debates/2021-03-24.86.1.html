        <p>
         I thank the member for Wentworth for his question and his great passion and interest in international affairsâ€”especially in our relationship with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG" rel="nofollow">
          PNG
         </a>
         . I don't think there is a more important relationship than the one that Australia has with PNG.
        </p>
        <p>
         PNG has reported over 4,100 confirmed cases, with over 2,000 cases reported since 27 February. Australia will provide 8,000 vaccines from our own supply to protect PNG's frontline health workers. These vaccines arrived in PNG yesterday. Further, an AUSMAT team arrived in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Moresby" rel="nofollow">
          Port Moresby
         </a>
         yesterday. It is providing advice on the vaccine rollout, cold chain logistics, storage and predeparture testing. Obviously, we thank everyone who is involved with that AUSMAT team for the very important role they're playing in helping and supporting PNG at this time.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are also lobbying for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
          EU
         </a>
         to release one million doses of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstraZeneca" rel="nofollow">
          AstraZeneca
         </a>
         vaccine purchased by Australia so that we can also provide those to PNG. I know the Prime Minister has made representations on this front and I myself have made representations on this front. We hope that the EU will be able to release those one million doses so that we can provide them to the PNG government in this time of need. We're also providing additional
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPE" rel="nofollow">
          PPE
         </a>
         , including one million surgical masks; 200,000 respirator masks; 100,000 sets of gowns, goggles, gloves and hand sanitiser; 20,000 face shields; and 200 non-invasive ventilators. If more equipment or material of this type is needed, obviously, we stand ready to provide further support to PNG at this time. We have also funded the reopening of the Rita Flynn Testing and Isolation Facility. It reopened on 5 March to add 45 COVID beds. And we are working with St John's PNG to transform Taurama aquatic park into a care and isolation facility which will have capacity for 120 low to mild patients.
        </p>
        <p>
         Over the past year we have re-prioritised over $60 million in development assistance to support PNG's response to COVID, and I would just like to conclude by saying that I'm sure I speak for the whole House in wishing the PNG government and their people all the best as they deal with COVID-19. It's obviously an incredibly challenging time for them at the moment, but they should know that this parliament and the Australian people stand with them in their hour of need.

          . And in relation to that last matter, I also pass on my thanks to the member for Corio for his assistance as we've been dealing with these matters in
