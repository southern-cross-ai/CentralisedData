       <p>
        I am outraged by the selfishness of this
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        government. Right now, the LNP members opposite care far more about their own jobs than about creating real jobs in Townsville. Under the LNP, unemployment has almost doubled. As Townsville's unemployment was reaching record-high levels, families were leaving in droves to find jobs elsewhere. Some people in Townsville are still struggling to put food on the table, pay their electricity bills and pay for petrol and the rising cost of living—all because of the cuts made by the now Prime Minister when he was the Treasurer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prime Minister Scott Morrison is the architect of the massive cuts that have impacted on the people of Townsville. Because of the chaos and cuts being delivered by this LNP government, the going has got very tough for some workers, businesses and pensioners. The Prime Minister is the architect behind the $9 million cuts to the

        </a>
        and Health Service—that's 25 nursing positions gone.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prime Minister Scott Morrison is the architect behind the $14.8 million cuts to Townsville schools—one in three teaching positions gone. The Prime Minister is the architect behind the $36 million cut to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JCU" rel="nofollow">
         JCU
        </a>
        and $38 million in cuts to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland_University" rel="nofollow">
         Central Queensland University
        </a>
        —that's 19 jobs gone from JCU. If Townsville is to get jobs and vital funding for family concerns like health, education and assistance in the cost of living then Townsville needs a Labor government that will deliver jobs for Townsville and not cuts and chaos.
