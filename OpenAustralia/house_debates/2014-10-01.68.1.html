       <p>
        During the last fortnight break, I had the opportunity of attending one of my schools, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Hills_Christian_School" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific Hills Christian School
        </a>
        , to attend its initiative of Thank You Week. I am sure other members have been approached by their schools who appreciate the work that they do and undertake and have had students wanting simply to say, 'Thank you.' This is a week that involves schools extending invitations to their members, local emergency service personnel and other local heroes to the school to thank them for their contribution to the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        It may surprise colleagues to know that I was well received by the year 6 students. They are about to go to high school. They took the opportunity to speak about the positive role that they have to play in Australia in the future. I was particularly impressed by their questions, and they were well versed in much of the adversarial nature of our parliamentary system, and its political history. I think this is a great initiative from the school and others, and I commend the organisers. I thank the class for the opportunity to speak to them and for their hospitality. I encourage all members, when their schools invite them, to take up that opportunity.
