       <p>
        I have accepted an invitation from President Joe Biden to undertake an official visit to the United States from 23 to 26 October. I'm deeply honoured to accept the President's invitation on behalf of all Australians. Our alliance with the United States has long been at the heart of our foreign policy. For generations now, we have worked together in service of our shared ideals, as partners for peace, security and stability in the Indo-Pacific and in the wider world as well. For all the profound history that we share, the future of our relationship offers us a greater world of opportunity. I look forward to building on the constructive discussions I've had with the President in our previous meetings, including advancing ambitious climate action and the transition to clean energy under the historic agreement that we came to in Japan—the Climate, Critical Minerals and Clean Energy Transformation Compact.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, this visit is also a valuable opportunity for Australia and the United States to build on the AUK

        agreement, which we announced in

        earlier this year, deepening the opportunities in research, science and technology and local manufacturing and an even closer defence cooperation in our region. Operation Malabar, along with Japan, India and the United States, will be taking place this weekend as well. On the subject of cooperation, I know that the whole House will join me in thanking the United States armed Forces for the assistance that they provided in the recovery following those tragic events of

I look forward to meeting with you later today at the Lodge and then meeting with you as well in the United States of America, in your home land. You are welcome guests here in our country. I also take the opportunity to welcome our ambassador to the United States,

       </p>
       <p>
        I consider President Biden's invitation a great honour not for myself but for who we represent—our great nations. It is a friendship between Australia and the United States. I very much look forward to representing Australia in the United States in Washington,

         I associate the opposition most strongly with the Prime Minister's remarks and note that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         is our strongest ally. The AUKUS initiative, delivered under us, is vital to our national security future. We wish the Prime Minister well on his visit, and, once again, we associate the opposition with all that he has just stated, including the warm welcome to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">
