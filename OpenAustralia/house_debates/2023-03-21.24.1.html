        Today marks 10 months since the Albanese Labor government was elected, and it's worth noting some of the achievements of those 10 months. They include cheaper medicines; a pay rise for millions, particularly the low paid; 180,000 fee-free

        places; and cheaper child care from 1 July. We've put in more paid parental leave. We've legislated for a National Anti-Corruption Commission. We've established a royal commission into the terrible robodebt. We're taking climate change action. We have Powering Australia up and running. We're fixing aged care. We're funding paid domestic violence leave. This week we're legislating for housing for veterans and vulnerable people. That's in the Senate, and we hope it comes back soon so we can get it through the House. Then there's the National Reconstruction Fund to get advanced manufacturing back on track in this country.

There were the multiple ministries of the former
