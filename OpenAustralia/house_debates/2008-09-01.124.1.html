       <p>
        I rise this evening to pay tribute to and to honour the work of the football and netball clubs within the electorate of Flinders. I do this on the basis that these clubs are a source of tremendous social support and a great virtue for people from across the electorate with regard to society, exercise, health and discipline. As we approach the grand finals across the various leagues, this is an opportunity to acknowledge the work of the leagues, the executive members who volunteer in the clubs, the members who volunteer to do work for the clubs and, above all else, the mums and dads who help with the junior clubs.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to speak about the extent of both football and netball clubs within the electorate of Flinders. There are five leagues across Flinders. Firstly, there is the Alberton league, which includes the Dalyston Football and Netball Club, the Kilcunda-Bass Football and Netball Club, the Stony Creek Football and Netball Club, and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillip_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Phillip Island
        </a>
        football and netball clubs. Secondly, there is the Casey-Cardinia football and netball league, which includes the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devon_Meadows" rel="nofollow">
         Devon Meadows
        </a>
        football and netball clubs and Tooradin football and netball clubs. Thirdly, there is the Ellinbank and district football and netball league, which includes the Catani football and netball clubs, the

        football and netball clubs, the

         Lang Lang
        </a>
        football and netball clubs, and the Nyora football and netball clubs. Fourthly, there is the Nepean football league, which includes the Crib Point Football Club, the Dromana Football Club—of which I am the proud holder of the No. 1 ticket—the Pearcedale Football Club, the Red Hill Football Club, the Rosebud Football Club, the Rye Football Club, the Somerville Football Club, the Sorrento Football Club and the Tyabb Football Club. Fifthly, there is the Peninsula football league, of which Hastings is our representative. I add to that list the A-grade RecLink, which helps those who are disadvantaged and down on their luck. In Hastings, the Westernport Warriors are the proud representatives of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mornington_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I acknowledge, in particular, the work of the clubs on four fronts. Firstly, in relation to health and exercise, these football and netball clubs are fundamental in helping kids and young adults have an outlet for a healthy attitude, to be engaged in sport, to be engaged in competitive sport and to be engaged with all the rigour, discipline and personal training. Secondly, as I mentioned at the outset, they are a source of great society. We see the community coming together. On Saturday I attended the preliminary final between my club, Dromana, and Frankston, in the Nepean league. There were probably well over 1,000 people in attendance at the game. It was a tremendous example of the community coming together. It was done in good spirit and it was an outstanding result, with Dromana proceeding to the grand final with both the seniors through and the reserves already through. I wish them all the best. Thirdly, it is training for young men and women in leadership. It is the provision of personal discipline, of giving them a sense of resolve, purpose and meaning. It does not substitute for other areas of life, but it is a fundamental outlet and area for personal development. Fourthly, there is the role played by volunteers. These volunteers may be at the level of the league executive, at the executive level of individual clubs or at the organisational level of senior or junior clubs. They could be mums and dads who run the barbecue or the stalls. But in these clubs across the peninsula, across
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Port" rel="nofollow">
         Western Port
        </a>
        and across the Bass Coast, you see people of great generosity giving their time to help young people. It is a great way forward.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I wish all of the teams the best as they go into grand finals over the coming two weeks. Most of the grand finals are two weeks from now; however, this weekend the Nepean football league will see Sorrento versus Dromana. Whilst I wish Sorrento well, I hope Dromana prevails in the firsts. In the seconds, we have Dromana versus Frankston, and my allegiances are well known there. Whether they are football or netball clubs, they are great clubs with great people running them. We need to do all we can to provide services and support. There are a series of things that we can do. I congratulate and thank all of those involved in these great volunteer organisations.
