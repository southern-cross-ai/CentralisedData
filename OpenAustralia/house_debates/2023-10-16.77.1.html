        My question is to the Minister for Aged Care. How is the Albanese Labor government delivering on its election commitment to get wages moving for aged-care workers and to lift the standard of aged care in Australia?

         I thank the member for Lalor for her question. I recently visited Manor Court Werribee Aged Care with the member for Lalor to talk with the aged-care workers and residents who live there—most of whom she could introduce herself, personally, such is her dedication as a local member—about the positive impact that our reforms in aged care are having on their day-to-day lives.
        </p>
        <p>
         The election of the Albanese Labor government was a watershed and uniting moment for people who care about the state of aged care in this country. They were desperate to see it improved. Before the election older Australians were scared about the prospect of going into an aged-care home, with the royal commission exposing a shocking tale of neglect and incompetence. Workers were undervalued and underpaid. Labor heard these people, and we listened. We promised to build a better, fairer future for the aged-care sector and now we are delivering. We funded a meaningful pay rise for aged-care workers: a 15 per cent increase in the minimum award. Under the Albanese government, personal care workers are now taking home up to $141 a week more, or $7,300 a year more. Registered nurses are now taking home up to $196 a week more, which amounts to about $10,000 a year more. I have heard from workers who have related how that extra money means that they can now buy sports shoes for their kids and purchase long-needed hearing aids.
        </p>
        <p>
         But stronger wages are not just helping our aged-care workers face the immense cost-of-living pressures; they are also leading to much better outcomes for the residents who they care for. I recently went for morning tea with the member for Higgins to Arcare Aged Care in Melbourne's east. There, one of the residents, Colleen, actually pulled me aside to tell me how much she respected and appreciated her nurse, Amanda. Colleen told me how good Amanda is at her job and how much happier she is now that Amanda has come to the aged-care sector and is caring for her. Maureen, from the

         , told me that her mum lives in aged care. She has noticed now that her mum is getting more one-to-one care because there are more workers on each shift that she is in there to see.
        </p>
        <p>
         We also have data that shows that since the election of the Albanese Labor government older people in aged care are receiving an incredible additional 1.8 million minutes of care every single day. Let me state that again: 1.8 million additional care minutes every single day! The Albanese Labor government is delivering better outcomes for older people in aged care and for the very hardworking people that care for them.
