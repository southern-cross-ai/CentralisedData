       <p>
        I would like to make a brief comment on the circumstances in Iraq at the moment. As we have seen, there has been a terrible force of evil rampaging through Iraq, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_State" rel="nofollow">
         Islamic State
        </a>
        of Iraq and the Levant, with jihadists—dangerous, evil people; brutal to the extreme—and mass executions. What we have seen has truly been a blight on humanity in the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        When faced with such evil, we have to look to the Iraqi government and say that we wish them all the best and we have to look for opportunities whereby we can support them to try to turn back these people. It is a terrible situation. Everyone throughout the world should be concerned. The jihadist movements need to be stopped and need to be dealt with as quickly and as effectively as possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        What also concerns me is that there are likely to be Australians who have signed up to be part of such an evil organisation, and I certainly commend the government on their attempts to stop people leaving this country by cancelling passports to stop their involvement. I would also say that where such people have dual citizenship, they are exactly the sort of people from whom we should remove Australian citizenship. We do not want them in this country in the future.
