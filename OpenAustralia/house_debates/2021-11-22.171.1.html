       <p>
        Last week we celebrated National Agriculture Day. This is a day when we celebrate our world-class biosecurity systems and the world-class agriculture that our country produces. The theme of this year's National Agriculture Day was 'agventures', encouraging Australians to consider career opportunities in the agricultural industry. This year I had the privilege of joining Calvary Christian College, AgForce and AgForce Young Producers Council for their National Agriculture Day event, at Calvary Christian College.
       </p>
       <p>
        The agricultural program at Calvary has been an integral part of the learning experience of the college since it opened its campus at Carbrook, in my electorate. The students are offered several agricultural pathways, both as curricular and co-curricular offerings. These include childcare farm visits in the early years; junior ag club, known as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAG" rel="nofollow">
         JAG
        </a>
        , and class visits in the junior years; as well as opportunities for show team involvement. The middle and senior school also have the opportunity to participate in From Paddock to Plate and agricultural science. Having a farm onsite at the college allows them to bring the learning to life, offering a full, interactive, practical experience for their students.
       </p>
       <p>
        The passion the students show for the agricultural industry is part of why AgForce established their School to Industry Partnership Program. They have successfully been the stream between Queensland's primary producing agribusinesses and schools. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIP" rel="nofollow">
         SIP
        </a>
        Program has not only been successful, but is now also considered the benchmark for school to industry engagement. The AgForce School to Industry Partnership Program delivers a range of events and programs throughout the year for primary students, secondary students and teachers, and these programs educate students about the origins of their food and fibre, engage them with a wealth of primary production and agricultural sector knowledge, and raise the profile of careers in agribusiness and increase the awareness in the variety of career paths on offer. Their events include AgConnect, and this event provides schools with opportunities to engage with the relevant industry partnerships and presentations. AgForce have also established their own young producers' council, an energetic, forward-thinking, commercially minded group of 18- to 40-year-olds who are passionate about the industry in Queensland. The council's goal is to raise awareness within AgForce of what matters to young producers.
       </p>
       <p>
        My electorate has a rich agricultural history and, alongside Calvary Christian College, two other local schools, Beenleigh State High School and Loganlea State High School, have outstanding agricultural programs. I commend everybody for the work that they do.
