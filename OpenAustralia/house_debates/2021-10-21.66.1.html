        I ask the Treasurer: how is the Morrison government's strong economic management and the importance of sticking to our national plan ensuring our economy recovers strongly when restrictions ease, especially in my state of Victoria? Is the Treasurer aware of any alternative policies?

         I thank the member for Menzies for his question and acknowledge his three decades of distinguished service in this place, including as a minister for defence and in the national security space. Today marks a significant milestone in Australia's road to recovery, with Victoria reopening. After 77 days of delta lockdown, restrictions are easing in Victoria. This is the day millions of Victorians have been waiting for. Kids are getting back to school, businesses are reopening and families are being reunited. Victorians have done the right thing by going to get the jab in record numbers. Seventy per cent are fully vaccinated, with 80 per cent in sight, and 90 per cent per cent have had their first dose, which is higher than the United Kingdom. Today, we say thank you to the health workers of Victoria who have kept our community safe, thank you to the teachers who have helped support our students, thank you to the mums and dads who have supported their kids, and thank you to the small-business owners who have supported their staff. Today is Victoria's day, as we move to the next phase with the reopening of the great state of Victoria.

        <p>
         I was asked if I am aware of any alternative policies. We know that the Leader of the Opposition has come up with two big ideas in that role in the last few years. First, there was the national drivers licence, which was going to turbocharge our economy. Second, there was a $6 billion conversation starter to pay Australians who have already had the jab.

             I know the Leader of the Opposition doesn't want to be reminded that he had a $6 billion conversation starter to spend money to pay people who have already had the jab. The Leader of the Opposition wanted our government to run with his policy. The only problem was that the shadow cabinet was running away from his policy. But there's one set of policies that the Labor Party will never run away from, and that's their plans for higher taxes. That's why we weren't surprised to see on the front page of the
             <i>
              Australian
             </i>
             there were plans that the shadow Treasurer took to the strategic policy review for a $27 billion tax on 300,000 family and small businesses. We're getting on with the job of growing the economy. Those opposite, if they ever got the chance, would put higher taxes on all Australians.
