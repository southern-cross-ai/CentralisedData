       <p>
        I rise to take note of the passing of Jim Hennessy. Jim was a dedicated trade unionist and a passionate advocate for the rights of working people. He was an active member of the Lindsay Your Rights at Work committee and campaigned to defeat the former Howard government’s

        laws at the last election.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jim emigrated from the United Kingdom with his family. He was a painter and decorator by trade but, to those who knew him, Jim could do practically anything. After living his early years in a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_London" rel="nofollow">
         South London
        </a>
        commission estate, Jim rose above the adversity of those beginnings and went on to become a man with passion for his community and a deep commitment to helping others. Even in retirement, Jim continued to make a contribution by volunteering at Governor Phillip Nursing Home and as a driver of Penrith council’s community bus.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jim had a love and deep understanding of his adopted country. He was a keen explorer of Australia, was a dab hand at the didgeridoo and had a knack for finding the nearest yabby hole. With his sharp mind and rich network of contacts, Jim was never afraid to give you his opinion or to put you in touch with the right person. With his generosity of spirit he was a man you could always turn to.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jim is survived by his wife, Sheila, children Peter and Tracey and his grandchildren. I know he will be remembered as a man who lived his life with great vigour and passion, and he has a place in the hearts of many in our local community.
