       <p>
        People with disability are living more independent lives and engaging with their communities, and are either entering the workforce for the first time or returning to work. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        , fully funded by this government and sustainable into the future, is customised to the individual. It provides packages of support which match people's circumstances and needs. This choice and control over the delivery of services and support will be in the hands of the people who actually use and benefit from the servicesâ€”NDIS participants, their families and carers.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am excited that from July 2017 the NDIS will be available in my electorate of Farrer. More than 6,000 people within an area from Albury in the south to Hillston, Hay and Deniliquin in the west are expected to join the scheme over the next two years. This Monday, I am hosting an information session in partnership with the National Disability Insurance Agency in Albury for people with disability, their families and carers, and community members from 1 pm.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am also looking forward to meeting with some of the participants who are already in the scheme, including mum Zoe and Ruthie. Ruthie is eight and has cerebral palsy. She became an NDIS participant four years ago in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        before moving to Albury with her family. One of the great things about the NDIS being a national scheme is that Ruthie's support package has effectively moved with her. This information session is a great opportunity for people in Albury and across our region to have their questions answered and find out more about the NDIS.
