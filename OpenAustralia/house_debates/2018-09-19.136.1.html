        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">

        , is of strategic importance, as these nations are being transformed by strong economic development and share a strong commitment to regional cooperation, diplomacy and security. Australia was ably represented at the

        Collectively, the population of Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam numbers 643.5 million, making the alliance an important emerging market for trade in Australian goods and services. As a region, strong growth prospects exist, with real gross domestic product growth of five per cent year on year and inflation relatively low at three per cent per annum. In terms of standard of living, there is an emerging middle class of consumers across the region, with

        per capita purchasing-power parity of $13,118 in international terms.
       </p>
       <p>
        Currently, Australia's total merchandise trade with ASEAN countries is worth $75.5 billion annually, with exports worth $31 billion and imports amounting to $44.1 billion. Major Australian exports include wheat, crude petroleum, liquefied and natural gas, alumina, nickel, coal and gold, while our major imports include refined petroleum, goods vehicles, crude petroleum and passenger motor vehicles. In terms of services, Australian firms supplied $13.5 billion worth of services to ASEAN countries last year and imported $15.5 billion of services, with education-related travel, personal travel and transport being major categories. Australia's trade with ASEAN places us in the top 10 trading partners with the regional alliance.
       </p>
       <p>
        In July, I participated in the Australian parliamentary delegation to ASEAN member nations, which visited Vietnam, Thailand and Brunei to foster diplomatic security, training and investment relations between our nations. The delegation visited the legislatures of each of the respective countries, meeting with government representatives and officials as well as a number of business leaders from the local chambers of commerce and industry. I'm pleased to be part of the government team working with the private sector on improving trade relations with our geographically close ASEAN regional alliance and working with a network of business contacts and personal relationships formed over two decades to open doors and create new opportunities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Developing export markets for Australian goods and services will provide economic development and create Australian jobs in a range of diversified industries, placing less reliance on the mining industry for our economic prosperity. Local businesses in my electorate stand to benefit from greater economic engagement with ASEAN, particularly in the international education, tourism, agricultural, fisheries, engineering and professional services sectors. Educational scholarships under the New Colombo Plan have fostered a high level of international cooperation.
       </p>
       <p>
        In terms of national security, cooperation between our law enforcement agencies serves to combat transnational organised crime, including the illegal trafficking of drugs, prohibited weapons and persons, and money-laundering. Joint military exercises between our defence forces promote greater regional security and help combat the threat of terrorism. Australia has a proud record of providing foreign aid to developing ASEAN nations, and this has resulted in infrastructure projects being constructed to improve living standards and alleviate poverty. I support maintaining a reasonable level of foreign aid to promote the economic and social development of our neighbouring ASEAN nations, fostering good diplomatic relations and cooperation.
       </p>
       <p>
        It has been personally rewarding to be part of the Australian government team which has been actively fostering strategic economic partnerships with the member states which form the ASEAN regional alliance, paving the way for the private sector to take up opportunities and develop a common market with our closest trading partners in the region. My network of business contacts and personal relationships in the South-
