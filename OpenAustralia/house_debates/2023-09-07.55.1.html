        Today is 7 September, and it is the 10-year anniversary of the 2013 election, where some very fine individuals were elected to this place for the first time, including you, Deputy Speaker Claydon. It was also the election of possibly the most chaotic, disastrous government that this Commonwealth has ever seen. I am talking about the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government. Let's remember just how chaotic and disastrous they were. I may need more than 90 seconds. 'The least productive since 1971' was how they labelled the Abbott government. He brought back knighthoods. He tried to water down section 18C, and somebody in his team in the other place defended it and said it was your right to be a bigot. There was the ideological vandalism of climate change and the abolishing of the Climate Commission. The 2014 budget was so bad that rallies happened around the country to bust that budget. Turnbull's government was paralysed by division, right-wing opposition and a backbench. We had Gonski 2.0,

        2.0, Turnbull 2.0, and, in the middle of the citizenship crisis, he declared from the dispatch box 'and so the High Court shall rule'. Aren't we glad that period is over?
