        I rise to update the House on two very important commitments that were made at the last election by the Morrison government for my electorate of Robertson. We made a first of its kind commitment of $945,000 for the new and innovative Health on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Streets" rel="nofollow">
         The Streets
        </a>
        , or HoTS, program. This initiative involves a mobile health clinic for people experiencing homelessness, and it takes health care and support services to those sleeping rough across the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        . It works to ensure that when it comes to vital health care across the Central Coast, no-one falls through the gaps. The team of registered nurses provide comprehensive health assessments, including primary health, public and sexual health, mental health, and drug and alcohol services.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the last 12 months, Health on The Streets have had over 1,300 clinical interventions, helped to link over 100 people to ongoing
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        -led care, and conducted around 900 referrals to other health services. Outreach workers have also assisted 30 people to be permanently housed, with an additional 33 people helped to attain temporary accommodation options. This has made such a tremendous difference to the lives of every single person who was able to find that support. Health on The Streets has been particularly important during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the team detecting five active cases in our community and administering over 33 vaccinations. The team partner with organisations including our local Coast Shelter and Mary Mac's Place, they're a truly valuable part of our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I really want to thank all of those involved for their genuine passion and care for others and the direct and important impact that this service is having on many people across the Central Coast. I personally very strongly advocate the work that this particular service does and will continue to advocate very strongly for it.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to inform the House that the funding agreement between the federal government and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast Council
        </a>
        has been signed for the $8.25 million redevelopment at the Peninsula Recreation Precinct in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umina_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Umina Beach
        </a>
        , which means that council will have the funds to get on with the job of planning and constructing these new, improved facilities. This has been a very frustrating experience for stakeholders engaged in this process. With the funding agreement signed, though, it means a new skate park; two separate sports facilities, each with a clubroom, storage, change rooms, toilets and a canteen; and surrounding works.
       </p>
       <p>
        These upgrades are really important for the Umina United Eagles Soccer Club, the Umina 'Bunnies' junior rugby league club and the Southern Spirit Cricket Club, who have worked to make this project a reality, and of course for so many young skateboarders here on the peninsula, who need to see this skate park upgraded. We know that the clubs that use Umina Oval as well are growing at a very rapid pace, and they need amenities that are state of the art. That's why it's so important that we work to get the funding agreement right. I want to see the shovels in the ground as soon as possible and will continue to advocate until this project is delivered.
