        Berowra Public School recently celebrated its 125th anniversary of teaching and learning at that school. It was the first school in Berowra, and started in a teacher's house with just 14 students back in 1894. One hundred and twenty-five years later, the school has over 400 students.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently, the students and teachers put on a whole-school assembly to celebrate this significant milestone, inviting parents as well as former students and teachers. The talented school choir, string ensemble, recorder group, dance group and band entertained fellow students and guests for the morning. A 25-year-old time capsule was opened and a new time capsule was stocked with messages and items for students to open in a further 25 years.
       </p>

        Former student Councillor Nathan Tilbury; former teachers Helen Vincent and

        ; and former principal Lester Marquet attended and shared tales about the rich history of the school. They reminisced about their time studying or teaching, and encouraged students to continue to strive for educational excellence. I want to acknowledge the leadership of acting principal Chantal Mamo and the 125-year committee: Deb Pickering, Kelly Lukic, Brooke Westwood, Brittani Lloyd, Karen Kitchener, Jenny Smith and Alison Withford organised a great celebration.
       </p>
       <p>
        Berowra Public School is a testament to the students, staff and broader Berowra community, who strive for educational excellence and continue to believe in the difference that education makes. Congratulations to Berowra Public on 125 years of outstanding teaching and learning. This school well and truly lives up to its motto of 'Service Before Self'. I was honoured to be present at the occasion.
