        My question is to the Prime Minister. Today is the last question time before the election. Given that the Prime Minister's budget still continues with $14 billion of cuts to public schools, including over $15 million from schools in Corangamite, and still continues with cuts to hospitals, including a $4 million cut to Concord Hospital in Reid, will the Prime Minister finally tell the Australian people why

          I thank the member for his question. The Leader of the Opposition is incapable of telling the truth. He's completely incapable of telling the truth. That's what I suspect we will hear tonight when he comes to this despatch box and continues to tell these untruths.

            What he won't tell you tonight is that under our government, over the last five years, funding from the Commonwealth for hospitals has increased by 63.2 per cent. In
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
             New South Wales
            </a>
            that's up by 56.4 per cent. In Victoria it's up by 54.8 per cent. In Queensland it's up by 95.6 per cent. In Tasmania it's up by over 40 per cent. Here in the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
             ACT
            </a>
            it's up by over 100 per cent. Under our government we have been increasing investment in hospitals all around the country, and the same is true of schools. Under our government, when it comes to public schools and state schools, those funded over the last five years, funding is up by 62 per cent. Funding for preschools has also gone up by 87 per cent. This is the record of our government. Investing in the essential services: that's what a strong economy does, and that's what managing a budget does. It enables you to invest in these essential services.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Labor Party will go to the Australian people and won't tell them the truth about what the government has done. I'll tell you what they will do: they'll tax Australians and they'll tax them hard. They'll tax them when they're old, they'll tax them when they're young and they'll tax them at all stages. That's what they'll do, because that's what the Labor Party always do. When they run out of their own money, they come running after the hard-earned savings and the earnings of Australians.
           </p>
           <p>
            At the next election, the choice will be all about the future when it comes to who the Prime Minister of this country is. The choice will be very clear. On this side of the House, if I'm elected again at the next election—I was elected as the member for Cook at the last election. At the next election there is a clear choice between myself as Prime Minister of this country leading the Liberal and the National team and the Leader of the Labor Party leading his team. It will be between myself as the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. But the election will be all about Australians and the choices that they want for themselves, and a stronger economy—
