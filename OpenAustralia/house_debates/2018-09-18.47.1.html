       <p>
        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development. Will the Deputy Prime Minister update the House on how good economic management allows the government to look after older Australians in rural and regional Australia, including in the electorate of Calare? What are the risks to older Australians retiring with confidence in regional areas?

         I thank the member for Calare for his question.

         is ageing faster than the capital cities, according to the Regional Australia Institute. That is the truth. Getting the books in better shape means that we can, as the government, share the benefits in regional Australia and build the future our regions want, expect and, most of all, deserve. That's what we want to do for the 8.8 million Australians who live in regional Australia, who make their homes there and who want to retire there. We want to build a better future for them.
        </p>
        <p>
         It means that we can invest in making country communities more liveable, such as in the electorate of Calare. It includes the $1.9 billion investment in the Blayney CentrePoint Sport &amp;

         upgrade through the Building Better Regions Fund. I've seen that particular facility. I know it needs upgrading. I visited it with the member for Calare in April. I saw firsthand what an asset an upgraded facility would be for the local community, particularly for seniors and particularly for people with a disability. A strong economy means that we can invest in aged-care beds in the regions, including the 73 beds in Lithgow and in Calare that we as Liberals and Nationals have delivered. That's what we've done; we've delivered it. It means fewer people in Lithgow will have to travel away from home; they can get the care they deserve locally. The member for Calare knows that. It's not just the here and now; it's for future generations.
        </p>
        <p>
         The member for Calare had a lot to do with the Murray-Darling rural medical schools network, and what a good initiative it is. Dr

         is an orthopaedic and spinal surgeon from the central west of

         . He has practices in Orange, Bathurst, Parkes and Forbes. He said—the member for Hunter, you should listen to this—'We need more people who not only want to train in the country but want to return to the country to live and practice. The Murray-Darling rural medical school network will help change the perception that you have to train in the big hospitals in the city to be a good doctor. I would hope that by educating and training more medical students out in the country where they can work with their peers and form friendship networks they will want to settle and practice in the country once they've completed their training.' You might knock Dr David Bell, but he's telling the truth. It is a shame that a few more of you didn't listen to the likes of Dr David Bell.

        <p>
         It is all about making choices to protect those senior Australians who built the country and not raid their savings, because that's what that lot opposite want to do if ever they get into government. They want to bring a wrecking ball into the savings of those people who've worked hard, who've helped build our country and who've help protect our country in its darkest time of need. That's what those opposite want to do. They want to whack retirees. They want to whack veterans' savings. That's all they stand for. I don't know why you don't get on board with the likes of Dr David Bell.
