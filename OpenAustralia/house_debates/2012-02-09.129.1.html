        The House will appreciate that on many occasions in this parliament I have spoken about the work of our police in protecting the community. Indeed, on Police Remembrance Day I specifically spoke about those police officers who paid the ultimate sacrifice in serving our community. Today I speak about another amazing and dedicated group of people who make invaluable contributions in respect to the safety and wellbeing of our society. Ambulance officers play a vital role in modern society, but it is not without a high degree of personal risk and sacrifice.

        had received advice from the Australian search and rescue service that a distress beacon had been activated and SCAT was requested to respond. This 41-year-old father of three was an extraordinary man; clearly, a man of great courage and part of a highly trained team of men and women committed to serving our community. With over 15 years experience in the New South Wales ambulance service, he was dedicated to saving lives. Michael Wilson received many awards and commendations for his acts of bravery. He was not only a highly respected paramedic but an exemplar to his profession.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the rescue on Christmas Eve, Michael was being lowered from a helicopter when, inexplicably, he appears to have fallen and become wedged between two boulders. When he slammed into the rocks Michael sustained critical injuries. Unable to free himself the helicopter line had to be cut. Given the hour and the emerging darkness, this meant that Michael could not receive assistance until a fellow paramedic, Tim Thisleton, was able to abseil down a rock face. Tragically, Michael died in his friend's arms.

       <p>
        Michael Wilson's death was the first time in more than three decades that a New South Wales ambulance officer was killed on duty. I had the honour of attending his funeral, along with hundreds of friends from the ambulance service, police force, fire and emergency service personnel and a veritable sea of blue flying suits, worn by the men and women of the helicopter rescue service. Sydney's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_James" rel="nofollow">

        church was literally swamped by those wanting to pay their respect to an heroic and extraordinary man who did extraordinary things for our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        For many years my brother, Gerard, was also a paramedic in the New South Wales ambulance service, which gives for me a more poignant perspective to this dreadful accident. Not only was there a deep and profound sense of loss by Michael's family, and the great sadness borne by his friends and work colleagues, this tragic death causes us to reflect on Michael's role and that of all members of the New South Wales ambulance service. Clearly, Michael Wilson epitomised the very qualities that the community is rightly proud of. I speak of the honour, the dedication and the commitment to his profession. For our ambulance officers this often goes unrecognised or, worse, taken for granted until we need their assistance.
       </p>
       <p>
        Notwithstanding the inherent risks and challenges, these men and women accept their duty and do what is necessary to save lives. It takes a special type of person to undertake this role, and on behalf of a very grateful community I thank them. Michael Wilson made a difference for the better in our community, and his family is right to be immensely proud of his contribution. I offer my most sincere condolences to Michael's wife, Kellie, his daughters, Eliza and Grace, and his son, Hugo. On behalf of this parliament I assure them that he will not be forgotten. The incredible courage, commitment and dedication to service that Michael showed will serve as an inspiration to us all. May Michael Wilson rest in peace.
