        I rise today to speak about the great work that the Palmerston Men's Shed does in my electorate of Solomon. Earlier this month I visited the Men's Shed and had the opportunity to meet with the president,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Craven" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and the secretary, Leigh Travis, as well as some of the other members. I was able to see the great contribution this community organisation makes with the local community. These guys are making bird houses, salt and pepper shakers, and bowls. They are even making a big trailer. They sell most of their goods at the Coolalinga Rural Markets to make themselves sustainable.

        The Palmerston Men's Shed is a community workshop area for men to gather, to develop skills and to undertake different activities. As we all know, essentially the Men's Shed is about increasing the wellbeing of men by fostering social connection and increasing their self-esteem. The Palmerston Men's Shed plays a very important role in our community by keeping men active and contributing to their mental health and physical wellbeing. I encourage all Darwin and Palmerston residents to become a part of this great organisation by either getting your men involved or contributing by way of donation. For more details on the Palmerston Men's Shed, people can contact my office or they can have a look on my website where there are connections to the Palmerston Men's Shed.
