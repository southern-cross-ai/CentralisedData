        It's a privilege to move this motion inviting the President of the Philippines, His Excellency Ferdinand R Marcos Jr, to address the parliament tomorrow. Australia and the Philippines have been working together for almost 80 years. Our partnership is one grounded in a commitment to peace, stability and prosperity in the region. Now, as we look to the future, we want to deepen engagement across defence and security, trade and investment, and people-to-people links.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia was proud to elevate our bilateral ties with the Philippines to a strategic partnership during the Prime Minister's visit to Manila last year. This elevation reflects the deep connections we share through business, education, tourism and family, including more than 400,000 people of Filipino heritage that call Australia home. President Marcos's address to parliament tomorrow will be an equally historic occasion, celebrating our strong relationship.

        Question agreed to.
