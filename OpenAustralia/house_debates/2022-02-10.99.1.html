        I'm aware of the dispute that's gone back and forth, and I don't want to enter too much into the argument now. But the concept of offensive words applies to the words themselves, regardless of whether they apply to a current member or a former member of parliament. But obviously there is a higher level of protection for members of parliament and judges under the standing orders in the way they're described. Given that, for example, a year earlier than the time that was being referred to the United Kingdom had a formal policy of appeasement, we're potentially going down a path where history can't be discussed in different terms because of views that were quite rightly formed by all of us further down the track. I'd simply ask, if it is possible, for you to have an opportunity to reflect on the ruling that you've made, rather than us immediately establishing a precedent. You may choose to refer it to the Speaker himself, and I would invite you, having reflected on it, to provide further advice either to the House itself or, if you deem it more appropriate, directly to the Leader of the House and to me because, potentially, we've gone a significant way further than we've gone before in the rulings that have been made today. But I don't want to litigate it further at this point.

         I thank the Manager of Opposition Business. I will take it under consideration. I stand by the ruling at this point in time. I will speak to the Speaker and, if it suits the Manager of Opposition Business, either I or the Speaker will address you and the Leader of the House in response. In addressing this issue, it is a very serious statement to make that you are appeasing or sympathising with a group who murdered many millions of people. That is a fact. These are things that we will consider. I appreciate that there is a bit of uncertainty, and we will look into that. It is a very, very serious remark to be made in this parliament and that's why I've ruled as I have, but I will absolutely take it under consideration and refer to the Speaker.
