        While I am down here in Canberra, back home in my electorate of Moreton things are getting very, very damp. My kids are home from school. Their spirits are pretty high, but a lot of other people are very worried as ex-tropical Cyclone Debbie heads down the Queensland coast. So far in my electorate, the suburbs of Archerfield, Oxley, Corinda, Rocklea, Fairfield, Moorooka—where I live—Willawong and Yeerongpilly have been affected. Some of those suburbs are on the majestic

        , but

        and its tributaries are also very high today and rising.

        I obviously urge everyone in Moreton to take care. Please stay off the roads, if you possibly can. Do not go rubbernecking. I know people love to go down to some of these low-lying areas but, if they can possibly help it, they should stay away. Please make sure your children who are home from school do not go out and play in the floodwaters. If you need help with water inundation, please call the

        on 132500 or the

        on 34038888. Of course, if there is anything life threatening, please call 000. All schools in Moreton—and, indeed, all over South-East Queensland—are closed today. I know already that there are some private schools that will not be open tomorrow. You need to check the school websites where you can.

        Unfortunately, my Lions seniors health and wellbeing expo had to be cancelled this morning so that we could keep people off the road, but I will try to reschedule that with a few local events. Please check your letterboxes for invitations for these health forums.
