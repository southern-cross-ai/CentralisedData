       <p>
        Saeed—not his real name—is currently in Villawood detention centre, threatened with deportation. He is a stateless man from a religious minority who faced persecution in Iraq, where the Australian government wants to forcibly return him. He fears for his life if he is sent there. He sought asylum in Australia in 2012. He arrived with his brother, who was granted protection in Australia, but despite identical circumstances Saeed's claim was denied. Saeed does not speak English and was never told that he had the right to appeal the decision to deny him protection. I am informed that important information about his case was not considered by the department at the time, but Minister Dutton has refused to give Saeed an opportunity to have his case reassessed.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is what happens when an immigration system is set up to punish people seeking asylum rather than welcoming them. People close to him have described him as a peaceful family man. He has spent three weeks on a hunger strike this month and is too sick to travel. Serious concerns have been raised about his health.
       </p>
       <p>
        Saeed's lawyer has been denied access to speak with her client at important times. The immigration department even drove him overnight to Sydney to avoid scrutiny. Melburnians have held vigils outside the MITA detention centre, and I acknowledge my constituents who have peacefully stood up for justice for Saeed. Over 17,000 people have now signed a petition calling on Qantas and other airlines not to facilitate the deportation of Saeed to a place where his life would be in danger. I call on Minister Dutton to stop this deportation and allow Saeed's case to be reassessed.
