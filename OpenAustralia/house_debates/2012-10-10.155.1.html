       <p>
        On Monday I visited the San Remo Men's Shed. It is one of the strong Men's Shed groups that are operating in Shortland electorate. There are a number of dedicated men who go along there and work every week. The beauty of Men's Sheds is that not only are the guys who are involved doing some very constructive activities and actually helping out in the community and raising funds for their shed; they are also providing support to one another.
       </p>
       <p>
        I spent about an hour and a half at the Men's Shed, talking to the guys. They raised a number of issues with me that they think are very important not only for our area but for the nation. For me it was an exercise in learning how they felt about various things and how important it is as a member of parliament to actually listen to what your constituents have to say.
       </p>
       <p>
        When I am back in my electorate one of my priorities is to visit and talk to community groups and to meet with constituents to find out the issues that are of great concern to them. Monday was no exception. I got some insight into a number of problems and issues locally. One personal issue was something we can resolve. You can pick up the personal issues, the general issues and the local issues. In addition to that, the group asked me for a new Australian flag and I have been able to organise for them to receive that.

        The Central Coast is a very special area in the southern part of my electorate. I would like to join with the member for Dobell in the comments he made earlier about the

         In accordance with standing order 193, the time for members' constituency statements has concluded. I suggest it may suit the convenience of the Federation Chamber to suspend proceedings until the Higher Education Support Amendment (Maximum Payment Amounts and Other Measures) Bill 2012 is referred to this chamber by the House.
        </p>
        <p>
         Proceedings suspended from 10:11 to 10:38
