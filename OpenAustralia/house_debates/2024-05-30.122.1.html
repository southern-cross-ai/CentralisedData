       <p>
        Volunteers are the lifeblood of our communities. During Volunteer Week I had the great pleasure of launching the inaugural Hasluck Volunteer Awards to celebrate the dedication and achievements of our many volunteers and their essential organisations. I'm calling for nominations from the full spectrum of volunteer organisations and sectors, including emergency services, environment, multicultural affairs, youth, disability, community sport and online community forums, to recognise the tireless work the administrators do to support those communities. Just in case that's not enough, I welcome further suggestions from the community to ensure that no volunteer effort goes unrecognised.
       </p>
       <p>
        Already we've had many nominations, reflecting a wide range of activities, including an organisation providing food security to those in need by coordinating with businesses to prepare hampers that feed families for a week. They support domestic violence victims, new migrants and new community members. Another nomination is for a local working through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Lions Club
        </a>
        and assisting their community in countless ways. Yet another is a nomination of an individual who coordinates and runs fundraisers focusing on environmental and community needs.
       </p>
       <p>
        My application form suggests using 100 words to describe the volunteer activities, but I've been sternly told that 100 words is simply not enough. I've seen nominations for someone who is running a multicultural centre welcoming newcomers and coordinating language lessons to help them stay connected with their homelands and cultures. Another nominee provides skill development to help new arrivals find work. Then there's the constituent who uses physical challenges as a platform for an array of volunteer activities, fostering connections across her community. There's more, including bushfire planning and preparation volunteers, sport volunteers and crosswalk attendants, who play critical roles for our schools. This short selection of stories highlights the remarkable contributions of our volunteers across Hasluck. But I know there are many more out there, and I'd love those nominations to flow through.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm immensely proud to be part of a community in Hasluck that has so many engaged and committed individuals. I'm also proud that the Albanese government has committed substantial funds in the budget to support our volunteering efforts. One nomination described a volunteer as someone who 'embodies adaptability, stepping up whenever needed, even tackling unfamiliar tasks solo to ensure continuity'. This is a description of pure dedication. Nominations for the Hasluck Volunteer Awards are open until 1 July, with an awards ceremony to follow in August. I urge community members to visit my website and nominate the wonderful people they know and work with. We need to celebrate our successes and to recognise the quiet heroes amongst us.
