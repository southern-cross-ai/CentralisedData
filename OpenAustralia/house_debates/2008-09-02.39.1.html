        On behalf of the Chair of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on

         Public Works
        </a>
        , the member for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Adelaide" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , I present the sixth report for 2008 of the committee, relating to the proposed fit-out of new leased premises for the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations at Block 9, Section 31, Canberra; the construction of the Australian pavilion at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shanghai_World_Expo" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        2010, China; the bridging of Kings Avenue over
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkes_Way" rel="nofollow">
         Parkes Way
        </a>
        at the Russell roundabout, Canberra; and the construction of new warehousing facilities at Wadsworth Barracks, East Bandiana, Victoria.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.
       </p>
       <p>
        by leave—The report I have just tabled, on referrals tabled March-June 2008, addresses four proposals to the committee made in March and June 2008. First is the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations proposed fit-out of new leased premises at Block 9, Section 31, Canberra,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        , valued at $66 million. That proposal aims to co-locate office accommodation for the department, consolidate existing leases and provide employees with a modern, efficient work environment. Second is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
        </a>
        proposal for the construction of the Australian pavilion at the Shanghai World Expo 2010, valued at $49.38 million. The pavilion aims to promote Australia’s interests and strengthen ties with China through participation in the World Expo. Third is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Capital_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         National Capital Authority
        </a>
        proposal for the bridging of Kings Avenue over Parkes Way at the Russell Roundabout, Canberra, ACT, valued at $26.6 million. These works propose to improve transport links between the city,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        and the airport and redevelop one of Canberra’s worst traffic black spots. The last is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Defence
        </a>
        proposal for the construction of new warehouse facilities at Wadsworth Barracks, East Bandiana, Victoria, valued at $36.37 million. The improved warehouses will enhance operational capability and provide efficient logistical and warehousing support for Defence.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee has reported on an exception-only basis on issues that it thought warranted further comment. However, many more issues were raised at the public hearings, and I would urge those interested in any of these works to supplement the report with the transcripts and submissions available on the committee’s website. In all cases, the committee recommended that the House resolve that the works be carried out. It also made a further recommendation that Defence report back to the committee on the outcome of their third community consultation meeting on the new warehousing facilities, in response to the concerns of local residents.
       </p>
       <p>
        The chair of the committee has asked me to thank the members and senators on the committee for their work in relation to these inquiries. I commend the reports to the House.
