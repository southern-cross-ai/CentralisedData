        I rise today to recognise the launch of an important new men's health initiative in my electorate led by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Bulldogs" rel="nofollow">
         Western Bulldogs
        </a>
        football club and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedon_Ranges" rel="nofollow">
         Macedon Ranges
        </a>
        and North Western Melbourne Medicare Local. At present, men living in Melbourne's west are not healthy. There are areas in my electorate where over 50 per cent of men are overweight or obese and where one in three men smoke. The consequences are heart disease, lung disease and the lowest average life expectancy in Victoria. To address this, the Western Bulldogs

         AFL
        </a>
        team have created the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sons_of_the_West" rel="nofollow">
         Sons of the West
        </a>
        community health initiative, which is designed to support men living and working in Melbourne's west.
       </p>
       <p>
        Partly based on a similar program run successfully by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_Football_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Liverpool Football Club
        </a>
        in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        , the program aims to engage up to 2,000 men in Melbourne's west to promote healthy living and prevent disease. Sons of the West is an innovative example of how to engage men and encourage them to take control of their own health. The 12-week program emphasises activities that are social and fun and alternates training events with barbecues, health checks, comedy nights and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIY" rel="nofollow">
         DIY
        </a>
        training. The men undertaking this programme will train with legends of the Western Bulldogs football team, including

        I attended the launch of the Sons of the West and was inspired by the level of enthusiasm felt by the players and the organisers towards the initiative.

       </p>
       <p>
        I applaud the Western Bulldogs for creating a program that inspires men of Melbourne's west to start looking after their own health, and I would like to thank everyone involved for their hard work in bringing the program to life, including ambassador Shane Delia; Western Bulldogs president,

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohan_Connolly" rel="nofollow">
         Rohan Connolly
        </a>
        for their work at the launch. I also commend the support of platinum partners
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_University" rel="nofollow">
         Victoria University
        </a>
        and Vic Health.
       </p>
       <p>
        In particular, I would like to thank a major partner, Macedon Ranges and North Western Melbourne Medicare Local, for providing the funding so that the Sons of the West program can take place. This program is just one example of the fantastic work our Medicare locals do in providing tailored and coordinated support to the healthcare needs of our community. Unfortunately, the benefits of the Sons of the West program do not seem to be appreciated by the Abbott government. Not content with slashing $80 billion from health and education last night, they have taken the axe to Medicare locals as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Sons of the West program is a fantastic health initiative that should have a bright future. It addresses the primary health concerns of men in Melbourne's west in a way that is fun and uniquely designed for men in Melbourne's west.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
         The Abbott
        </a>
        government should be encouraging programs like this, not slashing their funding sources and hampering their effectiveness.
