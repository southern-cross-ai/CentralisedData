        Regrettably, climate change still doesn't get the attention it deserves in this place even though it's one of the biggest threats to our environment, economy and future. Indeed, Australia's response is grossly inadequate, and while signing up to the Paris Agreement was a good start, if we don't have a serious plan to tackle climate change, then it will be much too little much too late. The only solution is to move as soon as possible to zero net carbon emissions and zero reliance on fossil fuels. That's why I've called on the government and the opposition to commit to both by 2030. Yes, that is a very ambitious target. But now more than ever we need ambition, and now more than ever we need strong leadership. There is simply no alternative.

        Many of my constituents are concerned with this issue, which is why earlier this year I was presented with the Community Climate Petition, containing hundreds of signatures from people in Denison who agree that climate change is a serious issue needing to be addressed, and because they think the government isn't doing enough. I know that many of my colleagues have been presented with similar petitions. Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to table the petition.

        Leave is granted.
