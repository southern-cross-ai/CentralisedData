        My question is to the Prime Minister: 48-year-old Nicole lost her job in March and is looking for a full-time position. She says that job ads which express a preference for younger workers eligible for the hiring credit are absolutely discriminatory; they may as well write: 'If you're over this age, please don't even read the advert.' What does the Prime Minister say to Nicole?

         I thank the member for her question. And, whether it's in the member's electorate or anywhere else around this country, what Australians can take great heart from is that, at the time of our greatest need in generations, the government, working together with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
          Reserve Bank
         </a>
         , has invested more than half a trillion dollars to ensure that Australia comes through the COVID-19 recession, frankly, almost better than any other developed economy in the world today. This has been a response of unprecedented scale, of unprecedented expanse, to deal with the many challenges that exist in bringing Australia through the COVID-19 recession. Whether that was the immediate need for a lifeline of support through JobKeeper and JobSeeker, and the measures that went to apprentices as well, to keep apprentices in work, or through to the longer term initiatives that have involved our advanced manufacturing sector, and everything in between—bringing forward investment decisions, bringing forward hiring decisions, and also delivering the tax relief that enables Australians to bring forward their decisions as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         That is an economic recovery plan that is working in this country and is reflected in the rebound in confidence that we have seen. A comeback in confidence that has been matched by a comeback in jobs, a comeback in investment, and a comeback in the ability of Australians all around this country to plan for their future with confidence. And, as we come into this Christmas period, and as we meet as a national cabinet also tomorrow and we continue the process of reopening this country safely and ensuring that it can remain safely open, the rest of the world looks at Australia and says 'How have they done it? We would like to be able to achieve the same.' And that was the message I had from President-elect Biden this morning when I spoke to him. And that is the message I get from leaders all around the world. Earlier this week I had the discussion with the Prime Minister of Israel and the Prime Minister of Denmark, and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_Norway" rel="nofollow">
          Prime Minister of Norway
         </a>
         , the Prime Minister of Greece and the Prime Minister of Austria, and they have looked at Australia and they've seen what we've been able to achieve. Now, that does not lessen at all the significant blow that Australians have suffered during the course of this COVID-19 recession. But Australians have known and will always know that my government has their back—and this Leader of the Opposition is watching his.
