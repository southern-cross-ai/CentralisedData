       <p>
        It is my great pleasure to inform the House that, on 1 August this year, the third annual Fadden Seniors Expo and Forum will be taking place at the Jupiter's Pavilion near Parklands Showground on the corner of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_Street" rel="nofollow">
         Smith Street
        </a>
        and Parklands Drive, Parklands. For those who remember the Fadden seniors forum last year, about 1,000 people were in attendance with almost 100 service providers and stands. All of it was free to provide services and information to senior Australians.
       </p>

        the entire day. We are very lucky to have my good friend and colleague the Hon. Bronwyn Bishop MP, the shadow minister for seniors, there to speak about the issues confronting seniors and to answer a range of questions. I am very proud to announce that this year's Fadden Seniors Expo and Forum's major sponsor is INOX Supreme Lubricants. INOX is an outstanding company that produces some of the world's finest lubricants and probably the only lubricants that are not petroleum based. Our silver sponsors are Snore Australia, Vision Centre

        . We will have over $2,000 in lucky door prizes, all donated for the community by great organisations that include Eye Cue Security, the Islander Resort Hotel, our great friends Telstra, the wonderful people of Zarraffa's Coffee—thank you to Kenton and Rachael—and Goldstein's Bakery and Pie Shop. Water will be donated by Wet Fix.

        The beauty of putting on massive events like this that are completely and utterly free for the community is that they are sponsored by so many of our partners within the community and that sponsorship allows these events to be free. We will be sending out over 15,000 invitations to the third annual Fadden Seniors Expo and Forum and we expect over 1,500 people to attend. The range of exhibitors providing free information services and stands will include Veterans' Affairs, BreastScreen Queensland, National Seniors Australia, Gold Coast Stroke Support,

        This is an enormous number of services all under one roof on one day, completely and utterly free for the entire northern Gold Coast to come along to. The parking there is simple and it is free; it is at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast_Parklands" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast Parklands
        </a>
        . There is enough parking for everyone to attend. There will be morning tea and lunch, again, provided to the community free of charge as a community event to inform, to provide services and to send the message that we care about our seniors and that it is important to get information to them. This is an opportunity in a one-stop shop to come along and see, hear, learn, listen, engage and enjoy. I welcome all senior Australians in the northern Gold Coast community to come along on 1 August 2012 from 9 am to 2.30 pm to the Jupiter's Pavilion, Parkland Showground, on the corner of Smith Street and Parklands Drive, Parklands. At the very least, can I say that it is an amazing treat spending a day with the legendary Normie Rowe, having him sing the national anthem, MC the day and having him available to chat with. It is a real treat and experience. I look forward to welcoming all Gold Coasters there.
