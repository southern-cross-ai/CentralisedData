        My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm his emissions reduction minister has been embroiled in four scandals this year, routinely failed to disclose his interests, has questions over an $80 million water purchase involving the former Deputy Prime Minister, has not declared shares in a company being investigated for poisoning critically endangered grasslands involving the now Treasurer and is part of a criminal investigation into the use of a fraudulent document, involving the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister himself? How many more government members have to be dragged into this—

          For a start, I can confirm that the Leader of the Opposition can't get a question out in 30 seconds! But I can confirm this about the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction: he has introduced the default market offer, which puts price caps on for our electricity consumers. He has committed to establishing the $1 billion Grid Reliability Fund, which secures Australia's energy future. He has delivered a $370 million investment into hydrogen and announced the National Hydrogen Strategy. He has put an end to dodgy discounts and late payment fees from the big electricity retailers. He has implemented the Retailer Reliability Obligation. He has passed the big-stick legislation. It was sought to be opposed by those opposite, so we took it to the election; they backed us at election and the opposition rolled over. He delivered the Business Energy Advice Program. He advanced our gas reform package. He has established the Liddell Taskforce. He has invested in four hydrogen and one bioenergy projects. He has agreed to underwrite the

          -Queensland interconnector. He has invested in two electric vehicle development projects and he's opened formal negotiations with the

          . And that's just recently.
         </p>
         <p>
          What I like is that we've got a Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction with emissions going down. He's getting on with the job like all of my colleagues. He is creating jobs. He is getting electricity prices under control, concluding trade agreements, guaranteeing funding for essential services in health and education, looking after our national security, protecting us against terrorists, ensuring we're taking action on countering foreign interference, ensuring we're taking action on waste management and getting plastics out of our ocean, and bringing forward $3.8 billion worth of infrastructure investment to invest in our economy.
         </p>
         <p>
          For the last six months, and before then, our government has just been getting on with the job. Those opposite are just getting on with their grubby smears and political games because they can't face up to the fact that they were given a message on 18 May: they don't want your higher taxes, they don't want your job-destroying emissions reduction targets, they don't want the fact that you blow a budget any time you see it. Those opposite were rejected, and they've been sulking ever since.
