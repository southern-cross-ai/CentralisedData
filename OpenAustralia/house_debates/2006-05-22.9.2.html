       <p>
        On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the committee’s report entitled
        <i>
         Australia’s defence relations with the United States
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.
       </p>
       <p>
        The security treaty between Australia,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        and the United States of America, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZUS" rel="nofollow">
         ANZUS
        </a>
        treaty, which came into force on 29 April 1952 is a key element supporting Australia’s national security. The treaty has operated for more than 50 years and still remains relevant in a strategic environment increasingly challenged by terrorism and non-state actors. It is as a result of this environment that the treaty was first invoked following the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States. Since World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
         II
        </a>
        , Australia and the United States have developed strong defence relations. In particular, the last decade has seen a new level of defence relations encompassing Australian involvement in the first
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War" rel="nofollow">
         Gulf War
        </a>
        and Australian involvement in the US led coalition in Afghanistan and Iraq.
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence given to the committee was overwhelmingly in favour of the alliance and the security that it provides for Australia. There was some discussion about the ongoing relevance of the treaty and whether there was a need to enhance it to more broadly reflect contemporary strategic needs. Whilst there was little support for renegotiating the treaty, some groups suggested that traditional alliances will need to adjust considerably to defeat the asymmetric threats faced by Western allies in the 21st century. Other groups cautioned that Australia should be more careful in how it manages the alliance to ensure Australia’s interests are not subsumed by those of its larger alliance partner.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee, through its inquiry, has examined how Australia’s alliance with the US impacts on the security of the Asia-Pacific region. Evidence given to the inquiry strongly supported US engagement in the Asia-Pacific region and indicated that Australia’s relationship with the US is seen by most countries as a positive influence on regional security. The committee found that Australia and the US could do more to encourage the development of democratic processes in the security forces of Indonesia and it has encouraged the US to lift legislative restrictions on US training assistance for the Indonesian military. The committee has also considered the impact on the Australia-US defence relationship of the emergence of a more powerful and assertive China. The committee found that Australia’s relationships with both the US and China are such that Australia has the potential to act to ease any future tensions that might emerge between these powers.
       </p>
       <p>
        In undertaking this inquiry, the committee has received significant assistance from both the Australian and US departments of defence, including support for the delegation to the United States to seek its perspective on the alliance. During this interaction, even the most senior US military personnel have consistently reported on the excellence of the performance of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        in all training and operational activities. This performance bolsters Australia’s contribution to the alliance and earns great credit for the Australian Defence Force and Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The challenges faced by Australia in its region and internationally will continue to be met in concert with our US ally. Australia’s defence investment will ensure that Australia continues as an effective and reliable alliance partner as well as a self-reliant regional power.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank the staff of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for their excellent assistance in drafting this report and for their organisational help prior to the committee’s departure for the United States.

        <p>
         The
         <i>
          Australia’s defence relations with the United States
         </i>
         report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade confirms that Australia does indeed have a strong and ongoing relationship with the United States. This relationship was cemented during the dark days of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
          Second World War
         </a>
         and has continued since. It is a relationship which in many respects is based on similar national characteristics and shared values such as a love of freedom and, of course, our commitment to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZUS" rel="nofollow">
          ANZUS
         </a>
         treaty.
        </p>
        <p>
         This report deals with a number of issues that are important for the future of Australia, our relationship with the US and the continued cooperation of our armed forces. On most of these issues there was unanimous agreement and support among the committee, whilst we agreed to disagree on other issues. Certainly there was disagreement in the case of missile defence. The summary in chapter 5 of the report deals with that issue. It states:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Opinion was divided along party lines about whether Australia should continue to participate in the US Missile Defence Program ...
        </p>
        <p>
         Generally, the committee worked well on a non-political basis as we sought to come to grips with some very important issues of joint interest to Australia and the US. These issues included the importance of interoperability between our defence forces, an Australia-US joint training centre, combined exercises, intelligence sharing and the selection of defence equipment, which included discussion on the Abrams tank and, of course, a strong focus on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Strike_Fighter" rel="nofollow">
          Joint Strike Fighter
         </a>
         program. Indeed, as part of its deliberations the committee had the opportunity to visit the US and take a close look at the Abrams tank and also the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSF" rel="nofollow">
          JSF
         </a>
         acquisition, which is the subject of a current inquiry by the committee. Suffice to say that at this stage there is considerable concern regarding JSF cost blow-outs, capability, time frame and other concerns, which will be dealt with in the committee’s current inquiry and on which, in due course, the committee will report to the House.
        </p>
        <p>
         Perhaps the committee’s most important recommendation is recommendation 1, which states:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
          The Committee
         </a>
         recommends that the ANZUS Alliance be maintained in its current form and that the treaty be viewed not just as a specific set of requirements, rather as a statement of shared values capable of being acted upon in the face of evolving contemporary threats.
        </p>
        <p>
         The committee took a strong interest in the issue of interoperability. This of course flows from the fact that we are part of an important alliance with the United States and our troops are actively engaged in hostile operations in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Interoperability of equipment is important, but so too is the interoperability of troops on the ground. Joint training exercises are just as important as common equipment.
        </p>
        <p>
         The committee also had a strong focus on the Australian defence industry. Indeed, in chapter 7 of the report we said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Evidence to the inquiry has been supportive of the need to maintain an Australian defence industry as a vital component of defence capability.
        </p>
        <p>
         We also discussed impediments to access the US defence market and noted that the US defence market is ‘larger than the Defence markets in the next 15 to 20 countries combined’. We also noted that impediments to accessing these markets are ‘significant’.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is important to note that we deal with this issue in some depth in chapter 7. In 7.40, for instance, we say:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         However other US Legislation appears to be designed to protect inefficient US industries, an obvious example of which is the US ship building industry. Innovative Australian companies, like
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austal_Ships" rel="nofollow">
          Austal Ships
         </a>
         of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         or Incat of Tasmania, face significant hurdles in reaching their customers in the US ...
        </p>
        <p>
         But we also note in the report that there is a lot of happiness with products coming out of Australia, including, for instance, the Bushmaster vehicle and Australian fast ferry designs.
        </p>
        <p>
         In conclusion, I want to thank members of the committee staff, including Colonel Gus McLachlan for his contribution to the work of this committee, for his input into this report and also for his input into our trip to Iraq. It just goes to show that Armoured Corps soldiers, when guided by those with infantry experience, can indeed make a valuable contribution to the task at hand.
