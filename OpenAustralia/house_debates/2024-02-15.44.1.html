        Despite the rorting and controversy around the former government's Safer Communities Fund, there were still many worthy organisations that received funding. This is particularly the case where organisations were dedicated to supporting vulnerable young people to help them engage meaningfully with society, their schools and families. Two such organisations are active in Warringah and in the northern parts of Sydney. Youth

I have approached the Treasurer and the Attorney-General for support in this respect and I'm waiting—and hoping—that the government will see the sense in supporting such important organisations and ensuring they have ongoing funding. We can't let young people down. We must keep programs like Youth Up Front and StreetWork going.
