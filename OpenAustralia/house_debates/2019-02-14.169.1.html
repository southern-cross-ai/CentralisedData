        I've spent my life supporting jobs in my electorate—firstly as a field distributor, then as a publican and a business owner. I have continued to create and support jobs since I was elected in 2010, and I remain the only candidate in Flynn with a plan to create new jobs in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         Central Queensland
        </a>
        . Flynn is an enormous seat that has very many products and commodities for sale, whether it be coal, aluminium, cement or agricultural products. But I don't just focus on the big centres, because I know how important it is to support and create jobs and better infrastructure in all corners of my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since 2010, I've worked hard to get hundreds of millions of dollars in new health and education services, roads, bridges, business support and water infrastructure. This has included new training centres at the

         Gladstone High School
        </a>
        , and there are other projects, including a new

        service for Gladstone; a $60 million jobs package under the RJIP; fixing the notorious Kinkora roundabout; making sure the aluminium sector is exempt from the Renewable Energy Target, the old

        shires have benefited from this bridge replacement program. All of these are going to make life better and support hardworking business owners who employ a lot of people in their different sectors.
       </p>
       <p>
        We all know Labor's track record when it comes to governing, and I will quote it: not one mobile tower was built under Labor between 2007 and 2013, not one; higher taxes; and the cutting of services to regional areas. Just recently announced was the closure of the Emerald Agricultural College, established in 1972. Since then it has put through thousands of trainees. It is a vital part of the agriculture industry. Likewise, Longreach Pastoral College has been given the thumbs down by the state government and is about to close, at the end of this year. These are services that the bush does not need to have closed, but Labor do it to appease their Greens mates. Shutting down the coal industry is imminent, and I'm fighting tooth and nail every day, along with my colleagues in Central Queensland and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         North Queensland
        </a>
        , to keep the coal industry going. Mining adds something like $250 billion to the Australian economy, and they just want to thumb their noses at it. That's not on.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor have put a target on our backs. A 45 per cent emissions reduction target and a 50 per cent renewables target will see the coal industry disappear and very quickly. This all amounts to a carbon tax, which I'm vehemently opposed to. It will affect your grocery bills, your power bills, your jobs. There's no doubt about that. Their position on coal is clear. They will not allow new coal-fired power stations. They will not allow upgrading of existing coal-fired power stations in Queensland. We have eight power stations, seven owned by the state government. I don't see many employee car parks outside a solar farm or a wind farm. They don't exist.

        An honourable member: Because they're not there; there are no jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        They're not there. To transition from coal to the renewables, there are no jobs. The jobs that are created are in China and Europe, where the wind turbines and solar panels are made. That's where the jobs are, but, sadly, nothing for Central Queensland. With Gladstone—
