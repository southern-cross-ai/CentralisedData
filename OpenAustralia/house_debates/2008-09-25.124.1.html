        I rise today to speak about Blackmore
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_School" rel="nofollow">
         Primary School
        </a>
        and a couple of volunteers that define what is good about the school and the local community. Blackmore Primary School is located in the western part of the suburb of Girrawheen within Cowan. It is an excellent school under the leadership of Russell Hahn, the Principal, and Darrilyn Dawson, the Deputy Principal.
       </p>
       <p>
        Russell certainly defined the school as progressive, having received a $150,000 Investing in Our Schools grant during the previous government’s term. He has instituted a wireless
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICT" rel="nofollow">
         ICT
        </a>
        capacity in the school. Unfortunately, in 2007 the state government decided that this school would close, despite good infrastructure, excellent location advantages and car parking, and very strong local support from the community for its retention. I fear that it is now too late to save this school, and that is a tragedy.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to speak particularly about the two volunteers that the school has referred to me. I have known
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jackson" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Jackson
        </a>
        for several years now. He is a scripture teacher, a chaplain and a long-time advocate for the federal funding for chaplaincy programs that the Howard government introduced. He also has been there for the school for many years doing soup and breakfast clubs. He is always available to staff and students in the school community. He is a positive role model and a great support person. He is always willing to help anyone. I run into Peter Jackson all the time across a number of different organisations. He is really out there. He was the driving force behind the Sunshine Children’s Ministry in the Girrawheen area. I know that he helps Nigel and Linda Godfrey in the Children in Action Ministries as I see him each year when they go away for the Easter camp.
       </p>
       <p>
        The other person I would like to mention is Ray Villarroya. Ray is a positive influence on many of the children at Blackmore Primary School. He is a reliable volunteer and has mentored a significant number of children for many years. He is a vital part of the school and has joined my crime prevention program as well—Cowan Community Watch.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have always said that volunteers keep our community strong. Peter Jackson and Ray Villarroya are great examples of dedicated community advocates who are always there to help. I thank them for their effort and their commitment.
