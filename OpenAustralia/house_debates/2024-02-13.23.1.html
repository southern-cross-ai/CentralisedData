        Things are getting better for Australian workers. On this side of the House, we are committed to making sure that they get to earn more and keep more of what they earn. This week, the second part of the closing loopholes
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IR" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        reform has gone through. That means we are closing the loopholes to make sure that Australian workers are earning more and that they get a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.
       </p>
       <p>
        What we're also debating before the House is the stage 3 changes to the tax laws, which will see all Australian workers get a tax cut. That means in my electorate, a regional electorate, all our taxpayers will get a tax cut. Eighty-four per cent of workers will get a better tax cut under this reform—roughly about $14,000 extra in their pocket. That's what they will get from this government. That's what happens when you have a government that is committed to all workers receiving a fair outcome for what they do—all workers, not just the people who earn the higher incomes but the people who care for their parents, the people who look after their children and the people who cut their grass and clean their houses. That is what a responsible government that cares for all workers does, and that is what I'm so proud to do and why I stand here today—making sure that people earn more and keep more of what they earn.
