        Over the last eight years, the Andrews Labor government has delivered reform and infrastructure right across the state of Victoria. The big build has seen 67 level crossings removed while 69 new primary and secondary schools opened. Twenty-two hospitals have been built and upgraded, and more than 26,000 extra healthcare workers have been hired. The list goes on and on, but one thing is clear: only Labor is getting on with doing what matters.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Saturday, Victorians will go to the polls with an opportunity to re-elect this strong and ambitious Labor government. For months now, local Labor candidates have been working hard in their communities, listening to the priorities and concerns of their electorates. With the support of thousands of dedicated volunteers, and despite some unusually wet weather, these extraordinary candidates have knocked on doors, stood at local shopping strips and visited community groups in order to talk to Victorians about Labor's plan for our great state.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to particularly applaud my local Labor candidates: Steve McGhie in Melton, Michaela Settle in Eureka and Josh Bull in Sunbury. They have all served with dedication and passion as representatives of our community, and I look forward to continuing to work with them long into the future as we continue to deliver as state and federal Labor governments for our people in Hawke.
