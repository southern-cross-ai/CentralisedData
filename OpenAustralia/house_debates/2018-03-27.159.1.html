        I bemoan saying I have grievances, but they are grievances of joy in the sense that there are wonderful things happening in the Goldstein electorate. I celebrate the achievement of the people of Goldstein in building community. In particular, I see this day to day in the community engagements I go to. Only recently I went to the Beaumaris North Primary School fete, which is their biggest fundraiser. This whole-school community event is created by the combined efforts of parents, staff, students and the Goldstein local business community. Previous fundraising efforts have led to the new playground equipment, sporting facilities and a brand-new amphitheatre. This year, the funds raised will support the school's digital technologies program and the redevelopment of the MacDonald Reserve playground. The day's entertainment included Highett gymnastics, Kayla Skafte, Beaumaris North Primary School Seahorse Singers, Beaumaris North's Got Talent, the school's science experiment, Susie King Singing Students, and Denzil and Phil Para.

        I'd also like to acknowledge that, on 18 February, it was Firbank's fair at Sandringham House Campus. Huge thanks go to the parents and volunteers, including Rachael Robb, who is a co-president of the Sandringham House Parents' Association and a co-organiser of the fair committee; Tania Powell, who is the other co-president of the Sandringham House Parents' Association; and Francesca Marchetto, the fair manager, who organised the event and worked tirelessly to ensure the day was a great success. Thanks also to the event's major sponsors, Lexus of Brighton and Barry Plant Bayside. The weather, of course, tried to dampen the atmosphere or, more to the point, blow us all away; it was windy that day. But spirits, of course, remained high in the context.

        That same weekend,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Leonard's_College" rel="nofollow">
         St Leonard's College
        </a>
        hosted their Community Day Fair, the largest event in their calendar. Coordinated by a dedicated and passionate parent committee led by Bronwyn Betro, the fair organiser, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Davis" rel="nofollow">
         Stuart Davis
        </a>
        , who is the school principal, the entire college community, including current and past families and staff, came together to celebrate all that is great about St Leonard's College. I have to say, having been there, that it was a miraculous day in terms of not just the sunshine but the volume and the number of people who came together to support not just a school but a community and to build a sense of social connectedness, which was truly inspiring. It was huge. There was live entertainment; delicious food, including fabulous homemade jams and cakes; and a community market, as well as bidding on silent auction items. I have no doubt they did very well out of the exercise.

        Similarly, last Saturday I had the pleasure of attending the Regis Brighton Doggie Fashion Show. Pups strutting their stuff show the sometimes unique nature of the Goldstein community. Dogs are a big thing. Yes, as part of that, my pugs, Louis and Ella, made a star appearance, but they were not alone. Staff and friends brought their pooches to the park to, as it were, strut their stuff down the red carpet and be given awards for different categories ranging from best vocals to, of course, best costume. But it was really about the clients of Regis Brighton and helping them enjoy the day and particularly to have human as well as canine engagement. Of course, that's very important, particularly for many people who use aged care and miss out on the opportunity for as much social connection as we might get around this place or in the rest of the community. The event was proudly sponsored by Regis Aged Care and Dogue Brighton. The event showcased many activities and treats, such as face painting, a sausage sizzle, and doggy bags with costumes and toys for the dogs. One dog was even turned into a unicorn. I will leave it up to you to decide how that happens. Show-goers also had the opportunity to tour the Regis Aged Care facility in Brighton, which was probably necessary because, let's face it, it was bucketing down on the day. The day also included a pooch fashion parade, which I had the honour of judging. I am happy to say that, even though my dogs were participants in that, the dogs that presented, they did not win any awards. There was no ball tampering or cheating in the exercise. It was one where everything was above board. Huge thanks go particularly to Craig Rutherford and the wonderful friends at Regis Brighton for coordinating the day and making it such a great success.

        I was also very proud recently to be part of United Israel Appeal's 2018 campaign gala dinner. This is a major dinner held to fundraise for the Israel appeal and the incredible work that's been done to bring it all together. I express my particular thanks to my table host,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Goodman" rel="nofollow">
         Alice Goodman
        </a>
        , for inviting me and having me along at the dinner last week. But the real congratulations need to go to Hayley Southwick, who was the coordinator of the dinner and the president of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UIA" rel="nofollow">
         UIA
        </a>
        this year. She deserves commendation not just because of her incredible organisation and volunteering work but, critically, also because of the incredible narration skills throughout the evening against the backdrop of many videos trying to describe the incredibly important work the UIA does. It was, of course, another memorable celebration of Israel, particularly in the year of its celebration of the 70th anniversary of its foundation. We heard from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dennis_Prager" rel="nofollow">
         Dennis Prager
        </a>
        , a best-selling author, columnist and nationally syndicated radio talk show host who is based in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles" rel="nofollow">

        . He is famous not just for his radio talk show but also for his Prager University videos. If you haven't seen them, go online and type in 'Prager University'. It will be fantastic to hear about some of the wonderful work that they're doing.

        He spoke particularly not just about the critical role of Israel to the world and the Jewish people and their preparedness to support each other, but, critically, about the importance of Israel and its support for many countries, including ours. He also highlighted much of the hypocrisy that sits at the heart of many discussions around Israel, particularly how people seek to delegitimise the modern nation state and its purpose when they don't apply the same standards or principles, and that ultimately people are sometimes trying to use their criticism of Israel as a form of cloak or screen for anti-Semitism. There was also present the Israeli Ambassador to Australia,

         Mark Sofer
        </a>
        , and the sand master artist Sheli Ben-Nun. I'd also like to acknowledge Mark Leibler
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC" rel="nofollow">
         AC

        , the honorary life chairman of UIA Australia; the treasurer, Julian Black; the chairman of the Young UIA, David Skurnik; and all the other members of the Victorian executive committee.

        It followed, of course, only a few days prior, on 18 March, attending the In One Voice Festival, which is in Elsternwick—technically just outside the Goldstein electorate, on the margins, but providing an opportunity for the Jewish community to come together and celebrate as part of what's forming as a new precinct, a space for the Jewish community, as part of Melbourne's rich tapestry, around Elsternwick to celebrate traditions and values and food, of course, which goes straight to the heart of not just Jewish community events but also my waistline. Last year I acknowledged everybody who was involved, so this year I'm going to acknowledge the one person I didn't acknowledge last year: I thank Ross Lomazov, who came up to me and reminded me that I didn't mention him last year—and that was not my error, but it is one that we want to correct.

        On Saturday the 17th we had the Southern

        Radiothon.

         Parliament Street
        </a>
        —aptly named—in Brighton. They had their open day, encouraging people to join Southern FM as part of its subscription base as the foundation for a radio station that covers the Bayside and south-east of Melbourne. Southern FM is home to one of the most diverse ranges of programming on radio, including jazz, soul, rock, pop, R&amp;B, dance and country, as well as discussions of health and parenting, community news and local sport. I was very fortunate to be on it also recently, visiting Wizz Fizz Island in the northern part of Queensland—which, I will concede, is a metaphorical island—where you get the opportunity to talk about the wonderful music that you want to talk about. As a local representative, it was my honour to be on the show with Pauline. Like all good open days such as Southern FM had, there was the sausage sizzle, but I did not partake, because of the number of other events I did that day. I'd like to thank in particular Pauline O'Brien for the invitation to attend.

         , as I am sure any member who has engaged with them will know, are an incredibly impressive group who come together and support people through the latter stages of their life in keeping them physically, mentally and artistically active, and they do incredible work. Many thanks to the committee and management of Bayside U3A, including its new president, Tony Aplin, and secretary, Judy Sinclair, and also to acknowledge the wonderful work of David Hone, who was the retiring president.

         Finally, last Sunday I attended the Bayside Community Forum on Refugees and Aid. The forum was supported by the Bayside Church and its pastors, Rob and Christie Buckingham, who do a wonderful job and put on an excellent forum. Great thanks to the
