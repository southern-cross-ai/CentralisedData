        I rise to speak about my local community’s Relay for Life event. Cancer Council Queensland first held this event in October 2001, at which time it raised $70,000. This event is now held throughout Australia in many local communities, and this year there are over 30 relay events scheduled, with an expected fundraising total of $3.2 million. Relay for Life is an overnight community event organised annually by Cancer Council Queensland. It is 18 hours of fun, festivities and camaraderie to celebrate those who have survived cancer, to remember those who lost the battle and, importantly, to raise money for cancer research, support, education and early detection programs. Teams raise money by collecting donations or sponsors or by holding fundraising events. Relay team members must take turns to walk around the track through the entire 18 hours, making sure that at least one team member is on the track at all times.

        Last year I participated as a walker, with Senator Mark Furner, at the Pine Rivers Relay for Life. This past weekend, 20 and 21 September, Redcliffe held its inaugural Relay for Life at the Redcliffe Tigers

        Sporting Club at Rothwell. The walk commenced at 3 pm on Saturday and finished at 9 am on Sunday. The Redcliffe peninsula has an unrivalled sense of community, and the relay was a terrific occasion for everyone to come together and celebrate what makes our local area special and raise money for a very important cause. Highlights of the event included the survivors’ walk to kick off the relay and a moving candlelight ceremony in the evening to remember those we have lost to cancer. Major sponsors of the event included the

        This year I organised a team and filled the role of team leader, camping out and participating in the relay over the 18 hours. I would like to take the opportunity to thank all of the sponsors and walkers who supported the team. At final count we have raised $3,895 for the Cancer Council of Queensland. My team, the Petrie Possums, was entered with the generous help of Redcliffe Leagues Club; BallyCara Retirement Village;

        and Lillian Van Litsenburg; the Golden Ox Restaurant; and Commerce and Industry, Redcliffe. A total of $40,000 was raised, which is a great effort for the inaugural Redcliffe Relay for Life event. This figure was reached due to a spontaneous pledge by Des Webb, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Redcliffe Leagues Club, when we found out we had reached around $38,000 and he agreed to top it up to $40,000. I congratulate the Redcliffe community on this fantastic effort.
