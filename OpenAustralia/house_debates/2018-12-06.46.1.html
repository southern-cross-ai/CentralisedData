       <p>
        There's a new saying in this parliament and it's 'never say never' with the member for Fadden back on the front bench again under the Morrison government, but already back in protection. In question time yesterday, we found out that this minister, the Assistant Treasurer, is pretty much responsible for very little. No-one could tell us yesterday in question time. We heard lots about what he wasn't responsible for but we didn't hear what he was responsible for. I don't think that's an accident, because the member for Fadden, it appears to me, is the minister responsible for payday lending. He's the most recent minister responsible for not bringing in the government's own draft legislation after the government's own review that sought to amend the way and to regulate the way the payday lending industry works. That review was worthwhile. This government's obstinate refusal to bring its own draft legislation into this parliament so that we can vote to protect vulnerable Australians is now in the hands of the member for Fadden, in his responsibilities. I would call on him. He's got a few hours left this afternoon. Perhaps he'd like to give us an opportunity to protect vulnerable Australians as we head into Christmas and they're getting ripped off by shonks in this industry that he is responsible for.
