       <p>
        I want to signal tonight that I will keep up the fight to have the gallantry of 12 soldiers who fought in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Long_Tan" rel="nofollow">
         Battle of Long Tan
        </a>
        recognised. I have worked with Lieutenant Colonel Harry Smith on this matter, and I want to see that these 12 men have their original gallantry recommendations—three medals for gallantry and nine commendations for gallantry—recognised and actioned. I have also met with Sergeant Frank Alcorta, who is one of those 12 who should be properly recognised. I must say that I was absolutely bewildered when I read his story. It occurred to me that his action that day on the battlefield was very similar to that of

        in the

        </a>
        . All Frank got for his trouble was a very modest
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MID" rel="nofollow">

        . He deserves greater recognition and respect for his action at Long Tan, as do his 11 colleagues. They deserve the same honours and recognition that were applied to the 81 award recipients who were part of the government’s 1998 review.

        I see this as a case of red tape tying up what should be a fairly straightforward process to recognise these cases of extreme bravery performed by soldiers in hellish circumstances. Apparently, no documentary evidence to support the extension of honours for these men has been found, and that in itself is totally unacceptable. The fact that these records have been lost begs the question: what happened to them?
