        I want to put on the record my support for the resolution to reject the Finkel-proposed clean energy target of 42 per cent of renewable energy by 2030, passed by the Nationals' federal conference on the weekend. My constituents ask me: 'Why does our country, so rich in energy-producing resources, pay some of the world's highest electricity prices?' We must exploit our natural advantage to provide cheap and reliable energy to create jobs and maintain our international competitiveness. Finkel found that coal is by far the cheapest and most reliable source of power, whereas solar and wind cost taxpayers many billions of dollars in subsidies each year.

          The renewable energy target flies in the face of every principle of the Liberal and National parties. It distorts the energy market and places a needless burden on those who have elected us to act in their best interests. The renewable energy target simply drives up the power price. To continue to support an

          status quo undermines our nation's competitiveness. Renewables need to stand on their own two feet and not be propped up by taxpayer subsidies. We need a level playing field to deliver true competitive cheap power prices. Renewable energy is a wonderful idea but reliable, cheap energy is essential to keep the wheels of our economy turning.

          <p>
           Two weeks ago, I met with Maria in my electorate. Maria is an age pensioner and she came to see me to explain that she lives frugally. She turns the heater on for an hour a day in the morning and her electricity bill has doubled in the last two years, In this place, every day, we listen to our Prime Minister blame everybody else for an issue that he is clearly responsible for. Maria is just one example. I also visited Quenos recently and they need action on gas. They need the Prime Minister to pull the trigger on gas. I met young Rhys, who is reliant on the Prime Minister to pull that trigger so he can keep his job. Young Rhys has a good job and I would like him to keep it.
          </p>
          <p>
           I want the Prime Minister to stop shouting and blaming the rest of the world; stop having 'hard chats' with retailers, to no effect; and stop talking about what he might do in five years. I want him to come in here and explain to the Australian public why they spent three years at their letterboxes waiting for their $550 refund on their gas prices and electricity prices and now he wants them back out to their letterboxes waiting for an explanation from the retailers. I want him to come in here and give the House an explanation as to why the energy crisis is here.
