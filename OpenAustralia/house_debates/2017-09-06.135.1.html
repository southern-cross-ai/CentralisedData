        I'd like to acknowledge three councillors not seeking re-election to the local council on Saturday. I didn't know
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Russell" rel="nofollow">
         Steve Russell
        </a>
        until after he was elected as Mayor of Hornsby, and I played no part in his election campaign, but I've come to have enormous respect for Steve. Steve transformed Hornsby, a council in debt and deficit, and brought it into the black. He kept a tight rein on staff numbers and regularly compared Hornsby's efficient staff-to-resident ratios with those of other, less efficient councils around
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Steve developed a national reputation for his work. He was strongly opposed to the constitutional recognition of local government, which was bad for councils and ratepayers alike, and sought to withdraw Hornsby from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government
        </a>
        Association in protest. He's been one of the most effective and persuasive advocates for local government amalgamation. Steve's legacy is the Hornsby Aquatic and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leisure_Centre" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the Hornsby Quarry remediation project, turning a disused quarry into the

       </p>

        I got to know Yvonne Keane when she became Mayor of the Hills Shire last year. Well known to Australian audiences for her small stature and her determination as the 'pocket rocket' on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">

        </a>

         </a>
        </i>
        , she brought the same determination to her mayoralty. As a child, Yvonne experienced domestic violence. As a social entrepreneur, she founded the sanctuary as a shelter for women and children escaping domestic violence in the Hills. She wanted to link her passion to do something about domestic violence with her role as mayor of the Hills.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week I was delighted to join Yvonne for the launch of a transitional housing strategy, a fantastic initiative she spearheaded. Under the strategy, developers who build developments of at least 50 units and incorporate a high-quality transitional housing unit within their developments will be able to build two bonus units. This groundbreaking initiative would have application in other areas of Australia. I'd like to wish Yvonne, her husband, Anthony, and their children many years of success and happiness. I'm sure this won't be the last we'll see of Yvonne in public life.

        After a record 26 years at Woollahra council,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Petrie" rel="nofollow">
         Andrew Petrie
        </a>
        is retiring. First elected in 1991, Andrew Petrie was Mayor of Woollahra five times. During the day he was a director of major investment banks, and in his spare time he served the community through council. Woollahra's a municipality with well-financed residents who know their rights and aren't afraid to resort to law to enforce them. Andrew was always fierce in protecting the interests of the municipality.
       </p>
       <p>
        I served with Andrew on the council between 1995 and 1999. He was an excellent debater, and it was always easier to win the argument if you had Andrew on your side. Together we worked to reduce the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BA" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DA" rel="nofollow">
         DA
        </a>
        backlog, crack down on unauthorised works and develop senior accommodation for the council. More than anyone, Andrew's been responsible for the revitalisation of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Double Bay
        </a>
        , returning it to being one of the great shopping precincts of our city.
       </p>
       <p>
        At one point we nearly lost Andrew when he had surgery that went horribly wrong and he was hospitalised for the best part of a year. Serving for 26 years is a remarkable achievement, I wish Andrew, Edwina and their family many years of happiness and health in retirement. I thank him for his support and friendship over many years.
