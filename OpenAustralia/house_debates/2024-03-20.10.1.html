        These amendments respond to the recommendations of the Senate committee and to feedback from stakeholders identified through the consultation process. The first amendment establishes an exemption from all offences for fundamental research and includes the definition of fundamental research in the legislation. The second amendment will amend the criteria for the Foreign Country List to provide the minister with the authority to add countries that are not members of the four multilateral regimes to the Foreign Country List where such additions are in the interest of Australia's national security, economic prosperity or international relations.

        The eighth amendment establishes a build-to-print exemption which will exempt from the 10A offence entities manufacturing components of DSGL goods and technology where they are unable to reverse-engineer the component to make the regulated item. Requirements will be prescribed in the regulations. The ninth amendment will apply the 10B offence to DSGL part 1 goods and technology and to DSGL part 2 goods and technology on the sensitive list and the very sensitive list.

        The 10th amendment exempts from the 10B offence DSGL part 2 goods and technology on the sensitive list and the very sensitive list if they are resupplied within, from or to a country on the Foreign Country List.

        The 12th amendment creates an exemption to lapse the 10B offence for DSGL part 2 goods and technology on the sensitive list and the very sensitive list for all suppliers from countries not on the Foreign Country List following a defined period after the initial supplyâ€”the period will be defined in the regulationsâ€”and to lapse the 10B offence for DSGL part 1 goods and technologies following a defined period after the initial supplyâ€”the period will again be defined in the regulations. The 13th amendment creates an exemption from the 10B offence for all firearms with serial numbers. The final amendment creates an exemption from the 10C offence for citizens or permanent residents of Canada and New Zealand.
