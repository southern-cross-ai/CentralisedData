        My question is addressed to the Minister for Family and Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. I refer the minister to the appearance on
        <i>
         Lateline
        </i>
        of Gregory Andrews, an assistant secretary in the minister’s department, on 21 June this year. When did the minister approve Mr Andrews’s appearance? When did the minister become aware that Mr Andrews’s identity would be masked and he would be inaccurately described as a former youth worker? When Mr Andrews’s bogus appearance was exposed, why did the minister fail to correct the public record, as required by the ministerial code of conduct?

         I was informed that Mr Andrews had decided to do an interview for the
         <i>

         program on the afternoon before the interview took place on 2 June.

         approached Mr Andrews directly, before it knew of his appearance before the coronial inquest into the deaths of three young petrol sniffers. As is made clear in Mr Andrews’s own public statement, the decision to appear was made by him alone. It is simply not true to suggest that Mr Andrews appeared at my request. Mr Andrews was speaking about these issues while he was still working at Mutitjulu, most particularly during the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         coronial inquest into the petrol-sniffing deaths in August last year.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was informed that Mr Andrews had decided that he would only appear anonymously as he had already experienced a number of threats, particularly at one time when his wife was pregnant, and, as a result, he had previously withdrawn testimony that he had given to the coronial inquest because he felt fearful. The reason he undertook to appear on
         <i>
          Lateline
         </i>
         is that he is concerned for the community of Mutitjulu. He had important evidence to provide. He was not the only person to provide that evidence. I would say to many of those that sit opposite that, rather than attempting to attack a person who is trying to uncover very serious issues, they should—

            I am advised that he consulted with the departmental executive to ensure that his appearance on
            <i>
             Lateline
            </i>
            would not contravene the Australian Public Service Code of Conduct. Mr Speaker, I suggest that people read Mr Andrews’s own statement about his reasons for appearing. I especially commend to you his suggestion that those attacking the
            <i>
             Lateline
            </i>
            program should channel their energy into protecting the women and the children who have been subject to the vilifying claims that Aboriginal women, doctors and health workers all made independently on the
            <i>
             Lateline
            </i>
            program. Unfortunately, these are disgraceful circumstances to have occurred in Australia’s community. It would do us all well to try to protect those who are trying to protect the most vulnerable in our society—not to throw stones at those who would put their own families at risk, as they believe, but to protect them and not damage whistleblowers.
