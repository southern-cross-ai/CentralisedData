        who had a wonderful win in the grand final during our break.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am very pleased to discuss a recent funding announcement in my electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Connor" rel="nofollow">
         O'Connor
        </a>
        , one that will complete an important project that has been planned for several years. The latest round of the National Stronger Regions Fund will deliver $1.6 million to complete a wellness and respite centre in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shire_of_Manjimup" rel="nofollow">
         Shire of Manjimup
        </a>
        . The multipurpose facility will provide a dedicated home for the town's home- and community-care programs to operate from.
       </p>
       <p>
        Manjimup is a small community with a population of about 5,000. Like many towns that sit in relative proximity to a bigger regional centre, it does not enjoy the comprehensive range of services that one might expect in a major city. Providing the means for our seniors to age with peace and dignity in regional areas has always been a priority for me as the member for O'Connor. Elderly citizens often need to access support services in order to continue living in their home town. The population demographic of this region has created a significant demand for expanded aged care facilities in the Shire of Manjimup.
       </p>
       <p>
        The median age in the region is 44 years, some eight years higher than the national average. People aged 65 and above comprise nearly 17 per cent of the population, compared to about 12 per cent for the state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        . People aged 50 and above make up 40 per cent of the region's populationâ€”about 10 per cent higher than the state average. The number of people with a disability living in and around Manjimup also exceeds the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        average.
       </p>
       <p>
        The demand for aged care, home and community care and dementia services has increased in recent years and will continue to grow. This places pressures on the home based carers, but despite Manjimup's ageing population the nearest respite service is nearly 200 kilometres away. A 400-kilometre round trip to access an overnight respite centre places an unacceptable burden on people engaged in full-time care. The Manjimup wellness and respite centre will provide the community with a 24-hour five-bed wing for planned, emergency or crisis respite care in a home-like environment. Elderly citizens, people with disabilities, and dementia patients will all have access to high-needs care within the town.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government has previously supported the shire project through a home and community care program. In 2014, $750,000 of capital works funding was allocated to the project. This grant, along with a national stronger regions grant from the federal government, will enable the shire of Mandurah to leverage other sources of funding to ensure the facility can be constructed to the standard that our senior citizens deserve.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the government on its commitment to providing such a vital service for the Manjimup community. I would also like to congratulate the Shire of Manjimup for its dedication to providing a better standard of living for it community.
