        Mr Speaker, I refer you to a number of initiatives that have been taken around the precincts of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        that relate to the need to combat global warming and water shortages. I understand that these include, for instance, turning off a number of water fountains around the place. I also understand that the air conditioning has been turned down and that water pressure has been turned down. I think these are all initiatives which we would support.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, I wonder whether you might give some consideration to another initiative: allowing members to remove their coats in the chamber during the warmer summer months. Not only do I think it would make for a more conducive work environment; it would probably set an example to boardrooms around Australia. I am suggesting that you might consider this only during the warmer months. I am not saying it should be compulsory for everyone but that members should be allowed to have the choice of whether or not to wear a coat into the chamber. I wonder whether this initiative could set an example for the rest of Australia whilst still maintaining suitable and appropriate dress standards in the parliament. It annoys me to see that some of the women in the House are doing their bit for global warming but we are not allowed to join them.

         I thank the member for Cowan. I point out to him that, yes, there was a trial to reduce the amount of water required for air conditioning last month, but that was for a week. Since then, the temperature has been returned to the level it was at prior to that. Last week a couple of members raised with me that they felt that the chamber itself was too warm. I have made some inquiries about that. There is no evidence of it, but I am mindful of the fact that we are expected to uphold certain dress standards and, if it is too warm in the chamber, I have no problem in seeing if the temperature might be reduced. With regard to the last part of the question on dress standards, the standing orders do require that the occupier of the chair uphold proper dress standards. If it is the will of the House to change that then I would obviously take direction from the House.
