       <p>
        I rise to speak to the condolence motion for the late Trooper David Pearce, Special Forces Sergeant Matthew Locke and Australian Special Forces Commando
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Worsley" rel="nofollow">
         Luke Worsley
        </a>
        . Today I want to particularly pay tribute to Luke Worsley, of the 4th Battalion,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Regiment
        </a>
        , who was killed during an attack on the Taliban in Afghanistan on 23 November 2007. I wish to express my condolences to Luke’s mother and father, Marjorie and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Worsley" rel="nofollow">
         John Worsley
        </a>
        , his brother and three sisters, their spouses, his nephews and his nieces. I had not had the privilege of meeting or knowing personally Luke or his family. I understand, from a public statement by Luke’s father, that the family wishes their privacy to be respected and desires people to think of Luke in the way he was known by those who knew and loved him.
       </p>
       <p>
        Luke’s parents live in the electorate of Greenway. Today I would like to record some reflections to honour his life. The commanding officer of 4RAR, Lieutenant-Colonel Mark Smethurst, described Luke’s actions during the attack on a Taliban bomb-making compound in Oruzgan province this way:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Luke was the first man of the team through the door and was met by enemy forces that opened fire at close range … Luke’s actions upon entering the room, warning of the enemy threat, almost certainly saved the lives of other members of his team.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the Department of Defence website there are some biographical notes about Luke, and I would like to refer to them now:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Private Luke Worsley enlisted into the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Regular_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Regular Army
        </a>
        on the 23rd of October 2001. After completing his

         Royal Australian Infantry Corps
        </a>
        and commenced his Initial Employment Training at Singleton,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
         NSW
        </a>
        on the 15th of April 2002. At the completion of his Initial Employment Training, Luke was posted to the 1st Battalion,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Royal_Australian_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
         The Royal Australian Regiment
        </a>
        . During his service with 1RAR, Luke deployed to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
         East Timor
        </a>
        as part of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Citadel" rel="nofollow">
         Operation Citadel
        </a>
        , providing security to the people of East Timor.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        After two years of service with the 1st Battalion, and looking for more of a challenge, Luke applied for selection with the 4th Battalion (Commando), The Royal Australian Regiment. He was successful in his attempt, and Luke went on to complete the Commando suite of courses, becoming ‘beret’ qualified in 2004.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Luke deployed with Delta Commando Company Group to Afghanistan in 2006. Upon return from his rotation, Luke was posted to Bravo Commando Company Group and deployed with them to Afghanistan in September—of last year, 2007.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        For his service in East Timor and Afghanistan, Luke was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Medal

       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chief" rel="nofollow">
         The Chief
        </a>
        of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston, said of Luke:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He was a greatly respected soldier and will be dearly missed. He was one of our finest. I am told his dedication and enthusiasm for soldiering was an inspiration to all those around him.
       </p>
       <p>
        Luke has been described by his family, his colleagues and his comrades as: ‘an inspiration to his fellow soldiers’, ‘greatly respected’, ‘one of our finest’, ‘an outstanding soldier’, ‘loving’, ‘compassionate’, ‘someone whose qualities set him above almost all other commandos’, ‘talented’, ‘modest and unassuming’, ‘tolerant’, ‘humorous’ and ‘a reflection of his upbringing’. In the words of Private Worsley’s brother-in-law:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Luke’s bear hugs were legendary among the family. He was soft, gentle and loving. We’re going to miss that affection so much. It’s something he gave so readily and something so many men are afraid of.
       </p>
       <p>
        He was a son, a brother, an uncle, a mate, an Australian hero. I am reminded of the words, ‘Greater love hath no man except he lay down his life for his friends.’ He was a man of courage and compassion, love and light-heartedness. I wish to honour his parents and pay respect to his family. We are proud of your boy. We thank you. I acknowledge the price that you, your son and your family have paid.

         I will not be speaking for long on this motion. But I think it is important that we acknowledge the passing of three soldiers who were killed in action doing their duty to this nation, as their passing shows, in a very dangerous place where there is much to be done.
        </p>
        <p>
         Much was said by earlier speakers regarding Sergeant Matthew Locke and his bravery. Sergeant Locke was an absolute credit to his unit. I think it was best put by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_Army" rel="nofollow">
          Chief of Army
         </a>
         , Lieutenant General Leahy. He said Sergeant Locke was:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         One of those inspirational leaders, who knew his duty and knew his task and it’s a very sad day that the nation has lost a man of this calibre.
        </p>
        <p>
         At the time he was killed, with complete disregard for his own safety Sergeant Locke broke heavy enemy fire to neutralise Taliban advancing on an Australian position. In doing so, he saved the lives of his mates.
        </p>
        <p>
         Trooper David Pearce was serving with the Reconstruction Task Force in Oruzgan province when he died on 8 October last year. He had previously served in the

          Solomon Islands
         </a>

         , of whom much was said earlier, was serving with the Special Operations Task Group in Oruzgan province when he died on 23 November 2007 as part of his second tour of duty in Afghanistan. He had also served in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">

        </p>
        <p>
         I would like to join with the Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence and other members of the House in expressing my sorrow at their passing and extending my condolences to their families and loved ones. It is a very difficult job being part of the defence forces and serving in locations like Afghanistan, facing enemies and putting your life on the line. These guys put their lives on the line and, unfortunately, their lives were taken. To be killed in action while serving in a location such as Afghanistan, you can pay no greater price than that. It is an incredibly sad thing for their families, but they need to know and understand that, as they knew them to be great people, they were certainly great servants of this country and we respect what they have done and their passing.

          I rise today in support of this motion of condolence. I can but offer my deepest sympathies to the families of Trooper David Pearce, Special Forces Sergeant Matthew Locke and Special Forces Commando
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luke_Worsley" rel="nofollow">
           Luke Worsley

          . Men of this high calibre are not common. These three men, and the men and women of the

           Australian Army
          </a>

         </p>
         <p>
          In delivering the condolence motion in the House, it was clear in the contribution from the Minister for Defence that his words were spoken with a heavy heart, bearing the weight of the office he now holds. In my contribution, I would like to reflect in particular on the life and service of Sergeant Matthew Locke. Sergeant Locke was from the town of Bellingen in my electorate of Cowper and his passing has had a profound impact on our area. From a small town of around 3,000 people, approximately 1,000 people turned out to pay their respects to Sergeant Locke at a memorial service. Sergeant Locke—or ‘Grub’, as he was known as a youngster—enlisted in the regular army in 1991. He served with the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
           Royal Australian Regiment
          </a>
          until 1997, when he successfully completed a
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Air_Service" rel="nofollow">
           Special Air Service
          </a>
          selection course. Over the following two years he completed another 15 specialist courses, including ones in demolitions, diving and parachuting.
         </p>
         <p>
          Sergeant Locke was posted to serve in the 3rd
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS" rel="nofollow">
           SAS
          </a>
          Squadron. During his service in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Defence Force
          </a>
          , Sergeant Locke served with distinction in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
           East Timor
          </a>
          , Iraq and Afghanistan. While deployed in Afghanistan in December 2006 he was awarded the Medal for Gallantry for twice fighting off militia patrols attempting to overrun his patrol’s isolated position, directing air support against militia forces. The following excerpt from Sergeant Locke’s medal citation provides an insight into his character and bravery:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          … a patrol, with Sergeant Locke as second-in-command, were tasked with establishing an Observation Post in extremely rugged terrain over looking an Anti-Coalition Militia sanctuary. After an arduous ten hour foot infiltration up the side of the mountain, the patrol was called into action to support elements of the Combined Task Force Special Forces patrol that were in contact with the Anti-Coalition Militia in the valley floor to their north …
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          During the afternoon, the Observation Post became the focus of the Anti-Coalition Militia who made repeated attempts by day and night to overrun and surround the position. In one such incident the Anti-Coalition Militia attempted to outflank the Observation Post and Sergeant Locke without regard for his own personal safety, led a two man team to locate and successfully neutralise the Anti-Coalition Militia in order to regain the initiative and protect his patrol from being overrun.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          This particular incident was followed by another Anti-Coalition Militia attempt to manoeuvre to attack the patrol Observation Post from another flank. Sergeant Locke, again with little regard for his personal safety, adopted a fire position that was exposed on high ground which dominated the planned Anti-Coalition Militia assault. Whilst deliberately exposing himself to intense rifle and machine gun fire from the Anti-Coalition Militia, he again neutralised the lead assaulting elements whilst suppressing other Militia until the arrival of offensive air support. Whilst still under sustained fire, Sergeant Locke then directed indirect fire to effectively neutralise another Anti-Coalition Militia advance on his patrol’s position.
         </p>
         <p>
          In this age, society holds up actors, athletes and musicians as role models and heroes, but in my mind Sergeant Locke and the other two Defence Force personnel I mentioned are true heroes. Yet Sergeant Locke did not see himself as a hero. When he was asked about the events that led to him receiving the Medal for Gallantry, Sergeant Locke said:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          What’s going through your mind is actually doing your job at the time and looking after the blokes with you—and that’s essentially what we spend our whole career training to do. There’s a heap more blokes that deserve the award as much as I deserve the award.
         </p>
         <p>
          Australia has indeed lost one of her finest sons, and I extend my deepest sympathies to Sergeant Locke’s parents, Norm and Jan, his wife, Leigh, and son, Keegan.
         </p>
         <p>
          In commemoration of our military history, which has so defined our growth as a nation, there has been a focus on the sacrifice of our service men and women. The sacrifice of the family at home is all too little acknowledged—the endless months of separation, not knowing if loved ones are safe, not knowing if a knock on the door might come with the worst possible news. We should be mindful of the sacrifice which is made by Defence Force families—the long weeks and months of separation from mum or dad, the fishing trips that do not happen, the endless moves from base to base.
         </p>
         <p>
          I would like to conclude my remarks by reflecting on the words of Padre Dr Graham Whelan, who observed on
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
           Remembrance Day
          </a>
          2007:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          It is our service men and women, not the reporters who have given us the freedom of the press … and … It is the service men and women not the politicians who have given us the right to life and the freedoms we now enjoy.
         </p>
         <p>
          Trooper David Pearce, Special Forces Sergeant Matthew Locke and Special Forces Commando Luke Worsley were fine Australians who upheld the values of this nation and were men of which Australia can be rightly proud.

           I rise to speak on the condolence motion for Trooper David Pearce and to pass on my sympathy and support to his wife, Nicole, and daughters, Stephanie and Hannah. Trooper Pearce was born in Liverpool,

           . He enlisted in the

            Australian Army
           </a>
           Reserve in 2002 and served until 2005. Following a period of reserve service, he transferred to the

           in July 2006. He was deployed to the

           </a>
           with the 9th Battalion of the

            Royal Queensland Regiment
           </a>
           in 2005-06. He was subsequently posted to the Brisbane based 2nd/14th

            Light Horse Regiment
           </a>
           in October 2006. He had been deployed just a few weeks prior and was serving with the reconstruction force.

           Trooper Pearce was 41 when he was tragically killed during a roadside bomb attack on the light armoured vehicle he was driving, only six kilometres from the Australian base of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarin_Kowt" rel="nofollow">
            Tarin Kowt
           </a>
           in the southern province of Oruzgan. Trooper Pearce was one of the great modern Anzacs who knew service above self and demonstrated so ably that, ‘Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.’ His death has touched the heart of the nation and has united people from all walks of life who have paid personal homage to this brave soldier.
          </p>
          <p>
           Trooper Pearce’s life experiences and outgoing personality made him a very popular soldier. His ability to communicate with people of all ages was highly regarded and he was well respected by his peers. As a former army officer with operational service overseas, I understand the hardships for families who keep the home fires burning whilst their partners serve us overseas.
          </p>
          <p>
           Trooper Pearce was a great family man. He was a dedicated father of two beautiful girls, Stephanie and Hannah, and a dedicated husband to Nicole, his wife and life partner of 18 years. It is attributed to
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell" rel="nofollow">
            George Orwell
           </a>
           that:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           We sleep safe in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm.
          </p>
          <p>
           Trooper Pearce’s sacrifice was not in vain. He is a beacon of inspiration to other peacekeepers to provide a better future for the people they serve—in Trooper Pearce’s account, those of Afghanistan. He stands tall as a man who believed that all people, wherever they may live, should have the opportunity to live in a better world, free from violence, intimidation and repression. Though it can only ever be a small comfort to his family, Trooper Pearce sacrificed his life doing what he loved—serving his country.
          </p>
          <p>
           A highly professional, skilled and dedicated soldier, he knew the great dangers, the great sacrifices, but also served in that great tradition of our noble country, knowing that the only way evil prospers is if good men do nothing. Trooper Pearce will never share a place with those cold, miserable souls who stand by in ambivalence. His place will be forever known as one of honour, of the man who did not shrink or shirk from danger but fulfilled his duty in the great tradition of our nation. He is universally saluted. Let me finish with some fitting words by

           This parliament is tremendously proud of Trooper David Pearce. As his federal member and a former fellow serving soldier, I am incredibly proud of his service and his sacrifice. I know his wife, Nicole, daughters Stephanie and Hannah, and extended family are very, very proud of their hero, father and husband.
