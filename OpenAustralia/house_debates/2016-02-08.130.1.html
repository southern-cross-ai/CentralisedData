        It is a pleasure tonight to report to the House the recipients of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        awards in Braddon. Bruce Reginald French AO received an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Officer of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        in the 2016 Australia Day awards. Bruce has contributed significantly to agricultural sciences with his work in gathering edible plant information. In 1999 Bruce founded Food Plants International, an online platform that documents edible plant species worldwide. The aim of Bruce's website is to provide information about edible plants with the objective of helping those in poverty feed themselves using their own local plants. The website has the world's largest database of edible food plants, with information now on over 27,000 plants. Bruce's work has led to improved food security, greater nutritional information and improved health outcomes for people across the globe in developing countries.

       <p>
        Just as an aside, my wife and I spent many years in full-time ministry with the church. I had the pleasure of serving many of those years with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_French" rel="nofollow">

        . You would not meet a man more passionate about justice, feeding the poor or teaching those who live in impoverished conditions how to help themselves. I congratulate Bruce. I particularly want to mention his late wife, Helen, who worked alongside him for so many years, and his wife of today, Deb.

        Lawrence 'Buzz' Ronald Green AM from Devonport in my electorate was awarded a

        .

       <p>
        Recognising our emergency service personnel in the Australia Day awards is especially poignant in my electorate. With 81 fires still burning in Tasmania tonight yet no lives lost, we are always reminded of the work our emergency service personnel do to keep our communities safe. They are the unsung heroes who work days, nights, weekends and public holidays—weeks on end, in fact—when an emergency situation arises.

        Along with the major national awards that took place around Australia are the local council awards that recognise those who do the work in the local communities, often as volunteers.

The young citizen of the year was Nikkita Popowski, for working with young children in Wynyard Gymnastics.
