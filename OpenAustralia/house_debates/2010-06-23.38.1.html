        These amendments will deliver more certainty around the definition of a managed investment trust by clarifying the operation of the rules, taking into account general financial sector industry practice. Doing so will advance the government’s commitment to secure Australia’s place as a leading financial services centre in the region and more generally improve the competitiveness of the Australian funds management industry by making the reduced withholding tax rates available on distributions from a wider range of funds. These changes will ensure that, while continuing to attract and retain foreign capital, the Australian funds management industry will continue to be supported and enhanced.
       </p>
       <p>
        This objective is achieved through a number of targeted amendments. Firstly, a substantial proportion of the investment management activities undertaken in relation to the assets of the fund connected with Australia are now required to be carried out in Australia. That is in amendment 1. Secondly, amendments (2), (5), (7), (8), (13), (14) and (15) expand the widely held rules for registered trusts to more appropriately recognise the nature of certain widely held members, including through reducing the wholesale member requirement from 30 to 25 wholesale members for wholesale trusts. These changes will better reflect industry practices.
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendment 11 expands the list of entities considered to be widely held, including foreign pension plans, sovereign wealth funds and certain government agencies, and widely held foreign equivalents of a managed investment scheme. A regulation-making power has been included to provide for further expansion of the list if warranted. Furthermore, a start-up period of 18 months is provided, during which a trust may be treated as a managed investment trust prior to meeting the widely held requirements in amendment 4. This extended period more appropriately facilitates new trusts to enter the managed investment industry without suffering a competitive disadvantage. Finally, the transitional rules have been significantly enhanced in a number of ways, including extending its period of application to seven years. That is in amendments (16) to (20).
