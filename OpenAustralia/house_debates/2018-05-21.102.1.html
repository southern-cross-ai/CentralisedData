       <p>
        Before members leave, I'd like to make a brief statement to update the House. I have advised the House that, following the receipt of five resignations, of the members for Braddon, Fremantle, Longman, Mayo and Perth, I would undertake the usual practice of consulting with the Australian Electoral Commissioner on possible dates for the by-elections and consulting with party leaders about my preferred date. The earliest possible date for the by-elections is 23 June, if the writs are issued today. However, the Electoral Commissioner has advised me that, in light of the issues to do with section 44 of the Constitution that have caused four of the five by-elections, the government is considering urgent changes through regulation to the nomination process to ensure that candidates are aware of their obligations under section 44 prior to the by-elections taking place.
       </p>
       <p>
        The commissioner has advised me that he supports these changes. I note they have also been supported unanimously in the recent report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, which has proposed that they should be in place for the forthcoming by-elections to improve public trust and confidence.
       </p>
       <p>
        As this regulation is not yet in force, there would be no possibility of applying it if by-elections were held on 23 June, and consequently I consider that I should not proceed to issue the writs today for the by-elections to be held on 23 June. I will continue to consult with the commissioner and party leaders about the timing of the by-elections, and I hope to be able to update the House later this week.
