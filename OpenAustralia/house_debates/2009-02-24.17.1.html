         I thank very much the member for Shortland for her question. Over the next six years, we will be investing some $3.2 billion in upgrading and building rail infrastructure. This is record investment that will create and sustain more than 1,400 direct jobs. Our investment, over half the period, is more than double what those opposite spent in this area of infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
         In December we announced $1.2 billion for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Rail_Track_Corporation" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Rail Track Corporation
         </a>
         , rolling out an additional 17 rail projects right across the country to enhance freight movement and to create local jobs. Work has commenced already, and already hundreds of jobs have been created. The nation-building package will result in not just direct jobs in terms of on the site of where the railway works are taking place but also indirect jobs. It will result in 2.2 million new concrete sleepers, locally manufactured and installed, with 65 jobs in Wagga, which those opposite are opposed to; 60 in Mittagong that they are opposed to; 60 in Grafton that they are opposed to; and 50 at Geelong that they are opposed to. Those on that side of the House take comfort in unemployment. On this side of the House, we are investing in infrastructure and jobs. Our largest investment is $1 billion—

          I rise on a point of order. The minister made an offensive comment, and I ask him to withdraw it.

           Again, I think that it was by way of including debate within his answer. Some members might find that they have difficulties with this—that in the order of a debate they would have dealt with it by way of debate. But based on the way in which we have dealt with these matters in previous parliaments and in this parliament, I do not think that it is something I am going to ask the minister to withdraw. I would just say this general thing: that it would be helpful if there was less debate in answers, as such debate causes these reactions. I do understand the reactions, but I do not believe that under the standing orders it is something that can be easily dealt with.

           <p>
            I am talking about direct job creation as a result of economic stimulus and as a result of this government’s activity. Our largest investment is $1 billion in the Hunter, creating 650 jobs in the Hunter region. And work is taking place right now in Maitland and in Muswellbrook. But it is not just in the Hunter—it is also in Wodonga where I went and turned a sod with the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Premier" rel="nofollow">
             Victorian Premier
            </a>
            for a bridge that is being built for Albury and Wodonga on the Wodonga to Seymour duplication line.
           </p>
           <p>
            But the fact is that all of these programs have been opposed by those opposite. Each and every one of the government’s initiatives has been opposed by those opposite. Those on this side of the House are not prepared to just sit back and watch the impact of the global financial crisis. We are getting out there with direct investment in infrastructure—which is creating these jobs in local communities.
