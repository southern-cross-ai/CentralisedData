         I would like to thank the member for Macarthur for his question, for his advocacy for families in his seat and for the years and years he has spent supporting families and bringing new babies into the world. He, like so many on this side of the House, knows just how important are those early moments spent bonding with a new baby. That is why I was so pleased that earlier this month, the government's paid parental leave legislation passed both houses.

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paid_parental_leave" rel="nofollow">
          Paid parental leave
         </a>
         is a proud Labor legacy, and the Albanese government is now building on that legacy. We are getting on with the job of expanding paid parental leave, making it more flexible and making it better when it comes to shared care. We know there is more to do to improve gender equality and women's workforce participation, but so far this government is delivering. We are delivering to families right across this country.
        </p>
        <p>
         In 100 days, working families will begin to enjoy the benefits of our changes to paid parental leave. I am pleased to update the House that, this Sunday, pre-claiming under the improved Paid Parental Leave scheme will start. It will be available for parents having a baby due from 1 July. Opening up pre-claiming is very important for expecting families. It is a great feature of the scheme because it allows families to get their applications sorted before their baby arrives. We know that raising children and managing work is a juggle for many parents. We also know that it is a time when there are bills to pay and a lot of chaos in the house, so families need to be able to get that support without any bumps.
        </p>
        <p>
         Because of our changes, over 180,000 families each year will benefit from a stronger, more generous Paid Parental Leave scheme that is right for the times and right for the future. Not only will more parents have access to the government payment, they will also have more flexibility in how they transition back to work, which is important for shared care so dads and parents can spend more time with their baby. We also know that when parents share care it is good for gender equality, it is good for kids and it is good for the economy.

          I am not sure what all these interjections are over here. Do those opposite not support our new paid parental leave scheme? Do they not support the good action this government is taking for families? Because it is this government that is delivering for Australian families. It is this government that is listening to their views and delivering cheaper child care, cheaper medicines, better more flexible paid parental leave, and I ask them to get on board.
