        On indulgence: I will begin this short statement by thanking the member for Stirling. This concerns a question not reached in question time, but I think it is for the benefit of members if I do make a brief statement. We are about to head off during a great time of the year but it is also known as the natural disaster season. Certainly, the warnings suggest that there is an above average bushfire risk for Victoria, for coastal
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        and for the south-west of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        . It is predicted that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         North Queensland
        </a>
        and the top of Australia are going to have a pretty rugged cyclone season.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government is doing all it can to work with state and territory governments to make our communities as prepared as possible. Consistent with the recommendations of the Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission, we have recently conducted preseason briefings about federal assets that might be deployed in the event of such an emergency. There is also much that can be done at a local level and I certainly encourage all Australians to be aware of risks in their local area.
       </p>
       <p>
        In December 2009 we commenced the National Emergency Warning System. I urge Australians to be aware of the nature of warnings and the protocols that they might receive on their mobile or domestic phones. I also urge them to consider preparing their own emergency plans, including evacuation plans if necessary, and preparing an emergency kit for their own households. There is some very valuable information on the website of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Management_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Emergency Management Australia
        </a>
        at www.ema.gov.au. I know that local members have been of tremendous assistance to their local communities in the event of natural disasters and I will shortly be writing to members to advise them of a 1300 number to contact Emergency Management Australia directly in the event of an emergency in their area.

         On indulgence: on behalf of the opposition, I associate myself with the remarks of the Attorney-General. Clearly, all Australians know that there are dangers that communities face as we approach what is sometimes known as the bushfire season. As a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         n, I am very aware of those dangers. It is timely reminder from the minister that we all need to be mindful of the sorts of risks that are involved and also the sorts of things we can do to mitigate those risks.
