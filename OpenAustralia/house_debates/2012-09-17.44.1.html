        funding model and what that has done to the small rural and regional aged-care providers in my electorate. This is creating a major problem for those small providers—in fact, it is putting them at real threat. They are at risk right now.

        I want to speak up on behalf of all of those who have rung me, very concerned about what this change means to the services being able to be provided for their families in those facilities with the changes the government has made.

That is what we see from this government: instead of growing the pie, whether it is in business or in other areas, they simply change how they are going to direct it. That is exactly what they have done with this.

It is a threat to those who desperately need to increase the size of their facilities and the aged-care beds that have not been taken up in
