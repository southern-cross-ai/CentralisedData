        My question is to the minister for workplace r elations. I remind the minister of his statement yesterday in question time that he was in the process of going through the Fair Work Australia report into
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSU" rel="nofollow">
         HSU
        </a>
        branch No. 1. How does he reconcile that spin with the fact that he told Sky News at four o'clock that he had read the entire report, or is he expecting people to believe that he read the 146-page report in the 15 minutes between leaving the House and his media appearance?

         I thank the member for Sturt for his question and I note that in the combined electorates of the party he represents four million people will benefit from an increase in superannuation from the legislation passed last night. Furthermore, I refer the member for Sturt to yesterday's answer. It is a public report. It is available to all.

           HSU

         </p>
         <p>
          The SPEAKER: Some people read speedily. The minister has the call. He is aware of the standing orders and will be directly relevant.

           I refer the member for Sturt to my answer yesterday. I also refer the members of this House to the process which has been underway. The report has been concluded into one part of the union. That matter has now been referred, at the discretion of the

            General Manager

           The SPEAKER: The minister will be directly relevant.

           The opposition do not want to talk about the benefits of the mining tax and they will do anything—

           The SPEAKER: The minister will resume his seat. The call is withdrawn from the minister.
