       <p>
        I would like to start off by congratulating one of my staff on the safe arrival of her new son, Luca. Luca was born last Monday. He arrived about one month early and both Luca and Alison Foscholo, my chief of staff, are doing well. Alison has been instrumental in setting up my office since my election last year. While she's on maternity leave, the office is obviously missing her, but we are also very excited for her and her husband, Andrew, on the arrival of their new son.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to congratulate the

        </a>
        , who last month launched the Shepparton Sports Hall of Fame. There are 27 inaugural inductees into the hall of fame. One of them is in fact Mr Michael Dobbie, who works for the office of

        in the Infrastructure and Transport portfolio. Michael competed as a professional wheelchair athlete, and the highlight of his career was representing Australia at the 2008 Paralympics in the wheelchair tennis event. Another inductee into the hall of fame was Mooroopna bowler, lawn bowler Clarice Power. Clarice competed in the 1986 Edinburgh Commonwealth Games in lawn bowls, where she narrowly missed out on a gold medal, with the event being pushed back due to serious rain delays. They were beaten by the Welsh team.

        Also this week the Loddon Murray Community Leadership Program met with parliamentarians, learning what it takes to be a community leader. I want to acknowledge the member for Mallee, Andrew Broad, for the work he did with his leadership group. I wish all those taking leadership programs all the best.
