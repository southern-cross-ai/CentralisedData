       <p>
        ASIC proposes to undertake a fit-out of its existing leased premises, as noted, at 100 Market Street, Sydney,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        . The current ASIC Sydney fit-out has reached the end of its useable life and requires a new fit-out to be able to flexibly meet ASIC's future business operations, accommodate staff growth and achieve overall compliance with the Department of Finance's workplace density target of 14 square metres per occupied work point. The estimated cost of the works will be in the order of $29.8 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project was referred to the Public Works Committee on 27 November 2019. The committee has recommended that the House of Representatives resolve, pursuant to section 18(7) of the Public Works Committee Act, that it's expedient to carry out the project. Subject to parliamentary approval, fit-out works are scheduled to commence immediately and are scheduled to be completed by May 2021. On behalf of the government, I'd like to thank the committee for undertaking this timely inquiry. I commend the motion to the House.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
         ATO
        </a>
        proposes to fit out a building being newly constructed at 152 Wharf Street, Brisbane. The ATO is leasing 24,000 square metres and proposes to fit out about 18,000 square metres as contemporary open plan, grade A office accommodation that meets the government's occupational density target. The estimated cost of the works is $49.6 million and will be funded within the ATO's existing departmental budget.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project was referred to the Public Works Committee on 27 November 2019, and the committee made two recommendations: firstly, that the House of Representatives resolve, pursuant to section 18(7) of the Public Works Committee Act, that it is expedient to carry out the project, and, secondly, that the Auditor-General consider conducting an audit into the process undertaken by the ATO in identifying and selecting 152 Wharf Street as the preferred site for the works. Subject to parliamentary approval, the fit-out works are expected to commence in February 2021 and be completed by August 2022. I want to thank the committee for undertaking the inquiry in a timely fashion. I commend the motion to the House.

        The estimated costs of the works to be undertaken over eight years from 2021 is $1.174 billion, including defence contingency. The project was referred to the Public Works Committee on 25 February 2020, and the committee has recommended that the

         House of Reps

        resolve, pursuant to section 18(8) of the Public Works Committee Act, that it's expedient to carry out the project. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction activities are expected to commence mid this year and be completed in late 2027. Again, I want to, on behalf of the government, thank the committee for undertaking the inquiry in such a timely fashion. I commend the motion to the House.
