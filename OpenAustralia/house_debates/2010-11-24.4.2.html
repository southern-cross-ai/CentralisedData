       <p>
        I am pleased to present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation which participated in the 122nd Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly held in Bangkok, Thailand, and also undertook a bilateral visit to the People’s Republic of China.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the 122nd
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPU" rel="nofollow">
         IPU
        </a>
        Assembly, the delegation was an active participant in the proceedings. The report outlines the various presentations and meetings that featured on the delegation’s agenda. It contains the various resolutions that were agreed to at the assembly, including those on the global fight against organised crime, including people trafficking and drug trafficking; the role of parliaments in accelerating the achievement of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals" rel="nofollow">
         Millennium Development Goals
        </a>
        ; youth participation in the democratic process; improving disaster risk assessment, prevention and mitigation; and the human rights of parliamentarians.
       </p>
       <p>
        The assembly’s overall theme, ‘Parliament at the heart of political reconciliation and good governance’, provided the delegation with the opportunity to raise awareness about our parliament’s efforts to advance reconciliation with Australia’s Indigenous peoples, including through the Apology to Australia’s
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Peoples" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous Peoples
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Nuclear nonproliferation and disarmament were also discussed extensively at the assembly, with Australia serving on the panel for a special presentation on this subject. We participated in meetings with parliamentarians from countries that have yet to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty. Our message was clear: parliamentarians have an important role to play in advocating for and building consensus towards a world free of nuclear weapons.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ongoing discussions about reform of the Inter-Parliamentary Union also featured at the assembly, along with debate about the links between the IPU and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations
        </a>
        . I am pleased to advise that Australia recently accepted an invitation to serve on the Advisory Group of the IPU Committee on United Nations Affairs. This is an indication of the effort that has been put in by the various delegations, especially over the term of the last parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        In acknowledging my fellow members of the delegation, I give my thanks to the deputy leader of the delegation, Senator Judith Troeth, who was deputy leader to a number of the delegations in the 42nd Parliament;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jill_Hall" rel="nofollow">
         Jill Hall
        </a>
        , who has attended two assemblies in that period;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Price" rel="nofollow">
         Roger Price
        </a>
        , the former member for Chifley and former Chief Government Whip, who was the constant within the delegations throughout the 42nd Parliament; and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Secker" rel="nofollow">
         Patrick Secker
        </a>
        , who has also contributed on two or three of the delegations to the IPU in the last parliament. At the IPU we were joined by Senator Julian McGauran.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I have said, the contribution that Australia’s parliament, as the parliament of a middle power, has made to the IPU is considerable. The fact that we have been invited to serve on the Advisory Group of the IPU Committee on United Nations Affairs is reflective of our efforts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following the IPU Assembly, the delegation undertook a bilateral visit to the People’s Republic of China. This provided an opportunity to further develop and strengthen parliamentary links with the National People’s Congress. The very warm welcome the delegation received indicated the strength of our bilateral relationship with China. The delegation was pleased to meet with China’s Vice-President,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xi_Jinping" rel="nofollow">
         Xi Jinping
        </a>
        , and National People’s Congress Chairman,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Bangguo" rel="nofollow">
         Wu Bangguo
        </a>
        , who both emphasised the importance they attach to further developing relations between our two legislatures. A roundtable meeting with representatives of the National People’s Congress helped to set future directions for strengthening parliamentary ties.
       </p>
       <p>
        The delegation’s visit included meetings and inspections in Macau, Guangdong, Ningxia, Beijing and Shanghai. China’s continuing economic development was highlighted throughout the delegation’s visit. By visiting a variety of China’s regions, the delegation came to a better appreciation of the diversity of China as well as the varied opportunities that exist for Australia to invest in and benefit from China’s remarkable growth.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the important messages the delegation heard in China was that a growing green industry sector could be worth up to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        $1 trillion by 2013. Business representatives with whom the delegation met indicated that Australian companies with green sector expertise should take a serious look at the business possibilities emerging in China.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another important message was that, with a growing Chinese middle class, the services sector is also growing. Here too Australia has opportunities. It was made clear to the delegation that Australia’s trading future with China does not rest solely on provision of natural resources.
       </p>
       <p>
        By travelling beyond the major cities of China, the delegation was able to see the work that is being done to improve living standards in rural and regional areas. In one village the delegation visited, it inspected a poverty alleviation project that involved establishment of rural settlements where people from impoverished areas could earn incomes from their own greenhouses.
       </p>
       <p>
        The delegation also saw the amazing scale of infrastructure that is being built in China to prepare for future growth. Nowhere was this more evident than in Shanghai, where the delegation inspected a deepwater port connected to the mainland via a massive 30-kilometre bridge. The first three stages of the facility, including the bridge, were constructed over a five-year period.
       </p>
       <p>
        The delegation also inspected the impressive
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Expo" rel="nofollow">
         World Expo
        </a>
        2010 site, including the magnificent Australian pavilion. The hosting of this event symbolised the growing confidence in China as it embraces its expanding regional and international focus. The capacity of China to deliver large-scale projects to support large-scale economic development emphasised to the delegation the need for Australian policy and decision making to be in tune with the extremely fast pace of growth and development in China.
       </p>
       <p>
        The delegation is grateful to the parliament of Thailand for its successful organisation of the IPU Assembly, especially considering the political climate of the time in Thailand. We are also grateful to the National People’s Congress of the People’s Republic of China for the very worthwhile program it arranged for the delegation. Particular thanks are due to Dr Geoff Raby, Australian Ambassador to China; Grant Dooley, consul-general in Guangzhou;

        ; Sarah Noble; Stuart Kerr; and Martine Porter for their efforts in ensuring such a successful program in China.
       </p>
       <p>
        The delegation expresses its gratitude for the support provided by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
        </a>
        , particularly by Eric van der Wal as foreign affairs adviser to the delegation at the 122nd Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly. The delegation also thanks the Parliamentary Library and the parliament’s International and Community Relations Office for their work. The briefings, advice and assistance with arrangements were all highly appreciated. On behalf of the delegation, I would like to thank the delegation secretary, Andres Lomp, for his diligence and support, and my adviser Debra Biggs for her support of not only me but the delegation in general.
       </p>
       <p>
        In concluding, I would like to dedicate the report of this delegation to the late Neil Bessell, who for quite some time, as an officer of the Department of the Senate, was the delegation secretary for a number of IPU assemblies. His breadth of knowledge of the IPU—the personalities, the complex political and geopolitical arrangements—was always so helpful and made it easy for successive delegations. His untimely death is something that all people in the IPU family regret. At his funeral, it was very touching to hear the expression of sorrow and condolence from the Secretary-General of the IPU,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anders_Johnsson" rel="nofollow">
         Anders Johnsson
        </a>
        . I think that indicated the value that was placed upon the efforts of Neil Bessell. He was a credit to all those that professionally serve within the Australian parliament. As I said, in a simple gesture I dedicate this report to his memory.
