        Today I would like to bring to the attention of the Chamber a concern that has been raised with me by a constituent, Mr John Lyons, who owns an important online retail business called GolfZone. He has raised a number of times with me, as well as with my predecessor, some of the problems that small businesses and online retailers have in situations where people use fraudulent cards. For example, they might steal credit cards, go online and purchase high-value goods. Then, once they have stolen those high-value goods, which were purchased using fraudulent credit cards, the money is deducted from the business's account. The customer ultimately then gets reimbursed and the goods are shipped. However, the banks don't reimburse the individual, and they've both lost the goods, so it's a significant impost on his business. John assures me there are many other businesses in similar circumstances, who are directly experiencing the problems of fraudulent online purchasing and the impact it has on their businesses. I think, as every member in this Chamber would agree, people are putting their energies—

         I know the members on the other side may scoff, but this is a man who has put time and energy in developing a successful online business, and he's losing money because of the criminal behaviour of others, as well as shipping goods that he can no longer recoup. That is a big problem in terms of managing his stock. More importantly, he is essentially being whacked twice, while at the same time dealing with the problem of not being able to recoup the income for those goods. I hope the minister and the government will give this serious consideration. I will be writing to the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services about this shortly.

         The other matter I want to bring to the Chamber's attention is the enduring problem of possum populations across parts of Goldstein as well as the great city of Melbourne. There have been numerous instances—

         I know you like to be referred to as a possum, but on this occasion it is a very serious matter. There have been a number of instances of collapsed ceilings, broken cornices and plaster damage to people's private homes due to possums nesting in roofs. I know when I grew up on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mornington_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">

          Port Phillip Bay
         </a>
         , I had a similar situation. The noise and damage they are causing is distressing for many people. It has led to a lot of property damage, problems for people who are dealing with sleep difficulties, and the night sounds are disturbing and make some people scared, particularly elderly people, who often find it difficult to clean the mess, particularly when it occurs on their rooftop. I know the members opposite may not take this seriously, but a number of my constituents have this problem, causing them to repair their roofs and homes, and it is related to an overpopulation of possums.

         A petition has recently been collected with more than 500 signatures calling on the state Labor government—the Andrews government—to investigate this problem and take appropriate action. I would like to thank my constituent Sandra Elmore for bringing this specifically to my attention. I also thank the member for Sandringham,
