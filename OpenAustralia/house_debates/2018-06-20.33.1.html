        On the topic of saving lives, Professor Anthony Brown has been awarded for his service as a clinician, author and educator in emergency medicine. Today he works as a senior specialist at the RBWH and he is now a Member of the Order of Australia. Geoffrey Batkin, someone I run into everywhere around Brisbane, is now a Member of the Order of Australia for his contribution to our community through social and aged welfare organisations such as Wesley Mission Queensland and UnitingCare.
