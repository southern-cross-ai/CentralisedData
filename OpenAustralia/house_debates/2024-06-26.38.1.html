        Dunkley is home to many older Australians, with 27,000 residents over 65 years of age. Many of these people are important contributors to our great community.

        Last week I followed in the tradition of the late Peta Murphy, hosting my first two seniors morning teas at the Frankston Bowls Club, thanks to Craig and to Langwarrin Public Hall. With musical performances with students such as Marli from

        band, it was delightful to catch up with all the Dunkley residents and hear their thoughts about the future of our community and the nation. Your voices are important to me.

        I also attended the June meeting of the Frankston Combined Probus Club, who received funding through the 2023-24 volunteers grant. These Probus members are hardworking, community-minded people who care about the community. It was a real joy to present some of their members with fuel cards as a 'thank you' for all their volunteer work. At these events, local residents spoke to me about issues such as climate change, particularly the opposition's expensive and risky plan to build nuclear facilities. Other concerns were raised with me, including ensuring responsible and affordable housing in Dunkley, homelessness, mental health issues and skills shortages. Thank you to all of those who took their time to meet me.
