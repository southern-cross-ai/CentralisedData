       <p>
        First and foremost, I acknowledge the dedicated work of Dr Charl du Plessis, who practices medicine in some of the most remote northern Goldfields towns and Aboriginal communities in my electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Connor" rel="nofollow">

        . Dr du Plessis is a much loved doctor whose skill and professionalism have been acknowledged by his peers in the awarding of the prestigious

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">

        of the Year. Dr du Plessis has resided and worked in some of O'Connor's most harsh and challenging climatic and social environments for the last 10 years. While his family currently live in Perth, he is a regular feature at the Leonora and Laverton hospitals' GP clinics and conducts outreach clinics to Aboriginal communities like Cosmo Newbery.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dr du Plessis's dedication to his patients came to the fore during COVID, when he chose to remain locked down with his communities when they were sealed off from the rest of WA as a dedicated biosecurity zone. While many services deserted these remote communities, Dr du Plessis knew he would be required to support the many chronic and complex health and emotional needs of his patients at a time of such great uncertainty. Dr du Plessis also plays an important role in supporting the frontline health and emergency service providers who are working under great pressure in these communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        So I take this opportunity not only to congratulate Dr du Plessis on his well-deserved award, but also to send a big shout out to the health and emergency service workers in the northern Goldfieldsâ€”people like

Ken is on call 24/7, dealing with the victims of family and domestic violence, alcohol-related harm, self-harms, car accidents and major medical emergencies. Ken often requires the backup from local police officers like Leonora station's Sergeant Jamie Cresswell and officer Tom Clendinning. This dedicated team works under constant pressure. Together, they support the wonderful

        On the ground, and embedded in her community, is Naomi Sprigg dos Santos, who has child safety as her No. 1 priority in her role with the WA Country Health Service. Pharmacist John Coufos is the only pharmacist for hundreds of kilometres, filling prescriptions, giving sound advice on complex health conditions and supporting childcare and dietary needs. Hope Community Services counsellors Sam Doran and Norma Ashwin also help support the myriad of mental health needs in the northern Goldfields, including those affected by

        , chronic alcoholism and drug use, sex abuse and domestic and family violence. Finally, to all the nurses and carers, and especially those who volunteer: thank you from the bottom of my heart. You all deserve an award, just like Dr du Plessis, in recognition of the selfless and tireless work you all do, keeping our northern Goldfields communities as safe, healthy and livable as possible.
