        Last November, members may recall being invited to attend the national final of the Schools Innovation Design Challenge, which was held here in the

        triumph. On the night, federal funding to help support their work for the next three years was announced, and that is something I welcome.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight I would like to highlight the role of the Re-Engineering Australia Foundation, the headquarters of which is located at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennant_Hills" rel="nofollow">

        in my electorate. In 1998, it was established as a non-profit organisation with aims to interest and inform students about engineering as a career. It provides technology, motivation and opportunities to students nationally through a series of structured experimental education programs, which aim at developing employability skills.
       </p>
       <p>
        The design challenge commenced in 2003. It was aimed at students from years 7 to 10 and it was offered to high schools throughout Australia. It develops the creativity and innovation of high school students through design of projects based on the development of a Formula 1 racing car. The program is linked with the international F1 in Schools challenge, which now runs in 18 countries.
       </p>
       <p>
        The foundation’s projects link schools, industry,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        s, universities and parents in stimulating interest and skills in students. In 2007 over 30,000 students from 280 secondary schools directly participated in the program.
       </p>
       <p>
        The foundation has had significant corporate and government organisational support.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dassault_Systemes" rel="nofollow">
         Dassault Systemes
        </a>
        contributed $450 million in engineering technology and software to schools. From 2008 until at least 2011 the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Defence
        </a>
        , through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Materiel_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
         Defence Materiel Organisation
        </a>
        , will be a major supporter. Telstra and Toyota have provided cash contributions and state and local governments have also made contributions.
       </p>
       <p>
        The benefits are very significant for students. It sows the seeds of inspiration. They can respond to their heroes—there are positive role models and mentors. They gain benefits from participating in national programs and the skills make them eminently employable.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the schools there is the benefit of having enhanced enthusiasm amongst teachers, there is a boost for participating schools’ reputations and the number of students interested in taking design and engineering subjects has seen an increase of some 400 per cent. And of course there is increased involvement and collaboration with industry. For universities and TAFEs there is heightened morale and enthusiasm, there is mentoring, it creates a national funnel for students interested in undertaking engineering courses and it improves connectivity with industry. For industry, there are increased linkages and involvement with local schools and access to potential staff.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am particularly interested in this matter because schools in my own electorate have participated.

        —which I think has four ex-students in this parliament, including me—was third outright place winner in the Fl In Schools world championships. It is important to note that Australian schools have won places in the world championships each year from 2005 to 2008. And Re-Engineering Australia has won much recognition from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineers_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Engineers Australia
        </a>
        and has also won the Prime Minister’s Award for Skills Excellence, to name just a couple.
       </p>
       <p>
        They have future plans. They continue to grow the program and members are encouraged to promote this project in schools in their electorates. This year will see the implementation of the first hub with direct defence industry links and collaboration in the

        through the Navy and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADFA" rel="nofollow">
         ADFA
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The future is very exciting. A pilot program entitled Oz-Blobs Challenge is presently underway in a number of primary schools. Students are provided with 3D modelling software and make their own design, which is then sent to the ‘Blobs factory’, where it is prototyped. With an extension activity of F1 in Schools, the proposed hybrid design competition students will be given a real opportunity to design components for cars in the future. This is a project that deserves members’ support and encouragement. It does a great deal for education and it will do a great deal for Australia and Australian productivity if we encourage students’ participation.
