       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity to say thank you to the people of Townsville for everything they have done and been through the last few years. Their resilience and sense of community has truly been astounding. From the devastating floods in 2019 through to the year that has been 2020, the people of Townsville have gone above and beyond for their fellow community members. Some of our businesses and livelihoods have changed forever, with jobs one day but gone the next, the unknown, national and state lockdowns, a global pandemicâ€”a horrible time for so many.
       </p>
       <p>
        But through all these tough times we as a community have come together, with everyday people helping each other through charities, the military and community groups, putting the people of Townsville first. I am so proud to say I live in Townsville. I want to let the parliament know about all these amazing organisations and individuals, but we would be here all day. We have fantastic people in Townsville.
       </p>
       <p>
        Coming into Christmas, the festive season, I want to let the people of Townsville know: you're amazing, you're tough, you're resilient and I am so honoured to be your representative here in Canberra. Most importantly, you deserve to have a happy and merry Christmas and a safe new year. Spend time with your families, spend time with your loved ones, spend time with your mates and look after each other.
