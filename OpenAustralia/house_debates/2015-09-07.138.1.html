        was a passionate, generous, caring, good-humoured and most decent man. He passed away, very sadly, on 23 July this year. Greg was the

        Council community development and recreational officer. In a previous life he had been a bank manager, but he chose a career and lifestyle where he could give so much back to his community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Greg was a familiar face at so many community events in the Southern Midlands. The Southern Midlands school holiday program involved Oatlands District High School,

        , Kempton Primary School and Campania District High School, and all benefited from his work. He was something akin to a pied piper for the young people in his community. The work that he did in his role, successfully applying for government and community grants, benefited many groups and organisations in the southern Midlands, including the Men's Shed at Oatlands.
       </p>
       <p>
        Greg always found a way to get things done with his creative persistence. My fondest memory of Greg, having seen him in action, was as the master of ceremonies at the infamous Bagdad Music Hall, an iconic annual event held at the Bagdad Community Club. Not only was he the flamboyant

        for nearly 20 years; he was a scriptwriter, a poet, a comedian and a singer. He made the world a better place because of his enduring decency. I, like all those who came to know him, offer my sympathy to his wife, Gaye, and his son, Paul. Vale,
