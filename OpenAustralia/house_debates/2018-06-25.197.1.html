        I'd like to congratulate these recipients on their recognition and thank them again for their contribution. More broadly, having knowledge of all the people that I have mentioned today, every one of them have one particular attribute: they're all people persons. I know throughout our electorates we honour these people but, because of the way they have conducted themselves over many years, it is a great honour for me to stand and respect them for their service.
