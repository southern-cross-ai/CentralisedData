        cricket fixture for 2023 was played again on Sunday afternoon. The contest in which we of course play for the Peter Veness Memorial Cup. It will not come as any surprise to this place, but it is my obligation, in any event, to confirm that the politicians were again victorious. Special mention to Jake Hauritz, from the gallery, who retired on 52 after a well-constructed innings, and to

        , who we understand took the first ever hat-trick to take place in this contest, which of course is the longest-running fixture of any of the sporting contest to take place between members of parliament, and the fourth estate.

        I am disappointed that the captain of the Press 11, Andrew 'the pot plant' Probyn, is not present with us in the chamber right here. But I am led to believe that he is nursing a bruised ego after his solitary over went for a punishing 15 runs—which, I have to say, turned the game distinctively in favour of the politicians, who were able to chase down the press's 157 comfortably with two overs to spare. I was a great game that was played in the best of spirits but, importantly, that concluded the right way.
