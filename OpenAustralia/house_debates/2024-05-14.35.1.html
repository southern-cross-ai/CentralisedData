        Australians are hurting. They are hurting under the cost-of-living pressures that have been made worse by the mismanagement of this government. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         Reserve Bank
        </a>
        sent a strong message last week that action is needed on inflation. But, from its commentary so far, it seems that this Labor government is deaf to the concerns of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RBA" rel="nofollow">
         RBA
        </a>
        , just as it's deaf to the concerns of everyday Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over recent weeks, I've had many locals share with me the impact that Labor's cost-of-living crisis is having on their daily lives. David is a pensioner in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Hills" rel="nofollow">

        . He has been forced to cut fruit out of his grocery shop. Yvonne from Thornlands has seen her rent increase by $225 a week. Margaret from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Point" rel="nofollow">
         Victoria Point
        </a>
        has seen her mortgage repayments soar by $1,300 in the last 18 months. Champion Support Services in Thornlands have seen a threefold increase in demand for their food bank services over the last year, and Ken from Cleveland has sent me his power bill, which is now triple what it was when this government came to office.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight's budget should be focused on reining in spending, tackling inflation and helping Australians who are struggling. It should be about taking the action that should have been taken over the last two years.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
         Can I
        </a>
        suggest to the Treasurer that tonight's budget should start with an apology to these Australians who've been let down by this government.
