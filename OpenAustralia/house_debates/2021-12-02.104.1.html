        My question is to the Minister for the Environment, representing the Minister for Women. Will the minister update the House on the strength and resilience of Australians during a very challenging two years, particularly Australian women and their incredible contribution?

         I thank the member for Robertson for her question and commend her on the important role that she will play chairing a committee that examines how we can best protect women, often, and all Australians from anonymous online abuse.

         For so many women, this has been the most difficult of years. For women in this workplace, it has been a year like no other. In this building, where we should aim to demonstrate global leadership and parliamentary workplaces, Kate Jenkins's sobering report told us that we must do better. I want to thank the 1,700 women and men who came forward to tell the stories, hurtful and distressing though that was. I want to say that I feel that the culture of change is coming and we can look forward with more confidence to when a young person who comes to work in this building feels inspired and valued, like so many do.

         All over Australia, whether it be getting through the bushfires and drought, storms that damage the crop that was finally going to balance the farm books, navigating lockdowns and the pandemic, and the economic challenges that we've faced, the one constant has been the courage and resilience shown by women across the country. With policies reflecting our principles—respect, dignity, choice, equality of opportunity, and justice—the Morrison government has handed down a dedicated, record-spending women's budget to improve women's safety, economic security, health and wellbeing. From listing life-saving women's medicines on the PBS—because we know that you can't place a value on time with your family—to funding early education and care, to superannuation that allows greater savings for retirement, the Morrison government will continue to support women at every age and stage of their life.
        </p>
        <p>
         To the women who run rural businesses and households; who fill our high streets with activity and shopfronts; who volunteer their time for local sporting teams and school committees; who juggle work, home and their family's happiness, as so many women do: thank you for everything you do to create strong communities.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to particularly thank every frontline worker doing the heartbreaking and life-saving work of keeping women and children housed, supporting their path to justice and financial freedom. We cannot keep women, children and their families safe without you. And I know I'm joined by every member of this place in saying thank you for your skill, your pride and your warmth.
        </p>
        <p>
         To the women of this country who are leading the way: you deserve our respect. We thank you for your contributions to every facet of our culture, and communities. So often we see you've been hit hard by life circumstances, you draw on inner resilience, you get back up, you dust yourself off and you face that uncertain future with confidence. The parliament is with you.
