         My department will also provide support for up to 100 tourism industry representatives to attend the Australia-China Tourism Summit 2011 in Cairns from 7-9 June 2011. This will include a Queensland tourism industry networking function on 7 June 2011. A number of businesses and industry organisations from North Queensland have been invited to take advantage of this opportunity, including Townsville Enterprise.

Known as the Queensland Tourism Service, the Service will provide a Tourism Business Review to eligible tourism businesses which will be carried out on-site by skilled and experienced Business Advisers at no financial cost to the business. The Business Adviser will work with the business to understand the business’ strategy and operations; identify strengths and opportunities, including benchmarking against best practice; assess potential areas for growth and improvement; and help firms access world-class business tools, processes and technology. In addition to the Tourism Business Review, tourism businesses will be eligible for:

         A further element of the Tourism Industry Support Package was providing support for tradeshows. Support was made available to assist in the attendance of 300 Queensland tourism businesses at the Australia Tourism Exchange in Sydney on 1 8 April 2011. Seven of these businesses were Townsville operators – Townsville Enterprise Limited, Tropical Horizons Tours, Vision Hotels and Resorts, Wildlife Island and Bush Safari, Reef

         In addition to my department’s activities, on 6 April 2011the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon Kevin Rudd MP, welcomed a group of over 70 Heads of Mission and Consuls-General and their spouses to Queensland. The purpose of the visit was to demonstrate to the world that Queensland is well and truly back in business and to assist the diplomats in knowing first-hand, and being better able to share, the tremendous opportunities on offer there. The visit included a day in Cairns, finishing with dinner in

         It should be noted that the assistance being provided by my department and portfolio agency, Tourism Australia, is in addition to measures taken by the Commonwealth Government under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements and the Commonwealth and Queensland Government funded Rural Resilience Fund. It is also over and above other support such as TQUAL Grants and funding for Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Projects. In the 2009 round of TQUAL grants, $100,000 was provided to Mount Flagstone Station Pty Ltd, 45 kms southwest of Townsville, to assist with the refurbishment of the historic homestead to provide quality farm-stay accommodation in the Townsville region. In the first round of Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Projects in 2008-09, over $16 million of funding was provided to the
