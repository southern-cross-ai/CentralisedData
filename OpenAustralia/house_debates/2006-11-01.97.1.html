        Last night over 1,200 people attended the Crown Palladium for a celebration of people with disabilities. People with disabilities participated in organising the night, which was to raise money to build a $4.5 million new facility at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Eira" rel="nofollow">
         Glen Eira
        </a>
        for 15 adults with disabilities, plus respite care for families and carers and facilities for socialising.
       </p>
       <p>
        The name of the project is ‘Building a

        ’. Robyne Schwarz, the passionate head of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Care" rel="nofollow">
         Jewish Care
        </a>
        , who is leading this proposal, describes this $4.5 million redevelopment of the Glen Eira properties as something that will offer regular respite for adults living within the community as well as a permanent place for people to live. The proposed development underscores Jewish Care’s commitment to growing and expanding disability services. New services will be created with the redevelopment, which will allow more adults with high and specialised needs to be cared for in some of Jewish Care’s existing facilities.
       </p>

        I want to pay tribute to Naomi Milgrom, who not only is deservedly a leader in business but also was sharing her wider social responsibility, was patron of the night and—like Robyne Schwarz and all of the team at Jewish Care, including Louise Zygier and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Zimmermann" rel="nofollow">
         Richard Zimmermann
        </a>
        , the director of development—is leading this wonderful effort to see that Jewish Care’s facilities in this crucial area are expanded.
       </p>
       <p>
        What was most impressive about last night was not only the support pledged by individuals, including the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Pratt Foundation
        </a>
        and the Victorian government—
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brumby" rel="nofollow">
         John Brumby
        </a>
        , the Treasurer, was there pledging $150,000 over five years and some money towards support services—but the involvement of volunteers and people with disabilities from the homes themselves. It was led by Lenny Gross, a local businessman whom I know well—I am often in his shop, Lenny’s. There was a wonderful presentation of drumming by people with disabilities. Lenny apparently told the function last night—my better half, Amanda, attended—that there is more to life than just business. That is what his wife told him. He therefore got out into the community and is working twice a week with adults with disabilities and giving them something creative to do. He led this drumming, which made a great impression on people last night.
