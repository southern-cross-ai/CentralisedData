        My question is to the Prime Minister. On 29 May the Prime Minister said the government has a jobs target. What is it?

        <p>
         We went to the last election committing to generating another 1.5 million jobs. That's what we did. We went to the election with that very commitment, and in our first six years that's exactly what we achieved. We generated that through policies that we put in place and working with the Australian economy and the businesses that make it up—the many small business and medium-size businesses. That's what we achieved.
        </p>
        <p>
         Now, the COVID-19 crisis has wiped 30 months of job growth from the Australian economy, and that is a devastating outcome. But what the Australian people know is that this government has demonstrated its ability to work with businesses, employers and employees across this country to generate jobs, and they know we can do it again. They know that's what they need. They know they need a government who knows how to create jobs, and that's what the JobMaker program is all about. That is the program I have outlined to the country and that, indeed, the Treasurer will add further to when the economic statement is released later in July and, of course, in the budget in October. This government knows how to generate jobs, and it's jobs that Australians need. That's why we will remain committed to generating those jobs and regaining those jobs that have been taken from Australians during the COVID-19 crisis. Our government has the policies to achieve it.
        </p>

         I had the opportunity to see a copy of the speech the Leader of the Opposition was supposed to deliver on economic policy this week. I am not surprised he did not decide to deliver it, because there was nothing in it. The Leader of the Opposition's great national solution to the problems of jobs in this country is a national driver's licence. What's next—harmonisation of shopper dockets?

          <p>
           I have because the Leader of the Opposition is off the policy topic, and that's the economy and jobs. We will be working to restore those jobs that have been lost and generate even more, and we will update on those targets when we present the budget later this year. But our government has delivered jobs and will deliver jobs again. Our government balanced the budget again. We'll be putting in place the decisions to do it again.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Australian public know that we know how to run an economy, particularly at a time like this. This Leader of the Opposition is shallow-thin when it comes to economic policy. He has no experience on the issue of economic policy, and his shadow Treasurer has even less.
