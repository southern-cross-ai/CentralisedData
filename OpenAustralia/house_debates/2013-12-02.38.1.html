       <p>
        ( I rise to acknowledge a great Australian Paralympian swimmer, Jacqueline Freney, who last month was named
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        Young Australian of the Year. Although Jacqueline and her family live just outside my electorate, in the seaside village of Skennars Head, I was fortunate enough to get to know Jacqueline and her parents, Michael and Joanne, when they lived in Casino.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jacqueline Freney is an inspiration to me, to the people of the northern rivers of New South Wales and to all Australians. She exemplifies the great Australian attitude of, when you are told you cannot do something, doing it anywayâ€”and proving all your detractors wrong. Jacqueline was born with cerebral palsy diplegia, which restricts the movement of her legs and body. But, coming from a swimming family, she was determined to follow them into the pool and she set herself the goal of one day becoming a competitive swimmer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rising to such a challenge can only be done with the support of your family, and this was the case with Jacqueline. She was expertly coached by her father, who runs the swimming classes in my electorate at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evans_Head" rel="nofollow">
         Evans Head
        </a>
        and the Casino pool. She names her father, Michael, and her grandfather, Peter, as the most influential people in her swimming career. I congratulate her on behalf of the people of Page.
