            A deliberate decision was taken to rip off working families and consequently a deliberate decision was taken for a propaganda campaign to try and disguise that fact. Some $120 million of taxpayers’ money was ultimately allocated towards that advertising campaign. Let us remember the highlights of this propaganda war: the 36-page booklet that contained the example of Billy, who got a minimum wage job and lost everything else. He lost public holidays, rest breaks, bonuses, annual leave loading, allowances, penalty rates, shift loadings and overtime—Billy with a minimum wage job in this propaganda.

                laws. So 3.5 million of them ended up being shredded by the Howard government itself. These booklets sat in storage containers around the country costing taxpayers, to add insult to injury. They paid the $2 million for the booklets, then they paid $110,000—

                   propaganda that Australian taxpayers paid for—$2 million on those booklets and then $110,000 to store them from October 2005 until 28 September 2007, more than 3½ million of them. And, on the topic of pulping fiction: whoever is the

                   character of the Howard-Costello government, whoever used to do the clean-up jobs, then ordered that these booklets be pulped—and they were pulped, immediately before the election campaign started. But we found 436,000 of them that the clean-up job missed, and we are ensuring that today they are pulped, just like the Rudd Labor government will pulp Work Choices.

                   On the question of pulp fiction, the Manager of Opposition Business is today trying to get away with the biggest fiction of them all: he is trying to pretend that members of the Howard government, Howard government ministers, did not know that Work Choices could hurt Australian working families. He is trying to pretend that the only Australians who did not know Work Choices could hurt working families were the Australians sitting around the Howard government ministerial table. Apparently they are the only ones who missed out on the news. The member for Higgins, hunched over

                     I am searching for an explanation, Mr Speaker, which could possibly make the version from the Manager of Opposition Business true. So here we have the Howard government ministers around the ministerial table—the only Australians who do not know, according to him, that

                     is hurting working families, so self-absorbed are they by their divisions: the member for Higgins hunched over his wallet note, the current shadow minister for family and community services hunched over the

                     defence minutes because that was his role, the current shadow Treasurer hunched over a number sheet—apparently the only ones who were so self-absorbed they did not know that Work Choices was hurting working families. Well, this truly is fiction. Each and every one of them knew that it was hurting working families. Before the election they defended Work Choices with propaganda, and now they defend it with their Senate numbers. It is time to do what the Australian people want and vote for Labor’s—
