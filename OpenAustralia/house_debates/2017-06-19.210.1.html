       <p>
        I want to take the opportunity to raise the impacts of the WestConnex project on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Peters" rel="nofollow">
         St Peters
        </a>
        , a community in my electorate. The fact is that St Peters has suffered substantially not just from the compulsory acquisition of tens of homes but also where the state government literally withheld a report that they had about the financial compensation that should be due to those homeowners. They have suffered from the demolition of those homes and factories in their area, much of which has had an impact on local schools, particularly St Peters Public School. But since March they have suffered from a noxious smell that has impacted the local community from the fact that much of the major works is in an old tip. Indeed, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Protection_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         Environment Protection Authority
        </a>
        produced a prevention notice to contractors in March which said that they should 'undertake all reasonable and feasible measures to prevent leachate from pooling' and to cover or remove pooled leachate as soon as practicable. That has not happened. Children are being kept inside St Peters Public School, unable to play or go out at lunch. This needs to be fixed by the state government. and it needs to be fixed now.
