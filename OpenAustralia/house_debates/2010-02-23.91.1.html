        I rise today to talk about a couple of upcoming community events in the electorate of Swan. This Sunday I will be hosting a community walk around Tomato Lake in Kewdale to raise awareness of organ donation week 2010. I think it is particularly important to talk about organ donation in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        because Western Australia has the lowest rate of donation in the country. Nationally, there is never enough supply of organ donors to meet demand. In 2009, there were 850 organs transplanted in Australia; however, on 4 January 2010, there were still 1,770 people on the Australian organ transplant waiting list. In 2008, only one-third of the demand for solid organ transplantation was able to be met.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the main reasons for the shortfall is the low family consent rate for organ donation to proceed. Families must always give the final permission to go ahead with the organ donation but, because 30 per cent of organ donors do not discuss their wishes with their family, almost half of the donations do not proceed. I understand it is often a difficult issue to discuss with family and friends, but it is important to do so. As we have heard so often, one donation can change lives. One donor can save the lives of up to ten people. I have previously registered as a donor and I have spoken to my son Jarrad about the issue, encouraging him and his mates to become donors. I hope that the walk on Sunday will raise awareness in Kewdale and across my electorate of Swan and encourage more people to register to donate their organs and discuss their desire to donate with their loved ones.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second event I want to talk about is the world’s greatest shave, which I will be participating in this year. There are two options: either to get coloured or to be shaved—but I am going to go for the shave. I am taking part to encourage people to either join in or at least donate to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukaemia_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Leukaemia Foundation
        </a>
        . Leukaemia is the sixth most common disease in Australia and it is estimated that every two hours someone loses their life to the disease. The Leukaemia Foundation is dedicated to the care and cure of patients and families living with leukaemias, lymphomas, myeoloma and related blood disorders. The foundation does very important work by supporting people who have been diagnosed with leukaemia and the valuable research work they do benefits our society. The community should join in on this day and have some fun along the way.
       </p>
       <p>
        The shave day has become a national event that has raised many thousands of dollars for the foundation. I look forward to the shave day at Carousel Shopping Centre and invite people from my electorate who want to donate to attend on the day. Prior to that day, they can visit my office or contact the Leukaemia Foundation direct. Anyone who attends the shopping centre on the day to see me get shaved can come along and get a photo with their new streamlined-look politician and at the same time make a donation to the Leukaemia Foundation.
