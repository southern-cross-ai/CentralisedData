            In the House
           </a>
           today the prime ministers of Australia and the United Kingdom spoke of the common bond between our countries based on our shared values. Although these values ranged across a number of areas, Mr Blair specifically talked about how both our countries were open—we welcomed people and we were open to looking at change, to embracing diversity and to seeing the value that could be derived from that.
          </p>
          <p>
           Here in Australia we so often take for granted the legacy that our democratic Westminster parliamentary system, coupled with a strong Judeo-Christian heritage, has bequeathed to us: equality for men and women, access to and accountability of government, respect for the rule of law, the freedom to receive reward for work and the freedom to choose our faith without fear of persecution or oppression. Despite the fact that in a utopian world everyone would enjoy this, clearly not all people do enjoy this legacy. There are countries where these sentiments are voiced and are perhaps even included in the legal framework underpinning their system of government, but the reality for people on the ground can be quite different.
          </p>
          <p>
           Without going back to the subject of this motion, we can refer to the current situation in Afghanistan where Mr Abdul Rahman has been apprehended and is facing trial and possible execution for his choice to live out his faith in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ" rel="nofollow">
            Jesus Christ
           </a>
           as a Christian. According to media reports, it may be that international pressure has moved the government of President Karzai to engineer a reprieve. The response, however, of other leaders in that country, such as Abdul Raulf—who is considered a moderate and who was jailed three times for opposing the Taliban regime—has been to highlight that, even if the government bows to ‘Western pressure’, they will incite the people to rise up and ‘pull him to pieces’, as apostasy is a crime punishable by death under their law.
          </p>
          <p>
           The incident which prompted this motion today was the dreadful event of 29 October 2005 in Poso,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Sulawesi" rel="nofollow">
            Central Sulawesi
           </a>
           , Indonesia, where three people were brutally murdered by beheading. They were not criminals, militants or hostages; they were schoolgirls, whose only crime was their choice to live as Christians in a country where freedom of religion is guaranteed by the constitution. The long history of violence in Central Sulawesi has caused the deaths of thousands of people and the displacement of tens of thousands of refugees who are fleeing religious persecution. The response of the Indonesian government—which has been to condemn the attacks, to send additional police to investigate the murders and to give their commitment to bringing the perpetrators to account—is most welcome. Welcome also is the possibility of a judicial review by the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_Supreme_Court" rel="nofollow">
            Indonesian Supreme Court
           </a>
           into the effect of the recent ministerial decree concerning the construction of houses of worship, which both moderate Muslim and Christian groups fear will discriminate against minorities, disregard human rights and contravene the Indonesian constitution.
          </p>
          <p>
           In drawing the attention of the House to these issues, I wish not only to highlight what has happened to these people, to pass on our sympathies to the families concerned and to note to the Indonesian government that we welcome their actions but also to highlight the response of the Australian media to these incidents. The beheading of hostages in Iraq or the arrest of Mr Rahman in Afghanistan have become front-page news. This contrasts greatly with the beheading of these three girls, which it appears was barely newsworthy, only making it to page 16 of the newspaper. Indeed, following that tragedy, two more young women, Ivon and Siti, both 17, have been murdered. They were shot in the head near a church in Poso and, to the best of my knowledge, their murders have not been reported in mainstream Australian media. Why? Are their lives worth less? Have we just started to accept that things like this happen in other places?
          </p>
          <p>
           The danger for Australia is taking for granted the freedoms, the security and the values that we enjoy, not realising that by ignoring the plight of others, whether here or overseas, we undermine the strength of our own society. It can start by tolerating abuse because ‘it happened overseas’. It can start by tolerating the intolerant in our own country, because to confront them may cause offence. As Mr Blair said, Australia is a great, open country. We welcome people from many nations. As we welcome them and look to uphold our values, we must also speak out against violations, whether overseas or in Australia, to make sure that the values that we hold dear as a country continue to underpin the inclusive and tolerant society that we have.

           </small>
           <p>
            I would like to join with my colleague the member for Wakefield in expressing my profound horror and sadness at the brutal killing of three young Indonesian girls in October 2005. The beheading of these innocent—and indeed that is what they were, innocent—young schoolgirls because of their Christian faith is barbaric. It is an act of unadulterated evil and a senseless consequence of misguided religious fanaticism.
           </p>
           <p>
            When confronted with such a callous disregard for human life, we need to pause and reflect on the fact that, despite the existence of laws, conventions, bills of rights and constitutions around the world which are meant to protect fundamental human rights and religious freedoms, sadly, abuses and violations still occur. That is why this motion today is so important. To remain silent about atrocities taking place in our own neighbourhood or in our own backyard would be irresponsible on our part and a dereliction of our duty as a democratic society that says it upholds and preserves the rights of individuals, among which is the right of individuals to pursue whatever religious faith they wish to practise.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is our duty to condemn the brutal killing of these young girls and, in doing so, we hope that we can play a small part in preventing such atrocities from recurring—although, sadly, that has not been the case since the beheading of the three girls in Indonesia in October last year.
           </p>
           <p>
            I am speaking to this motion today to express not only my horror at these events but also my interest in nurturing Australia’s relationship with Indonesia and in promoting dialogue between the different faiths and cultures of our global community in order to promote peaceful coexistence amongst people.
           </p>
           <p>
            I represent one of the largest Muslim minorities in Australia in this place and I have been very active in my electorate in promoting dialogue, including participating in our very successful local interfaith network. Since its establishment in early 2001, this network has had a remarkable response from our local religious communities, which have welcomed the opportunity to come together and seek to understand and learn from each other. Forums such as this prove that we can overcome our diversity and differences and live together peacefully and productively. But we can only do this if all groups and individuals involved are prepared to treat each other with equal value and respect and, indeed, we can only do this if the political and religious leaders of a community lead by example. The success of the dialogue and partnerships can be seen in my electorate of Calwell, which has remained calm and harmonious despite the racial and religious unrest found elsewhere, both internationally and even here at home in Australia.
           </p>
           <p>
            I agree with the call of the member for Wakefield to the Indonesian government to investigate this matter and to bring the perpetrators to justice. I have no doubt that the government of Indonesia, which is a democracy based on the rule of law, will do exactly that. But beyond that I want to strongly support the call of the member for Wakefield for both Indonesia and Australia to remain, despite this, committed to peace and enhancing mutual understanding and cooperation between our people. The Labor opposition is firmly committed to this purpose and I am sure that every member in this parliament is also committed to this purpose.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are all aware that Indonesia has experienced many racial and religious difficulties over the years. Indeed,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Sulawesi" rel="nofollow">
             Central Sulawesi
            </a>
            and Poso, where the atrocities took place, were the scene of bitter fighting between Muslims and Christians between 1998 and 2002 in particular. In fact, over 1,000 people were killed before a government brokered truce managed to subdue the violence. Tension, however, remains high. In May last year, a bomb exploded in the nearby predominantly Christian town of Tentana, killing 22 people and injuring over 30. It is believed that the fighting, which took place four years ago, drew Islamic militants from all over Indonesia who have targeted Central Sulawesi as a region that can be turned into a foundation stone for an Islamic state.
           </p>
           <p>
            Today we need to condemn militancy and religious fanaticism not only in Indonesia but also around the world. Fanaticism is one of the root causes of hatred and violence. Its tragic legacy can be seen around the world. I need only refer to the bombings in
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" rel="nofollow">
             New York
            </a>
            , Bali, London, Baghdad and Madrid, to name but a few. It is important to say to those who commit violence in the name of religion, whether it be Christianity or Islam, that their actions are totally inconsistent with the teachings of their respective religious doctrines. Both
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_and_Christianity" rel="nofollow">
             Islam and Christianity
            </a>
            condemn violence and cruelty and uphold the sanctity and dignity of human life. It is important that we condemn all forms of fanaticism, in particular religious fanaticism, because they impose a significant threat to our world community. It is important that we take collective responsibility to ameliorate the circumstances and factors that create tensions and drive fanaticism. There is goodwill in Indonesia towards Australia as there is goodwill in Australia towards Indonesia and we must protect and build on this goodwill.

            <p>
             I rise to speak this afternoon in very strong support of the motion moved by the member for Wakefield. I would like to congratulate him on his sensitivity in raising this within the government’s party room and in this place during question time. I also congratulate him on his forthrightness but also sensitivity, having regard to all of the issues, in bringing this private member’s motion forward to the parliament.
            </p>
            <p>
             I think his motion very appropriately makes the point strongly and delicately that the brutal executions of three Indonesian girls in October last year are a deeply serious matter which should concern every Indonesian, every Australian and every world citizen. I welcome my colleagues on both sides of this House expressing their sorrow in this parliament and I join them in that. The motion expresses our deep sorrow to both the government and the people of Indonesia but, in particular, to the families who were directly affected by the killings of these three dear girls. It also condemns the beheadings, as there was a culprit or group of culprits here. The motion regards this as an act of brutality and terror and a very serious abuse of human rights. It welcomes steps by the government of Indonesia to investigate this incident and to ensure that justice is administered, if indeed it is possible. The motion also conveys to the government and the people of Indonesia that the Australian government remains committed to peace and reconciliation in Indonesia and to enhancing our mutual understanding and cooperation as good neighbours in our region.
            </p>
            <p>
             It may perhaps disappoint some, as they listen to the broadcast or read this in

             . In it, David O’Shea talked about the loss of at least 1,000 and perhaps as many as 2,000 lives beginning in around 1998. A vibrant community in Poso, once home to 40,000 people, both Christian and Muslim, is now a Muslim town of around 5,000. David O’Shea talked about an incident in December 1998 when a drunken boy entered a mosque. In the finish, two young men, one Muslim and one Christian, had a drunken fight and the Muslim boy was stabbed. What happened after that is still disputed, but we know that trouble broke out.

             It is also fair to say that, in that part of the world, most civil unrest is stirred up by other elements, allegedly by the military or Jakarta’s corrupt elite and, importantly, by Laksar Jihad, which is a very well entrenched organisation in the region and which has a sophisticated propaganda wing. They do stir up trouble and portray the Christians as the aggressors. Just as they did in November 2001, they have found it is not hard to rouse the Muslim masses.

             The children, in this instance, were singing before a community of Christians in their burnt-down church. There was no roof and there were barely any walls. The girls were singing:

             Oh dear Lord, how much longer are your children to endure this oppression as a result of the unrest? Christmas is upon us once more. We find ourselves in the ruins of your kindness. We hope and pray your peace will be everlasting. Though storms may break over us, though we are forced to suffer, we will always worship You.

              I commend the motion and very briefly note the horrific murders that have been specified. However, I will use this debate for a broader comment on Indonesian human rights. No doubt there have been a number of advances in recent years as Indonesia moves towards a more democratic regime. Indonesia’s constitutional court has shown its independence, and Indonesia has become the first Asian country to endorse all eight
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILO" rel="nofollow">
               ILO
              </a>
              conventions. There are no restrictions on women’s political activities in the nation. There have been direct elections at provincial levels, at county levels and at city levels, and, of course, in the last few years there has been a more open media.
             </p>
             <p>
              That is not to detract from the significant challenges and the real human rights issues that the government faces. I commend the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Immigration_and_Multicultural_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
               Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs
              </a>
              for the swift decision in recent weeks on the 43 refugee claimants from Papua. It contrasts with the deliberate delaying of decisions in respect of large numbers of Timorese, whose claims were of varying credibility but were all given credibility by the department’s failure over many years to face up to its responsibility to say something about the occupation of Timor for fear it might have posed difficulties for our relationship with Indonesia. Indonesia has made marked advances, and we should recognise them. We should recognise the current government’s strivings to improve.
             </p>
             <p>
              It is interesting to note that, whilst we are mainly concerned with Islamic fundamentalism, the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
               US
              </a>
              State Department, as a fairly credible source, cite problems such as Hindu restrictions on the practice of Friday prayers by Muslims in Bali. So it is sometimes a very complex, localised situation. However, a
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US_State_Department" rel="nofollow">
               US State Department

              ’s document on Indonesia has put the country in some perspective. They noted a more noticeable trend over the past few years towards using broadly worded criminal laws that limit the freedom of expression. They also noted that journalists ‘face violence and intimidation from police, soldiers, government officials and rebels’. There are instances such as the persecution of the Ahmadi sect of Islam on 15 July and, in September, attacks on their religious institutions in
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Java" rel="nofollow">
               West Java
              </a>
              . There have been dozens of disappearances, and there has been the use of torture. The US State Department has said that torture has sometimes been used to obtain confessions, to punish suspects and to seek information that intimidates others.
             </p>
             <p>
              I talked briefly about Indonesia becoming the first country in Asia to endorse all eight ILO conventions. On a positive front, the Indonesian police force has worked with the ILO to change practices in regard to demonstrations and industrial action. However, on the other front, the imposition of export processing zones has meant that there are exceptions to Indonesian laws in labour matters, which mean that there are still difficulties for union organisation in the country.
             </p>
             <p>
              On ethnic matters, in 2004 the Attorney-General found that 60 articles of law discriminated against the Chinese minority. Whilst noting that, and having concerns about that, we should not shy away from the fact that the Indonesian regime is actually doing something about it and is tackling it. In May 2004

              a decade or so ago over Timor, was refused a work visa and stay rights in Indonesia because of her criticism of the regime. We see a continued colonial presence in Papua based upon rather dubious legal foundations of a so-called ‘vote of free choice’. Indonesia is determined to hold onto that because of the vital mining deposits in the country, as is most clearly shown in Freeport.
             </p>
             <p>
              In conclusion, I commend the member for Wakefield for bringing forward this motion. It does cite a very graphic, horrible instance, and we would hope that the Indonesian authorities press home investigations and reprimand the culprits. We should recognise the very real advances in Indonesia in the last few years but at the same time the complexity of the situation and sometimes reversions.

              <p>
               I rise to support this motion in respect of human rights and religious tolerance because it gives me an opportunity to outline the very good work of Australia, in cooperation with Indonesia, in this area. I also rise to temper some of the attempts to censure our northern neighbour through comments about individual incidents, which I fear is no more constructive than the Indonesian parliament censuring Australia for events in Cronulla. After all, both nations, along with all of our near Asian neighbours, with Australia, have challenges in human rights and religious and cultural freedoms. Make no mistake.
              </p>
              <p>
               When we look back—perhaps a decade from now—on the events of the last 12 months, our achievements will be measured by our ability at a community level with our near Asian neighbours to foster community strengthening and conflict resolution strategies and by the technical and training aid that we provide to our near Asian neighbours. We will be measured at a national level by our interfaith dialogue and at an international level by the conventions to which we and our near Asian neighbours are signatories.
              </p>
              <p>
               I begin by pointing out that we are both signatories to the International Convention on the Rights of the Child. Every year, dating back to 1981, Australia has been a co-sponsor of a motion on the declaration on the elimination of intolerance and discrimination in both religion and belief. Indonesia has taken very important steps just recently in respect of the international covenant on civil and political freedoms and the international covenant on economic, social and cultural freedoms.
              </p>
              <p>
               At the most basic level in a community, our achievements will be judged not by what we say in this place about individual events, for I believe that is quite unconstructive. That is not to say, of course, that we sanction them. Far more important, and what we will be measured on 10 years from today, is what we do at community level, what we can achieve at family level in the battle of ideas. As I alluded to in my maiden speech, our urgent appointment is right now with our near Asian neighbours to make sure that when youths—be they from a disadvantaged background or a privileged one—are inevitably confronted with a choice between intolerance and taking that path of moderation, understanding and prudence, we win that battle of ideas to which we contribute with our near Asian neighbours, and they choose the latter.
              </p>
              <p>
               I think Australia is doing an excellent job with trade, with aid, with technical assistance and of course, at a national level, with the interfaith dialogue. That began in November 2004 and was repeated again this month in Cebu. It reached out to moderate Islamic leaders and empowered them and their voices. It said, ‘How are we going to empower you to have a coalition with governments, because you have a vital role in speaking to your supporters, and to help make those choices at village level?’ Be it around a fire, under a tree or around a kitchen table, it is happening here and it is happening with our near Asian neighbours. I want to emphasise that that is an international collaboration, fundamentally against terrorism.
              </p>
              <p>
               The Minister for Foreign Affairs was right to say that this is not a battle between
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_and_Christianity" rel="nofollow">
                Islam and Christianity
               </a>
               ; it is between tolerance and intolerance—it is between those who support those fundamental freedoms held by our near Asian neighbours as well as in Australia and those who attempt to break them down. Australia’s role has been substantial at the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
                UN
               </a>
               level. We have worked exceptionally hard at regional level. Finally, we have worked with assistance and aid at the local level. At the level of interfaith dialogue, the chance is to take moderate religious beliefs, be they those of people right here in Australia or our near Asian neighbours, and work to ensure that their voices are being heard in government and that those in government, reciprocally, are actually listening.
              </p>
              <p>
               So, to this motion today, I simply say that in highlighting individual acts, barbarous as they are, we need look no further than the response of the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Indonesia" rel="nofollow">
                President of Indonesia
               </a>
               , who said:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               I condemn this barbarous killing, whoever the perpetrators are and whatever their motives.
              </p>
              <p>
               Nothing could be clearer. Nothing is clearer in sharia law: it is obviously absolutely intolerable to kill innocent civilians. And that strong rhetoric was backed up with action. It was backed up by moving the chief of police and 800 security staff straight to Poso to restore the situation there. So we have evidence that there is a deep commitment in Indonesia, as there is here. Finally, we have seen reform locally with their 1969 regulations on construction of places of worship and with Indonesia’s recent signing of a number of international covenants to empower this. I think they should be acknowledged.

                <p>
                 Might I first acknowledge that all the contributors I have listened to in this debate have approached what is a terrible tragedy with great understanding of both its importance and the complexities that face Indonesia in dealing effectively with a multicultural and multifaith community forged together out of a variety of different islands previously under Dutch dominion. I think that tone of debate does this parliament great credit.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In relation to religious extremism, it is certainly possible to point to events such as the beheading of those three Christian girls—a terrible tragedy. It is possible to point to Afghanistan, where their courts are considering the death penalty for an apostate who has converted to Christianity. But we look only in one direction if we look towards extremism when it is manifested by persons of Islamic background. Look to India, where a Christian missionary was burnt hideously to death by Hindu extremists. Look to acts even in our recent times of extremists following odd and quite unacceptable brands of Christian faith—the ‘Lord’s soldiers’, I think they are called, in Africa, who have committed unspeakable atrocities using kids as young as seven and eight to carry guns, to kill their parents and to impose a reign of terror in that part of Africa where they have temporary dominion.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Look, too, to our not so distant past, where those carrying the cross brought to
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_America" rel="nofollow">
                  South America
                 </a>
                 unimaginable horrors—enslavement and tragedy to the native South Americans. More recently and with less tragic consequences for the people of Papua was the very fact that Christian missions there were responsible for enormous cultural destruction—the destruction of longhouses and cultural evidence of any belief other than Christianity—as they arrived, which has contributed to the difficulties of that emerging nation as it struggles to deal with its own complexities.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Of course, Indonesia, as the member for Reid has quite properly mentioned, has made enormous strides, some with the assistance and cooperation of the Australian government. I know that Brian Burdekin, a former Commissioner for
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights" rel="nofollow">
                  Human Rights
                 </a>
                 in Australia, has had good and effective dialogue with his Indonesian counterparts. There are many in Australia and Indonesia who would share the kind of tone of discussion that is occurring today, notwithstanding the temptation to inflame debate that events such as the grant of asylum to those who left
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Irian" rel="nofollow">
                  West Irian
                 </a>
                 and came to Australia might give rise to in that other country.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I join with the member for Reid in his comments about the circumstances of that country. Our own behaviour in Papua was less than exemplary. Although in the end independence was granted, it came in circumstances of which Australia really cannot be proud. It was delayed for far too long and then pushed forward in haste. And since independence little attention has been paid to that country’s long-ongoing national integrity. There are real difficulties about the manner in which
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Papua" rel="nofollow">
                  West Papua
                 </a>
                 was incorporated into the Indonesian state—what many call ‘a so-called act of free choice’.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Nonetheless, both the government and Labor have made plain that they accept Indonesian sovereignty over that country. But that does not mean that we should not calmly, sensibly and with great dignity make a case for the internationalisation of human rights. If human rights matter, they must be universal and they must extend to all religions, to all persons and to all peoples. Of course, that means we do not turn blind eyes to circumstances where people come to this country in genuine fear of persecution, irrespective of the fact that we regard their country as indissoluble.
