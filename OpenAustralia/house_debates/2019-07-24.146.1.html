       <p>
        All of us are here in this place because of a group of extraordinary volunteers who give up their time and give their labour for free. Chief among the volunteers in Berowra has been my conference president,

        .
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Matt Cross
        </a>
        is an extraordinary Liberal who has served our conference for 18 years and has been the president of the conference for the last three years. Matt turned up at his first Liberal Party meeting as a schoolboy in his St Leo's school uniform, aged 16, just before the 2001 election. He was motivated to help out then, and he has helped in every campaign in Berowra since, and in countless campaigns across the state.
       </p>
       <p>
        Matt has held various office positions in our conference, including as vice-president. He was president of the Northcott, now Hornsby Berowra,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Liberals" rel="nofollow">

        . He was secretary of the Hornsby state electorate conference. He's been secretary of the Normanhurst branch. Matt has worked for Liberals as well. He worked for my predecessor,

        </a>
        , and then he went to work for both of the first two state premiers in the current Liberal government in

       <p>
        Matt's contribution to our party across New South Wales has been extraordinary. Recently, Matt returned to Australia after a period of time at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_University" rel="nofollow">
         Harvard University
        </a>
        , where he completed his masters degree. He brought back with him a great presence in his life: his wonderful fiancee, Jess. Matt and Jess have decided to make their home in another part of Sydney and, as a result, at the recent Berowra

        meeting, Matt chose to step down as conference president and move to another area.
       </p>
       <p>
        We in the Berowra FEC are very grateful—and I am particularly grateful—for all of the efforts and work that Matt has put into our party. I hope that at some point in time in the future Matt will join me and others here or serve in one of our state parliamentary offices. As a person of great principle, a person committed to Liberal values, a person who, through his own efforts and his loyalty to our cause over many years, has demonstrated that he believes that the Liberal way is the best way for New South Wales and for Australia, he will make a great contribution.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm delighted to stand in the House tonight and, in Matt Cross, salute the work of an extraordinary Liberal, a great friend and the best conference president a new member of parliament could want. Matt, I wish you and your fiancee, Jess, many years of happiness and success, both in your political career and in your professional career. I am so grateful for your kindness, your friendship and all the things that you've done for me. It's wonderful to have a moment to pay tribute to you tonight.
