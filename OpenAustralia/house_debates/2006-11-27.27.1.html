        It is with great sadness that I report to the House the death of Mr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Jarvis" rel="nofollow">
         Jim Jarvis
        </a>
        , who passed away on Monday, 1 November at the age of 71. Jim Jarvis was a former
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Mayor" rel="nofollow">
         Lord Mayor
        </a>
        of Adelaide, once a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fleet_Street" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        journalist, a business entrepreneur and a very proud Adelaidian. Whilst he will be remembered by many for his role as the city’s 73rd lord mayor, leading the council from 1985 to 1987, he also served on a number of charitable and advisory boards, and he ran his own successful marketing firm,

        I had the privilege of meeting and working with Jim Jarvis in recent times. He made a wonderful contribution to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        community, business and social life, and he did some particularly admirable work during his time with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Vision" rel="nofollow">
         World Vision
        </a>
        and the Don Dunstan Foundation. Jim was a true family man, a devoted father and husband to his large family. On behalf of many of my constituents in the electorate of Adelaide, I would like to express my sincerest condolences to Jim’s wife, Sky, his family and friends. I know he will be sorely missed by our community and all those he has touched all over the world. I thank him for the wonderful contribution that he has made to the city of Adelaide.
