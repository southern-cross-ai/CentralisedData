        really shaped my view of politics growing up. I was extraordinarily proud, watching

        And yet the ABC is under attack from conservatives—or people who call themselves conservatives but really don't understand what true conservatism means. True conservatives would be proud of the fact that it was a conservative government that founded the ABC—the Lyons government. True conservatives would understand the value of institutions. True conservatives would recognise the difference between a national broadcaster and a state broadcaster. This government is perpetrating the old view taken by
