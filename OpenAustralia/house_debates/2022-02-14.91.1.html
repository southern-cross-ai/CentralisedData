       <p>
        My question as to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm he failed to order enough rapid antigen tests, said it wasn't his job and blamed the states; he failed to order enough vaccines when it counted and said it wasn't a race; and, during the bushfires, he went missing and said he didn't hold a hose. Why won't the Prime Minister just do his job?

         Since the pandemic hit, 1.1 million jobs have been created, and 11.5 million Australians have benefited from tax relief over the last three years. There are 700,000 jobs that have been saved through JobKeeper, and 71.3 per cent of trade and exports are now covered by free trade agreements.
        </p>
        <p>
         Eight hundred and fifteen thousand six hundred female business operators are in place as of August last year, compared to 647,000 in 2013. Two hundred and twenty thousand trade apprentices are now in trade training, the highest number on record. There's been a 20 per cent reduction in emissions since 2005. One in four homes has rooftop solar. Electricity bills are down five per cent in the last year and eight per cent in the last two years. There are 1,213 major transport projects, supporting 100,000 jobs. Over 99 per cent of homes and businesses now have

         access. There are over 1,200 mobile blackspot base stations now funded, with over 900 already built. There are 135,000 new home projects backed by HomeBuilder, and 300,000 Australians or more are in their homes because of direct support provided by government since the last election alone.
        </p>
        <p>
         Over 93 per cent of Australians are double vaccinated, one of the highest rates in the world. We are ranked second in the world for pandemic preparedness by the

         . A hundred thousand defence industry jobs and 15,000 small and medium businesses are being supported. Over 4,000 visas have been cancelled or refused for criminals since 2019. A hundred and sixty-three thousand one hundred and five new aged-care homecare packages have been delivered since the last election. Five hundred and two thousand four hundred and thirteen people are now being supported by the National Disability Insurance Scheme; that's up from 277,155 at the time of the last election. Over 94 million telehealth consultations have been conducted, and we've revolutionised telehealth.

         I'd be happy to have an extension of time, but the clock will beat me. But what I can tell you is that that's what doing your job looks like. That's what it looks like. This Leader of the Labor party wouldn't be able to keep up if he tried.
