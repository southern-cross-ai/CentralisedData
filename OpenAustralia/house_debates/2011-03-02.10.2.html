       <p>
        This motion establishes a joint select committee into the Christmas Island tragedy which occurred on 15 December 2010. This is an important inquiry for a number of reasons, the first of which is to acknowledge the human tragedy that occurred at Rocky Point that day and to demonstrate that the Australian parliament too recognises the human consequences. Forty-one people were rescued from the water, one person swam ashore and 30 bodies were recovered, with others lost at sea. It was a harrowing experience for all involved: the people on the vessel; the local Christmas Island residents, who did everything they could to help the survivors; and the Customs and Navy officers involved in the dangerous rescue and search mission. True bravery was on display during the incident. Differences were cast aside as people took great risks to help and ultimately to save lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was on Christmas Island on the day of the tragedy and met firsthand local residents and Customs, Navy and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
         AFP
        </a>
        officers working to assist the rescue. I was honoured to be able to personally express appreciation for their work and their courage, and I want to publicly acknowledge and thank them. Their efforts saved lives. I also acknowledge the AFP members of the disaster victim identification unit, who had the tough and painstaking work of identifying the victims and treating the deceased and their families with sensitivity and respect. Finally, I want to pay particular tribute to those crew in the tenders and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIB" rel="nofollow">
         RIB
        </a>
        s who plucked 41 survivors from the sea. I am indeed looking forward to thanking them personally when time permits.
       </p>
       <p>
        In establishing this committee, the government acknowledges the important reviews that have already occurred and those processes which are still continuing: the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service internal review, which was publicly released on 24 January this year; the Christmas Island Emergency Management Committee review; the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        state coronial inquiry, which is on foot; and the Australian Federal Police criminal investigation on matters under Australia’s people-smuggling laws.
       </p>
       <p>
        Similarly, the joint select committee will build on the work of the standing group which was established by the Prime Minister on the day following the tragedy. The standing group was created to ensure that the facts surrounding the incident were known and reported as they became clear, to provide direct accountability between all government agencies involved in the incident and the parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the Prime Minister said on 16 December 2010 when she announced the standing group, it is important that ‘every truth, every fact about this tragic incident, is known to decision makers and the general public’. The establishment of the standing group was also recognition of the tragedy that occurred, and the members and senators who participated showed honest compassion and professionalism in coming together to address this incident as both Australians and representatives of their communities—not just as representatives of a political party. I would like to publicly acknowledge the standing group and to thank all of its members: Senator Xenophon,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Fielding" rel="nofollow">
         Senator Fielding
        </a>
        , Senator Hanson-Young and Mr Crook. The joint select committee will of course also include members of the opposition, and I call on them to ensure that, so far as possible, the bipartisanship continues. I trust that we can work constructively in that vein.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the key intentions of the government in establishing this committee is to ensure that the Australian community are able to understand what happened during this tragic incident and to provide information to parliamentarians in a transparent way. It is for that reason that the terms of reference for the joint select committee are focused on reviewing the operational response of all Commonwealth agencies, including both the direct response effort and the after-incident support. This will incorporate consideration of how agencies work together, how they coordinated responsibility for responding, the adequacy of their equipment and the location of that equipment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The community needs to understand what happened and to consider whether, collectively, there is anything else that could have been done. While we cannot protect against every eventuality, the government is committed to ensuring that our agencies and the Christmas Island community are appropriately resourced to respond.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Gillard government condemns people smuggling. It sees criminals profit at the expense of others and puts the lives and safety of people at risk.
       </p>
       <p>
        Customs has taken the first step towards answering some of the questions; however, their review was limited to Customs’ internal processes and its response to the tragedy. The joint select committee will go beyond this and will ensure that a collective whole-of-government understanding exists and that the whole-of-government response works as well as it possibly can. We want to ensure that our agencies are equipped to respond to the sudden emergence of a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLAS" rel="nofollow">
         SOLAS
        </a>
        situation in and around Christmas Island.
       </p>
       <p>
        Already the government is acting on the recommendations put forward to date. We have accepted all eight recommendations from the Customs internal review. We will be trialling new surveillance tools, we will provide additional safety and rescue equipment, and we will deliver more vessels to the AFP and the Department of

        <p>
         The coalition joins with the government in supporting the establishment of the joint select committee on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
          Christmas Island
         </a>
         tragedy of 15 December 2010. This committee process is an important part of the ongoing process of examining all the issues and details that specifically pertain to this terribly tragic incident in December of last year. This was an extraordinary event. It is an event that none of us want to see happen again, and it is an event which I think calls for new and extraordinary arrangements to ensure that we cover all the processes that are required.
        </p>
        <p>
         The composition of this committee is not usual in terms of the involvement of crossbenchers, opposition parties and the government. The coalition is happy to cooperate with the government to have this different set of arrangements for the formation of this committee to enable this task to be undertaken. Obviously, in doing so I am sure the government will agree that this does not form any precedent for these types of arrangements on an ongoing basis, and we appreciate the discussions we have had with the government along those lines.
        </p>
        <p>
         This inquiry will examine the details of what occurred around that fateful day and the things that have been done since then to support those who were involved. I want to thank the government on behalf of the shadow minister for border protection and myself for the timely and open access we had to information from the government over those terrible days. The coalition sought briefings and were given briefings. Those briefings were freely offered, and we found that process to be very effective at a very difficult time. I particularly want to thank the minister at the table, the Minister for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
          Home Affairs
         </a>
         , Minister for Justice and Minister for Privacy and Freedom of Information and I want to thank the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship for the very open and direct access we had, as I know that the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister for foreign affairs also had as we worked through that process.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is a new process. As the minister said, we have had other reviews to date. We have had the internal review undertaken by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Customs" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Customs
         </a>
         and Border Protection Service. I want to place on record again, in joining with the minister, the coalition’s thanks and appreciation to the men and women of the Customs and Border Protection Service and the men and women of our defence forces who were involved in the border protection command. I want to put on record again our thanks to all of those in the
