       <p>
        I take this opportunity to inform the House about a small community in my electorate called Blyth, just 15 minutes to the west of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_Valley" rel="nofollow">

        . Blyth is a small town with an enormous heart. With only 300 residents, the town has just completed a fundraiser in support of the Cancer Foundation which raised more than $35,000. Initiated by champion local shearer Daryl Andreske, who was sick of the spectre of cancer in our lives and wanted to do something to help, Daryl volunteered to shear for 24 hours in support of the cause. With the assistance of an enthusiastic local committee led by Graeme Wandel, the program was put together with an aim to raise $10,000. Local sponsors—and on the day sponsorship from members in the crowd paying for individual sheep to be shorn—catering and late night entertainment saw the total pushed to $35,000. People were exhorted to support by enthusiastic

        . Daryl shore for nine two-hour shifts interspersed by normal alternating half-hour and one-hour breaks through the 24 hours—a total of 469 sheep. One mathematician calculated Daryl dragged 22 tonnes of sheep across the board during the event. A crowd estimated as in excess of 1,000 attended throughout the course of the event, showing the widespread interest and support that this event generated in the larger community. Daryl’s mates were rostered on to make sure he never had less than about 50 people in the crowd urging him on, even in the wee hours of the morning. Despite intensive training including consulting a sports psychologist, Daryl was pretty much spent by the end of it. My congratulations go to Blyth and Daryl.
