        I have a great news story. I rise to inform the House that in February this year the Boronia
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Football Club
        </a>
        switched on its new floodlights at Millers Reserve for the first time. Their actual home ground is at Tormore Road in Boronia, but this club is doing so well that they need two grounds for training. Sadly, it was going to be the juniors who missed out unless we came to the rescue. I was delighted to see come to life the $50,000 commitment I made on behalf of the Australian government prior to the 2004 election. It was terrific to see the new lights operating on training nights for this footie season. It is only because of running a very strong economy that we can help local footy clubs such as Boronia.

        Australia is renowned around the world for its rich sporting tradition. The Boronia Football Club is one of the countless small clubs across Australia that form part of this great tradition at a grassroots level. Boronia Football Club has been part of the fabric of the local community since it was formed in 1932, 75 years ago this year. Today the Boronia Football Club has one of the largest Auskick programs in Victoria, and I understand that there are around 280 kids participating each weekend, which is absolutely amazing when you consider childhood obesity and getting kids out of watching

        To that end, I congratulate

I must also congratulate the club’s president, Scott Cartledge, and many others at the club who have given up their time to contribute to the club, including Fiona Osborne,

        , Fraser McDonald, Frank Carrol and Darren Linkins. It has been a great honour for me to be the No. 1 ticket holder for the Boronia Football Club for the past three seasons. This year we expect them to have a first division win by their seniors. They are an amazing, hardworking football club. The firsts did not have a great year last year but, when I went there recently, I noticed that the players this year seem super fit and super keen, and I am looking forward to the past presidents’ lunch on 16 June. In closing, let me just say: go the Hawks.
