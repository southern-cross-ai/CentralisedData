       <p>
        On 29 September 2006, I had the honour of turning the first sod to mark the beginning of work on stage 2 of the $70.5 million duplication of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Bass Highway
        </a>
        between Penguin and Ulverstone. Due for completion in February 2008, this project will deliver a continuous four-lane highway between Devonport and Burnie, the two major centres on Tasmania’s north-west coast—or, as I call it, Tasmania’s sunshine coast. By shortening travelling times between these two major centres, this highway will make it easier for the people of the north-west to interact and do business. There is no doubt that a freeway-standard road will bring both social and economic benefits to the region.
       </p>
       <p>
        This $70.5 million project is being funded entirely by the Australian government, further illustrating the commitment of this government to serving the people of north-west Tasmania. I am pleased to say that the $28.5 million first stage of this project, undertaken by local firm Shaw Contracting, was completed in February of this year, some five months ahead of schedule. It is another example of working to the cause in Tasmania. The five-kilometre section of road extending west of the Leven Bridge towards Penguin includes an interchange and three new underpasses. As will be appreciated, roadworks of this nature involve the moving of a staggering amount of earth. As a by-product of this project, two new public recreation areas have been created, thus increasing community facilities in this region.
       </p>
       <p>
        The upgrade has improved not only travelling times through this section of highway but also road safety for the travelling public. In association with the

        of Tasmania, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Automobile_Association" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        recently released its first star ratings for Australia’s
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AusLink" rel="nofollow">
         AusLink
        </a>
        national network. Of particular note was the statement of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RACT" rel="nofollow">
         RACT
        </a>
        ’s chief engineer, Mr Doug Ling, who was reported in the
        <i>
         Advocate
        </i>
        newspaper as saying that there was:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ... no doubt the risk of crashes on the Bass Highway has been reduced by recent upgrades.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Ling also said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ... the risk rating would continue to get lower as we continue to upgrade this vital transport corridor.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are not just talking about the stage 2 roadworks further reducing travelling times but also talking about the fact that the highway will continue to be made safer for all road users. As the president of the Road Trauma Support Team of Tasmania, the issue of road safety is one close to my heart. Not only will the road improvements reduce travelling times; the improved safety features will also reduce road trauma, and that is a far more important objective.
       </p>
       <p>
        We all know that most road accidents are caused by human error—there is no doubting that—however, road design is also a factor that should not be ignored. That is why I am particularly pleased that the road safety design features that were incorporated into the first stage of the Bass Highway duplication will also be used in the second stage. For example, the median strip between opposing lanes of traffic will contain a safety barrier and will be landscaped with leafy shrubbery to reduce headlight glare at night. Noise reduction measures will also be used to minimise sound impacts on local residents. The $42 million 5.5 kilometre second stage includes a new bridge over the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leven_River" rel="nofollow">
         Leven River
        </a>
        , as well as a duplication of the Forth Road interchange underpass and the Lovett Street interchange underpass at Ulverstone.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate both Van Ek Contracting Pty Ltd on winning the design and construct contract for the new Leven River Bridge and Hazell Brothers Civil Contracting Pty Ltd for winning the roadworks contract. The new bridge is expected to be completed by December next year and the associated roadworks are expected to be completed shortly thereafter. Together with our $15 million contribution to the upgrading of the notorious Sisters Hills section of the Bass Highway, the Australian government is injecting a massive amount of funding into the transport infrastructure of north-west Tasmania to benefit the locals and tourists alike. On behalf of my electorate I would like to commend the Australian government for its ongoing support of the people of north-west Tasmania.
