        On indulgence, for the benefit of members regarding arrangements for sittings, the Senate a little while ago carried a resolution which enabled the Senate to sit until 10 pm this evening but then be suspended until 9 am tomorrow. They, of course, are having a break of an hour, from 6.30 pm until 7.30 pm, when they will not sit. So perhaps we could have a bipartisan suggestion that they might like to do things a bit quicker.

        I am advised that with the transmission time required for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">

        bills—and this is not often understood—things do not just finish in the Senate and arrive here—there is a procedure that is beyond capacity to change, which will take anything up to three to four hours, I am advised by the Senate officials. I will consult with the Acting Manager of Opposition Business, the member for Menzies, prior to four o’clock to make a definite call on whether it is the case that it is worth while us waiting around this evening. If it is not the case, then it is in the interests, particularly of the parliamentary staff, that we suspend the sitting. If the Senate is to sit tomorrow, given the transmission time, it is probably more efficient in terms of people going about the arrangements they have made according to the sitting schedule. Perhaps we can do what we did last time, which is to come back on Monday. But we will make that decision—

         and perhaps if people object, they might like to talk to their Senate colleagues in the other chamber.

          Order! I am about to make two reports from the Main Committee in relation to condolences. I would hope that I could get the cooperation of the House for at least these two motions.
