       <p>
        Today I would like to pay tribute to the hundreds of year 12 students in my electorate of Isaacs who begin their final exams this week. I want to acknowledge them and congratulate all of them on the dedication and sacrifice they have shown over what has been a very, very challenging year. Usually I'd be attending school graduations at this time of year, which is one of my favourite activities as a member of parliament, but sadly, because of COVID-19, it won't be possible this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        The final year of high school is, for many students, filled with mixed emotions. It is a challenging year at the best of times. It draws to a close 13 years of schooling over which students have become young adults, forged strong friendships and grown academically. Year 12 students in my electorate and across the country were forced to dig deep this year as they faced the many challenges put before them because of the COVID-19 restrictions. As a result, many students missed out on treasured milestones like their final school camp and the year 12 formal. I say to them: I'm terribly sorry that many of you missed out on these important experiences; yet, faced with these challenges, you've shown tremendous courage. The resilience you've developed this year will undoubtedly serve you well in work, in higher education and beyond.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to thank the fantastic teachers and support staff for keeping their schools going in such trying circumstances. The care and compassion you have shown to your students demonstrate your dedication in educating our next generation of leaders. I thank you; your students thank you; and Australia thanks you.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I must pay tribute to the parents and carers of year 12 students for working away tirelessly behind the scenes to support our students. We recognise and acknowledge your hard work and commitment, and we cannot thank you enough.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm sorry I cannot be there with you to celebrate your achievements and the final days of high school. I hope that you have received my award certificate folder. I will genuinely miss being there to hand these out in person, as I've done for more than a decade. I'm tremendously excited about your future. Many of you will decide on a future course of study at university or take on an apprenticeship, while others will become young entrepreneurs and start a business. No matter how long it takes, you will find your place. Please know that I and all of us in our community are proud of you.
