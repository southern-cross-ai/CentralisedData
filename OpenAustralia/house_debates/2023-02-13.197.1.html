        On Friday morning, I heard the power of truth in storytelling as I attended the Memories in the Mall commemorative ceremony hosted by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_City_Council" rel="nofollow">

        and the Gandangara Local Aboriginal Land Council. Our own local elder, Aunty Barbara Simms, stepped up on the stage and shared her story. Her story moved me. Auntie Barbara told us how she was forcibly taken from her home in

        , where she lived with her mother and father, when she was just eight years old. Her three brothers and sisters were also taken away. Imagine an eight-year-old child today, a primary school age child, being taken from their family. It's unthinkable.
       </p>
       <p>
        As many of you know, today is the anniversary of the Apology to the

        . It is a significant day for all of us as Australians. It's a day when we can acknowledge our past and reflect on our history while looking ahead to what our future holds.

        As I was saying, as Aunty Barbara said, it was now time to think about how we can walk together, talk together and break bread together. Breaking bread together is a true symbol of reconciliation, forgiveness and harmony.

        Back in 2008, when the then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said sorry to the Stolen Generations, Aunty Barbara was there in person. I, for one, am humbled by her words. She is a woman of strength and resilience. She is an inspiration to all Australians, past, present and future.

        people are the original storytellers, and I want to thank Aunty Barbara for sharing her story. Your words are truly words of wisdom, thank you.
