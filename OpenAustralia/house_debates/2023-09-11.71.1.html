        My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister update the House on additional funding for public and community housing he has agreed to with the Greens today to ensure that the Housing Australia Future Fund Bill passes the Senate this week?

         I thank the leader of the Greens for his question. I am indeed very pleased that the Housing Australia Future Fund now has majority support in the Senate, with the

          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         , the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Greens
         </a>
         and all the crossbenchers from the Jacqui Lambie party as well as Senator Pocock all declaring their support, like crossbenchers did, for social and community housing to be built in this country.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have a comprehensive housing plan. The $10 billion for the HAFF includes 30,000 additional social and affordable homes for women and children escaping domestic violence, for veterans and to fix up remote housing. In addition to that, we have our $2 billion Social Housing Accelerator, which we announced in June. In addition to that, we've announced a new national target to build 1.2 million homes over five years and the $3 billion New Homes Bonus so that state governments get homes built. In addition to that, with National Cabinet, we've announced a better deal for renters. Today we have committed an additional $1 billion in funding for the National Housing Infrastructure Facility to build more homes for Australians who need them. I thank the crossbenchers in this chamber and in the other chamber for joining with the Labor government to make sure this is done.
        </p>
        <p>
         These are the last of the commitments that I made in budget replies to put into legislation. We spent our time in opposition developing good policy that will become good programs in government. Cheaper child care will be in place from 1 July. The National Reconstruction Fund—in place. Fixing aged care, Rewiring the Nation—all of these plans have now been put in place.

           We developed policy in opposition to deliver in government, and that is what we are doing—working for Australia each and every day. I thank the Leader of the Greens for the constructive discussions that we have had.
          </p>
          <p>
           The coalition, obsessed as they are with just saying no to everything, are the great irrelevancy in Australian politics today. They marginalise themselves, they sit in the corner and they just say no to everything because that is just their response. The coalition of yesterday turned into the 'no-alition' of today, obsessed with their negativity.

            Before I call the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, there is far too much noise in the chamber. We are not having a repeat of last week. The member for Deakin and the member for Barker will leave the chamber under standing order 94(a).
