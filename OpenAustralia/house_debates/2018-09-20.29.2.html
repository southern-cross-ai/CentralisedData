       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill amends the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporations_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Corporations Act
        </a>
        2001(Corporations Act) to address corporate misuse of the Fair Entitlements Guarantee scheme.
       </p>
       <p>
        This vital legislation cracks down hard on companies which try to evade their obligations to workers and shift the burden to taxpayers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Corporate misuse of the Fair Entitlements Guarantee scheme places an unfair burden on Australian taxpayers, who ultimately bear the costs of employers improperly relying on the scheme.
       </p>
       <p>
        It also creates an unfair commercial advantage over honest competitor businesses which do the right thing by their employees.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill will mean we have stronger levers to ensure employers are held accountable for their obligations:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FEG" rel="nofollow">
         FEG
        </a>
        is an important safety net for Australian workers which protects employment entitlements when workers lose their job due to their employer's insolvency.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst the overwhelming majority of companies are doing the right thing, unfortunately, some employers shift employee costs onto the FEG scheme for their own advantage or just to exploit the scheme.
       </p>
       <p>
        These changes are tightly targeted to deter and punish only those who seek to avoid their employee entitlement obligations and exploit the FEG scheme.
       </p>
       <p>
        This improper use of FEG is contributing to a significant increase in scheme costs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Average annual costs under the scheme have more than tripled from $70.7 million in the four years to 30 June 2009 to $235.3 million in the four years to 30 June 2018.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments in part 1 of schedule 1 of this bill strengthen enforcement and recovery options under the Corporations Act to deter and penalise company directors and other persons who engage in or facilitate transactions that are aimed at preventing, avoiding or significantly reducing employer liability for employee entitlements in insolvency.
       </p>
       <p>
        The changes in part 1 of schedule 1 of the bill include:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The amendments in part 2 of schedule 1 of this bill enable the court to make a contribution order against an entity in a corporate group or closely connected economic relationship with an insolvent company, where:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The amendments in part 3 of schedule 1 of this bill strengthen the ability of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Securities_and_Investments_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Securities and Investments Commission
        </a>
        to disqualify company directors and other officers, either directly or on application to the court, where they have a track record of corporate contraventions and inappropriately using the FEG scheme to pay outstanding employee entitlements.
       </p>
       <p>
        The reforms are the result of extensive public consultation processes conducted during 2017 and 2018. They have been developed with the government's insolvent trading safe harbour reforms in mind and are tightly targeted to deter and punish only those who do the wrong thing by workers and taxpayers. They will not affect the overwhelming majority of companies that are doing the right thing.
       </p>
       <p>
        The reforms build on other actions that the government has taken to protect employee entitlements, such as;
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The Legislative and Governance Forum for Corporations was consulted in relation to the bill and has approved it as required under the Corporations Agreement 2002.
       </p>
       <p>
        Full details of the measure are contained in the explanatory memorandum.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am sure that all of those present will be keen to support the bill and ensure these important protections for workers and taxpayers come into effect as soon as possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
