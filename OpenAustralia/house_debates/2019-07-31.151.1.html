        I would like to draw the attention of the Chamber to all the volunteers in my electorate of Brand. I know National Volunteer Week was in May—not that far away—but given how much our community relies on volunteers, quite frankly every week could be National Volunteer Week, where we spend time thanking volunteers for their hard work for communities right around our country.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was very pleased recently to attend a volunteer thank you event organised by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Rockingham" rel="nofollow">
         City of Rockingham
        </a>
        . This event, hosted by Deputy Mayor Deb Hamblin, was to recognise the vast array of advisory committees, working groups, emergency services groups and other volunteers across Rockingham. They included the Department of Fire and

        ; and there are so many more that I'm unable to continue going through the list. I would particularly like to mention the advisory committees that advise the councillors, the mayor and the deputy mayor of the City of Rockingham.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to single out the Rockingham Volunteer Fire and Rescue Service, who that night celebrated 30 years of dedicated service to the organisation by their star volunteer, Mr Barry Stagg. I'm very pleased to acknowledge in the parliament of this nation Barry's years of service, provided humbly and in good humour. Congratulations once again, Barry. I know you adore all the attention you're getting from the community and from me now, and I really hope you enjoy serving and continue to serve our community, as you have done for so many years.

        As many in this place would know, volunteers are at the heart of the democratic process of Australia. They make an invaluable contribution to whichever field they choose to help in. In our case, of course, it's politics, and in many ways it can be difficult during some of the more passionate and sometimes absurd clashes of ideas that happen out in the community, particularly during an election campaign. Political volunteers help out their chosen party or candidate through the strength of their conviction and their commitment to helping make the world a better place through engagement at a grassroots community level. I'm very grateful to have the volunteers I do have in Brand, many of whom have helped out on countless federal and state campaigns. They're a fantastic bunch of people. Lois Robinson, our star doorknocker: rain, hail or shine, she was out there spreading our message. She shows age is no barrier to enthusiasm.

        , master of all things pre-poll and phone calling: his sense of humour across the campaign was a great antidote to all the tougher days that a campaign can have. Owen Farmer: I don't think Owen missed a single campaign event the whole time. His work with the homeless community in Brand is something of great pride to me as his federal member. And Margaret Sweeney: always reliable and always effective. Thank you to you all.
