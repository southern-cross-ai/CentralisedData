        I rise to welcome and acknowledge comments in Queensland media today about infrastructure needs, particularly in the broader south-east Queensland region, which encompasses my home town, my home city, Toowoomba. Specifically, media today refers to a proposal from the Council Of Mayors South East Queensland, chaired by Lord Mayor Graham Quirk in Brisbane. The deputy chair is His Worship Paul Antonio, the mayor of Toowoomba.
       </p>
       <p>
        This a proposal for rapid rail network trains, travelling up to 250 kilometres an hour, carrying passengers to Brisbane from the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        or Toowoomba in under 45 minutes. This is a very ambitious plan. This media today repeats what was stated in the media back on 8 October, which talked about this ambitious plan and explained very clearly the blueprint for it was in a report by major infrastructure consultants
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMEC" rel="nofollow">

        , who were commissioned by the Council Of Mayors South East Queensland to look at transport, in that case, as part of the feasibility study into a possible

        bid for south-east Queensland in the years to come. That's very, very exciting.
       </p>
       <p>
        That report referred to the inclusion of Toowoomba in that long-term planning. It suggested that another recent $15 million business case grant to determine passenger rail requirements between Toowoomba and Brisbane could bring that plan forward. I acknowledge that in particular because that's specifically the plan, the grant, I announced as the local member for Groom and as former Minister for Regional Development, Territories and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">

        back at budget time on 8 May this year. I stress the budget papers say:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian Government has committed $15 million for planning for the Toowoomba to Brisbane Passenger Rail â€¦ through the Major Project Business Case Fund.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's committed. It's a proposal that I developed after consulting
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Fullerton" rel="nofollow">
         John Fullerton
        </a>
        , the

         Australian Rail Track Corporation
        </a>
        . Certainly I have discussed it with Richard Wankmuller, the CEO of Inland Rail. That inland rail connection could give us the infrastructure on which to base passenger rail connection as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Here we are, almost six months down the track from that announcement. I say to the bureaucrats and the planners: we are fair dinkum about regional development, we are fair dinkum about managing congestion in major centres and we are fair dinkum about this Toowoomba-Brisbane passenger rail network. I'm concerned that after six months there appears to have been no progress on getting that study underway. I certainly will be following this up. I will not let this project slip away.
