        The summer holiday season is a wonderful time of the year, with a range of community events held in my electorate of Holt to celebrate the season. One iconic event is the Twilight Carols at the Westfield shopping centre at Max Pawsey Reserve, conducted by Larry Sebastian of the wonderful Casey City Church.

        I do not think it is any secret that we are ending the year in fairly challenging circumstances, with many people in my area unsure of what the future holds for them. This is not a time to assign blame, but I remind this chamber and our people that we live in a great country and I believe our country's best days are yet to come. Our country's strength derives from its peopleâ€”their sense of resilience, purpose and community. I believe we will get through this terrible set of circumstances following the announcement of

        pulling out of Australia. I want to express my sympathies to all of the thousands of affected workers in the Casey and Dandenong regions.
       </p>
       <p>
        I received an email today from an automotive components worker who is in despair about his future, as well as the future of his family and his 400 co-workers. We need to work together in this place. People want us to work together to fix this issue.

        will discuss accountability, but I state that I believe in the Australian people and that Australia is a great country. I believe manufacturing does have a future in Australia, and the Australian government needs to do what it can to strengthen manufacturing.
       </p>
       <p>
        I heard a ridiculous argument from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Murray" rel="nofollow">
         Paul Murray
        </a>
        that we do not make cars that are good enough. What a load of rubbish! It made me sick to my stomach to hear someone talking about Australian products in that way. Holden and Ford cars made in Australia are great. The product is good enough, but we have a problem with our currency. Commentators should not go on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">

        and say Australians do not make great things. They do, but manufacturers are confronting circumstances beyond their control. Do not blame the workers for the problems, because they are making a product that is great. We stand in solidarity with all those who have lost their jobs or who are about to lose their jobs. We owe it to them to work together to make sure manufacturing has a future in this country.
