        I want to take this opportunity to talk about just a few of the activities and achievements of note that are taking place in my local schools. I readily acknowledge that these are just the tip of the iceberg and that every day, in schools across my electorate and around the nation, the dedication of our teachers, support staff, parents and volunteers helps to create places of learning and engagement that are challenging and shaping our leaders of tomorrow.

        It's one of my great joys as a federal member to visit my schools, and it always leaves me inspired and amazed by the achievements of both staff and students. Recently, I had the pleasure of visiting Elanora State School as part of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Week" rel="nofollow">
         National Science Week
        </a>
        , to view the incredible work that their students are doing in science. To see the enthusiasm, inquiry and energy these students had for scientific learning was such a credit to the school and a great sign for the future. I note that Elanora State School also conducts a special coding, drone and robotics club after school to encourage students in these pursuits. It's a fabulous opportunity for these primary school students to gain and grow an interest in science and technology and to help develop skills that we know are so valuable and so important for the future. As an engineer by profession, my own love for science is obvious and well known. I know many other local schools with special science programs who take part in competitions like F1 in Schools, which I have supported over many years, and other enrichment activities that give students practical experience in how science helps shape our world. Congratulations to the staff, students and parents at Elanora State School. I especially acknowledge and welcome their new principal, Toni Robinson.

        In the short time I have left, I want to talk about the community work being done and supported in our schools. Once again, I know that many schools conduct special charity fundraisers for worthy causes, often driven by the students. Earlier this year I visited St Augustine's school, where their social justice team was busy preparing care packs with essential toiletries to give to those in need in the local community. I was also delighted to meet with the Marymount College Interact club and support their efforts by donating a hamper for them to raffle. The club fundraises for St Vincent de Paul to help those in our community who are doing it tough. These are just a few recent examples of exactly the sort of social engagement and community care the Prime Minister was talking about when he spoke about bringing Australians together. I commend the schools in my electorate and I look forward to catching up with them not only during their school visits here but also back in the electorate.
