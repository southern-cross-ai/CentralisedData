        Last weekend was a ripper for community festivals in Hawke. We started on Saturday with SunFest, and what a great day that was. SunFest's reputation, over the years, to put on a good show and turn out the local punters, is absolutely legendary. This year was no different, with fun for families young and old.
       </p>
       <p>
        I caught up with Raquel and Kylie and the awesome team at the Sunbury Aboriginal Corporation who do so much for Indigenous and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        people in our community. I spoke to locals about our plan for Sunbury, including the new urgent care centre, which is on the way. SunFest was put on by the brilliant SunFest committee, led by Craig and Shona. The praise they get is very well deserved.
       </p>

        Then, on Sunday, the kids, Zoe and I caked up for the superhero themed Ballan Autumn Festival. This is a stellar community event in my home town, organised by the amazing Ballan Autumn Festival Committee. Thanks go to President Kevin Harper and the whole team who do such a fantastic job. My mates at the Ballan

        took out the top prize for outstanding float by a community group. And it is true that not all superheroes wear capes. These heroes deserve our endless thanks and admiration, for the work they do.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations also go to the Ballan

        , Ballan Primary School, the local Scouts, the Men's Shed, the Ballan Chamber of Commerce and too many others to name for their efforts throughout the day, and in the months leading up to it, to make it such a success. I'm deeply appreciative of all their efforts. Their work brings our community together and makes Hawke such a fantastic place to live and raise a family.
