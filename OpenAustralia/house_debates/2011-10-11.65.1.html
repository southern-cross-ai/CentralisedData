       <p class="italic">
        That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) the Treasurer, Shadow Treasurer and the Member for Lyne each making a 10 minute statement on tax reform in the House, during Government business time on Wednesday, 12 October 2011;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) after the conclusion of the statements in paragraph (1), five minute statements by Members on tax reform being listed as an item of business in the Main Committee; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) any variation to this arrangement to be made only by a motion moved by a Minister.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, as you would be aware, the tax forum was held last week in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        . Two hundred people came from around the country and engaged in serious policy debate. I was pleased to be at this extremely successful forum and to participate in this exchange of ideas. For those opposite, the tripling of the income-tax-free threshold from $6,200 to $18,000 and a commitment by the government to increase it further to $21,000 is not tax reform. Through this legislation we take one million people out of the tax system.
       </p>
       <p>
        This motion will enable parliament to have an appropriate debate tomorrow. It will be after the discussion that takes place tomorrow and the determination of the Clean Energy Future bills. We will then have this debate for half an hour. It will then be adjourned and referred to the Main Committee to give other members an opportunity to participate in the debate. I congratulate the member for Lyne on his initiative in supporting this forum and participating in it. It is a pity that those opposite simply cannot be bothered to be engaged in the serious policy debates before the nation.
