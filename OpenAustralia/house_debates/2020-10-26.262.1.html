        is based at Townsville hospital. They do an incredible job. They look after families of sick children who are on the roller-coaster of hospital treatment. The house gives those who have come from out of town a place to stay and unwind when they're not sitting anxiously in waiting rooms in the hospital. Anyone with children knows how important it is to keep the family unit together, and that's exactly what

        I was very delighted and extremely happy to be asked to open the Townsville facility's brand-new kitchen. Together with community and individual donors, the federal government put in $176,000 as part of the Building Better Regions Fund. In most households the kitchen is the heart of the home, and that's no different at Ronald McDonald House. This new facility has been built like a home kitchen to make things feel as normal as possible and to ensure that putting together a home-cooked meal is as stress free as possible. We know that, in the kitchen, families can come together and talk about their experiencesâ€”the highs and lows. No-one would wish on anyone having sick children.
