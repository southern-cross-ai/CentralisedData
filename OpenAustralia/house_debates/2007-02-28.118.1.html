        I have spoken many times about my appreciation for our multicultural society and my belief that we need to do more to support the many diverse communities living together in Australia.

       <p>
        Before the suspension, I had just commenced talking about my appreciation for our multicultural society. I would like to once again talk about my support for our multicultural community and my deep belief that we need to be doing more to support the many different communities living together in Australia. This morning I would like to focus on the African communities, particularly those moving into my electorate of Adelaide, where we have an ever-growing African community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have had the opportunity to meet with women’s groups which have been formed to assist these new arrivals to settle into our community. I would like to talk this morning about some wonderful organisations that have been formed, in particular the formation of what is called ‘African Women’s Wisdom 40 Plus’ group, which, as it sounds, is a group comprising women from the following communities: Sudanese, Burundian, Congolese, Liberian and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leonean" rel="nofollow">
         Sierra Leonean
        </a>
        . This group has been formed through a partnership with Lutheran Community Care and the Sudanese Community Association of Australia
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SA" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Branch, and they do some wonderful work in supporting the interests and needs of the African community, alleviating isolation experienced by older African women and focusing on issues such as language barriers.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have had the opportunity to meet with this group on several occasions, including when we gave them a tour of the state parliament to show them our political system. The stories that I have heard when sitting and talking to these women are gripping.

       <p>
        When I recently met and listened to the African women’s wisdom group, I found their stories were gripping, heartfelt and at times tragic, but they all shared one central theme: they all wanted more support to learn English, and to play a greater role in both our workforce and our communities. I, for one, think this is a pretty reasonable request.

        has recently written to the minister for immigration calling for greater support for Lutheran Community Care and for this program. I stand here today to support those calls on the minister to do more to help these communities play an active role amongst local residents. I will continue to call for greater funding for these programs, both within my own party and particularly with the current government.
