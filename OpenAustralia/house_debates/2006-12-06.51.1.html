         I thank the honourable member for Hughes. I can tell her that it is now seven months since the government announced the most far-reaching reform of superannuation in Australia’s history. Former Labor minister

         That was seven months ago, and endorsed by Susan Ryan. We have been waiting breathlessly to hear what the Labor Party thinks about it.

          . Somehow they cannot announce a policy until we introduce the legislation. That, I think, is the member for Hunter’s view: the Labor Party cannot announce a position until they see the bill.

             That is his position. Unfortunately for him it is not the position of Labor spokesmen, because yesterday they did announce their position. Apparently, the member for Hunter has not been let into the loop yet. Yesterday Senator Sherry put out a media release: ‘Labor to support budget superannuation plan’. That was on Wednesday, 6 December. That is funny, the legislation has not been introduced. As we have observed from the member for Hunter, he could not announce a position until it was introduced. Some people will wonder why his position on the front bench is under threat! Others will know. In fact, the ‘guess the shadow Treasurer’ competition has moved into a new phase. The member for Lalor will not step up to the plate. The member for Melbourne—

                say that this is the first good decision that has been taken under the new Leader of the Opposition. It is seven months too late, but finally the Labor Party has brought itself around to support some decent reform in this place. Whilst the Labor Party are about it, let me announce some other decent reforms they could support in this place.
