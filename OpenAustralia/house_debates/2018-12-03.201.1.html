        Every year, in my electorate of Robertson on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        , we run our annual Christmas card competition. This year was our biggest yet, with over 600 entries from local primary school students. My team and I really loved all of the entries, and we loved them so much that we decided to turn every single one into a personalised set of gift tags, as a way of saying thank you to all of those who got involved.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I would like to really congratulate this year's winner, 12-year-old Sienna-Rose from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Cross_Catholic_Primary_School" rel="nofollow">
         Holy Cross Catholic Primary School
        </a>
        . Sienna-Rose had the most beautiful watercolour design of a cockatoo at a local beach. It was an incredibly creative take on this year's theme, 'Our Christmas Day'. Well done, Sienna, on your design.
