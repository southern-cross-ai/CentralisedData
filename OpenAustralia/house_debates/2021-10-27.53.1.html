        My question is to the Prime Minister.

         South Australia
        </a>
        ns, like those in communities across Barker, will soon look forward to their borders reopening, so families can reunite, businesses can ramp up and more people can get back to work. Will the Prime Minister please update the House on how this news demonstrates the Morrison government's national plan is working so we can safely live with the virus and build a stronger Australia?

         I thank the member for Barker for his question. As a proud
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         n, he'll be proud of his state today, because today South Australia exceeded 80 per cent on first dose vaccination. Australia has now passed the United Kingdom on first dose vaccinations across whole of population. We have had one of the lowest fatality rates of COVID-19 in the world. We have had one of the strongest economies, particularly amongst advanced economies, going through COVID in the world, and we're on track to have one of the highest vaccination rates in the world.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today, we know that the TGA has approved the go-forward on the booster program for our vaccinations. I was talking to Jane Malysiak today. You may remember Jane, of Marayong. She joined me for that first dose of the vaccine. We spoke about getting together again for the booster shot, which we'll be able to have as the plan is rolled out by the minister for health, together with Professor Murphy. We will continue that program. Jane was particularly pleased to hear that within about a week and a half Australia is likely to head to 80 per cent double-dose vaccination around the country, which is in line with what the minister for health and others were saying at the beginning of the year.
        </p>
        <p>
         That program means that we're able to open up. We're able to open up under the national plan, which the member for Barker was asking about. South Australia has joined many other states now in outlining their timetable to open up their state under the national plan, which is being achieved by those vaccination rates continuing to rise around the country. We want to see those rates rise particularly in Queensland and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         . We will continue to work with those states to achieve those outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
         On Monday, Australians will be taking off again. Australians will be taking off as international restrictions on travel by vaccinated Australian residents and citizens is lifted, and more than 500,000 Australians have already downloaded their international vaccination certificate which will enable them to do that. We will be concluding very, very shortly our arrangements with Singapore, which next month will see particularly students and business travellers who are double vaccinated being the first to come to Australia out of Singapore. And we welcome the announcements made today in Singapore about Australians being able to travel there from 8 November. By the end of the year, I fully anticipate we will be able to see international visitors, including backpackers, who are double vaccinated being able to come back to Australia. I know that'll be great news to the minister for agriculture, in particular, and the many others around the country who rely on them.
        </p>
        <p>
         The national plan is working. Australia's taking off on Monday. Australia has passed the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
          UK
         </a>
         in single dose vaccinations. We are moving forward strongly under the national plan.
