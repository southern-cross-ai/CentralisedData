        I address my question to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his election promise of August 2007:

       </p>
       <p>
        Will the Prime Minister now admit that the government does not intend to honour its election commitment and that all Australians will pay the price for the government’s failure in public health?

         I thank the member for Kooyong for his question. He is a member in this place whom I have great respect for. However, I say to the member for Kooyong that the question he has just put is actually constructed on a false premise. The undertaking I gave the Australian people, as those opposite will be familiar with, was as follows: that if there was not substantial and serious commitment to health reform and hospitals reform on the part of the states and territories, the government would then proceed to seek a reference from the Australian people with a view to taking over hospitals from the states and territories. Secondly, since the election, as the honourable member will know full well, we have commissioned the Bennett commission of inquiry—

          Oh! Those opposite say ‘inquiries’. Did I hear of inquiries launched recently in the matter of climate change—one inquiry, two inquiries, three inquiries; I think we are up to six now, aren’t we? Yes, six inquiries. Any inquiry will suit those opposite rather than take a position on the

           Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. That is not the Prime Minister’s quote. I know he is selective in the way he uses media but his words were that he would ‘fix public hospitals by mid-2009 or he would seek a mandate for financial control to take’—

                  We will now formally review the member for Dickson’s candidature in the leadership contest for those opposite. The commitment we made was to establish the Bennett commission of inquiry, which is a Health and Hospitals Reform Commission inquiry. It has a wide mandate. It is due to report to the government, I believe, around mid year. It will contain a range of options for the government to consider. We will be responding to those as well.

                    Before the member for Sturt interjects about inquiries and investigations, I would reflect on the appalling substitute for policy action which constitutes the approach of those opposite to climate change right now—refusing to take a position on climate change. The member for Flinders pretends to have a position; the member for Goldstein has the reverse position.

                     Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It is pretty clear on relevance that a question about his election commitments in health cannot stray into climate change.

                       The government’s commissioning of Ms Bennett to conclude this inquiry will have its end point when it reports around midyear. It will examine a range of options for the future of our health and hospital system. Those opposite would also be familiar with this, having themselves sucked out $1 billion in federal investment into the public hospital systems of Australia. The government, through the last

                       meeting, returned that investment into the hospital system and agreed on a wide-ranging set of health and hospital reforms with the states and territories. That is practical action for the future. We will consider the Bennett commission of inquiry’s report when it is deliberated on and concluded, and we will take what necessary action there is for the future. That is a proper course of action on the part of the government, as opposed to those opposite, who saw hospitals as one single opportunity in the past: a political opportunity simply to kick the states at every single pass and to make themselves look like the big, responsible people in Canberra—disinterested in what was happening in the states, disinterested in the crowding in our emergency departments and disinterested in the lengthening lists of procedures which were necessary in hospitals for people who had a range of complaints and medical conditions. Instead, we have engaged in practical cooperative arrangements with the states. We will act on the Bennett commission’s report when it is properly submitted to government.
