       <p>
        My entire community was shocked and deeply saddened by the horrific crash at Dyraaba that took the lives of Shaun, Kaleb and Zara Zagar in June 2013. Shaun, 28, and his children Kaleb, 6, and Zara, 5, were killed on a Tuesday morning when another car crashed into their car as they waited by the side of the road for the school bus. I have met with Andrew Zagar, who is the father of Shaun and grandfather of Kaleb and Zara, to express my and the community's sadness about what was such a needless tragedy. The grief experienced by this family is immeasurable. It is always very upsetting when lives so young are cut so short.

        I want to acknowledge the more than 1,500 people in my community who have signed a petition calling for harsher sentencing for repeat offenders, particularly those offenders under the influence of alcohol and drugs. I share their concerns. This accident was a tragedy that need not have occurred. The petition asks for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Legislative_Assembly" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        to consider harsher penalties for repeat offenders, particularly those under the influence of drugs and alcohol. It asks that repeat offenders who seriously injure or kill another member of society while under the influence or while disqualified from driving be given a minimum 15-year sentence with structured rehabilitation programs of consequence put in place. The driver of the car that crashed into Andrews Zagar's car will face court later next month.
