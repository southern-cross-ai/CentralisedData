        My question is to the Minister for the Environment. I refer the minister to an email from the owner of Homebush Export Meat Company in my electorate which states that due to the repeal of the carbon tax he will be able to expand further, put on another employee in his small business and return to profitability. Will the minister outline what savings have been passed on to families and businesses in

        since the government scrapped the world's biggest carbon tax? Are there any threats to these savings?

         I thank the member for Reid for his question for two reasons: firstly, because he bothered to ask a question about the environment. The shadow minister for the environment has given up. He will ask questions about defence. He will ask questions about education. But in almost two years he has barely asked two questions on the environment and has given up. The second reason I want to thank the member for Reid is that he voted to repeal the carbon tax, and that has meant real benefits to people in his electorate. He knows a little bit about this topic because he comes to this House as a small business owner and a publican. Therefore, he is somebody who has dealt with the cost of refrigerants.

           Let me make this plain. The member for Reid referred to Homebush Export Meat Company. The owner of Homebush meats wrote: 'The carbon tax savings for me will be approximately $2,000 per month in electricity and refrigerant savings.' So what we see is a $24,000 a year benefit to a small business—

               what we see is a $2 billion saving in electricity costs for families and small businesses over two years—a nine per cent saving for businesses and a saving of up to 10 per cent in electricity costs for households. These are legitimate, real reductions in electricity bills.
              </p>
              <p>
               However, the question asked whether or not there were any threats. Of course, the answer is, 'There are.' We know that these electricity savings are threatened, because the Leader of the Opposition wants to bring back a carbon tax with higher electricity prices. So it is time to ask some questions for Bill. It is time to ask him how much he will increase electricity prices by.

                  I shall refer to questions for 'the loyal leader', because we know how loyal he is! So these are questions for the loyal leader. How much will electricity prices increase under his plan to bring back the carbon tax? When will he at least answer as to how much it will be? When will he release his policy for increasing prices and why won't he look small business owners in the eye to say how much he will add to their costs? How much will he add to the costs of families? It is time for the loyal leader to answer questions about his plans for higher electricity prices.
