       <p>
        As the local federal member for Petrie, I see the effort every day that goes into our comeback. Australia's greatest asset in securing our future prosperity is people, of course—the people we represent. Together with Petrie, they make up a nation that we're all proud of.
       </p>
       <p>
        Around 70,600 taxpayers in Petrie will benefit from tax relief of up to $2,745 this year because of the Morrison government's tax relief plan. This is on top of the 76,700 people in Petrie that have already benefited. Small and medium businesses are the backbone of our local Petrie community, and around 19,800 businesses in Petrie write off the full value of any eligible asset they purchase, and that really helps local businesses that supply them and, of course, the employees that work in those businesses. The budget will deliver a further benefit to 6,500 businesses in Petrie who will be able to use the extended loss carry-back measure to support cash flow and confidence during this global pandemic. To businesses like Isuzu and

        in the electorate, up in Burpengary East, this gives confidence to invest in local businesses and jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Boosting us towards future jobs and higher wages includes the government's modern manufacturing investments, tax incentives, and research and development support. This means businesses like Reid Print Technologies in Clontarf, which I recently visited, can innovate to the next level and collaborate with startups on R&amp;D and across industries. For example, they merged their tech into clothing, and it is now a wearable baby monitor to track the temperature and movement of the baby—just brilliant.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the Assistant Minister for Youth and Employment Services I met two young people just last week, Patrick and Ella, at Thor Building Products in Brisbane. Patrick and Ella are part of the nearly 145,000 commencements under the boosting Australian apprenticeships scheme. They said their jobs have given them security—a way to plan for their future. Patrick said he used to work as a casual but he now works full time and has security. So this scheme has helped with underemployment.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's why the budget increases access to the First Home Super Saver Scheme, as well, from $30,000 to $50,000. This is reward for effort, but it gives those people wanting to break into the housing market an opportunity to do so—and there have been more first home buyers this year than in the last 12 years. It has never been a better time to reskill either, with the 1,025 apprenticeships that have started in Petrie. This has been expanded through JobTrainer nationwide, with 500,000 new places.

        I just want to mention aged care. My father-in-law died this week, on Monday, in aged care. He was looked after very well. But what the government has done to help aged care is really important. This will help our recovery.
