        Today I rise to acknowledge the excellent and compassionate work of The Family Co., located in my electorate of Hughes. During the recent election campaign, I was fortunate to meet the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        , Ms Ashleigh Daines, and learn more about The Family Co.'s initiatives. Based in Jannali, The Family Co. creates a safe and positive community where women, children, youth and families can strengthen their ability to face the challenges life throws at them and to realise their best futures. The excellent staff at The Family Co. provide both practical and emotional support to individuals and families. They work with them and they offer them education, connections, information, advocacy and referrals to other services. This is to help increase their own knowledge and help them build the confidence needed, often when they are escaping from the scourge of family and domestic violence. The Family Co. operates with compassion, integrity and courage, with an overriding commitment to the learning and growth of the women and children and families that it assists. Its programs and projects support improved communication and relationships between family members, reduce the impact of poverty and disadvantage on families, and enhance families' capacities to support the growth and development of all family members. Furthermore, The Family Co. affirms and strengthens families' social, cultural and racial identities.
