        Currently South Australia is one of the safest places in the world for coronavirus, but community events in Mayo are thin on the ground. But, when we do host an event, we do it well. One example was Sunday's annual Houghton Spring Fair. We had a stall at the fair and we were very busy. Organisers said it was one of the busiest fairs ever, which meant it was also a great time to launch the building works for the community hub. The vision has been two decades in the makingâ€”20 years of fairs, raffles, sausage sizzles and patiently saving the money. The family-friendly footy club is growing, but the facilities are rudimentary. I remember hosting a forum in the clubrooms and discovering a bucket under the sink, when I was washing the dishes, and that was what was catching the water. It's taken years of advocacy, but I'm pleased that the federal government has committed $600,000 for stage 2 of this project. With $435,000 from the state government, funds from

        and the local

        's fundraising, the 20-year dream is now becoming a reality. When finished, this community will have a true gathering place to be proud of. I'd just like to finish with a quick shout-out to the Paracombe Primary School. I bought four of the children's butternut pumpkin seedlings, and I'm hoping that, like the song, from little things big things will grow, and they will turn into lots of pumpkins for soup in autumn.
