            who create so much opportunity and jobs for our economy and for our citizens! You cannot help but be energised by those enterprising men and women, like in the electorate of the member for Eden-Monaro. When we visited the Yellow Belly Cafe at Googong, you could not help it. It was infectious to see the optimism, the energy, the entrepreneurship, of the proprietors there. We saw it again this morning at the Lonsdale Auto Electrical business: Gordon seizing an opportunity to relocate and grow his business, and excited about the possibility of being able to purchase a hoist or some new diagnostics equipment to help him grow his business and recruit more.
           </p>
           <p>
            That is what this budget is about. This is our next step in building a strong and safe economy that provides jobs and opportunity, which secures our economic future, and that is why people are so positive and optimistic about this budget. It hits the right spot. It hits the right spot because here on this side of the parliament are men and women of enterprise, small business running through their veins, knowing the real issues of those taking a risk, mortgaging their house and creating opportunities for themselves and others. That knowledge has helped ensure that, hand in glove with the small business community, we have crafted a program that hits the right spot, that puts fuel in the engine of the economy and revs it up so that it can create more jobs and more growth into the future.
           </p>
           <p>
            So it is not surprising when you see the endorsements of this budget. Let us have a look at the positivity and the optimism.

             The Institute
            </a>
            of Public Accountants said, 'As a result of this budget, small businesses right across Australia will have greater confidence to employ, to invest, to grow, which will boost our productivity and our prosperity.' The New South Wales Business Chamber said:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            These measures will be particularly well received in regional Australia where unemployment is at its highest and job opportunities are limited.
           </p>
           <p>
            The
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPA" rel="nofollow">
             CPA
            </a>
            organisation, referring to the tax cuts on income for small business referred to by the Prime Minister, said they will help drive the small business sector and allow these businesses to create jobs and invest in our nation's future.
           </p>
           <p>
            Last night was a great night for small business. It shows our faith and our belief in those enterprising men and women that create opportunities for themselves and their communities. That is why we want to get behind those people. They can invest in new equipment, take advantage of growth. They might even buy a pie warmer,

             Opposition Leader
            </a>
            ! And they can do that to delight their customers, to grow their business and to secure our economic future. What a great night for small business! Let you all be reassured: we think about small business every day, Bill.
