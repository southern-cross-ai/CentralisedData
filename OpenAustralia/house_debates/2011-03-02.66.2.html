        <p>
         I thank the member for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McEwen" rel="nofollow">
          McEwen
         </a>
         for his question. The government has set out a plan to tackle climate change by establishing a carbon price through a market mechanism. Of course, a carbon price through a market mechanism is going to be the most economically efficient way of cutting pollution and driving investment in clean energy.
        </p>
        <p>
         On the other side of the chamber, we have the so-called direct action policy. What we know from scrutinising that policy is that it demonstrates that it would cost over $30 billion rather than the claimed $10.5 billion, which would mean that the average Australian family would be $720 a year worse off under the Leader of the Opposition’s direct action policy. Furthermore, under that policy—a direct cost to the budget—there will not be a single dollar of assistance for households to meet those costs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Under direct action any future government is going to face a $30 billion budget black hole. That $30 billion is going to need to be met through higher taxes or cuts in expenditure and cuts to services. Without that expenditure, the opposition has no hope of achieving its stated target of a five per cent cut in emissions by the year 2020. It is bad economics and it is bad for the environment. Interestingly enough, the shadow minister, the member for Flinders, has not in the course of the day—and I have been watching—effectively attempted to deny their figures. He does not deny the $30 billion black hole and he does not deny the $720 cost to families. Instead, the problem is to be solved with the magic bullet of soil carbon.
        </p>
        <p>
         Not only are there significant questions about the science of sequestering carbon through the soil but there are also agreed international rules that prevent us counting soil carbon as abatement for our pollution reduction targets. The member for Flinders seems to be implying that it is all going to be okay because he is going to change the international accounting rules. He is going to go to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         and convince 190-odd countries to change the international accounting rules. I cannot see it happening in a hurry.
        </p>
        <p>
         The opposition have run out all sorts of interference today. They have likened the Prime Minister and other government ministers to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonel_Gaddafi" rel="nofollow">
          Colonel Gaddafi
         </a>
         and all sorts of ridiculous things, but they have not effectively answered this question about their own policy. They will not stand up for market principles. Their policy is a farce. The shadow Treasurer has been pretty vocal about this issue. He is well and truly on the record as a man of market principles. Only some months ago, in the book by Lenore Taylor and David Uren, he said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I was acting industry minister in 2002 when
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Costello" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         He went on to say:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I believe the market mechanism is the best way to price a commodity. I am a true believer in markets.

            My question is to the Treasurer. Has the Treasurer seen the report by Verso Economics in the United Kingdom which finds that, for every job created in the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
             UK
            </a>
            in renewable energy, 3.7 other jobs are lost? It states:

           <p class="italic">
            Research in Spain, Germany and by the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
             EU
            </a>
            suggests that net employment effects are negative, with the likely opportunity costs or costs associated with higher energy prices outstripping the creation of green jobs.
           </p>
           <p>
            Treasurer, how does this fit with your claim that a carbon tax would create additional jobs?

            <p>
             I thank the shadow Treasurer for his question. What we know is that an emissions trading scheme is the cheapest, most cost-effective way of dealing with carbon pollution and driving the creation of jobs, particularly in renewable energy. That is a fact. Whether you go back to the Stern report in the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
              UK
             </a>
             , a report of much higher standing than any that could have been quoted by the shadow Treasurer, or the Treasury modelling that was conducted here recently or indeed most of the reputable work around the world, it all points to the fact that a price on carbon is the cheapest way to drive investment and jobs. It is the cheapest and most efficient way of making your economy more competitive for the long term.
            </p>
            <p>
             There is a very clear difference between this side of the House and those on the other side. We on this side of the House want to charge polluters because they should not be allowed to pollute for free.

                  Nothing could be more relevant than having an emissions trading scheme, which is the cheapest and most-efficient way to reduce carbon pollution and drive investment in the jobs of the future. There is a very clear contrast between our approach and that of those opposite. What they want to do is use a direct action policy which taxes families to hand money to polluters. That is inefficient and it is not sustainable. As the modelling which has been published today shows, their direct action model will cost $30 billion, or $720 for every family, when it is fully operational. There is a very clear contrast.

                    We on this side of the House want to charge polluters and assist industry and households. Those on the other side of the House want to put an unsustainable bill of $30 billion on the public purse, which will be paid for by average families, and give that money to polluters. That is the alternative that we are debating here. No wonder they are so rabid when the contrast is put in that way.

                      Their policy is not efficient, and the member for Wentworth has already pointed this out. Consider for a moment what $30 billion is equivalent to.
