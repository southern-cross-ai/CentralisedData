        Today I would like to talk about a local charity in my electorate of Longman that literally gives you butterflies. I remember vividly the first time I stepped into the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribie_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Bribie Island
        </a>
        Butterfly House and took in this incredible sight of hundreds of butterflies around me. Some, with obviously impeccable taste, even landed on me! The variety of butterflies was incredible. There were butterflies of all shapes, sizes and colours. This wonderful organisation was started by Bribie Island residents Ray and Delphine Archer back in 2014. They had moved to Bribie Island only the year before, to fulfil their dream of retiring on the island. Ray and Delphine's work with butterflies and passion for breeding them began in 2009. The Bribie Island Butterfly House has since become so much more than just a place where you can see beautiful butterflies. This wonderful local volunteer organisation also helps the Bribie Island community by donating around $10,000 each month to other charities, both locally and globally. These funds are all raised through profits made from entrance fees, with an average of 2,000 people per month coming to say hello to the butterflies that live in the Bribie Island Butterfly House. The Bribie Island Butterfly House has many volunteers, who do a fantastic job maintaining the operation of the butterfly house and breeding laboratory. I would like to thank Ray and Delphine Archer and the volunteers at Bribie Island Butterfly House for their enormous contribution to the community. Who knows? Maybe one day Ray will get his dream of Bribie's second name being 'Butterfly Island' coming to fruition.
