        My question is to the Prime Minister. After the election, the Prime Minister said that he had learnt a lesson, a very clear lesson, about his attacks on Medicare. So, why hasn't the Prime Minister abandoned his cuts to breast screening,

        s and X-rays, which will mean Australians will have to pay more vital scans?

          It is interesting that the member for Scullin has participated in the fraudulent misrepresentation that the Leader of the Opposition is guilty of when it comes to Medicare. But it is a funny thing, Member for Scullin, because the truth always comes to the surface. Your question indicates that you have not worked out the truth yet, but we have on this side of the House.

           <p>
            The truth is that this government is investing more in Medicare than any previous government, including any previous Labor government. The truth is that this government saw 17 million more bulk-billed consultations than any previous Labor government. The truth is that the cuts, as you describe them, are not that at all—that agreements with the diagnostic imaging sector and the pathology sector during the campaign made it very clear that we will invest up to $50 million a year in scans, including the ones the member for Scullin mentioned. The diagnostic imaging sector in return said they would maintain the same rate of bulk-billing.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Leader of the Opposition popped up in a new pathology centre every five minutes—remember that?—banging the table. The interesting thing was that he does not appear in any of those centres any more. He might get you to ask the question, Member for Scullin, because he knows the answer. He knows the truth: this government's investment is a record, increasing, sustainable and a whole lot better than Labor's record in government.
           </p>
           <p>
            I will leave you with this Member for Scullin: you cut $6 billion from medicines and Medicare while in government. You, the Labor Party—all of those here who were part of that government—cut $6 billion from Medicare and medicines. Don't tell more lines to the House.
