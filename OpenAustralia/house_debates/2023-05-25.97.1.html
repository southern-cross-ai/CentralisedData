        . My electorate of Brisbane has the youngest demographic in Queensland. Young people both in Brisbane and across the country feel left behind, struggling to afford rent, seeing their

        debt skyrocket and watching their standards of living drop. Under the changes proposed in the budget, the rate of youth allowance will be $602.80 per fortnight, just $43 a day. Young people do not get discounts on their rent or groceries, so why is youth allowance still one of the lowest income support payments?

         <p>
          I'd like to thank the member for his question. What we've done in this budget is a very responsible cost-of-living package for those doing it toughest. As part of our initiatives, we have committed to a $40 increase in the base rate of many of those working-age payments. That, of course, includes JobSeeker, which those opposite have not made a decision about. It also includes Abstudy, Austudy and a range of other payments. This has been responsible and important.
         </p>
         <p>
          I'd like to point out to the House that this base rate increase, which I introduced legislation on into the parliament today, will actually have indexation applied after the base rate has increased on 20 September, if it indeed passes the Senate. I look forward to all of those across the Senate supporting that important piece of legislation. Also, as mentioned previously in question time today, we've increased the maximum rate of Commonwealth rental assistance by 15 per cent—the largest increase in over 30 years. Of course, that will have indexation applied as well. Many students do access Commonwealth rent assistance because they access the private rental market. Therefore, this payment and increase will be very much welcomed by students right around the country.
         </p>
         <p>
          What we've done in this budget is have a carefully calibrated budget that delivers for those on income support, including students, and I hope that we will see the support across the Senate from all parties, including the crossbench, including those opposite, because it will make a real difference to people 's lives.
