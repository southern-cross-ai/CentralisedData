        Earlier this week, I received a message from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brad_Hazzard" rel="nofollow">
         Brad Hazzard
        </a>
        , the Minister for Health in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        , and he gave me the courtesy of telling me that he'd be retiring after 30 years in the parliament. Brad Hazzard is someone who I regard as a friend and someone who's made an enormous contribution, particularly as the Minister for Health during the global pandemic. Brad Hazzard is someone who has always been prepared to reach across the aisle to deliver outcomes, whether that be in New South Wales or whether that be between New South Wales and the national parliament. I regard him as also being a very patient man. He waited a very, very long time to become a minister after many long years in opposition. I wish him and his family well in the future, and I thank him for the constructive relationship that we've had during my time in the national parliament.

         Just briefly, on indulgence, I join with the Prime Minister's remarks and pay tribute to a great minister and a Liberal who's contributed a lot to our party but, most importantly, a considerable amount to our country. He has, during the course of COVID, like many of the health ministers around the country, confronted a very stark set of circumstances and responded with leadership. There were a number of occasions where I spoke with Minister Hazzard during the course of COVID and the governments' collective responses to it. And I wish him well in the next stage of his life. He has led a distinguished career and he has contributed a lot to the state of

          New South Wales

         and to our country.
