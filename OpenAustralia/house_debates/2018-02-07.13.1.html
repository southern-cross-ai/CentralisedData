        Customs Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2018.
       </p>
       <p>
        The customs tariff proposal that I have just tabled removes the customs duty rates applied to herbicides and pesticides imported under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASEAN" rel="nofollow">
         ASEAN
        </a>
        -Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement.
       </p>
       <p>
        These amendments implement early outcomes of the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement announced by the Prime Minister and the President of Indonesia on 26 February 2017.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a result of these amendments, eligible herbicides and pesticides imported under the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement will be subject to a 'free' rate of customs duty, as of 20 September last year.
       </p>
       <p>
        All other parties to the ASEAN-Australia-New Zealand Free Trade Agreement that import significant amounts of these goods have a 'free' rate of customs duty through other trade agreements. As such Indonesia will be an important beneficiary of these amendments. Of course the other very important beneficiaries are Australian farmers, who are major users of pesticides and herbicides. As one of the most competitive nations on earth, our farmers are constantly needing to reduce their costs of production of agricultural products. This is an important initiative, as are all initiatives that reduce the costs for farmers to improve their efficiency and productivity. They, of course, will always jump on those opportunities, being an extraordinary farming sector that has always, for centuries, been effective and productive in what it does.
       </p>
       <p>
        In exchange for this, Indonesia has agreed to reduce the tariff applied to Australian sugar to five per cent. We know how important it is for our sugar exporters to have the best possible markets. It's wonderful to have the minister for trade here at the table; he's playing an extraordinary role in helping and supporting Australian farmers access new markets. We are seeing daily the impact of this on the prices of commodities and in the benefits to farmers. I've got to say, as a farmer myself, I have been astounded at the progress that is being made in getting access to new markets for our products. This is a government that has been hugely supportive of the agricultural sector and the farming sector in Australia. The numbers are in; we are seeing it every day. This bill is just another step in that very, very important direction of giving every Australian farmer access to every possible market. I commend this bill to the House.
