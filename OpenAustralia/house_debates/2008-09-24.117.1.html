       <p>
        On Saturday I attended the closing ceremony of the Evangelical Soccer Association of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        . The association was created in the year 2000 as a way that young Christians could enjoy and gain the benefits of competitive sport without having fixtures on Sundays. I also make the point that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESA" rel="nofollow">
         ESA
        </a>
        of WA is an example of how all the positives of competitive sport can be achieved without reliance on alcohol for social or funding purposes. The ESA have chosen a Christian model that does not exclude, but rather provides a moral guide for generations of boys and girls.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many soccer clubs—I would say the majority of clubs—in Perth have their games on Sundays, which conflicts with the day of worship for Christians. Beyond ensuring that games will not be played on Sundays or on other days such as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_Friday" rel="nofollow">
         Easter Friday
        </a>
        or Christmas, the Evangelical Soccer Association also encourages the appropriate responses and interactions on the sporting field. In this way, faith and sportsmanship have been combined for a very positive overall result.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although there are clubs all over Perth, within the Cowan electorate, I have the Greyhounds and the Kingsway United Soccer Club. At Saturday’s closing ceremony, I was once again impressed with the organisation and the values that the ESA of WA practices. It is always a very well run event. Prayers were said on several occasions by the ESA’s Chaplain, Peter Burne. Trophies were presented to all the champion teams. Individual presentations were made to both teams in each of the finals. And probably most important of all, every competitor from every club received a participation medal. Having coached junior sport for many years, I always knew that for the effort they put in, apart from the enjoyment of the sport, competitors needed some memento of the season.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think that the Evangelical Soccer Association of WA is an excellent sporting organisation. They do things very well. Although I know the participants appreciate the association, its volunteers and administrators, I add my voice and say: well done and please keep up the good work. I congratulate and thank the soccer association’s executive and committee for the successful 2008 season and the great work the association does. The President and Chairman, David del Pino, and his wife, Eleni, have been tireless workers over many years for the association and players. I also thank Roger Edland, Secretary; Samantha Hodge, Treasurer; Avril Web, Registrar; Peter Burne, Chaplain; Peter Wagener, Referee Coordinator; Carl Overbye, North Zone Representative; Craig Danfield, Coach Coordinator; Brendan Lindstrom, Adult Competition Coordinator; and Chrissy Haddock, Management Committee member. I should also thank Sonshine
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM" rel="nofollow">
         FM
        </a>
        radio for their support of the Evangelical Soccer Association. Once again, I say well done to the ESA, and all the best for 2009.
