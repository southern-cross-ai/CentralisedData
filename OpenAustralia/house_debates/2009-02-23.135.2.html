       <p>
        Last week I had the honour of joining my colleague the member for Parkes in attending a commemoration at Boggabilla for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Len_Waters" rel="nofollow">
         Len Waters
        </a>
        , Australia’s first Aboriginal fighter pilot, and also attending a ceremony at Toomelah, where the service of Indigenous veterans was acknowledged by the laying of a commemorative plaque. Men such as Len Waters have served Australia with pride and distinction. He logged more than 103 hours of combat flying and he was involved in 95 operations and 26 sorties against the Japanese. His service is rightly acclaimed. His family, his community and Australia have much of which to be proud. It is important that we acknowledge all of those who served, and by commemorating Len Waters and laying the commemorative plaque at Toomelah we can but try to pass on our gratitude to those who have protected Australia, as well as to hold them up as examples to future generations. Today I would also like to acknowledge the hard work of Les Lang, whose efforts did so much to drive forward the memorial at Toomelah. Courage and service unites all Australians, and the example of Len Waters—and the Aboriginal war memorial at Toomelah and the roll-of-honour plaque—will no doubt be a source of pride and inspiration for many years to come.
