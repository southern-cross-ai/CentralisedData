        Well, ho, ho, ho! Christmas lights are beginning to coruscate in the streets of

        as residents prepare to embrace this upcoming Christmas season. Adding to the joyous Christmas spirit, I was delighted to hold once again my annual Christmas card competition for school students in my electorate, and as always the entries were spectacular. I want to commend the efforts of the teachers, the parents and, most importantly, the students, who created some striking artworks. The future of Australian art is incredibly bright if North Sydney is any judge.

        I want to congratulate Toby Ward, who is in year 5 at Cammeray Public School, for winning this year's competition. Rounding out the top four were Oscar Worthington of St Thomas Primary School; Ava Kebsch from

        . All four entries were remarkable. I found it, in fact, very difficult to choose a winner. I received hundreds of entries from several schools in my electorate, and I'd like to acknowledge and thank the students and teachers from Mowbray Public School, St Michael's, Cammeray Public School, Northbridge Public School,

        To every student who participated in my 2021 Christmas card competition: thank you for your fantastic entries. To all the people in North Sydney and right around Australia: I hope you have a joyous and safe Christmas with your families, who, in many cases, have been apart for far too long.
