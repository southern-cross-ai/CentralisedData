       <p>
        As local football competitions come to the conclusion of their seasons right around the country, I'd like to congratulate all of those involved in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
         AFL
        </a>
        competitions in my electorate in particular: to those who reached their goals and those who will try again next year, to those who succeeded in winning premierships and those who didn't quite make it. It's a valuable thing in Australia that so many people participate in and, indeed, are observers of sport in its various manifestations right throughout this country.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to pay particular tribute to Peter Hookey, who comes to the end of his term as the president of the Warrandyte Football Club, in my electorate. Peter has been a great president of that club. He's seen it grow remarkably over the last few years, and as this season comes to an end, so too does his term as president of the club.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was delighted to be able to join him recently at one of the matches. It was good to see the under-19 teams finish as runners-up in their eastern suburbs competition in Melbourne, and the club will continue to grow and thrive. I look forward in the future to seeing the installation of the new lights, which this government has funded through a $100,000 sports grant to the Warrandyte Football Club. That will enable training to occur on many more occasions in the evening and enable more people to be involvedâ€”particularly female competitors, with numbers growing stronger all the time.
