        I rise today to speak on the unprecedented tragedy of the deadly fires in Athens recently. We all saw images and horrific stories coming out on our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
         TV
        </a>
        screens that laid bare the horrifying destruction that took place in Athens. I happened to be in Athens. It was just within a few hours of arriving when I heard reports of these dreadful fires and the tragedy that was taking place. Upon hearing about the extent of the casualties and injuries, I made contact with our Australian embassy as I heard that we were coordinating assistance from our wonderful country that always assists where there is need. I would like to pay tribute to and congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Bishop" rel="nofollow">
         Julie Bishop
        </a>
        , for her immediate response to assisting with the fire recovery efforts.
       </p>
       <p>
        We did so as Australians, and I was very proud to be an Australian in Athens at the time. Australia provided disaster assistance. The tragic event had claimed 92 lives at that point, with several people remaining missing. Certainly the messages of our foreign affairs minister, our Prime Minister and our Leader of the Opposition,

        , were all gratefully and thankfully received by the Greek people in Greece who were affected by this catastrophic event. We sent 10 members of the disaster assistance response team,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DART" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , from fire and rescue from all over Australia to conduct fire impact assessments. I believe they just returned yesterday. I met with them at the welcoming reception that we had in Greece. They were welcomed with open arms.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greek" rel="nofollow">

        government was so thankful to Australia for sending this assistance. I'd also like to pay tribute to the deputy foreign affairs minister of Greece, a true friend of Australia, Mr Terens-Nikolaos Quick, who conducted the welcoming ceremony.
       </p>
       <p>
        We were very well placed to support Greece in these recovery efforts, drawing on our experience with the bushfires that we have here. The response team supported the crisis by working with the department of foreign affairs at our embassy in Greece. I'd also like to pay tribute to our wonderful ambassador to Greece, Kate Logan, who is doing a marvellous job in Athens representing Australia, and also her second in charge, Andrea Biggi, who's been there for a couple of years now. Both of them were brilliant in coordinating and responding through our foreign affairs ministry and ensuring that assistance was given.
       </p>

        There were some horrendous stories that came out of it while I was there. One that comes to mind is the tragic story of two little twin girls about the age of six who disappeared. Everyone was out looking for them days after the fire, and they were found huddled with their grandmother, perished. There is a story about a particular person who was combating the fires and trying to protect his house. He sent his family away and stayed back but decided to pack everything and go. He tried to open the garage door, which was remote-controlled, but there was no electricity. He finally gouged the door open and was overcome by the flames. There are some horror stories. It was horrendous to see. This was part of Athens; these were suburbs, not bushland. You'd see a row of buildings that were completely burned out. I'd never seen anything like it in my life.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to pay tribute to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Greenwood" rel="nofollow">
         John Greenwood
        </a>
        , our Adelaide burns surgeon, who voluntarily flew to Athens to assist. He is the surgeon who developed the synthetic skin products and assisted many burns victims. Currently, the Adelaide Greek community is fundraising to assist him with equipment et cetera to do more good work. I was absolutely proud to be an Australian in Athens during this time. It's a real tribute to us as a nation when we offer assistance overseas to countries that are going through devastating times, such as the fire in Athens. Mr Greenwood, the surgeon who I was talking about, upon hearing this tragedy, made the decision to offer his support and help to the burns victims free of cost. At his own cost, he flew over there. He's an absolutely marvellous person. He was also the person who treated the first victims from the Bali bombings in Darwin after that dreadful terrorist bombing. His experience was invaluable, absolutely crucial, in assisting over there.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my home state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        , the community across the board has rallied. They've put together fundraisers through the Greek Orthodox Community of South Australia and through the archdiocese. I pay tribute to all of them.
