        , I'm told, by many of my constituents, is the best place to be in the world—particularly during the pandemic. I've said many times in this place that the further away from the big capital cities you get, the stronger is the sense of community.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the most important drivers in making sure that our regions remain strong and resilient is the important work undertaken by local government—local councils—and Braddon's local governments are doing an outstanding job, working hard, day in and day out, for their respective communities. That's something the Morrison government is well aware of. We understand the critical role that councils play in delivering the vital services that each region relies upon.
       </p>
       <p>
        The past year has not been easy. In fact, it's been tough. That's why, during this federal budget, the Morrison government has continued to deliver significant support to assist our region's eight local government councils, from King Island to the West Coast, from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_Head" rel="nofollow">
         Circular Head
        </a>
        to Latrobe, each region's economic recovery has been given a significant boost, thanks to additional funding provided through phase 3 of the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program. This is a funding stream that is directly targeted towards our local government. It provides the opportunity for them to deliver priority projects that they couldn't otherwise afford or undertake. The program has direct benefits to the communities that they serve.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's important to remember that, when government spends money, it's not the government's money that we're spending—it's taxpayers' money, and it needs to be spent wisely. That's why the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program is so powerful and so well received. It's localised and it's targeted. It guarantees that everyone living across the north-west, the West Coast and King Island has a portion of their hard-earned taxes spent back in their local communities. This funding will deliver projects that have been identified as important by local government, in their local communities, for them. It will also make local lives better, safer and more connected. Crucially, it will connect support to local business to create local jobs in our local towns and regions and will use local contractors. That's what this program is all about—local councils can deliver more funding to upgrade local roads and build pathways; to heat community halls; to revamp playgrounds, parks and sporting facilities; and to improve access to public facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The program will also help communities bounce back from the COVID-19 pandemic. Australia-wide, this round of the program is expected to support around 3½ thousand jobs—but what it's doing is providing local jobs. And, in Braddon, that's important.
       </p>
       <p>
        Across the three phases, over $18 million has already been distributed, right across our local councils: Burnie,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        , Circular Head, Devonport, King Island, Latrobe, Waratah Wynyard and the West Coast. Across Tasmania, that figure is almost $74 million, and this funding isn't a commitment that will appear in one or two or three years time; the money has been delivered by the Morrison government. To their credit, councils have been rolling out these projects quickly and efficiently.
       </p>
       <p>
        Here are just a few of the projects that have been identified so far through the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program. At Burnie council, they've installed more exercise stations along the coastal pathway, to provide greater recreational and exercise opportunities. At Central Coast, they've redeveloped Ulverstone's much loved skate park. They haven't had the capacity to do such work since it was built in 1970, but now it will be a modern activity hub, catering for all ages and all abilities. At Circular Head, Back Line Road has been made safer for pedestrians, and walking pathways have been provided. Over at Devonport, Spreyton Memorial Hall is having a heater replaced so that people can meet during winter months. At Latrobe, Tarleton Road is being made safer due to pavement repairs. Waratah Wynyard Council are protecting that endangered species, the Tasmanian devil, by installing virtual fencing to stop the devils crossing the road at Rocky Cape and being struck by vehicles. This system has proven to be extremely effective in preventing wildlife collisions and deaths in many other parts of the nation. The West Coast is upgrading

        in Queenstown to prevent serious accident or injury.
       </p>
       <p>
        Every dollar spent on building a stable and effective local government sector is a dollar well spent, and it's at the heart of the Morrison government's economic plan for a more secure and a more resilient regional Australia.
