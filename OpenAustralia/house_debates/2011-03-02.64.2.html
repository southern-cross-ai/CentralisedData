        My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. The minister would be aware of the extraordinary contribution that the honey bee makes in terms of the honey industry and pollination services to agriculture generally. The minister would also be aware of the incursion into Australia of the Asian bee, which could become the cane toad of the insect world. Minister, the government is currently intending to withdraw funding for the Asian bee eradication program based on tenuous scientific advice. Could you use your good offices to review, delay or cancel this decision in the interests of not only food security but also biodiversity in Australia?

         I thank the member for New England for the question. I acknowledge the significance of the biosecurity issue that he raises—and the chorus of support from some of those opposite, seemingly ignorant of the fact that the Asian bee was found when they were in office and no program to do anything about it was put in place until we came to office. There was no program at all. The Asian bee was found in Queensland in May 2007, when
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_McGauran" rel="nofollow">

         was the minister, and nothing was done.
        </p>
        <p>
         The member for New England also referred to the fact that this is much bigger than the honey industry. The pollination services that are provided by bees go to a whole series of industries and make a massive difference to the productivity of those industries. There are a number of things that need to be put on the table and understood here. First of all, no other country has ever managed to eradicate Asian bees once they have arrived.

         <p>
          The one who did not try was

          </a>
          . He was one of yours, okay? He is the one who did not try. Secondly, since the first detection of Asian honey bees in Queensland in May 2007, the Australian government—since we came to office—has worked closely with the Queensland government, the states and territories and the Honey Bee Industry Council to prevent the establishment and spread of the pest. Thirdly, the Asian Honey Bee National Management Group is an independent science based group which comprises federal, state and territory government officers, representatives of Plant Health Australia and representatives of the Honey Bee Industry Council.
         </p>
         <p>
          In addition, the decision the member for New England referred to was based on a number of scientific factors from the national management group. It was not a decision of government. That decision of the national management group was based on scientific factors, including the breeding rate of the bees, their tendency to swarm and their ability to cover extraordinarily long distances when they swarm, which has created significant difficulties in locating all of the nests and destroying them. The decision that that management group has made reflects the scientific assessment of the feasibility of eradication but does not amount to a decision that there will not be continued engagement in other areas other than eradication in terms of control.
         </p>
         <p>
          As I said, funding prior to us coming to government amounted to zero dollars. Funding decisions since then, through a series of ministerial council decisions, have involved continued extension of the eradication programs. At the November 2010 meeting—the last time the Primary Industries Ministerial Council considered this—they decided to extend funding until 31 March this year. Further funding approval beyond that is a decision yet to be made by the ministerial council, but the decision that the member for New England has raised is a decision of the scientific committee. Obviously, the concerns that he has raised will be passed on directly to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.
