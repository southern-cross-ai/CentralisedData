        My question is to the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction. Will the minister update the House on how the Morrison-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCormack" rel="nofollow">

        government is supporting job creation infrastructure that will secure the affordable and reliable energy that Australians rely on while at the same time lowering reductions?

        <p>
         I thank the member for her question. As a former social worker, she knows how important affordable energy is for the most vulnerable in our community. She also knows we're investing in the technology and the energy infrastructure which will bring down electricity prices and ensure we keep the lights on while we're reducing our emissions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Just recently we launched our
         <i>
          Technology investment roadmap discussion paper
         </i>
         . That focuses on technology, not taxes; reducing the cost of energy, not raising it. It's all about making sure that we have more jobs and more investment as we come out of the COVID crisis. We've also recently announced the first round of the microgrid program. There was a program in the member's electorate: $1.4 million for Tarnagulla and Donald in her electorate for a microgrid, which will reduce the cost of energy in remote communities like in the Mallee, using the very best technology available.
        </p>
        <p>
         This focus on investment in critical infrastructure using the best technology available applies also to our Snowy 2.0 project. There was $1.38 billion invested by the federal government, and the people of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowy_Mountains" rel="nofollow">
          Snowy Mountains
         </a>
         know what benefits this will bring. Those benefits aren't just about bringing down electricity prices and keeping the lights on. They're also about creating jobs in the Snowy Mountains region. We've already seen $35 million of direct expenditure in the Snowy Mountains region as a result of Snowy 2.0. We know there are already 500 people involved in the construction project. By the end of this year, it will be 850. At its peak, 2,000 jobs will be created from Snowy 2.0 in the Snowy region. This will be a jobs boom for the Snowy region.
        </p>
        <p>
         Local businesses are also involvedâ€”100 businesses. James from Allspec &amp; Partners in Tumut is providing surveying services and machinery hire for Snowy 2.0. We know that Monaro Milk &amp; Juice is growing their business on the back of providing food and drinks up to the Snowy worksites. Of course, Matt at The Coffee Pedaler on beautiful Wynyard Street in Tumut is providing coffee, snacks and lunch up at Lobs Hole, one of the main worksites at Snowy 2.0. Our focus is on technology, not taxes; jobs and investment; a stronger economy as we come out of the COVID crisis.
