       <p>
        I rise today to put on the record my congratulations and thanks to the new Speaker’s panel. I want to say thankyou for the kind words that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, spoke on my behalf yesterday. I particularly want to thank the Speaker,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Jenkins" rel="nofollow">
         Harry Jenkins
        </a>
        , for the remarks that he made on my behalf yesterday. It was a pleasure working as Deputy Speaker and I would be dishonest if I said that I was not a little disappointed that I am not continuing in the role. I also want to particularly thank my staff member Lindy Franklyn, who did a phenomenal job in this place—so well that most of you probably had no idea of the work that she was doing. I want to record my thanks and gratitude for Lindy’s dedication to the job, as it was often quite difficult at times to manage people’s diaries and times. I thank Lindy for that.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to make it quite clear that I accept wholeheartedly the decision of the Labor Party to honour both the spirit and the letter of the agreement that we and the opposition signed with the Independents going into this parliament to create a better parliament for the future. Those of us who have had the privilege of sitting in the Speaker’s chair understand the value of parliament and parliamentary reform better than most. So I am more than happy to endorse both the spirit and the letter of the agreement that was signed on behalf of the government and the opposition. I call on all members of the House to honour that agreement and make this chamber a better place for all to work in.
