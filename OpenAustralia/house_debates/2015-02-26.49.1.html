        One of the special things about the electorate of Ryan is that we host the second-largest population of military personnel in Australia. We are always welcoming new members and their families as they adapt to their new location and make new friends. I was delighted to attend the Defence Community Organisation welcome event for these families at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallipoli_Barracks" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        last weekend.
       </p>
       <p>
        There were many community and government organisations present, standing by to welcome and support our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Defence Force
        </a>
        families. The day was hosted by the Defence Community Organisation, a group which offers programs and services to Defence families. They support families with the challenges they may face living the military way of life, but they also provide opportunities.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important we have these groups to make life easier for our Defence Force families as they relocate into new communities. It was a great day and a wonderful opportunity to meet so many members, their partners and their families. I particularly want to thank those support groups in the community and welcome all of our new Defence Force families to Ryan. We have a wonderful and inclusive community and I am sure all the families will enjoy their time in that location.
