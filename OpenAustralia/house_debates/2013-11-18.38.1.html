       <p>
        Yesterday, 17 November, we marked World Prematurity Day. Every year around the world 15 million babies are born too soon and, sadly, one million of these babies do not make it.

       <p>
        I am glad to be able to wear this badge and to show my support for families who have been affected by premature birth. Preterm or premature birth is the second-leading cause of newborn death. However, there is very little awareness of this issue.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to show my support for the international campaign Light it up Purple. As we drove into Canberra last night I was proud to see the iconic Questacon building lit up in purple. Questacon was in good company with the likes of the

        and others around the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        The National Premmie Foundation is an Australian charity. I would like to mention a young lady from my electorate, Bess Gairns, who lives in Mungindi, in north-west
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        . She is the proud mother of young Eddison, who was born prematurely. He is now a healthy young man with a great interest in

        tractors and is clearly going to follow in his father's footsteps and be a cotton farmer. Bess has done some great work with the National Premmie Foundation and I commend her efforts in promoting awareness of the 25,000 deaths every year in Australia from premature birth. There are obvious difficulties in having a premature born child when you live in regional Australia. Bess and her partner, Andrew, certainly know that.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a very serious issue and I am grateful for the opportunity to bring this matter to the House today.
