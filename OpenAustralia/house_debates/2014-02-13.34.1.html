        I rise to honour the life of Des Dans. A dedicated Labor man, Des Keith Dans lived life according to simple principles. He was committed to Labor values and the betterment of his community. He followed his beliefs throughout his life.

       <p>
        During the war, he served in the Navy. Post war he served in the merchant marine. His commitment to workers' rights saw him serve union members in the

        and ultimately serve

        through the state parliament. His abilities were recognised in the series of senior portfolios he held over the years, including being Leader of the Government in the

        , industrial relations minister, water resources minister, tourism minister and racing and gambling minister.
       </p>
       <p>
        Des Dans's service, dedication and commitment have benefitted Western Australia and helped to make it the place it is today. Particular regard needs to be paid to how Des helped transform WA in the 1980s. His ability to get things done resulted in landmark decisions being made. He is well known for being minister responsible for the defence of the

        in 1987, a task which resulted in the transformation of Fremantle into the thriving port city it is today. However, this is only one of the many achievements he oversaw. Other achievements include the establishment of

        , the largest centre of tourism related training west of Melbourne.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 2 January 2014, Des Dans died aged 89. He is survived by his wife of 52 years, Rikki, and children, Jody and Peter. His passing means Western Australia has lost a dedicated servant, our party has lost a valued comrade and his family has lost a loved husband and father. For his dedication to our country, Des Dans deserves the respect we offer with this tribute in our national parliament.
