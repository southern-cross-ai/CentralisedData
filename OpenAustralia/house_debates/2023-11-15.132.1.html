        Today, I would like to address the chamber on the Albanese Labor government's commitment to strengthen and transform our vocational education and training—the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VET" rel="nofollow">
         VET
        </a>
        sector. Particularly, I would like to commend the Minister for Skills and Training, the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_O'Connor" rel="nofollow">

        , for his exceptional work in spearheading the creation of the National Skills Agreement. This five-year landmark initiative represents a monumental step forward in fostering national cooperation in the vocational education and training sector. It builds on the government's employment white paper for an inclusive labour market in which everyone has the opportunity for secure and fairly paid work.

        I did not have the privilege of attending university—just like nearly 80 per cent of those aged 15 years and over in my electorate of Holt. My journey to this esteemed House was shaped by my early years as a shop assistant. I diligently stacked shelves and navigated the bustling aisles of the various Woolies stores across the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. Thanks to the VET sector, I was able to upskill and transition into the world of culinary arts. I earned a Certificate

        in Commercial Cookery from

        and diplomas in hospitality management and patisserie from the William Angliss Institute. This allowed me to pursue a passion for baking and move into bakery departments at Woolworths. Even though this change in position increased my hourly wage by only a few dollars, knowing that I was skilled in a trade gave me a sense of security. My story is like so many more from the community I am proud to represent, and that is why the National Skills Agreement is significant to me on a personal level.
       </p>

        To those in Holt who wish to pursue vocational education to either skill or upskill themselves, the Albanese Labor government has your back. Under the leadership of the Albanese government, a groundbreaking $12.6 billion investment is set to revolutionise access to TAFE, enhancing training quality and addressing crucial skills needs. This commitment, combined with contributions from the states and territories, surpasses the unprecedented $30 billion investment over the next five years. The federal government's commitment includes an additional $2.4 billion in flexible funding designed to support state and territory skills sectors. This flexible funding aims to address crucial and emerging industry needs in Victoria, such as clean energy, sovereign capability, care services and digital capability.
       </p>
       <p>
        To complement this investment, up to $1.3 billion of Commonwealth funding will be available to implement key reforms, reflecting our commitment to achieving the objectives outlined in the National Skills Agreement. These reforms include a $325 million investment in establishing nationally networked TAFE centres of excellence. These centres will foster partnerships between TAFEs, universities, jobs and skills councils, and industry to ensure a collaborative approach to skills development. Moreover, a $100 million allocation will support the growth and retention of the high-quality vocational workforce, recognising the pivotal role educators play in shaping the future of our workforce. An additional $250 million will be focused on improving VET completions, with a specific emphasis on supporting women and those from marginalised backgrounds. This significant investment is built upon the foundation of an additional $440 million already committed for the delivery of 300,000 fee-free TAFE places from 2024.
       </p>
       <p>
        This agreement marks a departure from the previous government's approach and highlights the commitment of the Albanese Labor government to work together with states and territories. It reflects our acknowledgment that partnership, cooperation and a long-term agreement are essential to implement much-needed quality and capacity reforms. In conclusion, the National Skills Agreement represents the federal government's commitment to ensuring that no Australian is left behind. As our economy undergoes structural changes, it embodies our dedication to unlocking the full potential of our skilled workforce, driving economic prosperity and building a brighter future for all Australians.
