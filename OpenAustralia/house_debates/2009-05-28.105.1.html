        of Indian Students of Australia say that, of their 33,000 members in Victoria, there have been 60 serious assaults on Indian students in Melbourne. In one recent attack two Indian students were hit on their heads with a bat at Tottenham station. The youths who attacked them taunted them racially. In another incident Sourabh Sharma, an Indian international student, was commuting home on a train after a shift at

        when he was brutally bashed and robbed by six people. As the 21-year-old lay on the floor being kicked in the head and body, his attackers screamed racial insults. This is the latest in what police sources call an epidemic of attacks on Indians at western suburb train stations.

        These attacks are a disgrace to Australia. As a MP from Melbourne I am angry and ashamed that these things are happening in my city, which has always believed in cultural diversity. Part of the ambience of Melbourne is cultural diversity, and this is a direct attack on our pluralist way of life. These attacks are also potentially harmful to our economy and national interest. Education is our largest export industry. Its success depends on our ability to offer international students a safe and welcoming environment. India is a booming democracy and will play an important role in Australia’s trade, security and political future.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased that authorities and people in Melbourne are acting swiftly to stamp out these disgraceful attacks.

        -Indian Western Reference Group was established in January to help shield Indian visitors and residents, particularly students, from an escalation of night-time street crime in the western suburbs. In fact, a team is being sent to India—unfortunately, there is a necessity for doing this—led by

        Understandably, there has been extensive reporting of this thuggish behaviour on the streets of Melbourne. The

        ran one story under the title ‘Now, Indian students facing hell down under’. Kanan Kharbanda, a 28-year-old, lost his sight after one attack. He returned to India for medical treatment. Thankfully, he is back in Australia completing his studies. It makes you cringe to read in the

        The bogans initiating these attacks are undermining the strong relationship between Victorian universities and the international education system. They are undermining Australia’s reputation for pluralism. I am sure all members will support me in condemning these attacks. I urge the Victorian government and the Victoria Police to continue in their efforts to crack down on the idiots responsible for them.
