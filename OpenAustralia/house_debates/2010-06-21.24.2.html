        On indulgence, I would like to make some brief remarks about the plane missing between Cameroon and the Congo on which are aboard six Australian citizens and one permanent Australian resident. I know the House will be both concerned and distressed at the news over the weekend of a plane chartered by

        —a well-known

        </a>
        mineral resources industry player. The plane took off from Cameroon for what was a flight of an hour’s duration and after three or four hours was reported missing. We are, of course, very seriously concerned about the welfare, wellbeing and safety of the six Australian citizens and the one Australian permanent resident on board.
       </p>
       <p>
        Consular officials have been providing every assistance to Sundance Resources and have been providing consular assistance to the families. That is being effected out of Canberra and out of Perth. Our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">

        to Nigeria is currently on the ground in Cameroon liaising directly with the Cameroon authorities and company representatives. The search is being coordinated and directed by Cameroon authorities in close consultation with the company itself. The company has had an interest in the iron ore prospective region near the border area of Cameroon, the Congo and Gabon since about 2006.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is still the early hours of the morning in Cameroon in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa" rel="nofollow">
         West Africa
        </a>
        . At first light this morning the search will resume. It will resume with the assistance of fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. Yesterday’s search provided no conclusive evidence, but the general search area is in the border area between Cameroon and the Congo. The plane made usual procedural contact after 30 minutes of a one-hour flight.
       </p>
       <p>
        A number of the board members of Sundance Resources would be well known to members of this House. This will be a very, very difficult time and a time of great distress for the families, for other management of Sundance Resources and also for employees of the company. I am sure that all of the thoughts, wishes and prayers of the House will be with the family members, the company managers and the employees at this very difficult time. I will keep the House informed, as appropriate, of any developments when the search resumes. I thank the House.

         On indulgence, on behalf of the coalition, I confirm that we join with the government in expressing our deep concerns about the safety of the passengers aboard the charter flight from Cameroon which failed to reach its destination in the Congo yesterday. The Australian miners on board would be well known to a number of members of this House. Indeed,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sundance_Resources" rel="nofollow">

         is a

         based mining company that is emerging as a global iron ore company. The miners on board epitomise the pioneering and entrepreneurial spirit that has made the Australian mining sector so great in this country. I know, as my
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Australian" rel="nofollow">
          West Australian
         </a>
         colleagues will know, that the West Australians on board are indeed very active members in our local community.
        </p>
        <p>
         At this stage we can only hope, and we join with the government in hoping, that tomorrow will bring better news. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of those missing.
