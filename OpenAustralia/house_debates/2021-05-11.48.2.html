       <p>
        Before members leave the House, I'll just update the House about arrangements for this evening and Thursday evening. I ask all members to note the usual arrangements and, importantly, the courtesies that will apply to the Treasurer's budget speech this evening and equally to the Leader of the Opposition's speech in reply on Thursday evening. As with all proceedings of the House, the member with the call is entitled to speak without interruption. In accordance with precedent, should I determine that a member be required to leave the House under standing order 94(a), the member will be advised by written note. I haven't had to do this during my time as Speaker. It's important that those courtesies are maintained. I ask all members to ensure that their guests comply with COVID-safe measures in place in the building. I trust there'll be cooperation from members and their invited guests in the galleries, for whom they are responsible. It should be the aim of all members that both nights proceed smoothly for the benefit of the House and for those watching and listening to procedures.
       </p>
       <p>
        To finish off, for the information of members, almost every year during the budget speech and during the budget-in-reply speech, I get a note alerting me to the time. The clock is there as a guide. This is the one occasion where both the Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition don't have a time limit. We don't want to encourage them to be unlimited, but there is not a 30-minute limit on the speech or on the Leader of the Opposition's reply.
