        I rise to condemn the cowardly sabotage of strawberries and fresh produce that has been occurring in recent weeks. It's disgraceful that someone would intentionally injure people, and that they would intentionally injure children. Many of these strawberries come from farms in my community, from areas like Wamuran and Bulimba. I know these farmers. They're parents, they're employers of local people and they're members of their own communities—and, because of these gutless attacks, they're struggling. They are being forced to dump tonnes and tonnes of quality produce, leaving it to rot. This is costing millions of dollars. Deputy Speaker, I call on you and I call on everyone listening to support our strawberry farmers. Don't give the spineless saboteurs any satisfaction. When it comes to your fruit: 'Cut 'em up, don't cut 'em out'.

        I have been speaking to the Queensland Strawberry Growers Association president, along with the Queensland Labor government minister

        , and we're working together on developing strategies to help them through this tough time. I must also commend the Queensland Labor government for sticking up for our farmers and promising $1 million to help get our primary producers through this tough time. I know that it will make an absolutely huge difference. I want to acknowledge the Morrison government for finally coming to the table and providing some support—about time.
