        AM, from Berwick. She was honoured for her significant service to the community through charitable organisations at a regional, national and international level. Mrs McGill is known for her role with Rotary Inner Wheel, in which she has inspired members to raise an incredible $2.5 million for various community causes. The selfless Berwick resident has also volunteered for more than two decades of her life with the Victorian Cancer Council. She has also had a vital role fundraising for health services, as the founder of the Coin for a Cord Day appeal for national cord blood research.

       <p>
        Some of Mrs McGill's noteworthy roles have included, for Inner Wheel Australia, national cord blood research coordinator, 2001 to 2016; founder, Coin for a Cord Day appeal; president, 2001 to 2002; vice-president, 1990 to 2000; secretary, 1997 to 1998; national committee member, 1999 to 2002; and council member 1990 to 1991; and, for the

She also served as the secretary of the Victorian branch of the Australian Track and Field Coaches Association for an incredible 15 years. In addition to her OAM, Mrs Cater was the recipient of a certificate of appreciation from the Glen Eira City Council in 2008. I congratulate Mrs Cater for all the great work she has done not only in representing the country but in helping young people representing Australia.
