        The Galston Valley railway is one of the great assets of my community. It's popular with families and train lovers from right around Sydney. It boasts a five-inch model railway gauge and a mainline link of about a kilometre. The railway belongs to the Hornsby Model Engineers Co-op, a group that's now 46 years old. Most of the model trains that run on the track are crafted individually, often by the skilled hands of members. The co-op is led by Roger Lainson and Robin Levin, and some of the earliest members of the club, like Bob Farquhar and Allan Head, are still involved today.

        I was fortunate to attend one of the most exciting events on the railway's calendar, the Galston500. Twenty-one teams each had a locomotive and collectively travelled 500 kilometres through the day. That's the equivalent of Sydney to

        . The Galston500 wasn't just a unique and entertaining occasion for families; it was also a great fundraiser for a worthy cause. It was an event created by club treasurer Allie Thackeray and her husband, Evan. The team solicits sponsorship, and this year they look set to raise nearly $12,000 for multiple sclerosis. The money is going to Multiple Sclerosis Research Australia through its
