        A number of schools in Warringah have invited me to hear ideas their students have for climate and environmental innovation. I visited
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mackellar_Girls_Campus" rel="nofollow">
         Mackellar Girls Campus
        </a>
        in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manly_Vale" rel="nofollow">
         Manly Vale
        </a>
        to hear from the year 10 students who have been working on local solutions to global problems. I was most impressed with their presentations and concepts, including basalt sculptures to tackle ocean acidification, tackling microplastics on beaches and water management solutions for flood affected areas. I visited Redlands in Cremorne to hear from students in years 7 and 8 for their Red-X event. The year 7s were challenged to address the future of transport, talking on problems like road congestion, fuel options, safety and the environment. The year 8 students were tasked with developing concepts to tackle threats to our oceans, including pollution, ocean warming and overfishing. What impressed me most were the creativity, passion and can-do attitude as well as the solutions the students came up with. With students as passionate and engaged as these young people were, I'm excited to see where these talents will take them. No doubt we will see some wonderful researchers, marine scientists and social entrepreneurs amongst them. I encourage them to stay curious and continue to follow their passions. They absolutely will solve our problems of tomorrow.
