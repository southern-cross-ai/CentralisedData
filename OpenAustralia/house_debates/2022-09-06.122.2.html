        I'd like to highlight the work of an organisation in my community which is doing something truly extraordinary in Victoria. The organisation is St Kilda Mums. Like the very best organisations, St Kilda Mums started out with one very simple ideaâ€”that is, rehoming the essential items for mums and bubs to help every kid in my community get the very best start in life. From this simple and very organic community organisation has grown something that is truly extraordinary. Every year now, thousands and thousands and thousands of mums and bubs who are going through a really tough time have help. It might be families experiencing extreme poverty, homelessness, family violence, but this organisation takes prams and cots and baby gear from one mum who doesn't need it anymore and gives it to these families in need. The work of this organisation is done with so much love and care. Their warehouse, right in the heart of my electorate, in Clayton, is today something truly amazing to behold. It is an enormous space which is just chock-full of the goods that amazing people around Victoria have donated to this organisation. To every volunteer who helps St Kilda Mums; to the founder of this organisation, Jessie; to everyone who has supported them on their journey, I want to say thank you. By 2030 St Kilda Mums want to support every Victorian child who needs their help, and I, as their local member, am with them 100 per cent of the way.

        I also want to highlight the work of an organisation in my electorate which has been serving our community tirelessly for 50 years, and that is South East Community Links, based in Springvale. This organisation has been supporting thousands and thousands of migrants around the clock since its inception decades ago. The organisation has grown with the community that it supports. It supports L-platers who come from a non-English speaking background to get their licence. It helps by providing emergency relief to people who are struggling. It supports women who are escaping from family violence. It supports many people in my community on immigration matters. It's a huge point of pride for me to have had a very long association with this organisation pre my time in parliament.

        SECL was founded by my mentor,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merle" rel="nofollow">
         Merle
        </a>
        Mitchell. Whenever people ask me who my idol is, I always point to Merle and her husband, Eric. These were two very rare advocates, who sadly have both passed away now. They had their home in Springvale and, when waves and waves of migration came into our local area, Merle and Eric were there to help people. I'm overjoyed that a community program has now been named in Merle's honour. Partnering with local schools, this program helps young people develop practical life skills that they might not otherwise pick up in a classroom. I was really pleased to visit

        recently to launch this program. Having known Merle myself, I know she'd be so proud of what the MERLE program will achieve with these extraordinary young people in Melbourne's south-east.
