       <p>
        Last week I met a remarkable ex-serviceman, Brian, an Afghanistan veteran doing great work in my electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Connor" rel="nofollow">
         O'Connor
        </a>
        and beyond. Brian was discharged from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAS" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        on medical grounds after returning home from active duty. Brian suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and, due to the nature of his illness, could not negotiate the process required to secure vocational retraining, income support or medical care. Like many returned servicemen, he struggled with the transition to civilian life. Tragically, he ended up having a complete breakdown.
       </p>
       <p>
        Brian's loving partner, Karen, endured some rocky times but persevered to secure

        </a>
        eligibility for the care Brian needed to make the journey back to a normal life. As part of his recovery, Brian is now committed to helping those who have fallen through the cracks as he did. Brian receives donations in kind to help fill his 'Help Save Our Veterans' trailer. He drives around Perth and the south-west distributing toiletries, clothing and bedding to the homeless and connecting with veterans living rough. He has opened his home, on a peaceful rural property, to those needing refuge while they find their feet. He and Karen help them access their entitlements and medical care, even driving them to specialist appointments in Perth. Together, they are working hard to expand their facilities to provide accommodation and support services for veterans, their partners and families while they rebuild their relationships and their lives. I commend Brian and Karen for their dedication to troubled Australian veterans and I commit to assisting them whenever I can.
