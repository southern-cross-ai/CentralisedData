        I would like to acknowledge today a very emotional win for the South Lismore Celtic Football Club, who recently won the Football Far North Coast
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZAC" rel="nofollow">
         ANZAC
        </a>
        Day Cup this year. It was an emotional win for the team, as Cameron Hyde, a much-loved member of the club, passed away just a few days before the game. Cammo, as he was known, was a life member. He was instrumental in reviving the club and, indeed, coached the premier team to a victory in 2019. This was the first time the Souths had been in the grand final since 1993. A minute's silence was observed prior to the ANZAC Day Cup match, and his wife, Tara; and parents, Rod and Christine, presented the team with their winning medallions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cammo was also a much-loved member of the St John's College Woodlawn community. He was a teacher who had a passion for connecting with students and helping them achieve their best.
       </p>
       <p>
        I extend my and, indeed, the community's thoughts to his wife, Tara; daughter, Lennie; parents, Rod and Christine; and his siblings, Karina and Brenton, and their families. May he rest in peace.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge the Anzac cup team: the team captain, Bodhi Estreich; Luke Condon; Trevor Vail; Connor Whitehall; Josh Parfitt;

        I would like to recognise Phoenix Talbot from Yamba and Sage Lewis from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Sandy Beach

        , who recently competed at the Billabong Oz Grom Cup at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffs_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
         Coffs Harbour
        </a>
        , a national competition with entrants from all over the country. Phoenix won the eight-and-under mixed division, which made him the youngest champion at the competition. He scored a heat total of 10.6, which is obviously a great score. His parents, Hayley and Michael, and brother, Archie, are naturally very proud of his efforts. His mum, Hayley, who was recently named the Clarence Valley Citizen of the Year, missed one of Phoenix's qualifiers as she was the guest speaker at my school leaders event in Grafton, where she spoke to the leaders about her solo kayak down the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_River" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . It was a very inspirational talk. Phoenix also won the Woolworths Surfer Groms Comp back in September 2020. He is certainly a young surfer with a big future ahead of him. Sage Lewis from Sandy Beach competed, and he came second to Phoenix in the under-eight mixed category. Congratulations to them both.
