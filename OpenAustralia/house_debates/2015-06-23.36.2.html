        My question is to the Prime Minister. Did the Prime Minister's own department circulate a Federation green paper that provides an option that would see the Australian government cut every single dollar of funding to public hospitals?

         My department did indeed circulate a draft green paper, a draft discussion paper, to officials in the premiers departments of the various states. As members on both sides of this House would know, the government, when in opposition, promised a white paper on reform of the Federation. We said that it was very important that we try to ensure that our Commonwealth is operating as efficiently and as effectively as possible. In particular, we thought it was very important that we try to ensure that our schools and our hospitals are delivering the best possible services. So what we are doing is entirely honouring the pre-election commitment that we made. There have been many months of discussions already between officials in my department and in other Commonwealth departments and officials of the premiers departments of the several states. This is officials talking to officials about what they think are interesting ideas for the future of our Commonwealth.

           We should be capable of having a sensible discussion about our Federation, with the objective of trying to ensure that our schools and our hospitals are operating under the best possible circumstances. As part of this discussion, lots of things will be raised. Lots of things will be chewed over. Many things will be considered and rejected. What is important is what ultimately emerges from this process. I think the Australian people are more than mature enough to have a process of debate, and I think they are quite capable of understanding—

             that what matters is what actually is concluded from this process, not what goes into this process. The only people who, it seems, are insufficiently mature to handle this process—judging by the catcalls today—are members opposite. Luckily not all Labor members of parliament have so taken leave of their senses, and I would certainly refer members opposite to the very sensible statements made by the Labor Premier of
