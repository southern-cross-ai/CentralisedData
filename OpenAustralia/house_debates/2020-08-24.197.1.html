        In the very difficult circumstances of COVID-19, the decision of this Liberal government to join forces with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clive_Palmer" rel="nofollow">
         Clive Palmer
        </a>
        to seek to force open WA's hard border will never be forgotten by me nor the people of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        . Clive Palmer is a liar, a hypocrite, a narcissist, an egomaniac, and a threat to our democracy. He is a shifty businessman, who lists litigation as a hobby. This is a man facing charges for fraud and the dishonest use of his position as a company director, having been accused by ASIC of illegally funnelling millions into his 2013 election campaignâ€”charges that carry a five-year prison term.
       </p>
       <p>
        Clive Palmer is the man who refused to pay workers at Queensland Nickel their entitlements after it went into liquidation, while boastfully throwing around millions on his crazy, vanity projects. Clive Palmer recently dismissed the coronavirus as a media beat-up. This is a man seeking to bankrupt the WA government with a $30 billion damages claim, which equates to $12,000 for every man, woman and child in WA. Let's not forget the $60 million that Palmer threw at the last election in support of the Liberals. Against the health advice of the WA government, and against the interests of the WA people and the hard work of the McGowan Labor government, this Liberal government have provided evidence in support of Clive Palmer. They've said that they've withdrawn from the case, but the evidence is on the record. This will never be forgotten.
