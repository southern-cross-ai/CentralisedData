        My question is directed to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Will the minister please update the House on the domestic and international response to the policy determination regarding the importation of bananas from the Philippines?

         I thank the member for Page and acknowledge her strong engagement with the farmers in her electorate, including the banana growers in Page. On 3 March the Director of Quarantine issued a new determination on the importation of bananas from the Philippines. This determination had been reviewed by the Eminent Scientists Group and the independent Import Risk Analysis Appeals Panel. The strict rules involve registration of low-risk plantations, disinfection and fungicide spraying and audit and verification by Australian inspectors, the cost of which will be paid for by the Philippines. I note the strong representations made by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Premier" rel="nofollow">
          Queensland Premier
         </a>
         ,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Bligh" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         , on behalf of growers, both to me and directly to the Prime Minister as well.
        </p>
        <p>
         Honourable members should be aware of the furious response that this has received from the Philippines. Filipino growers have been extraordinarily angry at this decision, on the basis that they believe these rules will actually prevent Filipino bananas from being able to enter Australia. I quote from the
         <i>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manila_Standard" rel="nofollow">

         , where the head of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Plant_Industry" rel="nofollow">
          Bureau of Plant Industry
         </a>
         made the comment that these restrictions were ‘very stringent, expensive and trade restrictive’. In the same way, the agricultural undersecretary has made the comment that ‘if the conditions are that strict, no industry can profit through exports’.
        </p>
        <p>
         But it has not only been the international reaction. There was also the reaction that appeared in the

         yesterday, where the Leader of the Nationals, on a visit to

         I’m staggered the Government has decided to import … I always held the view that the bananas would never be allowed into the country.
        </p>
        <p>
         The reason that was so surprising was that it was not the first time he has gone to Coffs Harbour to make a comment on bananas. On 3 July 2000, the Leader of the Nationals—

          And they say, ‘Why nine years ago?’ I will tell you why—because nine years ago he, as Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, initiated the import risk assessment on bananas for importation from the Philippines. He released the media release from
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffs_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
           Coffs Harbour
          </a>
          —the same place—where he said:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          As is the usual practice, the banana
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRA" rel="nofollow">
           IRA
          </a>
          will be conducted … allowing a careful scientific assessment of the quarantine risks as well as opportunities for widespread consultation with all stakeholders.
         </p>
         <p>
          But that was not enough. Two years later, as minister for agriculture, he again made the comment:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Neither threats of trade retaliation by the Philippines or publicity campaigns by the Australian industry will be taken into account in the decision.
         </p>
         <p>
          What is more,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosecurity_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Biosecurity Australia
          </a>
          , as an entity, was instituted and the legislation went through while he was the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. I table the media releases. As far as the process which has led to this is concerned, the Leader of the National Party designed it, initiated it and defended it. And yet today he is wandering around saying, ‘Oh, I wonder how this happened.’ Only in the National Party would you find a leader who actually wants you to believe that he was asleep at the wheel, because at least that is less embarrassing than the truth. Current indications are that no Filipino bananas are likely to come into Australia, but, if any were to come here, they may as well carry the label ‘Grown in the Philippines, brought to you by the Queensland National Party’.
