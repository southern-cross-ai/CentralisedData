       <p>
        I will read a statement prepared by the Lucas family:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Lucas family have long been travellers. As parents we set an example of travel and exploration which we knew would educate our children and broaden their minds in ways nothing else would. Dean chose travel and a passion for surfing as his mission in life. He visited 67 countries, surfed in most of them even in Iceland. His younger sisters Kim and Michelle also hit the road with different aims and paths to adventure and knowledge. As a family we were able to meet up at different times and places to have valuable time together and share some amazing stories.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Dean aged 33 began his independent travels as a 17 year old heading to Indonesia with Adam Coleman who he had met at Mandurah High School, keen surfing mates.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        They, along with other mates, enjoyed several Indonesian trips and road journeys before heading on their separate paths.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Many countries, friends and working experiences filled the next 10 years as Dean traversed the globe, influenced by different cultures and people, and in turn he left a path of influence and inspiration. (Many tributes have flowed in from around the world as testimony to 'Dean the quiet gentleman who showed them a different way to live')
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Dean met Josie Cox in India in August 2012 and a bond was formed between two committed travellers. In November 2012 Dean met Josie again in Mexico and their relationship was sealed. While in Nicaragua, they met Adam and the link was formed to a construction job with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GS" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Holdings in Edmonton Canada. After 2 years working summers for the same construction company Adam and Dean planned a road trip to Mexico as neither had surfed the isolated
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baja_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
         Baja Peninsula
        </a>
        , despite being frequent visitors to the country. Dean and Adam were fluent Spanish speakers. This was to be their first trip together in over 10 years.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        After an amazing Baja experience they caught a ferry to the mainland where they were only a day away from Adam being re-united with Andrea, his Mexican girlfriend, and Dean only days away from flying to London to be with Josie.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        They never made it. While travelling on a toll road they were killed in what appears to be a robbery gone wrong. Unfortunately their fate was not determined and information was relayed to their families and friends nearly a week later.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mexican authorities quickly arrested 3 suspects and are pursuing 2 others.
       </p>

        and Sayulita Mexico and continues to this day.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We are privileged as Australians to have these amazing people working for us.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Families, partners and friends of Dean and Adam met in Mexico and began the wait for answers and confirmation through forensic identification of the men.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Mexican People, led by the surfing community's Janet Blazer in Mazatlan and Kalle Carranza in Sayulita, stepped in to make our time in Mexico as pleasant as possible under the tragic circumstances.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Free accommodation was arranged courtesy of some beautiful people. Our thanks go to Cheri, Patrick, Jensen and Wheeler Hasburgh, Storm and Courtney Richardson and the Felice family.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These friends kept us busy including us in surfing, football, dancing and some great dinners and fond celebrations of life and love.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Surfing community memorial paddle-outs were supported around the world from Golden Bay to Mexico, from Mazatlan to Sayulita to Cancun. We felt privileged to be a special part of the paddle-out at Sayulita where over 50 people paid tribute to Adam and Dean.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Their overwhelming sentiment to us was of apology and sadness that this had happened in their country.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We thank the Mexican people for their compassion and generosity. We feel for the Mexican people and the difficulties they face in an otherwise beautiful country.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In happier times we will return to explore beautiful Mexico, a wonderful country. We will eat amazing food, surf incredible waves and most of all thank some special friends for helping us through a very difficult time.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We want to thank the extended group of family, friends and strangers who have made this whole journey as easy as possible. From
