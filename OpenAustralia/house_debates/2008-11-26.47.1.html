         meeting has been well received by local government, including by ALGA, Council of Capital City Lord Mayors, Local Government Managers Association and local mayors around the nation, who came to Canberra for what was an extremely successful dawn of a new partnership between the Commonwealth and local government. Regional mayors welcomed the event. Sandra

         The opposition did what it usually does: it came out and welcomed the event and the funding, and then it went to work undermining it; then it went to work walking both sides of the street.
        </p>
        <p>
         Perhaps the best example of that was the member for Cook, one of their shadow ministers for local government—they have two—saying that the community of Wollongong, because they are under administration, should not have received any local government funding. He argued that the ratepayers of Wollongong should be punished for the actions of some rogue councillors from Wollongong. The good people of Wollongong did not react kindly to that. The paper ran an article headed ‘Shadow minister for silly statements’ and the subheading said:

           Some objections to the administration of the Wollongong council have been raised in interjections from those opposite. It pays to have a sense of history and a bit of memory going back more than a day; more than 24 hours. The night before the

             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
              Local Government
             </a>

              Jim Lloyd
             </a>
             , issued a press release on 23 July 2007. The award from the Howard government for asset management for foreshore development went to Wollongong council. So it pays to have a bit of memory. But the member for Cook did not remember that and nor did the Deputy Leader of the Opposition when they opposed the good people of Wollongong receiving any funding for local capital works.
            </p>
            <p>
             It gets even worse, because you do not have to go back a year; you can go back a month. There is another council in
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
              New South Wales
             </a>
             that is under administration: the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Macquarie" rel="nofollow">
              Port Macquarie
             </a>
             Shire Council. We know about Port Macquarie because there has been a bit of focus on it. We had a by-election just a month ago which returned an outstanding representative in
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Oakeshott" rel="nofollow">
              Rob Oakeshott
             </a>
             to this parliament. They did not object to Port Macquarie council getting funding of over a million dollars as part of the $300 million Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program. I wonder why? I wonder why they are having a go at Wollongong even though last year it was the award-winning council from throughout the nation but for Port Macquarie they are hands off? How inconsistent are they? I thought back. I visited the electorate of Lyne during that by-election and I remember that the mayor who was dismissed for corruption,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Drew" rel="nofollow">

They are very quick to go out there and say that the people of Wollongong should not receive any funding on that basis, which is what the member did.

                       Mr Speaker, on a point of order, I heard what you said to the member for Mackellar, but under standing order 91:
                      </p>
                      <p class="italic">
                       A Member’s conduct shall be considered disorderly if the Member has …

                      </p>
                      <p>
                       To accuse someone of corruption when there is no substantive case against them is surely objectionable to the Speaker and I would ask you to ask the minister to withdraw it.
