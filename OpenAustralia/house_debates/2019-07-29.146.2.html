       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) acknowledges that ADF cadets, in cooperation with the community, benefit the nation by developing an individual's capacity to contribute to society.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I rise to speak in support of our very significant and historical Australian Defence Force cadet movement, which goes a long way to developing youth in our communities. I want to pay tribute to the cadet leaders and staff, and the parents particularly, who give up their time to mentor and shape the character of the next generation of Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to acknowledge the role that the ADF cadet movement, in cooperation with the wider Australian community and volunteer movement, play in benefitting the nation by building character, resilience and the skills required so that the cadets can make a valuable contribution to society when they grow to full adulthood.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was once a cadet myself. I didn't enjoy it all the time. But certainly as I look back on my own past, I acknowledge the significance that it played in my own formation as a person and the character that it built in me.
       </p>
       <p>
        I particularly want to acknowledge in this parliament my local cadet units: the 504th Army cadet unit Mandurah, the 52nd Army cadet unit Armadale, the Australian Airforce cadets unit 707 squadron and, never to be forgotten, the naval cadets—they are the senior service—Training Ship Mandurah. I see all those cadet units regularly throughout the year; whether it be at Anzac Day services, where they perform the role of honour guard; or at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Remembrance Day
        </a>
        , where they do the same; and then out on the streets where they have been raising money for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Red Cross
        </a>
        , for example, or just lending a hand across the community. I have come to know quite a few of the cadets. I admire what they do.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am also very proud to say that it's been an opportunity for me to encourage some of them to pursue careers in the Australian Defence Force. We've had several young cadets join the Navy, some have gone to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force_Academy" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force Academy
        </a>
        , and are studying not far from this House right now, and others have enlisted. The cadets have been a really good pathway for young Australians in my electorate to take on a career in the Australian Defence Force.
       </p>
       <p>
        Importantly, the Australian cadet movement encourages volunteerism. I think this is something that on both sides of the House we can agree needs greater work in Australia at the moment. We talk a lot about the increasing selfishness of people. I think we like to beat up on the younger generation, but to see all those young Australians serving their community and serving their country in uniform as cadets is very heartening indeed. It encourages and grows a love of country. This is really important. We are all Australians. The cadet movement is one organisation, which, across all six states and territories, unites us all in the service of our flag, our history and the traditions that have been passed down through the Australian Defence Force.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are approximately 26,000 cadets currently enrolled across the three service cadet programs. There are 3,200 officers and instructors of cadets and approved helpers who supervise and support the young Australians engaged in these programs. There are actually 508 ADF cadets units in all states and territories.
       </p>
       <p>
        Very quickly, I want to talk a little bit about my own experience. I learnt self-discipline through the cadet program. Every Anzac Day I was required to perform the role of an honour guard at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyde_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Hyde Park
        </a>
        in Sydney, at the Anzac remembrance hall. We used to take pride in being able to stand still the longest. Sometimes a few of us would fall over and faint but, nonetheless, we'd earn kudos by standing as still as we possibly could. I always liked to pride myself in doing that. I was a fairly fidgety kid—I wasn't a great student—but, hey, I could stand still for a long period of time! To do that on Anzac Day, where we honoured our veterans, was very, very important.
       </p>
       <p>
        I learnt failure. I did a course up in Singleton called the adventure training award. I thought I would be a walk in but I actually failed. It was a week of navigation and of small team leadership. I failed and I was absolutely shattered but it built in me resilience. I never forgot that you need to prepare for these sorts of things if you want to pass them successfully.
       </p>
       <p>
        And, finally, I overcame fear. I remember abseiling off the cliffs out near the heads. I was very scared, but I managed to get down there—there's great exposure over near The Gap. I credit the cadet movement for a lot of my development. Thank you.
