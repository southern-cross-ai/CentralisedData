        Mr Speaker, with your indulgence, I would like to recognise in the gallery tonight Mr Russ Chaney and Mr Alan Inlow, from the United States, and Michael Kefford, from Victoria, who have supported me in the World’s Greatest Shave.

        Sadly, Leukaemia is the No. 1 childhood cancer. Twenty years ago, children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia had a 30 per cent chance of survival. Now 80 per cent of children are likely to survive, thanks to the

        </a>
        and their commitment to the cause. However, in spite of their terrific effort, the incidence of lymphoma has doubled in the past 20 years for no known reason.
       </p>
       <p>
        As many will know, the Leukaemia Foundation’s World’s Greatest Shave was held just over a week ago.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        ’s Greatest Shave is an initiative of the Leukaemia Foundation and is now one of the nation’s largest fundraising events, involving well over 100,000 Australians shaving or colouring their hair. As you can see, I participated in that. Participants ask friends, family or colleagues to take part or to sponsor them, which is how I came to be part of this very worthwhile national event.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year the Leukaemia Foundation contacted the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scout_Association" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        to see if it would take part in the event. Mr

        , the District Commissioner for Kalamunda, who has over 40 years involvement with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        n branch of the Scout Association, took up the challenge and ensured that scout groups in his area did as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jim visited my office in Forrestfield to see if I would be happy to attend the 1st Forrestfield Scout Group’s fundraising day in support of the World’s Greatest Shave at the Forrestfield Marketplace and Forum in my electorate of Hasluck. Alison Lockwood is the group leader of the 1st Forrestfield Scout Group. She has three daughters who have all previously taken part in the World’s Greatest Shave and she provided fantastic support for the day. Jim decided to take the very big step of having his head shaved for charity—a brave move, as Jim has a full head of thick hair. His wife, Anne, had never seen him bald, so there was a risk involved. It was a risk that he was willing to take to ensure that he was doing something to highlight the need for the community to support and assist the Leukaemia Foundation with much needed funds.

        s are diagnosed with a form of leukaemia every week. In Western Australia, the Leukaemia Foundation started back in 1993 with a group of volunteers. Today it has a staff of 13 and many volunteers. The services they provide include information and resources, education and support programs, transportation to and from treatment, home away from home accommodation in Perth close to major metropolitan hospitals, and practical assistance and emotional support. Volunteers assist with many aspects of the foundation, including administration tasks in support of the World’s Greatest Shave, cleaning of the accommodation and providing patient transfer.
       </p>
       <p>
        The patient transfer service is invaluable to people undergoing treatment as they cannot jump on a bus or use public transport due to the high risk of infection. A large proportion of patients come from regional areas, and once they are diagnosed there is very little time to make arrangements for the rest of the family. It is usually straight on a plane to Perth for treatment, with the family car being left to assist the remaining family members. During 2005-06, the Leukaemia Foundation provided 1,400 trips, used $8,000 in fuel and clocked up over 50,000 kilometres.
       </p>
       <p>
        This task has been made a lot easier this year through a valuable corporate partnership with the Bridgestone franchises in WA and their kind donation of two fully serviced Commodores. The foundation is currently on the lookout for another corporate sponsor who would be interested in sponsoring an education and support program such as Living with Grief. Living with Grief is a six-week program to assist those who have recently suffered bereavement. There is support for the patient in treatment; however, there is a great need for support for families who have been recently bereaved. All of these services are provided free of charge by the foundation. The Leukaemia Foundation is the only national not-for-profit organisation dedicated to the care and cure of patients and families living with leukaemias, lymphomas, myeloma and related blood disorders. Thank you to all those who took part in the World’s Greatest Shave either through sponsoring or by having your head shaved.
