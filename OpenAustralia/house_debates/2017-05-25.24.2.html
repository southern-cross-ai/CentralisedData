       <p>
        Just before Easter this year, I received an email from concerned grade 3 students from Wilmott Park Primary School, in my electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McEwen" rel="nofollow">
         McEwen
        </a>
        . Amalia, Kiana, Montana and Phoenix told me that they had found rubbish, bottles, plastic and a pram in Malcolm Creek in Craigieburn and they were very disappointed about the pollution. On behalf of those students, I wrote to the Mayor of Hume City Council, Drew Jessop, to express their concern. I asked the mayor what actions the council was taking to ensure the health of our waterways were protected against dumping and other forms of pollution.
       </p>
       <p>
        The students were thrilled to see that, because of them raising this issue, because of their actions, Malcolm Creek was cleaned by the council and the council is committed to ensuring the creek is maintained going forward. It is fantastic to see these bright young kids taking an interest in our local environment and actively working to stop pollution. I am extremely proud to represent such wonderful students in the electorate of McEwen. It is promising to know that our future is in the hands of proactive, bright minds who will continue to be eco-warriors for many years to come.
