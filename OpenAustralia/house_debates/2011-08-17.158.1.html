        I rise to speak in general about education and specifically about the Australian Industry Trade College. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AITC" rel="nofollow">
         AITC
        </a>
        is a college dedicated to preparing year 11 and year 12 students for a career in industry and it is based in my electorate of

        . Their unique modelling differs from conventional schooling allowing students to complete their senior education and gain significant work experience along with various additional qualifications and skills. This gives students the essential foundations necessary to secure an apprenticeship placement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over 530 school based apprenticeships have been achieved by the college in over 50 different trade qualifications and around 95 per cent of students graduate with the Queensland Certificate of Education each year. These numbers are impressive when compared to the conventional schooling senior certificate rate of only 75 per cent. Around 92 per cent of year 12 graduates from the college were employed as apprentices in 2010. At any one time there are around 300 students at the college working towards the same goal of an apprenticeship in their chosen field. The AITC takes on 150 year-11 students each year. Currently there are 300 students enrolled at the AITC. However, at any one time, half of them are off campus completing on-the-job training though their work experience program. The remaining students are on campus completing a four-week block of in-class study.
       </p>
       <p>
        The team of educators at the AITC have been selected for their commitment to the unique program and a flexible learning pathway. Together these academics have developed an innovative and creative curriculum model that complies with the Queensland Studies Authority. The core curriculum at the AITC includes English communication, mathematics A or pre-vocational mathematics, business, information technology and physical wellness, which includes yoga and martial arts. Other fields of study include a certificate III Australian School-based Apprenticeship, delivered off site at a registered training organisation. The AITC also offers the option of additional certificate courses, and all students must engage in community service. The curriculum is delivered in units during the four-week block, and the work component is a separate unit which also contributes points to the Queensland Certificate of Education.
       </p>
       <p>
        The unique learning structure at the AITC gives students the opportunity to graduate not just with a Queensland Certificate of Education but also with significant work experience, a

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology" rel="nofollow">

        , significant networks within the industry of their choice, a first-aid certificate and the completion of up to 30 per cent of a certificate III in their trade qualification.
       </p>
       <p>
        But it is not only the learning structure that is unique at the college. The AITC also has a unique style of teaching and working with students. Each student at the AITC has assigned to them a case manager who provides them with support and advice as they prepare themselves for entry into the workforce. Making the transition out into the real world can be very daunting for young people. Having a mentor on hand makes the transition less stressful for them.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the tasks students are given to increase their confidence in looking for work is to make their own phone calls in class to prospective work-experience employers. This is a very emotional task for these students as rejection becomes a reality that they must face. Young people sometimes do not realise how difficult it can be to get a job, and this exercise empowers them and strengthens their ability and confidence in arranging their own work experience, teaching them a valuable lesson not usually taught in more traditional models. The college has established relationships with over 1,200 employers from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         North Queensland
        </a>
        through to Tasmania to assist the students in finding work once they have completed their qualifications.
       </p>

        The AITC
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        , Mark Hands, and the staff are doing a wonderful job in ensuring young people have access to flexible education and practical experience, particularly for students who would normally leave school before completing years 11 and 12. The flexible model of the AITC works for individuals wanting to pursue a career in industry without missing out on or forgoing the final years of their schooling. I would like to see more educational institutions offering flexible learning options like the AITC to encourage a future skilled workforceâ€”
