       <p>
        I rise in the chamber this afternoon to make the House aware of an event that occurred in my electorate across the break. On 27 August I was pleased to officially launch the School Lawyer Project. It is believed to be the first formalised project in collaboration between the Western Community Legal Services and The Grange P-12 College.
       </p>
       <p>
        Access to justice is so important, and in this community it is now assured, with Vincent Shin appointed as the practising lawyer to work in the school. The program began in June, and he has already assisted students and their families with a variety of legal processes, resolving workplace issues, immigration assistance, problems with Centrelink, issues related to insurance claims, rental tenancy and homelessness issues, and occasionally a police matter. He is also running workshops with students and parents on their legal obligations and their legal rights.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a fabulous program. I would like to congratulate David Smilie and his staff from The Grange College; Denise Nalthorpe, Shona Moore and Renee from the Western Community Legal Centre; the numerous philanthropic groups that are providing the funding; and especially Vince Shin, the first school lawyer in Australia, we believe, for their hard work in pulling this fabulous project together. I also thank the philanthropic organisations that have made this possible.
