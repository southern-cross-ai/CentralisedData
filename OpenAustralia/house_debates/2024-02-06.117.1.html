        ():  Today, I want to share the remarkable story of Chelsea Community Church of Christ in my electorate of Isaacs. On 17 March this year, the Chelsea Community Church of Christ will celebrate its 100th year of serving the community—a significant milestone. Leading the church is Reverend Judi Turnham. We've known each other for 16 years, starting when we first met following my election to the seat of Isaacs in 2007. Over this time, I've witnessed Reverend Judi's leadership and pastoral care change many people's lives through her openhearted embrace of those most in need. The dedication and commitment shown by Reverend Judi's team in serving the community is exceptional.
       </p>
       <p>
        The church works to support our community in many ways, and I'd like to mention a few here. The first is the church's hot breakfast service. While most of us still sleep, volunteers arrive at the church before dawn every Wednesday to prepare a hot breakfast for around 100 people. I'm told that putting food on plates in this way takes an extraordinary amount of time and effort; however, the selflessness of many church volunteers who make it possible know how important it is. The church also offers what they call Your Pantry. The service started in 2015, and it is a lifeline for people who are experiencing financial hardship or struggling to put food on the table. The service operates with the principles of dignity, privacy and confidentiality. People can choose from a selection of groceries in private, without being judged or made to feel less than others. Reverend Judi Turnham and the church are deeply committed to providing a lifeline in the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I recall a story that the Reverend told me about a 55-year-old homeless person who found their way to the steps of the church. He was without hope and, sadly, contemplating ending his life. Without judgement, Reverend Judi and her team placed practical and spiritual pastoral care around him, and continued to provide support for over five years. I'm told he is now helping others in the community, a shining example of the triumph of hope over despair.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Chelsea Community Church of Christ is a shining testament to the power of compassion, unity and community service. Under the remarkable leadership of Reverend Judi Turnham and the team around her, the church has touched many people's lives, offering hope, support and a sense of belonging. Thank you, Reverend Judi and your team, for your work to make our community even better.
