        I move:

       <p class="moved">
        That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Warringah moving immediately:
        <dl>
         <dt>
          (1)
         </dt>
         <dd>
          That this House suspend proceedings forthwith so that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer can defend themselves against the very serious charge of deceiving the Australian people about the introduction of a carbon tax, in particular, that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer address the following questions before the full scrutiny of this House:
          <dl>
           <dt>
            (a)
           </dt>
           <dd>
            how the Prime Minister can claim any semblance of a mandate for her carbon tax when she said, five days before the election “there will be no carbon tax under the government I lead”;
           </dd>
           <dt>
            (b)
           </dt>
           <dd>
            how the Prime Minister can maintain the trust of the Australian people when she said one day before the election that “I rule out a carbon tax”;
           </dd>
           <dt>
            (c)
           </dt>
           <dd>
            how the Treasurer can be trusted with a trillion dollar economy when he said six days before the election that he “rejected this hysterical allegation that somehow we are moving towards a carbon tax … we certainly reject that”;
           </dd>
           <dt>
            (d)
           </dt>
           <dd>
            how the Treasurer can ever be believed again when he said, in relation to a carbon tax, that “we have made our position very clear. We have ruled it out”; and
           </dd>
          </dl>
         </dd>
         <dt>
          (2)
         </dt>
         <dd>
          that the Prime Minister and Treasurer stand before the people of Australia whose trusts they have abused and whose mandate they do not have, to argue why a carbon tax won’t destroy jobs, the economy and our standard of living.
         </dd>
        </dl>
       </p>
       <p>
        The Prime Minister today stood up before her caucus colleagues and said that she was very confident she could win a debate on the carbon tax. If she is so confident, why did she not have the debate before the last election? If she is so confident, why will she not have the debate with the next election? The fact of the matter is that this Prime Minister knows she cannot win any debate on a carbon tax because she knows (a) that it is bad policy and (b) that it is based on a lie.
       </p>
       <p>
        We had the Treasurer stand up in this parliament today boasting—hysterically, almost—about what a courageous decision it was. I will tell you what, Mr Speaker: it would have been courageous to talk about it before the election. That is what courageous governments do: they talk about things before an election, not after an election. The courageous thing for this government to do now would be to seek a mandate for the carbon tax that it ruled out before the election and now has ruled in. If the Prime Minister and the Treasurer were so confident about the case for a carbon tax, why did they go to the last election running on a lie? They say that they want to give business certainty. If the Prime Minister was so keen to give business certainty, why did she sabotage the former Prime Minister’s campaign to have an emissions trading scheme in the last term of parliament? Perhaps it was not the Prime Minister who went in to see
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">
         Kevin Rudd
        </a>
        and sabotaged the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ETS" rel="nofollow">
         ETS
        </a>
        ; perhaps it was a body double? Perhaps it was not the Prime Minister who stood up before the Channel 10 cameras during the election and said, ‘There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.’ Maybe it was a body double.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is the Prime Minister who understands business so well. Oh yes, she knows what business wants. She knows that business demands certainty. The certainty that it is going to get from this government is the certainty of taxes, taxes and yet more taxes. That is the last certainty that the businesses of Australia want—higher taxes. I have a little lesson for the Prime Minister and for the Treasurer. Higher taxes do not generate more investment. Higher taxes do not improve an economy. Business might want certainty, but it does not want the certainty of ever more taxes under a government that it just cannot trust.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let me remind the House of these words that should echo around this chamber every day between now and the next election—these words that will haunt the Prime Minister every day that is left to her in this parliament. She said: ‘There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead. I rule out a carbon tax.’ The truth is—I regret to say it of the person who holds the highest elected office in this country—that she told a lie to win votes and she broke a promise to form a government. It was a breach of faith—

         </small>
         <p>
          In deference I withdraw. I accept your admonition but I am entitled to say, Mr Speaker, that this Prime Minister broke faith with the Australian public. This Prime Minister behaved in a contemptible way by telling a deliberate untruth to the Australian people before the last election.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is very important that we suspend standing orders and we give this Prime Minister a chance to come clean. Why did she say it? Why did she say, ‘There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead’? Did she think a carbon tax was bad in principle? Did she suffer from blind political panic just a few days out from an election? The Prime Minister must have known at that stage of the parliament that the Greens were likely to hold a balance of power in the Senate, so we cannot have any of this subsequent rationalisation, any of this obfuscation: ‘Everything changes after polling day.’ She knew full well that the Greens were likely to have a balance of power in the Senate and she knew full well that the Greens wanted a carbon tax. So why, oh why, did this Prime Minister stand up and say repeatedly, ‘There will be no carbon tax under a government that I lead’?
         </p>
         <p>
          But that is not the only untruth that we heard from the Prime Minister during the election campaign. Remember the climate change citizens’ assembly? Remember the 12 months that the Prime Minister was going to spend building consensus? Well, 12 months have not passed; consensus has not been achieved and yet we now have, in total breach of faith with the Australian people, a carbon tax foisted on the Australian people by this bad, untrustworthy, lying government.
         </p>
         <p>
          Let’s not hear any more from this Prime Minister, ‘I’m following the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
           John Howard
          </a>
          precedent.’ John Howard was a gutsy Prime Minister. John Howard was prepared to tell people before an election what he wanted to do. He would never have said one thing before an election and done something completely different after an election. So let us be absolutely crystal clear about what this government is doing: this government has broken faith with the Australian people. This government is seeking to do what this parliament has no mandate to do. This Prime Minister is asking this parliament to engage in a conspiracy against the Australian people.
         </p>
         <p>
          Only one member of this parliament—the member for Melbourne—had the guts to say to the people before the election, ‘I support a carbon tax.’ Not one single member of this parliament apart from him had the guts to say that. This parliament has no mandate for a carbon tax. For this parliament to seek to impose a carbon tax would be a betrayal of democracy. It would be a betrayal of the Prime Minister’s word. It would be a betrayal of any trust between the people and the government. Any carbon tax that is legislated by this parliament would be the l-i-e lie tax. I would like to think that deep within the heart of even this Prime Minister is the desire not to live a lie. So do not put this tax in; seek a mandate first—

                    I second the motion. On a number of occasions over the last few days we have asked the Prime Minister of this country and the Treasurer of this country to defend their integrity. We have asked them to explain why, immediately before the election on numerous occasions, they deliberately sought a mandate to rule out a carbon tax and yet after the election they want to implement a carbon tax.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    We have asked them to stand up for their courage. They have refused to do so. We have asked them to stand up for their integrity. They have refused to do so. These are the two most important public figures in the land—the Prime Minister and the Treasurer—and they are refusing to protect their personal integrity. Their sole defence is to attack the integrity of others. Their sole defence is to say something about another person, but they do not have the courage to defend themselves. They do not have the courage to defend their words. This means that this couple, who have become the

                      This is why we are inviting the government to join us in suspending standing orders so there can be a debate about their integrity. We are providing a format and a platform for the Prime Minister to show courage, to show personal integrity, to show Australia that she is a person with some conviction. We are inviting the Treasurer to come before the Australian people and show that he does have some semblance of courage. But that courage was not on display when the Prime Minister announced the new tax. This is a Treasurer who has overseen the introduction or increase of 13 new taxes in four years and, for the most spectacular and largest of them all, he was cowering under his desk while the Prime Minister was outside in the parliamentary courtyard explaining to the Australian people why she was breaking a solemn promise. The Treasurer can cower under his desk like a modern-day

                      , but I say to him you cannot come into this place and run away from a debate on your integrity. You cannot come into this place and pretend that somehow everyone else is responsible for your foibles. If you seek to occupy a high office in this land, at some point in time you have to have the courage to look the Australian people in the eye and be honest. You have to have the confidence to explain to the Australian people why you want to introduce new policy.

                     <p>
                      The fact is that today in this place the Treasurer is running away from questions about his integrity and the Prime Minister is running away from questions about her integrity. It leaves the Australian people wondering who is running the shop. You can see the dynamics on their side of the House. Last night on

I say to these people stand up for your integrity and show some courage. Do not give us the hilarious and hysterical laughter; actually give us some leadership. You were elected to lead. Do not cower away from the Australian people.

                         <p>
                          And now we have heard everything in this parliament—a lecture on courage from a man who tweeted and asked people to tell him what he should think on climate change! He is the man for whom the expression ‘no ticker’ was actually generated. He is a man who is hollow, without courage, and does not know what to believe in. He tried to get the leadership of the Liberal Party on the basis that he would say: ‘I don’t know anything, I don’t think anything, I don’t believe in anything. Everybody on the backbench can have a conscience vote.’ He is a man without courage and a man without integrity, because he has said in the past that he stands for a price on carbon and now he is walking away from it.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          There are some days in question time where there is one moment that symbolises and comes to be the fulcrum on which a debate changes, and we have had that moment today. I have been saying to the Australian people that this is a desperate fear campaign built on a foundation of lies from the opposition—and we have had that proved today in just one moment. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition came into the parliament today and put to me the following question:
                         </p>
                         <p class="italic">
                          I refer the Prime Minister to her unequivocal statement on Sunday … that:
                         </p>
                         <p class="italic">
                          Every cent raised from pricing carbon will go to assisting households …
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          What she did in formulating that question was to cut the sentence in half. What I said was that every cent raised from pricing carbon will go to assisting households, to helping businesses transition and to programs to tackle climate change. This was one moment that symbolises a campaign of dishonesty—bringing in a transcript and deliberately cutting it in half to give a false and dishonest impression to the Australian people. That one moment symbolises what this opposition is about: a campaign of dishonesty.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The Leader of the Opposition has been out saying to the Australian people, ‘You’ll pay this dollar figure more, or that dollar figure more for the things that you buy.’ Well, let us just go to a statement from Woolworths—and they’d know a bit about pricing, wouldn’t they! They have said very clearly that they could not forecast the potential price impacts until more details of the scheme were released. Every time the Leader of the Opposition has used a dollar figure, every time he has stood in a shop, every time he has stood next to a car and put petrol in it he has been misleading the Australian people—a campaign of dishonesty, a campaign of fear, a foundation of lies from the Leader of the Opposition.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Let us continue going through the dishonesty, the foundation of lies, that the Liberal Party now relies on. Let us look at the track record of the Leader of the Opposition in dealing with the question of pricing carbon. This will tell you how contentless he is, how he will say anything, how he will do anything on the question of climate change. He has said the following in relation to the Rudd government:
                         </p>
                         <p class="italic">
                          The Rudd government has a mandate to deal with climate change.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          He was in this parliament today denying a mandate. He said about the
                          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_Pollution_Reduction_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
                           Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme
                          </a>
                          :
                         </p>
                         <p class="italic">
                          If the government substantially accepts our amendments then there is no reason why this legislation cannot be passed.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          He said that in the past. He has said in the past:
                         </p>
                         <p class="italic">
                          I also think that if you want to put a price on carbon, why not just do it with a simple tax.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          They are statements made by the Leader of the Opposition, and when the government moves to price carbon, despite him having made those statements, despite him having supported pricing carbon, despite him in fact having directly supported a carbon tax as the best system, he decides that his political interest lies in generating fear. It is a campaign built on dishonesty and a foundation of lies. Should it be a surprise to the Australian community that this man, when faced with choosing between the nation’s interest and his own political interest, would say every time, ‘My own political interest comes first’? He believes in profiting at the nation’s expense. He believes that if he can profit from the nation going to economic ruin, if he can prosper from the economy going downhill, then he will do so.

                                 Who has caught this the best? Who has best summarised this for the Australian people? Is it me as Prime Minister, as someone here who debates in this parliament? Is it someone on the government benches? Is it someone in the media? No, it is not. The person who best caught all of this about the Leader of the Opposition is the member for Wentworth, when he said:

                                 Many Liberals are rightly dismayed that on this vital issue of climate change we are not simply without a policy, without any prospect of having a credible policy but we are now … also without integrity. We have given our opponents the irrefutable, undeniable evidence that we cannot be trusted …
