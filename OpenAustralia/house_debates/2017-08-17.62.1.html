       <p>
        I stand in this place today to express my anger at this government's complete neglect regarding rising electricity prices, particularly in regional, rural and remote areas of Queensland. What a complete and utter joke the latest solution to rising energy prices is, as delivered in this place by an out-of-touch
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM" rel="nofollow">
         PM

        and his out-of-touch government. The Turnbull government's solution is a complete slap in the face for the community of Herbert. What kind of a solution is a pamphlet? In what parallel universe does the PM think that a pamphlet advising consumers they can get a better electricity price from another provider is a real solution, especially when you don't have another power provider?
       </p>
       <p>
        I challenge the PM to come to Townsville with that solution and talk with the pensioners, the small business owners and the families who are struggling to pay their power bills. I challenge you to hand-deliver every constituent in Herbert a pamphlet and see just how overjoyed they are with your new solution. I challenge you to hand your pamphlet to Now Office Furniture, where local owners are having to turn off their air conditioning throughout part of the day because they cannot afford the price of electricity. I say to the PM and this government: how would you cope trying to run a business in the heat and humidity that Townsville experiences? If real solutions had been created, if a real plan had been developed and if real answers for the north had been proposed, I would have rolled out the red carpet for you, but you just haven't delivered.
