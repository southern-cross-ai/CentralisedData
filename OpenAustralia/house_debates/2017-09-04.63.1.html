        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. On behalf of the large Korean-speaking community of Bennelong, will the minister outline to the House the diplomatic efforts to bring the

         I thank the member for Bennelong for his important question. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea" rel="nofollow">
          North Korea
         </a>
         n regime continues to threaten nations in our region and to progress its illegal development of weapons that would enable it to carry out those threats. North Korea continues to directly defy the authority of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations
         </a>
         Security Council, which has repeatedly banned these illegal tests, ballistic missile and nuclear weapons programs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Yesterday, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korean" rel="nofollow">
          North Korean
         </a>
         regime conducted its sixth illegal nuclear test. As the Prime Minister said, it claimed it was a hydrogen or thermonuclear bomb. It claimed it now has the capability to attach such a device to an intercontinental ballistic missile. It was exponentially more powerful than previous tests, which regrettably gives credence to the regime's claims.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are dealing with a pariah state and a cruel and ruthless leader who has no concern for the welfare of the impoverished people of North Korea, no concern for international law and no regard for the peace and security of our region. Australia's response will continue to be firm, measured and calm. We are working with our partners and allies in the region. I am in constant contact with my counterpart foreign ministers and secretaries of state, and with the United Nations, to compel North Korea to reassess its calculation of risk in relation to its behaviour and to deter it from carrying out any further illegal tests.
        </p>
        <p>
         We urge all nations to fully implement the sanctions that were unanimously agreed by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         Security Council on 5 Augustâ€”that includes banning exports of North Korean coal, lead, iron, iron ore and seafood. It includes banning any new work visas for North Korean workers who were working outside of North Korea and sending remittances back to the regime which it was using to fund these illegal programs. It also includes sanctions on North Korea's foreign trading bank, its primary source of foreign exchange.
        </p>
        <p>
         There must be unprecedented pressure brought to bear on North Korea. North Korea must understand it will pay a significant price for its illegal behaviour, and nations are urged to consider additional autonomous sanctions against North Korea as Australia has done.
        </p>
        <p>
         We welcome the very strong stance taken by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
          UN Security Council
         </a>
         , which will meet again this evening. There will be immense consequences for our region, if North Korea's illegal tests are left unchecked, and we will pursue every political, diplomatic and economic option to bring about a peaceful resolution to this crisis.
