       <p>
        This coming Friday I will be welcoming back to Murray the Minister for Aged Care and Minister for Indigenous Health, the Hon Ken Wyatt. Minister Wyatt will be visiting four of our aged-care facilities throughout the electorate, and will be opening the redeveloped Granite Hill Ages Care in Euroa.

        government has provided $11.6 million for this facility out of a total of $15.2 million for the build.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are also going to visit Rumbalara Elders Facility, which is an Indigenous aged-care facility and is one of the very first of its kind—offering not only care for our Indigenous aged cohort but also a career pathway for aged-care facilitators and workers in that industry who also happen to be Indigenous. We are also going to visiting Shepparton Retirement Villages, Tarcoola Residential Aged Care and are driving out to Kyabram to visit Warramunda Villages, who have also received $1½ million for a further stage of their build.
       </p>
       <p>
        A total of 97 residential care places have been allocated over six facilities, with an estimated value of $6.35 million. A strong percentage of beds that have been awarded to these aged-care facilities are for dementia care. We were also pleased to announce that $2.4 million will also be going to the Cobram aged-care facility. I am proud to be part of this coalition government that is delivering on aged care.
