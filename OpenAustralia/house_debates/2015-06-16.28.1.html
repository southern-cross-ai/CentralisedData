       <p>
        I want to acknowledge a remarkable woman in my electorate of Bass who recently received well-deserved recognition for her commitment to her family in the face of challenges that very few of us have to deal with.

       <p>
        Lisa King of Launceston is a teacher and mother of four sons. Tragically, her second son, Noah, was born with a terminal brain condition and was only expected to live for a few years. With the love and care of his parents, Noah made it to his 10th birthday before his body gave out. Three months after Noah passed away, Lisa's husband, Aaron, died of a heart attack at the age of 39. It is hard to image the unbearable hardship of two such devastating blows in such a short time. However, Lisa's courage following these events inspired her community and touched our hearts.

        this year, she was named Barnardos Tasmanian Mother of the Year and was a runner-up in the national award. While continuing to raise her sons, Jalen, Harri and Kobe, Lisa had the strength to support others facing tough times. Her blog,

        , Lisa's friend who nominated her for the Barnardos award, said that despite the tragedies in her life she continues to be upbeat and positive and to think of others. Lisa King is not only the rock of her family but an inspiration to us all.
