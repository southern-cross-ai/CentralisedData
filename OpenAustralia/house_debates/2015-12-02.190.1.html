        With the end of the parliamentary year upon us, I would like to thank the important people in my life. To start with, I would like to thank my wonderful staff for the incredible job they have done this year. Kylie Jackson, my very efficient office manager, keeps the offices in Rockhampton, Sarina and Canberra running like clockwork—the digital guru, particularly for us who are a bit technically challenged. Christopher Lawson, my media adviser, is a whiz at providing interesting stories to the local media—master speechwriter, motivator and expert organiser. Janine Crute, my electorate officer, manages my diary and deals with constituent issues. Constituents love her kind and calm manner when dealing with difficult issues. Rebecca Hitchcock is my part-time electorate officer. Bec is the financial guru, very efficient, with no job too big or too small. Nanet Pagsanjan, our wonderful electorate officer running the Sarina office, does a great job representing me in the northern part of the electorate.

        is the newest member of our team—all that youthful energy in the office, and then after hours running up the Young

       </p>
       <p>
        A big thank you to the LNP members and supporters in Capricornia for your continued support. I would also like to thank my colleagues and the ministers who have supported us in Capricornia this year—in particular my colleagues in the National Party, especially

        running—the security, the clerks, the cleaners, catering and groundsmen.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to thank my family: my parents, Bill and Gloria Martin; my daughters, Jessica Price and Kirstin Daniels; my son-in-law, Tim Price; and my wonderful partner, Cam Schroder. Without the love and support of you all, I could not do this job weeks away from home at a time. You keep the home fires burning. I would also like to mention my brothers, Daniel and

        , and their families, who have been drawn into the political arena as well. Thank you.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last, but not least, to the people of Capricornia: you have given me your trust, and I will not let you down. Everything I do as a parliamentarian is about my electorate of Capricornia. I would like to wish you all a merry Christmas and a safe and prosperous new year.
