         I just remind members that there are still 30 seconds in which they can be ejected under 94(a) before I lock the doors. Lock the doors. The question is that this bill be now read a third time.

           I was; thank you, Mr Speaker, on a point of order. I ask that the member for Barton withdraw the comment she made, directed to the Minister for

            Social Services

           , under standing order 89. It is an offensive reference and she should withdraw it.

            The member for Barker will resume his seat. It was problematic at the time the member for Barker sought to raise this matter; there was such—

            The member for Chifley will just be uncharacteristically quiet for a second, if that is okay. As the chamber was so rowdy, all I heard was the member for Barker clearly responding to something; I could see that, but I did not hear the interjection, and, without the member being present—

           <p>
            Members on my left, I do not need any assistance. Without the member being here, and the moment having passed, I do not propose to take any further action, other than to caution members that, if they make unparliamentary remarks and they are asked to withdraw, they should withdraw. Unparliamentary remarks will certainly be dealt with in the normal way. But, on this occasion, I do not think that there is any further action I can take, other than to disrupt the House—which has probably had enough disruption for the day.
