        We talk often in this House about community, and ultimately our community is about its people. Last year the Casey community lost a tireless volunteer, and I lost a great friend. Bryan
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthy" rel="nofollow">
         McCarthy
        </a>
        passed away from cancer last year. He had two great loves in his life: his family, including his wife, Maria, children Chris and Andrea, and his large extended family; his second love was serving his community. His life of service included decades working at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MFB" rel="nofollow">
         MFB
        </a>
        , the Melbourne Metropolitan Fire Brigade, and serving as a volunteer in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFA" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , including volunteering at the Coldstream CFA and the Wandin Fire Brigade.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to this service, he spent many years as part of the Lilydale Rotary and the Chirnside Park Rotary, serving as president on multiple occasions. He was also the president of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Evelyn" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Evelyn
        </a>
        Sports and Community Hub, playing a leading role in developing the new facilities for the Mount Evelyn Cricket Club, the Mount Evelyn Football Netball Club and many in the wider Mount Evelyn community. It is truly humbling for Bryan's family that the new community centre at this facility will be named the Bryan McCarthy Community Room. That room and that facility will be opening in a few months, and I'm very much looking forward to attending that great community asset that Bryan will have as a legacy; his name will carry on for generations, and people will remember and know the service that he gave to our community. He was also on the advisory committee for the Rivers and Ranges Community Leadership Program, supporting council areas from Mitchell shire, Murrindindi, Nillumbik, Whittlesea, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarra_Ranges" rel="nofollow">
         Yarra Ranges
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Very importantly, in addition to the community work that he did, Bryan was an unwavering support for his wife Maria in her role as mayor and councillor of Yarra Ranges Council, as well as her many community roles across the electorate of Casey, including as part of Yarra Valley Business and the Mount Lilydale Mercy College Old Collegians, and many more organisations. Many people who knew Bryan would also know that it was never 'Bryan' and never 'Maria'; it was always 'Bryan and Maria', and they were connected together through their life after being teenage sweethearts. Many people, including me, send our love to Maria, who we know is a strong woman, but it's never easy to lose someone like that.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was fortunate to meet Bryan when I joined Liberal Party and he was chair of the Evelyn
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEC" rel="nofollow">
         SEC
        </a>
        , our state electorate. As a senior leader at the time, Bryan took me under his wing and provided guidance and support. Really importantly—and something that doesn't always happen in politics—he created opportunities for me and he stepped aside from leadership roles within our local organisation to, honestly, put me into leadership roles that I wasn't ready for. But I guess he saw the potential in me at the time and supported me by putting himself second, and that's something that I think we all know can be a very rare commodity in politics. It's a bit of a cliche, but I can confidently say that I would not be the person I am today without the support, the love and the guidance of both Bryan and Maria McCarthy. I pay tribute to Maria, who I know is watching at home today.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was overwhelmed with gratitude that Bryan made the trip to see my first speech. I can still picture him just up there watching. He shouldn't have travelled. It was a big strain and a huge physical effort for him to make the trip. I am forever grateful. I know he and Maria are forever grateful that they were able to be here on that day because we in this House represent not just ourselves and our families but our friends who support us. I've not had a greater supporter in my time in politics than Bryan McCarthy. The Casey community mourns him. I mourn a great friend. Rest in peace, Bryan McCarthy.
