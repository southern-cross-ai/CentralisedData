        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Does the minister recall the Treasurer’s boast in his budget night address that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We expect to double the number of fishing vessels apprehended in Australia’s northern waters ...
       </p>
       <p>
        Can the minister confirm that last year Coastwatch recorded the sighting of 13,018 suspected illegal fishing vessels in Australian waters? That is an average of 35 illegal fishing vessels a day. Is the minister aware that the

         Australian Fisheries Management Authority
        </a>
        has revealed that this new funding will lead to the apprehension of an average of two illegal fishing vessels each day? Now that we have been told how you will deal with two illegal fishing vessels each day, what will be done about the other 33?

        <p>
         I thank the honourable member for his question and can restate the Treasurer’s announcement on Tuesday night that, as part of the budget, the government has announced funding in the order of $389 million to be provided to deter illegal foreign fishing in our northern waters and ensure the sustainability of our northern fisheries and Australia’s security. And that is on top of the $50 million a year announced some 12 months ago or thereabouts. That will enable us to double the current levels of apprehension and increase our surveillance capability to deal with Indonesia in a number of ways at stopping-off and departure points. So, frankly, the government has addressed this issue full-on.

          My question is also addressed to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Would the minister advise the House as to how this year’s budget benefits farming families and rural communities? Is the minister aware of any alternative proposals?

          <p>
           I thank the honourable member for Maranoa for his question. He well knows how well received the federal government’s budget has been by farmers, rural communities and their representative organisations. The
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Farmers_Federation" rel="nofollow">
            National Farmers Federation
           </a>
           has stated that it is the most positive yet for regional Australians. The Victorian Farmers Federation has described it as the best budget in 11 years for rural Australia—and no wonder, because it is new and increased funding of $700 million for agriculture, fisheries and forestry.
          </p>
          <p>
           A major feature of the budget initiative is to improve retiring farmers’ capacity to access the age pension. This government has announced new treatment of rural land under the pension assets test, which means those of age pension age living on rural properties who have at least a 20-year attachment to the land may have their property excluded from the assets test for age pension and carer payments. This is a remarkable and not yet widely enough understood initiative by the government. This announcement will allow up to 10,000 retired farmers a higher rate of pension or access to the pension for the first time. It will improve their living standards and allow them to remain in their family home on the family property, which has often been in the family for generations.
          </p>
          <p>
           This side of the House understands primary producers, farmers and rural communities—and no wonder. Looking over my shoulder I can see grain growers, cane growers, wool producers, meatworkers, jackaroos, shearers and stock and station agents, but on the Labor Party side—because I am asked about alternative policies—there is but one who has dust on his boots, who comes from a primary production background, namely the dairy industry, and that is the member for Corio. He is the only one. If the Labor Party will not do anything to save its agricultural spokesman, they will not do anything for rural Australia.
