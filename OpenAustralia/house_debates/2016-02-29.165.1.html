        On Friday, the state member for Charlestown and I held an afternoon tea to recognise the high school leaders in our area. It was a very inspiring event. Not only did we present them with a certificate, have a little chat with them and share afternoon tea; we went around the room and each of those students told us why they were school leaders and what they thought the important attributes of being a school leader were. The No. 1 attribute was that they saw being part of a team as being very important. They also saw that leadership was not about telling people what to do but about leading from behind, as I think it was put to us. On top of that, these leaders shared with us the goals that they want to achieve in the year. One of those goals was promoting democracy and inclusion within the schools in which they are leaders. I know that the future of Shortland is in good hands with fine leaders like these.
