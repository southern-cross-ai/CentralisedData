        My question without notice is again to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Is the minister aware that aviation regulations state:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A hand-held metal detector must not be used—
       </p>
       <p>
        I repeat: ‘must not be used’—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        for screening at a security controlled airport from which a screened air service does not operate unless its use is required by:
       </p>
       <dl>
        <dt>
         (a)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         written notice under subsection 44 (3) of the Act; or
        </dd>
        <dt>
         (b)
        </dt>
        <dd>
         a special security direction under section 67 of the Act.
        </dd>
       </dl>
       <p>
        Does the minister think it is a good idea to outlaw the use of security screening equipment, particularly amid significant global aviation security threats? Does the minister agree that, rather than outlaw the use of security screening equipment, it would be better to let airlines actually use it to make travel safe? Or is he going to pretend again that Sir
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wheeler" rel="nofollow">
         John Wheeler
        </a>
        said he should not do that as well?

         Order! The last part of that question was unnecessary. Part of that question was asking for an opinion. Nonetheless, if the minister would like to answer the earlier parts I call the minister.

          This government have arranged for security wands to be available at all of the regional airports carrying regular passenger transport services and we have trained several hundred people to be able to use them in the event of their being required. So when, in fact, there is an upgrade in the security threat from the current low level at a regional airport, at a moment’s notice these people can be brought to an airport and used to undertake the appropriate security arrangements. So, effectively, we respond to the security threat as it is at the time.
         </p>
         <p>
          Again, however, the honourable member for Brisbane has dishonestly misrepresented Sir
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wheeler" rel="nofollow">
           John Wheeler
          </a>
          ’s recommendations. Sir John Wheeler did not recommend that wands be used at every country airport. He did not recommend that baggage be screened or, indeed, that passengers be screened. In fact, he only made one recommendation about regional airports at all. That is recommendation 15, in which he suggested that the

          should offer appropriate and increased security oriented training and guidance and be in communications with airports to survey and help discern their security needs. We have done that. Each of these airports has developed a security plan. We have provided funding to help them with basic security measures—
