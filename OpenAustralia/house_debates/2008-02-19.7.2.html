        My question is directed to the Treasurer. Is the Treasurer aware of comments of the newly-appointed petrol commissioner, who said on Channel 9’s
        <i>
         Today
        </i>
        show: ‘I haven’t promised them significant savings. I think it is a naive notion that petrol is going to dramatically reduce’? Treasurer, will the appointment of the petrol commissioner reduce the price of petrol and, if so, when and by how much?

         I thank the member for his question. I am not aware of the comments of the petrol commissioner, but I tell you what: I am very pleased that he has been appointed. Everybody on this side of the House wants a petrol cop on the beat in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">

         full-time. This side of the House is committed to competitive markets. Competitive markets are very important at a time when prices are on the rise, which is why we made the commitment to the appointment of a petrol commissioner.
        </p>
        <p>
         We had to shame the opposition when they were in government into doing something in this area at all. We eventually forced them to have an inquiry. That was a good thing. The problem was that they did not do anything. But within 10 weeks we have put in place a petrol commissioner. Our objective is to put the pressure on the petrol companies to ensure that motorists do not pay one cent more than they have to, one cent more than is fair. That is the commitment that the Rudd government made to the Australian people.
        </p>
        <p>
         And we have gone further. We have put in place the grocery inquiry, something those opposite could not do in 11 long years, something those opposite could never do.
        </p>
        <p>
         So on this side of the House we are absolutely determined to protect working families. We understand—

          Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. It goes to relevance. The question is by how much does he expect the price of petrol to come down and when. From his answer, is he saying it is 1c?

           Points of order should not stray into disguised supplementaries. The Treasurer will return his response to the question.

            The Rudd government is determined to ensure that consumers get value for money. Those opposite had 11 long years to take action. Did they do anything? They did nothing. You are going to see this government very active in this area of competition policy to ensure that Australians get the best value for money, whether it is at the petrol bowser or in the supermarket.
