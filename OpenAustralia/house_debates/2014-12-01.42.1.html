       <p>
        I rise today, sadly, to draw attention to two terrible and tragic workplace deaths that have occurred recently in the electorate of Adelaide. Just recently we saw 21-year-old Jacob Porter tragically killed while he was working as a landscaper at the new Costco shopping centre development at Kilburn. We know that the loss of someone so young is always deeply shocking and saddening, and I wanted to take the opportunity to send our respects and sympathies to his friends and family.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to pay tribute to 54-year-old Mr Jorge Castillo-Riffo, who died in hospital over recent days as a result of injuries he suffered at the worksite of the new
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Adelaide_Hospital" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Jorge died in hospital on Friday, also taken far too young.
       </p>
       <p>
        Both of these men were killed this year in Adelaide in tragic circumstances whilst they were quite literally building the great city that we love. I know that the whole parliament will join in offering heartfelt condolences to both Jorge's and Jacob's family and friends at this incredibly difficult time.
       </p>
       <p>
        We know that it is the right of Australians at work to be safe. These tragedies are a terrible reminder, for business and for all workers across the country, that no matter how difficult the task, no matter how tight the timeframe and no matter how many times we have done something before, safety should always be the most important consideration.
