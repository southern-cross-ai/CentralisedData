        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to his meeting with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Volcker" rel="nofollow">
         Paul Volcker
        </a>
        in September 2005 and to reports today in which a Volcker inquiry official who participated in that meeting was quoted as saying:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        “Downer’s attitude was, ‘Well, what else were they supposed to do? They really had no option if they—
       </p>
       <p>
        the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWB" rel="nofollow">
         AWB
        </a>
        —
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        want to do business in Iraq”
       </p>
       <p>
        I quote further:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        “When it was suggested to Downer that the Australian government might have advised the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        of its knowledge of breaches in UN sanctions, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Minister" rel="nofollow">
         Foreign Minister
        </a>
        had remained silent.”
       </p>
       <p>
        The report also says that the foreign minister behaved like ‘a pompous ass’. What did the minister actually say in this meeting? Is it not a fact that the minister has simply tried to cover up the government’s gross negligence in allowing AWB to pay $300 million to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein" rel="nofollow">

         In calling the Minister for Foreign Affairs, I would remind the member for Griffith that just because something is a quotation it does not automatically make it acceptable in the parliament. The Minister for Foreign Affairs can ignore that part of the question, but the rest of the question stands.

          There was certainly a phrase in that question which was the pot calling the kettle black. I think the House knows exactly which phrase I am referring to. The government most certainly did not cover up any Australian company breaching sanctions. The simple point is that the Australian government has maintained and supported
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
           United Nations
          </a>
          sanctions. At no time has the Australian government ever made a decision, ever announced a decision or signed a decision to suggest that we would weaken our commitment to United Nations sanctions. The proposition that somehow this government would have been in favour—

             A lot of evidence has been put to the Cole inquiry. Officers from the department that is led by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and by me have been before the Cole commission. In none of that evidence—at none of those hearings—is there any evidence that those officers of my department have been trying to cover up.
