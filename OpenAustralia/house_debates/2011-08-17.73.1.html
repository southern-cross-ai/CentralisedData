        From time to time, members have the melancholy duty of advising the House of a tragic event within their electorate that impacts on the entire community. Today I have such a duty. I advise the House of a tragic accident that has devastated a local family from

        . Karen and Fernando were on a marked pedestrian crossing in central Melbourne when they were hit by a car that is believed to have been running a red light. Sadly, they have both now died as result of their injuries. What compounds this tragedy is that their young children, aged two and five, have now been left without parents, which I am sure we all agree is one of the worst blows which you could experience in your life. It is truly shocking that all in one family could have been destroyed by such a brutal and random accident such as this, and I am sure that all members here will join me in extending our deepest sympathies to both the children and their extended family and friends.

        Mr Marino worked across the road from my electorate office, at the

        at Dapto. I did not know him personally but I knew him from around the community and it is a tragedy that has touched everyone. The community is reaching out. A fund has been established to help the children and a Facebook page has been established to place tributes.
