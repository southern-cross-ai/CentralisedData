        Last week I had the opportunity and the pleasure of attending Doncare's annual community showcase at the Veneto Club in Bulleen, in my electorate. Doncare is the major community welfare agency in Manningham, in the Menzies electorate. It has served for many years the youth, the disabled, the aged and others who are vulnerable in different circumstances throughout the city. It was a pleasure to be there with the chairman of the board, Tony Monley; the director of Doncare, Doreen Stoves; their patron, Rosie Batty; some of the professional staff; and some of the more than 500 volunteers who give their time to this agency. This is a unique agency in that it has a hybrid arrangement of professional staff and many volunteers from the local community who provide their time and effort to help others within the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of their programs at the moment is iMatter, which is a relationship program particularly aimed at young people. Its aim is to help young people to build self-esteem, respect and resilience and to prevent violence and promote healthy relationships by raising awareness and creating change around societal pressures and social attitudes, identifying potential risks to relationships, looking at problems, including abusive behaviours, and understanding the dynamics of what makes a healthy relationship. It was a pleasure to be able to provide some funding, through the Stronger Communities Program, for some iPads which will be part of the training process for this.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank all those who are involved in Doncare. I would particularly like to mention the sponsors—the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bendigo_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         Bendigo Bank
        </a>
        of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doncaster_East" rel="nofollow">
         Doncaster East
        </a>
        and Templestowe, the Silverstone Volvo dealership in Doncaster and the Veneto Club in Bulleen—who have made Doncare their major charitable activity for this year and, in addition to that, the ongoing support of the Manningham City Council, which was represented at the event last week by the deputy mayor, Councillor Dot Haynes and other members of the council. This is a wonderful organisation and deserves the ongoing support of the people in my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the moments remaining to me, can I add my best wishes to the Reverend Peter Rose. I have known Peter for a long time. He has been the chaplain here, as I recall, for about a decade now and will be retiring at the end of this parliament. Peter, can I say on my behalf—and I am sure on behalf of many others you have interacted with over your period of time here—a very profound and sincere thankyou for your presence, for your counsel, for your wise words and for your listening ear on many occasions. Thank you very much, God bless and good luck.
