       <p>
        My question is to the Prime Minister, and it follows from the one I asked him previously. It goes further to the letter from which I quoted, where Mr Stewart, on behalf of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWB" rel="nofollow">
         AWB
        </a>
        , says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        AWB did not use or make payments to a fictitious transport company. As far as AWB knew, the inland transportation component of its
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        approved contracts was legitimate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given that this letter was copied to you, Prime Minister—even though you seem to think you have no knowledge of it—and that the materials in it are so demonstrably false in terms of everything that has been presented to the Cole commission and to Volcker’s own inquiries, is there no other person in the grain business capable of conducting this foray to Iraq effectively other than Mr Stewart, who is so deeply compromised by these things?

         I point out to the Leader of the Opposition that, as of now, as I understand it, there has not been evidence presented which directly contradicts the position taken by Mr Stewart—and he is yet to be given his opportunity. I would have thought that ordinary principles of justice entitle that man to be heard. I thought the Labor Party once stood for ordinary principles of justice. I thought the once-great
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         believed in the Aussie fair go. I thought the idea was that you were innocent until you were proven guilty. But apparently the Labor Party does not believe in that.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am following the evidence that is being presented to the Cole inquiry very closely, but I intend to withhold judgment until that very learned commissioner, widely respected in Australian legal and corporate circles, has brought down his conclusions. I would also remind the Leader of the Opposition that

            Ltd, that the difficult situation in which the company now finds itself is not further aggravated by statements made without any basis in fact. The proper thing to do, the decent thing to do, is the approach that was advocated by a former Labor trade minister before the Senate estimates committee on 23 June 1994—and I refer to the member for Canberra, I think it was; a former trade minister—when he was asked certain questions in relation to an inquiry, believe it or not, into

               Brendan Stewart is the executive chairman of
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWB" rel="nofollow">
                AWB
               </a>
               Ltd. No adverse findings have been made against him by Commissioner Cole. The commission goes on. AWB Ltd is the holder of the wheat pool. If we are to have a satisfactory outcome for the wheat growers of Australia and not some kind of political hit scored by one side or the other in this parliament, if we are really interested in selling wheat to Iraq, we really do need to have the company that owns the wheat involved in some way. It is in fact quite hard to sell wheat that you do not have.
              </p>
              <p>
               Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition could sit down and think about that. Here he is, saying: ‘Get the wheat into Iraq. Find our market. Save our farmers.’ In order to do that, you have to at least deal—at a minimum—on a commercial basis with the holder of the wheat. Doesn’t the Leader of the Opposition understand the way in which AWB Ltd is involved? It has acquired the wheat from the wheat growers. Why doesn’t he talk to the member for Hotham? He would tell him. Why doesn’t he talk to Gavvy over there? He would tell him. They know something about primary industry in Australia. The Leader of the Opposition, in order to try and score a political point, is completely losing track of how all this works.
              </p>
              <p>
               We have an inquiry. Let it get on with its job. In the meantime, let the Deputy Prime Minister lead a delegation to Iraq on behalf of Australian wheat growers.
