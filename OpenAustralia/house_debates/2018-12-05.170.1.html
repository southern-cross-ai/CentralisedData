        All of us are inspired by different things, and one of the things that truly inspires me is seeing young people fulfil their potential—typically with high energy, an enormous amount of courage and a lot of pride in what they do. I say that not just as a dad. I say that as somebody who runs a not-for-profit helping young Australians. I say that as an MP who turns up to speech nights and sees a sea of young people, typically at schools, with enormous promise. And I say that as an everyday bloke who goes to the footy and the cricket and sees young people doing their thing. But there's nothing more gut-wrenching than when a young person loses their life. Only a few weeks ago, through schoolies, an 18-year-old lost his life falling from a balcony.

        But I rise in this Chamber today to talk about Jacob Mabb, a 21-year-old from my part of the world, on the

        , in my electorate. We heard the terrible news only yesterday that Jacob, at just 21, passed away at the

        . He had been flown out of Bali, having incurred dreadful and, as it turned out, terminal brain injuries after a motorcycle accident. LifeFlight was able to evacuate him. As you could imagine, his parents, Steve and Julie, are struck with grief at this loss. On his death, Jacob donated his liver and also his kidneys, and three lives have already been saved. It's times like these that we in this place, who rightly debate public policy, can never forget the importance, simply, of life, particularly that of young ones. Kate Fitzsimons established a foundation, having lost her sister Nicole in a motorcycle accident. As she says very clearly, 'Young people, enjoy your life, but there's nothing more important than keeping safe.' So, safety first! God bless Jacob.
