       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased to present the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 2015, representing part of the government's reforms to strengthen and improve Australia's anti-dumping system.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a government that strongly supports genuine free and fair trade and an open and dynamic market economy. However the importation of dumped and subsidised goods, which injure Australian manufacturers and producers, undermines support for trade by reducing the fairness of the playing field for Australian businesses.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is why we support Australia having an effective trade remedies regime. It represents an integral part of a robust international trading system and we want to ensure that Australian industries are competing on a level playing field. It is also critical to our broader plan to boost the competitiveness of Australian manufacturing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia's current regime for combatting injurious dumping and subsidisation is transparent and complies with our obligations under
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organization" rel="nofollow">
         World Trade Organization
        </a>
        agreements. But there is clearly room to strengthen, and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the systemâ€”and that is what we plan to do.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our reforms included in this bill introduce a number of measures to strengthen Australia's anti-dumping system. The improvements will:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The improvements that I am introducing in this bill today are designed to provide certainty for stakeholders. These reforms will complement the improvements contained in the Customs Amendment (Anti-Dumping Measures) Bill (No.1) 2015.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are committed to ensuring that Australian industry is able to compete on a level playing field. Our reforms will ensure that Australian industries have access to a strong anti-dumping system that delivers efficient and effective remedies for Australian businesses injured by dumping and subsidisation.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the bill to the House.

        Debate adjourned.
