        It is with great sadness that I rise today to speak about a great community servant who is no longer with us. Phil Tolhurst served the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_City_Council" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        for more than 10 years before becoming general manager in 2007. Phil died suddenly and tragically on 18 September at the age of 52. Perhaps we can take some comfort from the fact that Phil died doing what he enjoyed most, and that was watching his son play soccer. Phil was a devoted family man and cherished his wife, Judith, and his twin sons, James and Matthew. He would often be seen cheering his sons on at the sidelines of their soccer or rugby matches. The Liverpool City Council, and the whole community of the south-west of Sydney, were deeply shocked by Phil’s passing. I had the honour of working closely with Phil for a number of years, and I cannot speak highly enough of this man and his commitment to the local community. His sole motivation and purpose were to ensure that the Liverpool area—the region and the community—and its residents thrived. For this reason he quickly earned the respect of his colleagues. When speaking of Phil, most people cannot help but mention his closeness to the staff of the Liverpool City Council. Regardless of whether they were managers of departments or working on the roads, Phil had time for all his employees—not just as a boss but as someone who cared.

        Phil’s dedication to enhancing the lives of others was evident in his personal life as well. Even after his passing, Phil’s generosity to community organisations was evident in the family’s insistence that, in lieu of flowers, donations instead be made to the Woonona

        . The Boys Brigade focuses on the training and development of young boys and men and builds them into balanced people through physical, spiritual, social and educational activities. Phil was a man of great integrity, one who had the interests of the local community at his heart, and a man who showed great warmth and compassion to all. Being from Wollongong, Phil was also a passionate

        fan. It is a great shame that he was not there to see the Dragons lift the premiership trophy earlier this month. But, as someone who believes, I am sure that he was actually watching. To Phil’s friends and family, I offer my deepest sympathies at this very difficult time. On behalf of a very indebted community, I thank Phil for everything that he did. May he rest in peace.
