        On Tuesday of last week the member for Maribyrnong and the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’s Services, the Hon.

        , and I visited parents, teachers and students at Chalmers Road School in Strathfield in my electorate of Lowe. Chalmers Road School is a school for students with an intellectual disability, a school that I am immensely proud to have in the Lowe electorate. Chalmers Road’s motto of ‘Challenging and fostering the individual’ is fully realised by the tireless work of the school’s teachers and volunteer parents.
       </p>
       <p>
        The parliamentary secretary and I were most impressed with the very good work being done to develop the individual personal goals of the children. From our observations, there can be no doubt that this work is underpinned by the practices, philosophies and principles at the school, which are all geared toward fostering a very caring atmosphere. It was truly moving to witness the passion of the teachers, dedication of the parents and enthusiasm of the children.
       </p>
       <p>
        The school principal, Dr Paul Van de Ven, deserves a great deal of credit for the environment fostered at the school. I have spoken with many parents and they all pay tribute to his hard work and aptitude as not only a teacher but also a leader. Rarely does one see such devotion to students. Dr Van de Ven’s job, and the work of his staff, is undoubtedly done out of love, not money, and we must support those that make enormous sacrifices for the most vulnerable members of our community. The parliamentary secretary and the minister have worked hard to ensure that schools like Chalmers Road are well resourced and supported.
       </p>
       <p>
        I note that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day" rel="nofollow">
         International Day
        </a>
        of People with a Disability is fast approaching: 3 December—next week. It is appropriate to record that Chalmers Road School has done an outstanding job promoting the ideals of International Day of People with a Disability 365 days a year. International Day for People with a Disability was established in 1992 by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations General Assembly
        </a>
        to raise awareness of disability issues, as well as focusing on the individual abilities of people with a disability. Every day, teachers at Chalmers Road focus on the strength of each child’s ability. This is essential for self-confidence and development and to combat any remaining stigma about people with a disability. I am proud of Chalmers Road School and so is the local community. I am honoured to stand before the parliament today and acknowledge the efforts of teachers, parents and students at the school, an acknowledgment that is well deserved and a very small token of our appreciation.
