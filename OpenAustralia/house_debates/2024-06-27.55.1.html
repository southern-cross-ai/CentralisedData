       <p>
        I understand that times are tough at the moment for many. But, when I walk around the streets each and every day in my electorate, I know that the cost-of-living relief that is coming in four days will really make a difference in the Hunter.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week I was speaking to Aaron, a customer at Burgerfiend, home of the delicious Cheeky Fiend burger, and he said that the $300 energy rebate will be a massive help for his family, and they might even be able to enjoy a burger or two more often. On the weekend I was having a beer at 4 Pines brewery, and I spoke to Jack, who said that the tax cuts mean that he will be able to enjoy a beer a little more often, and I think Phil the publican was very happy to hear that too. When I was walking down the streets in Muswellbrook on Thursday, Joy told me how much of a difference cheaper medicines are going to make for her and her husband, who are on a pension.
       </p>
       <p>
        Everywhere I go, I speak to people about the cost of living, and they know that what this government is doing will really make a difference in their lives. It's the little things in life that make all the difference. It's about having that extra money in your pocket to be able to take the edge off the bills. It's about having that extra spare change to have a beer with your mates or enjoy a good burger or two. That's what we're delivering to Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm really looking forward, on 1 July, to making sure that the people of the Hunter and all over Australia know how much the Labor government cares about them and cares about their familiesâ€”to give them a better future when we're going through these cost-of-living battles that we're struggling with now. We know they're doing it tough, and that's why we've done this. That's why we're really making a difference and trying to move Australia forward.
