        As much as I love being here in Canberra representing my community, I can't wait to head home. I'm told it's nearly Christmas, which I love but haven't had a lot of time to think about yet. The next few weeks will give me a chance to do some Christmas shopping at some of the many local small businesses across my electorate. Ninety-eight point four per cent of all businesses in Australia are small businesses, and the Hawkesbury and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains" rel="nofollow">
         Blue Mountains
        </a>
        have their fair share, contributing hugely to our local economy. But COVID, floods and bushfires hit many businesses hard, and we're still not seeing all the jobs come back.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor recognised how vital local businesses are during the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GFC" rel="nofollow">
         GFC
        </a>
        , and we injected money into the economy via small cash payments to pensioners and families that went straight back into the high street shops. We knew we needed to encourage people to go local first and give them something extra to spend. Heading to your local shops for your Christmas shopping and celebrations is exactly what is encouraged by the campaign that the Council of Small Business Organisations Australia, COSBOA, is rolling out around the country and in Macquarie. I welcome this extension of the Go Local First campaign, urging people to buy from small businesses in our community, to strengthen the economy and create jobs. I'm already seeing the ads on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">

        and online asking people to go local first and see if that perfect present, perfect peach or perfect plant is available at your local shops. I'll be shopping from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wentworth_Falls" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        to Windsor, maybe even up to Wisemansâ€”and everywhere nearby that doesn't start with a W! Look out for the Go Local First ads and keep an eye out for my posts of where I'm going local first.

        Who can forget the Liberals' promise of 'No cuts to the ABC and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SBS" rel="nofollow">
         SBS
        </a>
        '? Of course it was another falsehood, and they immediately slashed their budgets and have launched repeated attacks on both these institutions.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_ABC" rel="nofollow">
         The ABC
        </a>
        is a provider of essential news, and our community has relied on it through bushfires and floods. I depended on it in 2013 as my suburb was ablaze and I was certainly listening hard when the water was rising in the Hawkesbury recently. The ABC plays a vital role in keeping us a free and democratic nation where misinformation has the capacity to undermine public order, health and safety.
       </p>
       <p>
        The ABC and SBS are trusted sources of news and information. I want people young and old to be entertained by Australian voices and Australian stories online, on TV and on radio. We need certainty that both SBS and the ABC will be there for us, and an Albanese Labor government will provide that with five-year funding terms. We'll also reverse the Prime Minister's cut of $83.7 million to the ABC and review options for delivering greater levels of financial stability for them as a safeguard against political interference. Only Labor will protect the ABC and SBS. (
