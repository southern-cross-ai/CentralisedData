        The potential diagnosis of breast cancer is terrifying at any time of life, but this situation can be a particular shock for younger Australians.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belinda_Lee" rel="nofollow">

        , a resident of my electorate, found myself in this very situation last year, when she needed an ultrasound to rule out breast cancer. Not only is the diagnosis of breast cancer itself a stressful prospect; excess costs that can sometimes be associated with diagnosis and treatment also put pressure on many Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        Facing the possibility of cancer, it would have been understandable for Belinda to take this time for herself. But, instead, she put the needs of others first and set out to raise money for the

         National Breast Cancer Foundation
        </a>
        . To raise this money, Belinda is climbing 50 of the over 100 peaks in and around Canberra. So far, Belinda has reached the top of 45 hills and mountains, and aims to finish her project in March this year when she summits

        . Belinda is a fantastic example of the spirit of generosity and selflessness that encompasses many members of our community in Bean. I look forward to following Belinda's fundraising efforts and wish her all the best for the last of the climbs she has ahead of her.

        On 30 December last year, my electorate of Bean lost a true gentleman. Graeme Rossiter made an outstanding contribution across many fields. He was a long-term Canberran, having studied at the old Dickson high school and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canberra_College_of_Advanced_Education" rel="nofollow">
         Canberra College of Advanced Education
        </a>
        , now known as the University of Canberra. For many years, he worked as a public servant in the federal
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , rising to senior positions. I came to know Graeme well in his capacity as a giant of community tennis in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        . Graeme first joined the Weston Creek Tennis Club back in 1982. He was president or vice president of the club for an extraordinary 25 years of service. With his leadership, his commitment, his passion and his vision, the Weston Creek Tennis Club grew to become one of the most successful and inclusive community clubs in the ACT. I enjoyed getting to know Graeme and found him to be a generous and inclusive community leader. When he stepped down as president in mid-December to focus on his health, he left behind an impressive and continuing legacy. I would like to extend my deepest condolences to Graeme's family; his wife, Maureen; sons, Mark, Andrew, Paul and Scott; and all who mourn the loss of this deeply good man.
