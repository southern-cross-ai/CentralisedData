Isn’t it also a fact that the AWA reduces the availability of overtime and the rate of pay for overtime, scraps shift loadings for morning and afternoon shifts, scraps weekend penalty rates and does not provide for a wage increase during the three-year term of the AWA? Prime Minister, isn’t it a fact that this AWA leaves a full-time employee working two hours of overtime during the week and a Saturday shift—

              Let me say in reply to the member for Perth, firstly, that it is a fact that often questions asked by the opposition are not true. That is a fact. It is a fact that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition made a totally false set of assertions when she asked a question of me about Teys Bros. It is a fact that I am not, for the reasons that any reasonable person would understand, in possession of the employment details of every employment arrangement made in this country. But it is a fact that since this government have been in office we have created 1.8 million more jobs. It is a fact that real wages have risen by 16.8 per cent. It is a fact that that compares with wage rises of about one to two per cent in the 13 years of the previous Labor government. It is a fact that when we reformed the industrial relations laws 10 years ago we were told that they would drive down productivity, they would push up industrial disputes, they would push up unemployment and they would depress productivity. All of those claims were wrong. It is a fact that economic predictions made by the opposition are almost always totally false.

               My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. Would the Deputy Prime Minister outline to the House how the government’s workplace policies have helped exporters and regional businesses remain competitive? How has this increased job opportunities in regional Australia?

                I thank the honourable member for Cowper for his question. The honourable member for Cowper would recognise that one in four jobs in regional Australia relies on exports. He would recognise that, as a result of many of the government’s policies, unemployment is now at its lowest level in 30 years—at a 4.9 per cent average across Australia. In his area of the mid-
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Coast" rel="nofollow">
                 North Coast
                </a>
                of
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
                 New South Wales
                </a>
                , unemployment has fallen considerably. He would also recognise that there has been significant growth in real wages over the life of our government. It has all been a result of good economic management and a reform process that has helped us maintain our competitive and efficient edge both domestically and internationally in the international marketplace. It is important that we recognise the importance of workplace reforms in helping make sure that Australia’s exporting industries maintain their competitive edge across the world.
               </p>
               <p>
                There are a number of examples that have come forward in recent days of domestic Australian businesses, regional businesses as well as export businesses, maintaining that competitive edge because of the reforms that our government has put in place. I will give the member for Cowper some examples. There is a company in
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
                 Central Queensland
                </a>
                called Mobbs and Co., which is a steel manufacturer and supplier to mining and rural industries, both export industries, as well as the building industry, including those key exporters. They have been using
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWA" rel="nofollow">
                 AWA
                </a>
                s with all of their 30 staff since 1997. The managing director, Kym Mobbs, said:
               </p>
               <p class="italic">
                If we hadn’t had AWAs, we would not have been able to compete. Our advantage is that we have the flexibility to adapt to changing customer needs because our staff feel part of our business.
               </p>
               <p>
                They are part of the business because of the AWAs.

                Last night there was a most enjoyable function held in Canberra, and I know that a number of the members of the opposition were there as well. It was the farewell for Peter Corish, the former President of the

                 National Farmers Federation
                </a>
                . He spoke about AWAs in his own personal business. With regard to his business, he said:

               <p class="italic">
                We have found them very effective in providing agreements that gives certainty for the employees as well as for us as employers.

                      Ms Reynolds said:
                     </p>
                     <p class="italic">
                      If they’re a good employee, because of the skills shortage, your employer is going to look after you.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      That is the last word from a small business person. Of course, that is exactly the case: good employers are going to look after good employees. The skills shortage is there, but we have to keep the economy going. We have to keep good skilled staff engaged in the workplace. That is the evidence coming from across regional Australia. I suggest the Leader of the Opposition should listen to the last line of that quote: if you are a good employee, because of the skills shortage, your employer will look after you. So if he is a good employee, because of the skills shortage on the frontbench, his employer, the unions of Australia, will look after him.

It does need to be dealt with if order in this House is to be maintained.

We were told that the sky was going to fall in. We know the Leader of the Opposition is broken-hearted that the economy is doing so well, but he should not try to take out his political frustration by asking absurd questions.
