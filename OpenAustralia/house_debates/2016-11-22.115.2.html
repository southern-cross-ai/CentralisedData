        There are more than 60,000 Australians who can boast of having Turkish heritage, many of whom live in my electorate. On 29 October we saw major celebrations in the Australian Turkish community. On that day 93 years ago, Turkey proclaimed itself a democratic republic. The relationship between Turkey and Australia is one to envy, beginning with angst in the turmoil of war but which, through mutual respect, has developed into a warm and lasting friendship.

        While being at the forefront of the global war on terror and experiencing its own conflicts—ranging from that with Daesh, attacks by the

        and, more recently, an attempted coup—Turkey is still home to 2.5 million Syrian refugees. Despite all its challenges, Turkey remains determined to provide humanitarian aid and a safe haven, particularly at a time when other countries are closing their doors. The

         Republic of Turkey
        </a>
        is a strong ally of Australia in the global efforts against terrorism in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan. The friendship between Australia and Turkey has come a long way since the shores of Gallipoli in 1915.

        Next year, the Australian Turkish community will be celebrating the 50th anniversary of the assisted immigration agreement between Australia and Turkey. This agreement was the cornerstone for the development of Australia's multiculturalism. The arrival of Turkish immigrants of the Muslim faith was one of the key principles that brought an end to the

        policy. The Australian Turkish community, like many of our multicultural groups, has contributed positively to our cultural diversity and social fabric, enriching the life and outlook of our community. Their colour, vibrancy and heritage, as well as the tremendous contributions the Turkish have made to Australian cuisine, give us all much to be proud of. I commend all Australians of Turkish heritage for their positive contribution to our community. I extend my sympathies to them, as well as to the people of Turkey, for the terrible losses that they have sustained due to terrorism in recent months.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Turkish community is very proud of its heritage and is determined to make a contribution in this country. Since their arrival, its members have shown that they are model citizens and ones that I think most of us can look up to. Long may the practice continue of accepting people of overseas origins, who make a contribution to this country and make our country better. I think this is a great Australian tradition.
