        The drone delivery trial in Bonython is still going and residents are getting increasingly fed up. Since I did a callout last month, feedback about the drone trial has not slowed down. In fact, it has increased dramatically. While some reactions have been positive, the feedback is overwhelmingly negative. Over the past week, I've had a number of comments coming in from residents—a bit of a surge in comments from Bonython residents. Judy, a Bonython resident of 24 years, says, 'It's like having a permanent mosquito every weekend. Initially the drones seemed to follow road routes, but lately they've been flying directly over my house and the volume has increased.' Sue: 'They are driving me crazy. I enjoy having my lunch in the sun and listening to an audio book, but this is impossible as the drones are too loud and drown out the book.' Kris: 'The noise echoes across the valley and it flies over my house continuously. The serenity of a peaceful suburb has deteriorated.' Briana: 'Every weekend for the last month or so I have had drones flying around and over my property. As a result I no longer feel I have privacy in the outdoor spaces around my home.' And from today: 'This morning, starting just after eight o'clock, there have been five drones passes—10 including the return trip—by 8.35.' That's on a Sunday. 'The weekends are by far the worst. In a period of just one hour one Sunday 11 passes, 22 including the return, were made until I lost count.'
