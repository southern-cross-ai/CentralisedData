         <p>
          This could be a personal explanation, but the issue I am raising is not about me. This morning the Deputy Prime Minister said:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          I remember Mr Shorten, didn’t he stand outside a goldmine down in Tasmania, telling us all about how he, you know, he put on the hi-vis shirt and the bomber jacket, told us all how
         </p>
         <p>
          This is not a random commentary from a Twitter troll; this is the person who is meant to be
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Prime_Minister_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Deputy Prime Minister of Australia
          </a>
          . It is true that I was at Beaconsfield, but it is even more sadly true that a minor called
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Knight" rel="nofollow">
           Larry Knight
          </a>
          died down that mine. I will never forget how, after Larry's body was found, management talked about stopping the search so the coroner could take control of the site and it would become a recovery. I will never forget the other miners who were doing the rescuing. They said in front of the superintendent's office: 'No, this is still a rescue operation, not a recovery. Until we know different, there are men down there who are still alive.' Whilst those modest heroes dug through rock to save their workmates, the families of Grant and Todd went through hell and back not knowing if their men would return alive.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is true that I was at Beaconsfield. It was a privilege to see how upwards of 250 people and more in that community, and the miners, rescued two trapped miners. But what I will never forget on that remarkable morning when the two men came out of the cage alive is that Larry Knight's family had held up the burial of their loved one so it would not distract from the rescue of the two miners who were in fact saved. So I simply ask this: before the Deputy Prime Minister rises to speak on any other matter in the House today, could he please come in here and apologise—not to me but to the family of Larry Knight, who did not need this whole thing dragged up again by the thoughtless comments of the Deputy Prime Minister Australia.
