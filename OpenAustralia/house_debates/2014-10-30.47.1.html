        I recently attended the 2014 Macedonian Doctors' Breast Cancer and Research Ball. The ball was held by the Australian Macedonian Medical Society to raise money for important equipment at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_George_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         St George Hospital
        </a>
        . It was great to see the member for Cowan there, who travelled all the way from Perth to Sydney for the event. I would like to congratulate the society for raising $15,000 for breast cancer radiotherapy equipment at St George Hospital and more than $6,000 for the St George and Sutherland Medical Research Foundation.
       </p>
       <p>
        St George Hospital was without a breast cancer radiation table, and there is now one on site and being used after the success of this event. Until now, patients from across the state have had to travel to the

        </a>
        for this treatment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian Macedonian Medical Society works hard to advocate and fundraise for very important causes in the community. In particular, I would like to note the work done by Dr Zoran Becvarovski, who has been a very strong leader of the society over several years. The society was established in 2009 by a group of Macedonian doctors and advocates strongly for the improvement of the health and wellbeing of the local community. In addition to Dr Becvarovski, I would like to thank the other members of the association's board, Dr Nick Cvetkovski and Dr Nikola Mitrev. I look forward to continuing to work with the Australian Macedonian Medical Society and the broader Macedonian community in the future.
