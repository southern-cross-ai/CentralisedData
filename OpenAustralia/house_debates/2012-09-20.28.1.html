        I rise with a degree of reluctance following the final of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        rugby premiership, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shute_Shield" rel="nofollow">
         Shute Shield
        </a>
        , played last weekend. I was pleased to attend, along with my colleague the member for Cook, to cheer on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Districts" rel="nofollow">
         Southern Districts
        </a>
        as they put up a strong fight against University, especially after having lost their second rower
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kane_Douglas" rel="nofollow">

        , who was called up to play for the Wallabies and received his first test cap against the Pumas.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Southern Districts Rebels showed great heart, only to have the premiership snatched from them by a single point to their more favoured rivals. And, as the member for Cook noted on Monday, many questions remain over a suspect pass. Nonetheless, as I am bound by contract to the member for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         North Sydney
        </a>
        , I wish to note the high achievement of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_University" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney University
        </a>
        rugby club in winning the Sydney rugby union premiership for 2012â€”their seventh title in eight years.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the time remaining, I would like to express how proud I am of the Southern Districts club. This was a club that was first formed in 1989 and played in its first grand final only this year. It was the merging of my old team, St George, with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Hacking" rel="nofollow">
         Port Hacking
        </a>
        . What has stood out during that time has been its club spirit. It was absolutely fantastic to see on the weekend the eastern grandstand of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concord_Oval" rel="nofollow">
         Concord Oval
        </a>
        full of Southern Districts supporters cheering on their team, who I am sure in years to come will get that title.
