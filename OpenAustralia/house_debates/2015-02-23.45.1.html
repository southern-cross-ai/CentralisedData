       <p>
        Last week's exposure of the sickening and apparently common practice of live baiting of racing greyhounds in Australia shows that the welfare of animals in this industry—the dogs, and the rabbits, possums and piglets used as bait—runs a distant last to the primary reason for its existence: the lure of great income. A breed renowned for being gentle, sensitive and loyal, the racing greyhound typically lives a short life of deprivation before being discarded once their money-earning days are over—and that is the treatment dealt out to the good ones. Around 8,000 puppies are born each year who never race, and four of every five racing dogs are euthanased. Only about 10 per cent of animals born will be re-homed and enjoy a natural lifespan.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are many dog lovers involved in the greyhound racing industry who surely dote upon their animals, and I am sure they are equally horrified by the cruel, debased and apparently widespread practice of live baiting brought to light by Animals Australia, Animal Liberation Queensland and the ABCs

        program last week. Animal lovers involved with greyhounds can make their disgust known by refusing to participate in what is an unfair contest on many levels.
       </p>
       <p>
        It would be no surprise to hear that my view is that this declining industry should end. But if it is to continue, then there must be greater transparency, strong and independent regulation and tougher penalties. There is no place in our society for such barbaric treatment of animals.
