        As I travel throughout my electorate of Farrer, I am continually impressed and inspired by the commitment, foresight and passion of our regional enterprises. Just one of these places that I had the pleasure of visiting last week was Murray Cod Australia, located in the small rural village of Bilbul, on the outskirts of Griffith. Murray Cod Australia is the nation's only large-scale producer of this fish species, which, as the name suggests, is unique to the Murray-Darling Basin. The company has recently expanded due to growing demand in supplying both local and overseas markets with what is one of the most unique and largest species of freshwater fish in the world. This is a very important business to the Australian economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Murray cod populations had declined severely since European colonisation due to a number of causes, including severe overfishing, river regulation and habitat degradation. Today, this species is actually listed as a vulnerable species, a stark reminder of the need to regulate and protect our native fish species.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Bilbul facility includes an enclosed aquaculture nursery comprising 34 large tanks with around 300,000 fingerlings. Hygiene and biosafety is of utmost importance in the facility. Staff and management are always vigilant against diseases that can decimate an industry. The local environment is also carefully controlled to ensure the best growing conditions for the fish. They grow from one gram to 100 grams in 12 months. After a year, they are then moved out into one of 12 single megalitre ponds which contain up to 25,000 fish per pond. According to the manager, Paul Van der Werf, the Murray cod is not the friendliest of fishes and will basically eat anything that moves, which, at Bilbul, is generally its own kind. To combat this, the fish are extremely well fed. Local farmers in the area are also keen to be involved in the company via lease arrangements, as aquaculture production can easily be integrated into existing agricultural systems. Another advantage in aquaculture is that the water can eventually be recycled for valuable irrigation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The modern Murray cod industry is very much in its infancy. There are excellent growth prospects for the industry as a whole, with potential to increase demand in Australia and through our export markets in South-East Asia. Aquaculture is the world's fastest growing food production sector. By 2030, it is projected that aquaculture will provide more than 60 per cent of global seafood. Right now, Murray Cod Australia is finding it a challenge to keep up with the demand, but it has very definite plans for future growth. To improve stocks, the company has opened a hatchery at
