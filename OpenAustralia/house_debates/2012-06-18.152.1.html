        I rise to speak about the Gillard Labor government's investment in tertiary education, particularly in the Moreton electorate and in South-East Queensland. On 6 June, which is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Day" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , I was fortunate to have my colleague the minister Senator Chris Evans visit my electorate and officially open the $29 million Campus Heart Building as part of the $105 million investment in upgrading the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffith_University" rel="nofollow">
         Griffith University
        </a>
        's Nathan Campus. This redevelopment program is the largest capital development program in the university's proud 40-year history, and I am glad to be able to say that it is the Gillard Labor government that is delivering on these fundamentals to improve the quality of tertiary education.
       </p>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_O'Connor" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and his team, and this new building, have certainly given the campus a new heart. This is the first major stage of the redevelopment giving the university an extensive range of state-of-the-art facilities. I should say it is a new heart and that, prior to that, it was not heartless—it is more a transplant, reflecting the way things have now changed at universities.
       </p>
       <p>
        This new, multilevel Campus Heart Building includes a major new retail building, a relocated bookshop, a modern cafe, five state-of-the-art seminar rooms and a large balcony for functions, which is where we held the opening. The extended library, the Willett Centre, includes a new student centre, 15 new classrooms, an upgraded library space and a central courtyard with a canopy. It reflects how university students learn now. When I was at university—back in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Ages" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        !—you went into the library, went through the catalogue cards and tried to track down the book. You went to the lectures, took notes and then went over your notes. Now, people can listen to lectures wherever they want—whether it be at the beach or out in the courtyard. The lectures have been recorded. They learn in a completely different way, as it should be in the digital age. That is why we are bringing in things like the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        —to support the modern way of learning. The new facilities are a great asset for the Moreton region and beyond and will be valuable for teachers and students alike.
       </p>
       <p>
        This $29 million investment at Griffith University's Nathan Campus is just a fraction of what the Australian government has committed to transform higher education, research and voc ed and training infrastructure, with more than $5 billion having been invested since 2007. It is great to be able to say that, despite a very tough budget, which is part of us delivering a surplus, higher education was able to avoid the cuts, because we understand that the innovation and productivity that flow from university research are a part of Australia's future.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Gillard Labor government's investment in students' future does not stop here. We are also delivering extra support for students and young Australians who need it the most, to help them make ends meet. I particularly commend Vice Chancellor Ian O'Connor and Griffith University for their particular commitment to helping the disadvantaged, especially students with an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATSI" rel="nofollow">

        background and rural and remote students. Griffith University is able to have a much higher percentage of these students accessing their services.
       </p>
       <p>
        This Labor government knows that it can be tough for young people to keep up with the rising cost of living, especially if they are studying or just entering the workforce. So this side of the House voted for delivering extra cash for students and a new tax cut for young people by increasing the tax-free threshold to $18,200. From 11 June, 2,500 students and young people in training in my electorate started to receive extra cash to help them meet the rising cost of living. People on youth allowance, Austudy or Abstudy get an upfront payment of up to $190, and obviously they do not have to worry about forms; this is being delivered seamlessly into their bank accounts.
       </p>
       <p>
        It does not stop there. In July 2013, students will receive another lump sum payment to give them a bit of extra breathing space. Further, the Gillard Labor government has committed to delivering, from January 2014, a permanent boost to the regular fortnightly student payment. Further still, from 1 July this year, everyone earning less than $80,000 a year will receive a tax cut. For most young people in the workforce, that means at least $300 extra a year in their pockets. For hundreds of thousands of people, especially students, part-time workers and mothers working to make ends meet and get ahead, this is a positive step in the right direction. For millions more, it means there will be more in their take-home pay.
       </p>
       <p>
        The increase in the tax-free threshold to $18,200 is the largest ever increase in the tax-free threshold. It means students working part time will have more money in their fortnightly pay packet, more money to spend at the bookstore or computer shop and more money that will circulate in the Australian economy, which is obviously better for jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        These tax cuts are good Labor policy and I am proud to have voted for them. Unfortunately, some members opposite voted against this policy—
