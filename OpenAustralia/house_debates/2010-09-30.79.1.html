        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. Will the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship please update the House on issues relating to the suspension of processing asylum claims of Afghan asylum seekers?

        <p>
         I thank the member for Newcastle for her question. As the House would be aware, on 9 April 2010 the government announced the suspension of the processing of new asylum claims for nationals of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka" rel="nofollow">
          Sri Lanka
         </a>
         and of Afghanistan—in the case of Afghanistan for a period of six months. The decision to suspend processing was based on growing evidence at that time of evolving country situations in Sri Lanka and Afghanistan. The pause in the processing of claims from Afghanistan is due to be lifted on 8 October, which is next Friday. That is when it is due to expire.
        </p>
        <p>
         In recent weeks the government has been closely considering, with the advice of relevant government departments, what approach should be taken to the pause in the processing of asylum claims from Afghanistan. During the last six months, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Immigration_and_Citizenship" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Immigration and Citizenship
         </a>
         has been working to improve its understanding of the issues surrounding asylum claimants from Afghanistan. This has been done in conjunction with relevant and interested governments and has been closely informed by our post in Kabul. After close and careful consideration, the government has formed the view that we should lift the suspension. I announce that that will occur effective immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government considers that it is now better positioned to assess asylum claims from Afghans based on more up-to-date country information. This follows, as I say, an exhaustive review over the last six months. As a result of the more exhaustive country information there been has a decrease in the number of primary acceptances of claims from Afghans who are not subject to the processing pause. Even taking into consideration the possibility of some of these being overturned on review, the percentage of successful refugee claims is likely to be lower than in the past. Those Afghans who are found not to warrant protection will be returned to Afghanistan, consistent with Australia’s international obligations.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government is working very closely with the government of Afghanistan and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees to enter into an agreement for the return of Afghan nationals to Afghanistan. I hope to be able to update the House and the community on that in the not too distant future. Australia will of course continue to work closely with our international partners and the government of Afghanistan to progress this matter.
