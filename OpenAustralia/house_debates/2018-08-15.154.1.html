        When we talk about someone being homeless there are probably stereotypical images that flash in people's minds, but the nearly 100 people, mainly women, who joined me in Windsor to discuss older women's homelessness know another reality. Women over 60 are among the most at-risk groups in our community. As part of national homelessness week, I thought it was time to shine a spotlight on this issue. I was joined by the shadow minister for homelessness, Senator Cameron, and Jenny Ranft from Wentworth Community Housing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Domestic violence, marriage break-ups, gambling addiction, poverty and inequality can all contribute to homelessness. While homelessness affects all ages and genders, the number of women couch-surfing, in temporary accommodation, in overcrowded housing and sleeping in cars has almost doubled over the past four years, and it's probably undercounted.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Hawkesbury and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains" rel="nofollow">
         Blue Mountains
        </a>
        , in my electorate, are not immune. The statistics are grim. The estimate of older women experiencing homelessness on the night of the 2016 census was 6,866. This was a 31 per cent increase from the 2011 figures and a significant jump in five years. There was also a big jump in the number of older women renting in the private rental market. In 2006 there were around 90,000 older women in private rentals. That had doubled by 2016.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor has a comprehensive suite of policies to combat homelessness and improve housing affordability, including reinstating a minister for housing and homelessness. I'm so proud that the community I represent cares about this issue and is willing to be part of the solution.

        We are at a crisis point in Windsor. The

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_Square" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and covering over for ever the impressive 200-year-old convict-built barrel drains. This will happen over the next few nights under the cover of darkness. It's essentially heritage vandalism of some of Australia's oldest colonial remnants. I don't think this Georgian square, the oldest public square in the country, should be having a modern concrete bridge built through it at all. It should be bypassed, but if the New South Wales government is determined to give the Hawkesbury only one single new lane across the river at the very least it should let people see what's about to go.
       </p>
       <p>
        When I spoke to archaeologists during my visit to the site in April they thought organising a public opening was relatively easy to do, but they said they hadn't been asked to do it by the New South Wales government. Well, I asked, and there has been absolutely no response from the New South Wales minister for roads or the local member, who happens to be the treasurer. This site is unique. I found it amazing to see the quality of work and the ingenuity involved in channelling water through the early settlement, and others deserve to see it too, before it's too late.
