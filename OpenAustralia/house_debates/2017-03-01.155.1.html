        I often tell people that if you want to know what country communities are all about then come and have a look at a country show. It is show season in central western

        at the moment. The shows are a highlight of the local calendar. On Saturday, 18 February, I attended the 2017 Gulgong show, the 129th year of that wonderful institution. It takes a lot of time and effort from hardworking volunteers to ensure the ongoing success of country shows like that at Gulgong, and I want to make special mention of the team at Gulgong, who put on such a great event recently.

        I would like to mention president Ian Haynes, senior vice-president Chris Seis, junior vice-president Lisa Byfield, secretary Brigid Glover, Treasurer Judy Eady, assistant secretary Jean Monaghan and hardworking committee member Louise Butlin. I also mention the patrons: Ken Evans, Ruby Gossage, Bill Hensley,

        , Ernie Tolhurst and Toni Wright. I need to mention the pavilion steward, Wendy Byfield, and we could not forget the ringmaster, Brian Hardy. Of course, it would not be a country show without the cakes, and Ruby Gossage was the cake steward—she has been doing that for about 60 years. The

        I would also like to mention

        and Ken and Esther Evans, who are life members on the committee; Tracey and Dave Spencer; and, of course the gentlemen in the wool section, who showed me through what had been happening in wool around the Gulgong area—Ron Rayner, Bruce Maxwell and Tim Maxwell. And, of course, I could not fail to mention Peter and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Doran" rel="nofollow">

        , who did a wonderful job and who were working on the gate when I saw them too.
       </p>

        I also officially opened the 2007 Rylstone-Kandos Show on 25 February. Again, it was an exceptional show. I would like to mention president, Cameron Clarke; vice president,

        The Rylstone-Kandos show was a wonderful community event. I was there working on a booth with Sandy Walker and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Reid" rel="nofollow">
