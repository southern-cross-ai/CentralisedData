       <p>
        It is with great sadness that I rise today to pay tribute to an inspirational man from my electorate who impacted on the lives of so many young people and their families across Macarthur. Last week I attended the funeral of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Saliba" rel="nofollow">
         John Saliba
        </a>
        , who passed away suddenly on Friday 22 November age 62—too young. He was a life member of Campbelltown Amateur Swimming Club where he served as president for nine years. He dedicated his life to supporting local swimmers in Campbelltown,

        </a>
        and eventually across the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        John, together with his son Mark, and former Australian coach
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Thompson" rel="nofollow">

        , were pioneers and champions of open water swimming in Australia. John travelled the world as Mark's manager, forging our country's reputation in the sport. His contribution, influence and legacy to the swimming community was inspirational. He was a highly regarded and well-respected official at the club, state, national and international levels and was instrumental in producing most of the documentation and policy on open water swimming in New South Wales. John was also the Australian open water team manager for many years. Former

        open water head coach Greg Towle said John's drive and passion for the sport of open water swimming set him apart. John's death has not only shocked and saddened former members of the Australian swimming team, but swimmers from around the world who spend time with him during international competitions. He was dedicated to helping all swimmers be the best they could be.
       </p>
       <p>
        At his funeral last week at St Gregory's College in Campbelltown it was obvious that John had a tremendous impact on the lives of many young athletes in my electorate and their families. His sons, Matthew and Mark, spoke about their dad and the love he had for his family and the sport of swimming. He was a loving husband to Carol, dad to Mark and Matthew, father-in-law to Christie and Genevieve and had four beautiful young granddaughters whom he loved with all his heart.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since his death, I have heard from former swimmers and parents at the Campbelltown swimming club who have told me that John's kindness and support were second to none. He was always fair and encouraging and gave each swimmer his time and advice to help them progress to higher levels in the sport.
       </p>
       <p>
        John's contribution to open-water swimming in Australia and around the world is immeasurable. On a local level John set a great example for parents of young athletes across Macarthur and two executive members of our local sporting clubs. He was a kind and generous man who had a great passion for swimming and for supporting all who took part in the sport.
       </p>
       <p>
        John's death is a great loss to the swimming community in Macarthur and across the globe. He will be dearly missed by all those who knew him, and they will remember him for his selfless dedication to helping others. My thoughts and prayers go to his family at this sad time—and to all who knew this great man. Rest in peace, John. You are loved and adored by your family, friends and community. Macarthur is a better place because of you.
