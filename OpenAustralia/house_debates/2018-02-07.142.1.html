        I recently met with Andrew Vourvahakis, the owner of Andrew's Choice smokehouse, a small business operating in the electorate of Lalor that produces a range of multi-award-winning artisan smallgoods, handcrafted using the finest quality ingredients. Andrew reached out to me in early January, concerned about a proposed 130 per cent price hike in his electricity bill. Unfortunately, Andrew is not alone when it comes to unfair price hikes. Small and large businesses alike are feeling the heat of rising energy and electricity prices in my electorate. I've visited small and large businesses with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Shorten" rel="nofollow">
         Bill Shorten
        </a>
        , the Leader of the Oppositionâ€”Milltech Martin Bright and Victoria Wool Processors, to name a few. Both businesses raised the issue of the extraordinary price hikes that they are facing. The worst part about this is that the Turnbull government have done nothing to relieve energy price increases, costing jobs and businesses in my local community. The government talk a lot about small business, but they're not talking a lot about energy prices and the doors closing because of their lack of action.
       </p>
       <p>
        When I met with Andrew, I heard in his voice the passion for his craft, the pride he has in his family business, and the responsibility that he said he feels to look after his employees. It warmed my heart. He balances his employees' needs with his family's needs in a way that makes me proud. He wants to make sure that the factory can stay open so his employees can work and earn a living for their families. Andrew proudly employs 13 local people in a full-time capacity. We aren't just talking about increases of a couple of hundred dollars either. We are talking about a 130 per cent price hike for Andrew, who is currently paying $7,000 a month for electricity. The new contract will force him to pay upwards of $15,000 a month!
       </p>
       <p>
        Andrew is not alone. He mentioned to me that owners of neighbouring factories and manufacturing outfits are now coming out of contract too and are being forced to sign on to similar, unfair deals. He told me that he has been a customer of his energy provider for 11 years and has always paid his bills on time. He told me that he felt that he was being put upon by his energy provider. But Andrew's a fighter, and he went up the chain to get as much of his grievance heard as he could. He has spent over $30,000 to make his business more energy efficient, changing the lighting and thermostats for all the hot water, giving his business an impressive energy rating of 97 per cent. He is now installing solar panels which will cost upwards of $150,000 to mitigate further price hikes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Energy price hikes such as those Andrew is facing are unsustainable and demonstrate what Labor already knows. We need to be investing in a plan that sees a clean, affordable and reliable energy future based on a mix of generation options that meets the needs of consumers at affordable prices. Labor is for reliable and affordable energy. I will work for business owners like Andrew in my electorate to ensure that they get what they need.
