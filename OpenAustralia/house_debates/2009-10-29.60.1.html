         I thank the member for her question. The member asked about two terrible terrorist attacks yesterday, that were reported overnight, in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Shortly before question time, I spoke to Pakistan’s
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">
          High Commissioner
         </a>
         to Australia and relayed to him the government’s condolences on the terrible loss that has occurred as a result of the attack in Peshawar, which was an attack upon innocent women and children in a marketplace. I expressed to him Australia’s solidarity at a time of very difficult circumstances as far as Pakistan’s security and economic and social circumstances are concerned. I relayed those condolences and that message of solidarity to the Pakistan high commissioner and asked him to relay that to Foreign Minister Qureshi. I know that sentiment will be shared by all members of the House. This was a terrible attack on women and children. The reason for the attack is no doubt because the government, the parliament and the people of Pakistan are taking a stand against extremism and terrorism in the North-West Frontier Province and on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. This is clearly directed at intimidating Pakistan and seeking to have it desist in its stand against terrorism.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia is a foundation member of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends_of_Democratic_Pakistan" rel="nofollow">
          Friends of Democratic Pakistan
         </a>
         . Recently, at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations General Assembly
         </a>
         , the Prime Minister and I attended the leaders’ summit of Friends of Democratic Pakistan, chaired by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Obama" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         , where we made the point to Pakistan that we stood shoulder to shoulder with them. We have substantially increased our development assistance to Pakistan and have also substantially increased the assistance that we give to them for the training of their military and defence officers.
        </p>
        <p>
         The member also asked me about the terrorist attack in Afghanistan. This was of course an attack upon a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         residence, on UN officers in accommodation. Any attack upon the United Nations is absolutely contemptible. We relay to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon our contempt for this outrageous act and our condolences to the secretary-general and to all officials and employees of the United Nations, and we relay our sympathy to the families of the victims. It underlines a very important point often missed: the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Security_Assistance_Force" rel="nofollow">
          International Security Assistance Force
         </a>
         mission in Afghanistan is a United Nations mandated force.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          The United Nations
         </a>
         assistance mission in Afghanistan plays a vital role, together with the secretary-general’s special representative,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai_Eide" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         They were terrible attacks. I know that the sentiments I have expressed will be shared by all members of the House. Any attack upon the United Nations is contemptible. Our support and sympathy goes to the United Nations today. The attack on innocent women and children in Pakistan is also an outrage. We express and send our condolences to Pakistan at this difficult time for them.

          Whilst this will not be a precedent for getting comments across the table, on this occasion it would be appropriate for me to give the Deputy Leader of the Opposition brief indulgence.

           Mr Speaker, on indulgence, the coalition supports the statements made by the foreign minister in relation to these barbaric attacks in Pakistan and Afghanistan. We thank the foreign minister for extending the sympathies of the Australian people, including both sides of this parliament, to the Pakistan

           <p>
            Just before giving the call to the Leader of the Opposition—I regret that it is now absolutely too late—we had in the gallery, or we might still have in the gallery, some staff and course members from a Centre for Defence and Strategic Studies group. I think that at this time it would be appropriate to acknowledge them, especially as there are military members from Pakistan within the group.
