       <p>
        Today I rise to congratulate my local chapter of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Women's_Association" rel="nofollow">
         Country Women's Association
        </a>
        . It's hard to believe that in my electorate I have a Country Women's Association, but they had a 90th birthday, which tells you just how much my part of the world has changed in the last 90 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        I rise today because I missed out on their birthday celebrations—we were here sitting last month—and I want to say thank you to them for all of the work that they do. In addition to all of the great things that they do in supporting women, being the largest women's organisation in the country, they support many local charities and community projects as well as aid to the Asia-Pacific countries.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are 400 branches in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        , probably in more remote and regional parts than downtown Western Sydney Lindsay. Our local branch of dedicated women provide a voice for women, networking opportunities and aim to improve conditions and welfare for women and families. They've donated to medical research into Lyme disease and Rett syndrome; supported the flying doctors mental health program; Mama Lana's community kitchen, which is for the relief of homelessness in my area; and local school scholarships. Internationally they have supported women in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG" rel="nofollow">
         PNG
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        to purchase sewing machines and fabrics, so they can give back to their communities and support their own families.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ruth Shanks AM, the international president of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Country_Women_of_the_World" rel="nofollow">
         Associated Country Women of the World
        </a>
        , was the special guest in my electorate, and I am so sorry that I couldn't be there. Congratulations to the Country Women's Association of Penrith—the president, Caroline Wong, secretary Alison Christie and members of the local chapter, who are doing a fabulous job. These volunteers reinforce why I'm so proud to be the member—
