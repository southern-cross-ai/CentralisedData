        I rise today to pay tribute to and remember a good friend and giant in the Cairns business community who recently passed away. Real estate veteran and community leader Ross
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moller" rel="nofollow">
         Moller
        </a>
        passed away suddenly last month at the age of 66. Ross started his career as a real estate agent in 1989 and went on to become a leading auctioneer and principal. He went to build up one of Cairns's most successful real estate business in the inner-city suburb of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_Hill" rel="nofollow">

        Hooker office was frequently lauded for its results both locally and nationally within the group. I was fortunate enough to have known Ross for the best part of four decades. I first met Ross during the 1980s when, in a life before politics, I was selling real estate with the Freeman Corporation and he was working as the manager of former real estate financing company, Mercantile Credits—

        the Bunnies—and we did a lot of business together during that period of time.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, Ross was more than simply a businessman. He absolutely will be remembered for his tireless, passionate and unwavering dedication to the Cairns community, whether it was in his capacity as President of Cairns Amateurs, as a Taipans board member, as an executive of REIQ for our region or on various community and advisory committees that he was involved with. Ross's positive contribution to our community is without question. He was part of our city's fabric. Ross Moller was a true gentleman and an all-round great bloke. His sudden passing has affected many people in my community, myself included. I think the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Manning" rel="nofollow">

        , summed it up perfectly when reflecting on Ross's life, saying:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He was always aware of the community he lived in, and he was a contributor, not a taker.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ross's memorial service was held last Tuesday. Unfortunately, I was here and unable to attend, but my beautiful wife, Yolonde, represented us there. She told me it was an amazing celebration of a fantastic and wonderful life well lived. He was very much appreciated by our local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ross is survived by his wife, Despina, and children, Nadine, Ben and Nick, and of course all of their families. I have to tell you that it was an absolute shock when we learnt of Ross's passing. He was certainly taken well before his time. Unfortunately, that tends to be the case of the very good and the very special people in our community. In closing, I'd just like to say to Ross: rest in peace, mate. You will be very, very sorely missed, but I can guarantee you, mate, you'll never, ever be forgotten.
