        I rise to speak on the very volatile and dangerous situation that has been evolving every day in Afghanistan recently. The situation stands as one of the most unpredictable foreign affairs issues in recent history and, of course, the top priority of the Australian government is to ensure a safe departure of Australian citizens and visa holders. But, further to that, we have a broader responsibility to Afghan nationals who seek humanitarian support.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since 18 August we have supported the evacuation of around 4,000 people from Kabul, including nationals from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_and_New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         Australia and New Zealand
        </a>
        as well as visa holders and foreign nationals. This is one of the largest evacuations in living memory. One thousand, two hundred people were evacuated overnight on six Australian and one New Zealand flight, with two more transfer flights to Australia today. The support of the ADF and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in working together with our partners and collaborators has been simply extraordinary.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the last 20 years, Australia has been a steadfast contributor to the fight against terrorism in Afghanistan and we have made significant progress in these efforts. In this fight against terrorism more than 40,000

        </a>
        personnel and civilians have served. I want to honour and acknowledge those 41 soldiers who died, and include the many Australians wounded in attacks. Some of these wounds will never heal, nor will the emotional scars of the loved ones who feel the pain acutely. We must surround them with our support, our care and our admiration.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia, and my constituents in Higgins, feel so strongly about improving education and employment opportunities for the people of Afghanistan, particularly for the women and children. Certainly, Australia has been an active participant in achieving this goal. Unfortunately, now Afghanistan faces a political and, potentially, a humanitarian crisis, which does put these achievements at risk.
       </p>
       <p>
        We've all been shocked by the recent events in this one last week in Afghanistan. I'm sure that many members in this House have been approached by their constituents about what we can do. The compassion of the constituents of Higgins has been clear to me, with hundreds of emails and phone calls to my office expressing their concern for the Afghan people. We've heard of numerous examples of families and children feeling threatened by the Taliban forces intimidating them. I am pleased to say that we have had success in this endeavour, with some of these individuals now on their way to Australia as we speak, and I thank the constituents of Higgins who have worked so hard to bring these cases to our attention, and to the department—to

        </a>
        —for working closely with my office on these matters. We have been working with DFAT to ensure that these vulnerable Afghan citizens are processed and settled as a priority, while sheltering in Australia's protection.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was particularly very grateful in the last week for the hardworking ministers, particularly Senator the Hon.

        , who are the ministers for foreign affairs, immigration and home affairs respectively, and for their staff and offices for the incredible work that they have been doing. I know they've been working night and day and that they've had texts, emails and phone calls all through the night. I have actually received photos and texts from people on the ground in Kabul; it's been a frightening experience for those people who are navigating their way through and their path to safety.
       </p>
       <p>
        Knowing that the Australian Defence Force has been on the ground supporting them has been incredible for them. I'd like to say thank you to the ADF for their continued and brave efforts in a very rapidly-evolving situation. It does remain extremely dangerous, but I'd like to acknowledge the significant issues that they have had to face in this very difficult time. Nonetheless, we remain focused on the safe evacuation from Afghanistan of as many as possible during this very difficult period.
       </p>
       <p>
        While we know this volatile situation will continue to evolve for many days to come and, potentially, for many weeks, we must stay focused on the goal of bringing these vulnerable people home. And we must never forget the good work that we've achieved over the past two decades and the reasons why we were there. To that end, we must not forget the service of our ADF personnel and their agencies, and also the fact that the people in Afghanistan have had improvements to their lives. They've gained increased access to basic health care and electricity; they've had reduced maternal mortality rates; there have been rises in life expectancy; and there has been the participation of women in politics and girls attending school.
