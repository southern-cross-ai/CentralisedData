        As part of Raise Our Voice in parliament, I'll deliver a speech on youth mental health written by a member of my Curtin youth advisory group. Saskia Laurence from

        "Am I good enough?" was a question I often presented myself with when growing up.

        When I went to seek help the next question was, "Am I a burden?"
       </p>

        The view of mental health given to me growing up affected my ability to reach out and this cycle is never-ending.

        The statistics surrounding youth mental health are alarming:

        Youth mental health cannot be addressed through quick fixes. It requires a comprehensive approach including prevention, early intervention, and long-term support.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We need to recognize that mental health challenges are not a personal failing, but a societal issue.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Young people are facing an unprecedented level of stress and pressure—from social media, academic expectations and family and community dynamics.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We need to address the root causes of these issues and prioritize access to mental health services for young people, by investing in mental health infrastructure, programs, initiatives and professionals.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To provide for our youth means to provide for our future.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank Saskia for raising this important issue and I will continue to advocate for better mental health supports for young people.

         in Parliament Week initiative, I am pleased to read out a speech by Isabella, an 18-year-old in my community who just finished her year-12 exams—best of luck, Isabella, for whatever comes next:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Australia has the capacity to lead and inspire a future with renewable energy, in alignment with the United Nation's 2030 Sustainable Development Goals in transitioning away from fossil fuel industries.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The change future generations will benefit from the most is change that is intersectional and informed.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Change that accommodates the integration of fossil fuel industry workers and rural communities into new industry to equip and empower them.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Change that educates current generations to make better choices about their consumption and carbon footprints.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Change that holds corporations and governments accountable towards transparent and smart progress forward.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         So, as a young person, when I look at the way things were, I see decisive ignorance about climate change, and stagnant policy.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         When I look at the way things are, I see young people across the world, in my city, protesting to summon government action towards this issue that undeniably affects us all.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         And, finally, when I look at the way things could be, I am filled with a fragile hope that Australia takes a leap to change its attitude towards climate change.
        </p>
        <p>
         Thanks, Isabella, for your work, and congratulations to everyone who took part in this competition.

          I would like to reach a speech written by a 17-year-old, Darcy Oats, a student from
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Augustine's_College" rel="nofollow">
           St Augustine's College

          campaign. Darcy writes:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The vastness of Australia is ingrained within the fabric of our national identity, romanticised in prose and heralded as the true epitome of the Australian condition; that no distance nor harsh landscape shall impede our nation from striving for greatness.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          But far too long, rural and regional Australia, and their very community's and concern's, have been lost amidst the noise of our large nation.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          I live in a land where a person my age is 10% less likely to complete grade 12; where I am statistically more likely to commit self-harm at higher rates than those from the cities.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          It is so easy to feel that I'm not worthy of attention, that those in the halls of my school and every school across rural Australia aren't seen as significant in the grand scheme of government.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Humbly, I beg you, those in this chamber, to open your ears, to listen to rural Australia, to have genuine concern.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Together, bonded in brotherly fraternity as Australians, these issues can be alleviated; to ensure that rural Australians aren't simply another number on a spreadsheet.
         </p>
         <p>
          Thank you very much, Darcy for your outstanding contribution.
