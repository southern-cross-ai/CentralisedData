        I am back with even more great news about the electorate of Braddon. There is something pretty special about this electorate of Braddon, but I don't need to tell you, Deputy Speaker Scott. I stand time and time again spruiking this electorate for all of its talents, but I must tell you we have another world champion in our midst. Wynyard's

         Matthew Phillips
        </a>
        created history in France a few weeks ago, becoming the E3 Class World Enduro Champion just a year after winning at the junior world title. At just 21 years of age, the Waratah-Wynyard Young Australian of the Year, became the first rider to win consecutive junior and senior world championships.
       </p>
       <p>
        Enduro racing appears to be a family tradition, with both his father and grandfather competing. Even with a busted foot and surgery needed only weeks before the finals, he came through and became the world champion.
       </p>
       <p>
        With some of the best enduro trails in the world, a win like Matthew's will bring much welcome international attention to the north-west coast. The sport is massive in Europe and, with Matthew's fan base increasing day by day, the spotlight is certainly on our island home.
       </p>
       <p>
        Matthew is an exciting example of what our young people can do when they dream big and work hard to reach that dream. After celebrating with his girlfriend, family and friends in France, Matthew is now back home in the beautiful city of Wynyard. On behalf of the electorate of Braddon I would like to say, Matthew, you have made our region very proud.
