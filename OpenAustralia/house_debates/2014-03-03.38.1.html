       <p>
        I rise to thank
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Ed" rel="nofollow">
         Mr Ed
        </a>
        Killesteyn for many years of distinguished service, recently to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEC" rel="nofollow">
         AEC
        </a>
        but also to the great institution of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Public_Service" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Public Service
        </a>
        . In my time as Special Minister of State I was continually impressed by Mr Killesteyn's integrity and impartiality. I regret that during his final months in office others were not able to recognise those qualities too.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know that the additional scrutiny placed on the AEC following the WA election result created a high degree of stress for Mr Killesteyn and his colleagues. Things were said publicly which probity and protocol prevented Mr Killesteyn from answering. I commend Mr Killesteyn on his impartial and dignified stance, and I commend him on the role that he played in ensuring openness and transparency throughout a difficult post-election period. I hail his courage in creating a proper process to resolve the impasse through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Court_of_Disputed_Returns" rel="nofollow">
         Court of Disputed Returns
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I expected that Mr Killesteyn would retire from the AEC within this term as commissioner, and I would be disappointed if he felt that his decision to resign was not his own. Mr Killesteyn's many years of impeccable service will not be forgotten by those who worked with him and by Australians who benefit from a sound Public Service and the quiet, competent, impartial work of men and women like him. Mr Killesteyn's family and loved ones will have felt the pain of the last few months. I regret this pain, and I wish him and his loved ones well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Domestically and internationally, the AEC grew under the leadership of Mr Killesteyn. It was innovative, efficient and effective.

        , Asia and in the Pacific, the AEC spread its wings. This is a tribute to Mr Killesteyn's sense of responsibility, service and democracy. I wish Mr Killesteyn and the terrific employees of the AEC every success in the future.
