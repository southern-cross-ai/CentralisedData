        As a local sports enthusiast and someone who has always been involved in a number of local sporting clubs during my life, it gives me great pleasure to recognise a number of exciting young sports stars who call Hindmarsh home. Recently I hosted a local sporting champions presentation and it was great to meet some of these young sporting stars. Successful applicants represented an extremely broad range of sports, including surfing, lacrosse, cycling, athletics, figure skating, surf life saving, hockey, cricket and netball, to a name a few. What was most impressive was the number of recipients who are competing on an international stage with the events being held in countries such as Slovakia, Scotland,

        and China. I would like to congratulate all of those who were successful in applying. I would also like to thank

        , who was my guest speaker at the local sporting champions presentation. Bruce, a local soccer star, said during his presentation that it takes dedication and resilience to excel in sport.

        Finally, on Saturday night I attended two surf life saving club presentation nights – Glenelg Surf Life Saving Club and then Grange Surf Life Saving Club. Grange have won 13 straight senior titles, a record hard to surpass both in Australia and probably internationally in sports. This year they also won the junior sports title. I congratulate them on their success.

       <p>
        I also want to pay tribute to many of the club members from both Glenelg and Grange who were recognised on the night. There are too many to mention, but I do remember a couple of names –

        and Shane Gleeson. I also want to thank the club, in particular Robert and Heather Thompson, for their great hospitality. I look forward to working with the Grange Surf Life Saving Club on their redevelopment.
