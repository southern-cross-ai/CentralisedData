       <p>
        Today I want to publicly acknowledge a very special member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        community, Sam Donohoe. Sam is a courageous 11-year-old boy who has shown great leadership in the face of substantial adversity. I met with Sam and his family recently to present Sam with a leadership medal and a certificate. Sam is fighting every day to conquer the challenges that come with having a seven-centimetre brain tumour. Through this challenge Sam inspires immense love amongst members of our local community. The greatest demonstration of this comes from his parents, Jenny and Steve, and his sister, Indi, who I had the great privilege to meet along with Sam to celebrate his achievements.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sam also motivates great acts of grace and compassion within his local school community, St Francis Xavier Catholic Primary School in

        </a>
        . I would particularly like to thank the principal, Kathy Fuller, for her tremendous support of Sam and his family, and, likewise, the Hope Island Resort Fitness Centre for all of its great support of Sam.
       </p>
       <p>
        Few people will ever measure up, in my view, to the levels of courage and bravery demonstrated by young 11-year-old Sam. I'm truly humbled by this young man. Sam deserves a place in the annals of our great parliamentary history for his sheer courage in the face of adversity. He's a true leader, an artist, a runner, and a reminder to us all about what's really important in life. On behalf of my community, I commend Sam Donohoe and his compelling story to this parliament. We proclaim him a great leader. Sam, Jenny, Steve and Indi, we will always hold you in our thoughts and prayers.
