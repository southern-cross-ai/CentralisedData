       <p>
        I rise today to speak of my recent participation in the 2016
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rim_of_the_Pacific_Exercise" rel="nofollow">
         Rim of the Pacific Exercise
        </a>
        , otherwise known as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIMPAC" rel="nofollow">
         RIMPAC
        </a>
        , as part of the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program.
       </p>
       <p>
        The ADF Parliamentary Program has been running since 2000. It is an exceptional program enabling parliamentarians to spend time in the field interacting directly with Defence personnel. Australia leads the way in exchange programs such as this, providing elected representatives the opportunity to observe at a granular level the unique and challenging aspects of service life. In return, ADF personnel get to observe the operation of our parliament and the working lives of MPs in action.
       </p>
       <p>
        During RIMPAC I met with many of our Pacific rim partners for whom such an exchange program with their parliamentary colleagues was a foreign concept, but they liked what they saw of the non-sanitised treatment that Australian politicians received—as did I.
       </p>
       <p>
        The RIMPAC exercise has been held every two years since 1971. It is the world's largest multinational maritime exercise. It provides an opportunity for Australia to command a multinational force, utilise the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        Pacific Missile Range Facility and enhance our interoperability with regional forces. During RIMPAC Australia held many of the very senior positions within the operation. This is recognition of Australia's early involvement and our reliability as a partner. Australia has participated in every RIMPAC since 1971, making it one of the four original participating nations. The operation included 27 nations, 45 ships, five submarines, more than 200 aircraft and 25,000 personnel, including more than 1,650 ADF personnel. I was able to speak with many Australian servicemen and women during the course of RIMPAC and their consistent message, regardless of rank or gender, was just how much they valued the opportunity to work alongside our multinational partners: the friendships formed and the building of international cooperation and interoperability.

        I wish to thank Major Lisa Collie, who replaced
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Lewis" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , for her careful management of the ADF program in Canberra. But I today want to pay a special tribute to Major Gina Rasmussen who coordinated my program from start to finish, making it both memorable and at times exhausting but absolutely never dull. Thank you also to Commodore Mal Wise, Commander Timothy Byles and Sub-Lieutenant Brendan Schofield—my erstwhile escort everywhere I went—for all the efforts you put into making sure that I was exposed to every facet of the military exercise.
       </p>
       <p>
        To the entire crew of the

        <i>
         Warramunga
        </i>
        , thank you for making me feel so welcome. In particular, I thank Commander Andrew Willis and Lieutenant Commander Matthew Ryall for allowing me such unfettered access to your crew and the opportunity to view the HMAS
        <i>
         Warramunga
        </i>
        capabilities from the basement to the bridge; Lieutenant Rayne Stibbard, who was my chaperon around the HMAS
        <i>

        </i>
        and who I suggest drew the short straw, along with two other women, in having to share a cabin with the civilian; and also Leading Seaman Holly Bradshaw, who hosted me for breakfast in the junior sailor's mess. Whilst on board the HMAS
        <i>
         Warramunga
        </i>
        , I also met with Rear-Admiral Stuart Mayer, Commander of the Australian fleet, who joined the ship to observe the missile launch.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to thank the crew of the HMAS
        <i>
         Canberra

        . Prior to attending RIMPAC, the HMAS
        <i>

        was assisting the Fijian people in the wake of Tropical Cyclone Winston. I was so proud listening to those young men and women of the HMAS
        <i>
         Canberra
        </i>
        speak about their work helping the people of Fiji rebuild their lives and of their enthusiasm to return to Fiji post-RIMPAC to build on those relationships. In particular, I would like to thank the HMAS

        's Commander Jason Hunter and Captain Chris Smith. Thank you both for being so hospitable and for organising an opportunity for me to dine with sailors from my own home town, the Newcastle-Hunter region. I want to thank Lieutenant Colonel Michael Bassingthwaighte, the commanding officer of the 2nd Battalion,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Regiment" rel="nofollow">

        , who are ordinarily based in Townsville.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you for the opportunity to work alongside you and to gain just some insight into your lives, the opportunities and challenges of a service life. I remain both grateful and indebted.
