        Today I rise to update the chamber on recent events in my loved electorate of Lilley. Over the past week thousands of northside families came together to celebrate Diwali, the festival of lights, which signifies new beginnings and the triumph of light over darkness. To signify this auspicious occasion, every year our community comes together in Banyo to enjoy sweet delicacies, delicious food stalls and entertainment to celebrate Diwali. I would like to congratulate the Banyo District Community Group on the success of the Banyo Diwali Festival and give special thanks to the hardworking volunteers—Devinder Bains, Randip Johal, Jagjit Khosa, Jatinder Rehal and Harpreet Singh Kohli—who helped with the success of the event.
       </p>

        Lilley has a proud manufacturing history and is the home of household brands like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Circle" rel="nofollow">
         Golden Circle
        </a>
        and Arnott's. This week Golden Circle is celebrating its 75th anniversary in Lilley. Golden Circle commenced pineapple cannery production in Northgate in 1947, and you would be hard pressed to find a long-term Lilley local who doesn't know someone who worked at the Golden Circle cannery at some point in time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Earlier this year I visited the Golden Circle workers to walk a mile in their shoes. It has been a big week—a big year even—for the Golden Circle workers, who carried the company through the pandemic and then the February floods. In June the workers took protected action and were able to negotiate a 5.76 per cent pay rise and a 13.25 per cent wage increase over the life of their enterprise agreement. I congratulate Kraft Heinz and the employee bargaining representatives from the United Workers Union for reaching this agreement.

        The Toombul Shopping Centre continues to be a hot topic on the northside. Last week I met with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        of Mirvac and the state member for Nudgee, Leanne Linard, for a long overdue update on the future of the site. During the meeting Mirvac committed to building retail and ongoing access to public transport and green space in their reconstruction. They have also committed to meaningful consultation with our community through a survey and through drop-in sessions to provide direct feedback on what you would like to see at this site. I will continue to represent our community and keep you updated on future consultation dates.
       </p>

        I also want to congratulate Darian Kaptich, a
