        , regional telecommunications would have to be one of the biggest issues in the Flynn electorate, no matter where you live. In 2024, telecommunications have never been more important. I often hear from small business owners that are losing money because their

        machine network systems and mobile networks are down.

        Many constituents have told me that banks and government departments have gone solely digital. Yet, when many customers try to complete transactions or documents online, two-factor authentication is required. They are not able to complete these requests in regional Australia, as often the two-factor message does not come through. There are further issues with the Labor government winding down the use of cheques across the banking system, with federal departments to use other payment methods by 2028. A goal has been set to end the use of cheques completely by 2030.

        In 2024, the Regional Telecommunications Review is examining the adequacy of telecommunications in rural, regional and remote parts of Australia. I have written to the committee asking them to visit the electorate of Flynn and hear from affected stakeholders. I encourage businesses and residents to provide feedback to the committee about their views and experiences using telecommunications services, as I for one know that the big telecommunications companies are letting us down.

        Today I call for a Senate inquiry into regional telecommunications. Telstra is under a service obligation that they are not meeting and not acknowledging. The performance criteria, based on fixed line and payphone standards and benchmarks, was made under the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection And Service Standards) Act 1999. These criteria were set over 20 years ago—

        S itting suspended from 09 : 56 to 10 : 17
       </p>
       <p>
        This criterion was made over 20 years ago and has not been changed to reflect the use of modern-day telecommunications. Mobile and internet reception is required daily to complete the most basic of tasks. Telecommunications are also critical in regional Australia for several reasons, including distance and isolation, access to services, economic development, education and skills development, healthcare access, emergency and disaster management, community connectivity, tourism and regional development.

        have highlighted the fact that telecommunications are not only critical but unreliable and severely lacking. Minister for Communications Michelle Rowland must honour her election promise and fix all the mobile black spots in regional areas. Regional telecommunications are not a matter of families being able to watch Netflix every night but rather a matter of making life-or-death calls in these situations. These things need to change and it's time that the big communications companies started putting people before profit.
