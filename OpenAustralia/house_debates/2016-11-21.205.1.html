        For the last three years the Muslim community in Moreton have played a game of cricket against the Muslim community in Rankin.

        , the member for Rankin, and I have been fortunate enough to join in. I am sorry to report that this year Moreton lost to Rankin. The score was 91 runs to 86 in Jim Chalmers's favour. The game was played in the usual positive spirit, with just a little bit of old-fashioned rivalry. The member for Rankin took three wickets in a pretty good bowling performance—I will acknowledge that.

        We started these games a few years ago with our co-captains, Ahsan Asidid and Ali Kadri, as a way of building understanding and bridging divisions in our community. Rankin won the first one in 2014. We won last year—the forces of good in Moreton—but we will have to work a bit harder to regain the cup. Congratulations to Jim Chalmers and his team, led by Ahsan Asidid. I thank Ali Kadri for getting together my team. The Moreton team had some special help from the energetic Rohingya Strikers. I would also like to mention James Stedman, who did the scoring. Thank you to St Laurence's, the local Catholic school, for providing the sporting field. Thank you to Steve Buckland and Phil Barnsley our very patient umpires. It was Steve's second time umpiring, so thank you to
