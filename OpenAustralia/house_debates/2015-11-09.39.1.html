Recently, Austrade came to Townsville and hosted a seminar on the benefits of the three free trade agreements signed under Minister Andrew Robb. They were, of course, the Korean free trade agreement, the Japanese free trade agreement and the China free trade agreement.

       <p>
        Inside the seminar were officials from Austrade, experts in their fields of engagement with each country. The guest speaker, a mango grower, told of the opportunities they had uncovered. She told how they more than doubled their crop and how they produced more R2E2 mangoes because of their reddish skins.
