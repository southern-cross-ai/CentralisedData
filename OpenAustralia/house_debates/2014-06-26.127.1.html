        From the earliest days of Dame Elizabeth Couchman, one of the cofounders of the Liberal Party, and

        , who was the first woman to be elected to the House of Representatives, the Liberal Party has a proud history of female participation and achievement both within the organisational and parliamentary ranks. Many more great women have followed in these women's footsteps, including the first female to administer a government department, Dame Annabelle Rankin, right through to our current Speaker.

        The importance of role models in our lives is universally recognised and cannot be underestimated. It takes a special person not only to pave a new and unfamiliar path but then to share their experiences, both the good and the not so good, with others. This is particularly true in the robust world of politics. I am sure that all of us in this place have benefited from the experience of those that have gone before us, the examples they have set and indeed the lessons they have provided.

        It is in that vein that I rise today to speak about another great Liberal woman, supporter and mentor to so many, Mrs Lorraine Elliott. Lorraine was the member for Mooroolbark in the Parliament of Victoria from 1992 to 2002. While a very capable and well-respected parliamentarian, Lorraine's influence has extended far beyond her responsibilities as a local member. Lorraine has been incredibly active in encouraging all women, and in particular many Liberal women, to engage more fully in the political debate and public life. An active participant within the Liberal Party organisation, Lorraine was metropolitan female vice president and was also keen in establishing the Canterbury Evening Discussion Group. In so doing, she provided an appealing forum, particularly for women, to participate in policy debate in a meaningful and fundamentally satisfying way. Lorraine assisted in fostering many Liberal women parliamentarians, such as Mrs Andrea Coote and Mrs Helen Shardey in the Victorian State Parliament, and the Hon.

        in the federal parliament. Lorraine's contribution in establishing this group has made our state and our country better.

        As the newly minted member for Mooroolbark, Lorraine visited my school when I was in year 10 to talk about life, politics and the economy. This was in the early nineties, when Australia was experiencing the Keating Labor recession and the Victorian economy was a basket case as a result of the Cain-Kirner Labor governments. She was the first parliamentarian I heard speak, and what she said resonated deeply with me. She talked about the importance of the economy and how having a successful business sector creates jobs, which in turn generates opportunity and security for families. In her parliamentary career she became the much-loved Parliamentary Secretary for the Arts in the Kennett government from 1992 to 1999, before continuing her services as shadow minister for arts in opposition. However, her public service has extended beyond the parliament, and she continues to serve her community as president of the Australian Centre for the Moving Image and on the advisory board of

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        After surviving the rough and tumble of Victorian parliament, she faces her biggest challenge of her life as she deals with cancer treatment. I am sure I speak on behalf of many in the Liberal Party when I say to her that we would like to sincerely thank her for her efforts and to wish her all the very, very best for a speedy and full recovery.
