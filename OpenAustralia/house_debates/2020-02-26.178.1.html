       <p>
        I rise today to speak about two wonderful constituents of mine, David and Cheryl Veness of Bathurst in central western
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        . David and Cheryl have lived in Bathurst for 18 years, although David's family have roots in the area going back to the 1800s. They even live in a street named after David and his forebears. David and Cheryl will celebrate their 50th anniversary next year in 2021, an incredible milestone in anyone's books. They had three children and their youngest son, Peter, who was a popular member of the Canberra press gallery, tragically passed away in January 2012 from brain cancer.
       </p>
       <p>
        David was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease 11 years ago and, rather than hide from any stigma related to that disease, he immediately joined the Bathurst Parkinson's Support Group. He's always encouraged anyone else with the disease to not live in denial but to seek support. Despite there still being no cure for Parkinson's, David still refuses to be brought down by the negatives and promotes an active lifestyle to help stave off the progression of the disease. Coming from a career in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         Commonwealth Bank
        </a>
        , David's work took him from Canberra to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and across country New South Wales. He brought his skills to Parkinson's New South Wales, where he became the president of the board in 2017. The role took into Japan last year for the World Parkinson's Congress in Kyoto.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dr Emma Blackwood of Central West Neurology &amp; Neurosurgery has stated that Parkinson's is more prevalent in the regions. The health system is still struggling to keep up with the disease. Parkinson's affects more people in central western New South Wales than prostate and breast cancer combined. David has been passionately fighting for more full-time dedicated Parkinson's nurses for rural and regional New South Wales, as well as promoting support groups across the country. Nearly two-thirds of support groups are in regional areas. David lobbied for a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sturt_University" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        study involving embedding Parkinson's nurses in local health districts. The study showed the very positive savings that can be made by adding specialist nurses to local health services.
       </p>
       <p>
        Never one to slow down, David's next target is making Parkinson's treatment and the drug Sinemet more widely available to sufferers. Sinemet relieves many of the symptoms associated with Parkinson's, including rigidity and instability. The drug is available on the PBS. However, manufacturing levels have dropped and chemists across the country are often running out of the drug.
       </p>
       <p>
        David and Cheryl have always remained active in the community, being involved in Legacy, Rotary and other community groups over the years. David also ran in the local government elections in 2017, and Cheryl has been active in Anglicare and also Court Support.
       </p>
       <p>
        David remains envious that

        , another Parkinson's sufferer, is somehow still more famous than here's. And, in what is perhaps a true show of personal fortitude, David is eagerly awaiting another Collingwood premiership. As he was born on 29 February, a leap year, this Saturday David will celebrate his 18th birthday. His frame made about the signs of 72 trips around the sun, but his strength of humour, strong will and zest for life are more reminiscent of an 18-year-old. Happy birthday, David, and thank you for all of the work that you are doing on behalf of all of those people living with Parkinson's. Our community really appreciates it.
