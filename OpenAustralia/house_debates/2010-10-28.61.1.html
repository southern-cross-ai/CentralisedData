       <p>
        In light of it being Seniors Week next week, I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge an important organisation which I have had the opportunity to meet with on a number of occasions. Along with the member for Tangney, I was invited just last week to their 10-year anniversary celebrations held at the Willeton Sports Club. The organisation is the Association of Independent Retirees Perth Southern Districts branch. The theme of the anniversary was to thank federal and state governments for their support over the past 10 years. I was asked to speak on behalf of the federal opposition. I congratulate all the members of the Association of Independent Retirees Perth Southern Districts branch, including their president Mr Charles Oâ€™Donnell, national president Ms Theresa Kot and foundation member Diane Blades, for reaching their 10-year milestone.

        The Perth Southern Districts branch of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIR" rel="nofollow">
         AIR
        </a>
        are a dedicated group of people, who advocate on behalf of retirees. In particular, the AIR has put together a set of recommendations aimed at improving the aged-care system. The AIR supports the direction and recommendations of the National Aged Care Alliance and has compiled a list of 13 recommendations which encompass AIR and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NACA" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        priorities. The recommendations include aims to improve the aged-care system to make it more flexible, consumer focused aged care, better funding arrangements, improved workforce requirements and more mental health and disability investment. I have one more organisation to congratulate before I finish, and that is

        , which is celebrating its 70th anniversary, which is quite a milestone. It is having a celebration on Saturday. I wish it all the best for its 70th anniversary.
