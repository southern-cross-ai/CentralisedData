        On Wednesday 20 November, the Prime Minister announced the bringing forward of $3.8 billion worth of infrastructure projects nationally, including around $1.9 billion in Queensland. These are projects that will create jobs and drive greater productivity for South-East Queensland and for my electorate of Fisher on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Sunshine Coast
        </a>
        . The package included accelerated funds of $113.6 million to begin more upgrades to the

        and Caloundra and $39 million more to secure delivery of the Linkfield Road Overpass project. Both projects will increase safety, reduce travel times and bust congestion for those travelling to and from Brisbane on the Bruce Highway.
       </p>
       <p>
        Critically, the package also included the fast-tracking of the coalition government's $390 million to fund the duplication of the north coast rail line between Beerburrum and Landsborough. It's still using the same single track that was built in the 1890s. My community constantly sees passenger trains and freight trains in constant conflict, resulting in a loss of time and productivity in the movement of both people and goods. The member for Fairfax and I have pushed the state government harder to—

       </p>
       <p>
        The member for Fairfax and I have pushed the state government hard to meet our funding halfway. That's not something you'd think would be too contentious given that it is a state owned asset. But so far Queensland Labor minister
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Bailey" rel="nofollow">
         Mark Bailey
        </a>
        has refused to fund the rail beyond the state's token gesture of 20 per cent, despite our assiduous work to break the impasse.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was therefore very pleased to announce that, as part of the Prime Minister's package of projects, the Morrison government will make $90 million available immediately to enable the Queensland government to start duplication work right now and will provide the remaining $300 million as key construction milestones are reached. This will mean jobs for locals on the Sunshine Coast—jobs when our building, construction and engineering sectors are facing difficult times, jobs that will see the construction of duplicated track and fewer people travelling to Brisbane on the Bruce Highway, jobs that will see more freight being shipped by rail and less on our congested road networks. Premier Palaszczuk and Minister Bailey, it's time to get cracking on this project. There can be no excuses, no delays and no ifs, buts or maybes. The Commonwealth's money is on the table. Let's start work now and argue later.
       </p>
       <p>
        The federal government's commitment to driving our national economy should be seen in stark contrast to federal Labor, who, when last in government, racked up hundreds of millions of dollars in debt with their ill-considered disasters—pink batts and cash for clunkers. In contrast, this government is getting on with the job of providing infrastructure.
