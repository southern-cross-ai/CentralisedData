        I rise to speak on the Migration Amendment (Regulation of Migration Agents) Bill and on the rates of charge bill, as well. At the outset, I say that Labor will support these bills. The Migration Amendment (Regulation of Migration Agents) Bill is an omnibus package of reforms aimed at deregulating the migration advice industry. The migration agents rates of charge bill amends the Migration Agents Registration Application Charge Act 1997.

        Australia's migration framework includes the Migration Act 1958, which is an extremely complex and often confusing system of law for those prospective migrants or visitors who have to navigate its complexities. Given this, people turn to migration agents to assist them through the process of applying for a visa. People seeking the help of a migration agent in Australia are by their very nature vulnerable customers. Often they are people seeking help to process a humanitarian visa, an opportunity to reunite with family, assistance to take up a job offer in Australia or to visit for an extended period of time. Often people are faced with language or cultural barriers which further compound what can be a stressful, confronting and expensive process. In my work as the federal MP for Blair and shadow minister for immigration and border protection I'm acutely aware of how difficult it can be for people facing what is often for them an overwhelming process.

        One of the strengths of Australia's migration system is its non-discriminatory nature. It would be good for the Minister for

        to remember that from time to time. It's important that we do everything we can to ensure everything we do in this place maintains the integrity of Australia's migration program.
       </p>
       <p>
        Regrettably, as some media reports have indicated, there are some unscrupulous migration agents who have exploited vulnerable people trying to obtain visas. This is completely unacceptable. These people are very vulnerable. They should not be treated this way, nor should their families. It's incumbent on the Turnbull government to investigate every complaint and take appropriate action to protect would-be migrants and their families who are already in Australia. People who are offering migration advice, such as migration agentsâ€”
