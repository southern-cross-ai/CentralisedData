        ‘We must hold ourselves in readiness for God’s will, whichever way things go.’ Those words were uttered 110 years ago by Sister Mary

        , for whom the Ballajura Catholic church is named, as is the Mary MacKillop Catholic Community Primary School. Soon Australia will have its first saint recognised, and I look forward to that day.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mary MacKillop was born in Fitzroy in 1842, the eldest of eight children. Her family continually struggled, as her father was not very financially aware. Mary MacKillop commenced working from 16 and was responsible for the financial support of her family. She worked as a clerk, a teacher and a governess. It was during her time as a governess at Penola, a town in country

        </a>
        , that Mary met Father Julian Tenison-Woods. Father Woods sought Mary’s assistance in providing children in the outback with religious education. However, because of her family’s reliance on her wages, it was not until 1866 that she was able to officially open the first St Joseph’s school.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mary had been inspired by Father Woods. Her faith and her religious conviction then attracted other young women to join her.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Congregation" rel="nofollow">
         The Congregation

        </a>
        was begun. The next year, 1867, Bishop Shiel asked Mary to open a second school, this time in Adelaide.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sisters" rel="nofollow">
         The Sisters
        </a>
        of St Joseph then expanded beyond the second school and created more schools in outback communities and in the larger cities around Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mary MacKillop had a significant impact on Catholic education that originated in those years. Beyond the schools, her dedication to those in difficult circumstances resulted in her founding homes for the homeless and destitute, as well as orphanages, refuges for former prostitutes and refuges for former prisoners.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is clear that Mother Mary did experience resistance and opposition to her work. Strengthened by her faith, she endured those trials with forgiveness. She did, however, suffer from ill-health, which made her work even more challenging and her results remarkable. The hundredth anniversary of her death was last Saturday, and on that occasion I was honoured to join the congregation of the Blessed Mary MacKillop Catholic Church at Ballajura for a commemorative service led by Father John Jegerow.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is worth understanding that with the beatification of Mary MacKillop in 1995 and the conferring of the title Blessed, that event represents that her first miracle was recognised. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_in_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Catholic Church in Australia
        </a>
        and around the world waits with great anticipation for an announcement that canonisation will be granted to Mary MacKillop, meaning that a second miracle will have been recognised. Canonisation in this case represents the conferring of the title Saint. Australia will then have its first saint,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary_MacKillop" rel="nofollow">
         St Mary MacKillop
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        It is my belief that when Mary MacKillop is recognised as a saint she will be an even greater inspiration to Catholics across Australia. It will cause the Catholic church in Ballajura to change its name, possibly to St Mary MacKillop Catholic Church, and the primary school will have to rename itself St Mary MacKillop Catholic Community Primary School. I am sure that no-one will mind such changes in Ballajura, and rightly so. There will perhaps be even more pride in the community than there already is.
       </p>
       <p>
        It would, however, be wrong not to emphasise that the work of Mary MacKillop had a very positive influence on Australia at that time and continues to do so, through the generations that have benefited. What she did and her dedication toward helping others is a great example of an Australian spirit that continues. She was a shining example of commitment toward helping and protecting those in circumstances of adversity. That example is not just for Catholics or Christians but for all Australians. Her canonisation will create greater profile and reflection on her work. Her example of dedication and selflessness is an example that all should follow, and canonisation will help to highlight her example both now and for future Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will conclude where I started by saying that I very much look forward to the recognition of a great lady being acknowledged as a saint very soon, and a saint for Australia.
