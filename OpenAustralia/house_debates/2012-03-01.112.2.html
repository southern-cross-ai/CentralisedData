        I rise to table a petition, which has gone through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Standing Committee
        </a>
        on Petitions, on behalf of the aggrieved people of my electorate regarding the recent closure of over-the-counter services at the Chapple Street Post Office in Gladstone. A rather large number of people in the area, 1,676 to be exact, found reason to support this cause by signing the petition exercising their democratic rights by registering their objections to this very short-sighted decision by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Post
        </a>
        . The stealth attack by Australia Post was made during the Christmas period, when the public eye was focused on other things.
       </p>
       <p>
        The petition against the closure was supported by every level of government: the Gladstone Regional Council Mayor, Gail Sellers; the state member for Gladstone,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Cunningham" rel="nofollow">
         Liz Cunningham
        </a>
        ; and me. All levels of government in Gladstone opposed this decision because we recognise the rapid growth occurring in the city, the importance this service has provided and the impact this decision has had on other post offices in the area. In correspondence dated 22 December 2011 the shadow minister, the member for Wentworth, sought through the minister advice from Australia Post as to which outlets had been under review. To date this request has not been responded to. The correspondence also stated:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The fact that I have been unable to obtain the full list of retail outlets affected by Australia Post's review highlights the unsatisfactory level of consultation and disregard for the dramatic effect closing a local Australia Post outlet can have on the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        In conjunction with the petition, I wrote to both Australia Post and the minister for communications. Both Australia Post and the minister's office were of little use to me as they were unable to provide me with what could only be described as a pathetic excuse. Unfortunately, the minister's response to my inquiry came after the closure had occurred, which only brought me to the conclusion that the communication minister appears to be a poor communicator. My office continues to receive correspondence regarding the closure and the impact it is having on businesses and services at other post offices. I sincerely hope that, as a result of tabling this petition, we are able to reverse this poor decision and return the post office to its original status.

        This petition of Residents and Citizens of Gladstone and District, Queensland draws to the attention of the House the unsatisfactory closure of the over-the-counter facilities at Chapple Street Post Office and Business Centre which is an indispensable regional service provided to Gladstone residents and businesses and the rapidly growing Gladstone region.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We therefore ask the House to ensure that the over-the-counter facilities at the Chapple Street Post Office and Business Centre remain open and accessible to Gladstone residents.
