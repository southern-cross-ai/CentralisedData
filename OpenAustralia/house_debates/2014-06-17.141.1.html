       <p>
        I rise today to acknowledge some truly remarkable Australians who have contributed much to the Lindsay community and have, rightly so, been formally acknowledged for their service in this year's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Birthday_Honours" rel="nofollow">
         Queen's Birthday Honours
        </a>
        list. Awarded an AM was the dynamic and inspirational
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Brennan" rel="nofollow">
         Paul Brennan
        </a>
        , recognised for his service to business and commerce through his role as general manager of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP" rel="nofollow">
         ASP
        </a>
        Healthcare. Paul has spearheaded a business that has pioneered a specialised safe container for the disposal of used needles and syringes. Further, Paul has been commercialising this successful technology and now exports these containers to the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        and France. Paul is also Chairman of the Penrith Business Alliance and a board member of the Nepean-Blue Mountains Medicare Local.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge the service of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Gould" rel="nofollow">
         Phil Gould
        </a>
        , who was awarded an AM for his service to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_League" rel="nofollow">
         Rugby League
        </a>
        . Phil's involvement in sport at elite levels spans nearly four decades, as an administrator, commentator, coach and player. Phil was the youngest captain-coach of the mighty Panthers and in 1990 led the team to its first ever grand final. In 1991 he delivered us our first premiership. His skills off the playing field are just as impressive as his skills on the field, as a commentator for Channel 9 and the Fairfax media. It is no coincidence the Panthers got to the top of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRL" rel="nofollow">
         NRL
        </a>
        ladder with Phil's return to the foot of the mountains as Penrith Rugby League's general manager.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        was the Reverend Dr Kenneth Chant of Werrington. I would like to recognise here today the parliamentary chaplain as well. Reverend Chant was recognised for his service to education and theological education. Reverend Chant founded the Vision Christian College for Australia in 1974 and is its current president. The college is an international and interdenominational Bible correspondence school which services over 100,000 students across 145 nations through its internet based Bible college programs and 4,000 local church campuses.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge Panthers chairman Don Feltis, who was also awarded an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Australia_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Order of Australia Medal
        </a>

        </a>
        and the Panthers on the Prowl since 2009.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchard_Hills" rel="nofollow">
         Orchard Hills
        </a>
        , which is home to

         Public Service Medal
        </a>
        for his astounding service to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Police_Force" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales Police Force
        </a>
        . Mr Nicholson joined the New South Wales Police Force in 1970 and is widely recognised as a person of impeccable character and integrity. Peter has dedicated countless hours of his personal time to support colleagues, offering encouragement, compassion and empathy during some very difficult times.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to congratulate all these remarkable men for the services they have provided our community. May they continue to build a wonderful community in Lindsay.
