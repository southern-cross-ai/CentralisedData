        election, the Henderson Labor team are becoming as desperate as the Gillard Labor government and will do anything and say anything to stay in power. Territorians are well aware that the Henderson Labor team, aka Territory Labor, are spinning out of control.

        In recent days we have seen them spinning the truth again. This time it is about their record on crime. No amount of spin from the Henderson Labor team can change the fact that crime is increasing in the Northern Territory. In today's

        I would like to add a few more mistakes to the list: firstly, that Chief Minister Paul Henderson, leader of the Henderson Labor team, stood next to Prime Minister Julia Gillard when she closed down the live cattle export industry. This has no doubt affected our relationship with Indonesia but it has certainly affected the livelihoods of many, many Territorians. Then there is the Montara oil spill, one of Australia's worst oil spills on record.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Henderson Labor government's failure on housing speaks for itself. How can anyone forget that, under the Henderson-Rudd Labor government, $672 million was spent on the SIHIP project which delivered two houses in two years? There is no doubt that the only way to stop four more years of a hard Labor government and putting up with their lies and mismanagement is to vote for your local Country Liberals representative. It is time for a change: Territorians cannot afford another four years of Labor.
