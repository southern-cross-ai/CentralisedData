        My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. Minister, how will the secure jobs, better pay bill help address cost-of-living pressures for working Australians by getting wages moving again?

         I thank the member for Paterson for her commitment to working people in her electorate. It's interesting that those opposite, when they want to talk about the cost of living, will never talk about how money gets into your bank account in the first place. They will never talk about what happens in terms of wages in this country. The secure jobs, better pay bill will get wages moving again, and that's why those opposite oppose it. If you put gender equality as an objective of the award system in Australia, that helps get wages moving in this country. If you improve how the Fair Work Commission considers equal remuneration and work value cases, that helps get wages moving in this country. If you ban pay secrecy clauses, that helps get wages moving in this country.

           If you give the Fair Work Commission the expertise to be able to better determine pay equity cases, that helps get wages moving in this country. If you get rid of zombie agreements, where people are still on the same agreements that they were on when

           was Prime Minister of this country, then that helps get wages moving in this country. If you simplify the better off overall test to make sure that it's fair, to make sure that no worker can be worse off, that helps get wages moving in this country. If you open up bargaining, which delivers flexibility and productivity for business while at the same time delivering pay increases for workers, that's going to help get wages moving in this country. If you ban job ads—make it unlawful to advertise a job ad—for less than the legal minimum, then that helps get wages moving in this country.

           But we know from the shadow Treasurer that that in fact is their problem with this bill. The shadow Treasurer knows, as he answered when asked by Laura Jayes about multiemployer bargaining, 'Well, it pushes up wages.'

               a similar question was asked of the Leader of the Opposition, where the Leader of the Opposition was asked whether he had concerns about proposed changes to the industrial relations laws. He began by saying he was 'deeply concerned for businesses', and then he went on to mention why:
