       <p>
        I rise to speak about the Abbott government's continued assault on rural and regional communities in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McEwen" rel="nofollow">
         McEwen

        . Regional towns are hit hard by the actions—and inaction—of this government, and those sitting over there should hang their heads in shame. The impact of their policies has a direct effect on the young people living in regional communities. According to the Brotherhood of St Laurence

         chance,
        </i>
        <i>
         our
        </i>
        <i>
         future
        </i>
        report, youth unemployment has reached a crisis point in regional towns. In McEwen, there are about 25,000 young people in the 18- to 29-year-old age bracket. Youth unemployment is at 20 per cent in towns like Seymour, Kilmore and Broadford. It is the fifth worst in Australia. These are good towns, with decent people.
       </p>
       <p>
        And what did this government do? It ripped the guts out of services and programs that help these young people to find jobs. Since its election, the Abbott 'opposition' government has been systematically tearing down job opportunities in regional Australia. Unless you are a mining magnate, this government is not interested in building prosperity and futures for our regional communities. It is not interested in growing towns and communities and building economic growth across the nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The results are clear. Unemployment was 5.7 per cent when this government came to office. It peaked at 5.9 per cent during the global financial crisis. Now it is at 6.2 per cent. Unemployment is now higher now than it was during the global financial crisis. People know this government is a failure when the flailing Treasurer bellows about his great work. This government has failed regional Australia, and regional Australia knows it. Labor knows investing in regional Australia is critically important for local communities, not just for the facilities—
