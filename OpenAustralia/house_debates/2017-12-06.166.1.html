        In this place we often witness combat of gladiatorial proportions, none more so than the recent battle over the origin of the Chiko Roll, famously fought out between the members for Calare, Riverina and Bendigo. But there is a great Aussie product whose heritage is not in doubt, and that's Milo. Milo was founded, discovered and developed in Smithtown in my electorate, and I was delighted to attend, with state member

        . That exhibition details the history of Milo and the Nestle factory in Smithtown since its beginnings in 1934, and it includes sporting memorabilia, historical photographs, technical equipment, packaging and posters. I think almost every member and senator in this place would be a Milo kid. This was a fantastic local exhibition, and it tells the story of Milo and how it developed in the Macleay Valley.

        Milo was invented during the Depression in the early thirties by Nestle's Thomas Mayne to help ensure that children received enough nutrients in their daily diet. The Smithtown Dairy Company factory opened in 1897 and started producing Milo in 1934. Generations of Smithtown families have worked in the factory, which currently employs 171 locals. The factory's quarter-century club has 101 members, 23 of whom are current employees.

        , the factory manager, said, 'The local community and its people have been critical in the success of the Smithtown site, and similarly the company has played an important role in sustaining the local community.' I would like to thank all those associated with the Milo exhibition at the Slim Dusty Centre, as well as to acknowledge the community of Smithtown and the workers at the

        factory for their part in creating our region's manufacturing history. I'd like to commend Slim Dusty Centre staff member Julia Morell and Slim Dusty Centre volunteer Shirley Kennedy, and Nestle staff including: Mathew Oram, the manager; Tania Garrett; Ravi Anand; Shalini Devi; Amy O'Brien; Janell Siek; Isla Christian; Kelvin Yong; Peter Gambrill; Sandy Fink and his family; and

        . They are great locals who've worked hard to produce a great local product. Milo is an Australian success story; it is our number one branded food export to the world. I'd certainly say that everyone in this room would love to have a Milo. I always like the crunchy bits on top!
