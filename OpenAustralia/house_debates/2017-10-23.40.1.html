        Last Friday, a remarkable woman left this world. Deborah Margaret Walsh lived a good life that was not long enough, but her years on this earth were full of love, determination and passion. Deb Walsh was a tower of strength and love that stood alongside
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Gray" rel="nofollow">
         Gary Gray
        </a>
        and enabled his career serving the Labor Party, the community of Brand, the state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        , this parliament and this nation. The nation owes her a debt for sharing her husband and, indeed, her father with us for so long. The last time I saw Deb, which, sadly, wasn't that long ago, we laughed, chatted and embraced on the Rockingham foreshore at a marriage equality rally. She fought for equality to the end. The three young men who are her sons must always remember this. I know that Riley, Darcy and Toby are very proud of their wonderful mother and her love will live on in them.

        If you knew Deb Walsh, you knew there was no escaping a good argument or exceptional food when she was hosting another cracking party for Gary's team. She always welcomed Gary's staff, made us feel at home in their home and made us feel part of her wonderful family. For so many of her friends and family, our world is diminished with her no longer in it, but our world was so much better for having had the chance to share it for a little while with Deb Walsh. Our thoughts are with Deb's family, her sons, her sisters, her nieces, her nephews, her lovely mother, Rosalie Walsh, and especially her best friend, husband and great love, Gary Gray. Vale, Deb Walsh, we will miss you.
