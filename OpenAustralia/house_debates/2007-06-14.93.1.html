       <p>
        I would like to commend the people of the electorate of Fisher and its surrounding areas for their very strong support for the substantial number of agricultural shows held each year in and around the electorate. These agricultural shows are a success because of the way that local people become involved to showcase the produce of their local communities. They are also a wonderful opportunity for the community to work together and to have sporting and equestrian events and for local farmers to show the quality of their cattle and so on.
       </p>
       <p>
        Somewhat differently from the large city shows, the small agricultural shows in country areas very much revolve around volunteer labour. Often you find that the people who are displaying the produce are the people who are taking the money at the gate. I think we need to encourage as many people as possible to support agricultural shows, because they are a wonderful opportunity for a community to have a window to the world. Our agricultural shows have, of course, been affected to a greater or lesser extent by drought. I am fortunate that the area I am privileged to represent has had substantial rain, to the extent that the Caloundra City Annual Show at Maleny was virtually rained out on the second day of the show, held only a couple of weeks ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        The local shows in and around the Fisher electorate include the Kilcoy show, the Caloundra City Show at Maleny, the Caboolture show this weekend just gone, the Sunshine Coast Show at Nambour this coming weekend and the Woodford show on 21 and 22 June. All of these shows provide entertainment for local families and also help to recognise, and as a community enable us to value, the work of our farmers.
       </p>

        Interesting things happen to members of parliament at shows. At shows I have had numerous opportunities to do things I do not do very well and this year I was invited to be one of the competitors in the milking competition. Not actually having been brought up on a farm, I must say the Ayrshire cow allocated to me was in no mood to have her udder emptied by a stranger and it took three people to hold her still. Even while I managed to get a late start, the event was all over before I could prove my milking skills, and the Caloundra City Mayor, Don Aldous, had claimed a victory. I am ashamed to say that I was actually disqualified.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the Caboolture show over the weekend I was able to reforge some acquaintances with people who have returned to the electorate of Fisher. Let me say that shows give all residents, young and old, the opportunity to be reminded of the importance of farms and rural communities and the sense of community spirit that is so important.
