        I rise today to speak about Mr Tadashi Yamamoto, who, sadly, passed away on 15 April this year at the age of 76. Mr Yamamoto was born on 11 March 1936 in Tokyo. He initially studied at Rokko Senior High School before transferring to Komaba High School, from which he graduated in 1953. He attended
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_University" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        in Tokyo, where he studied philosophy, and then continued his undergraduate education at St Norbert College in Wisconsin and received a Master of

        </a>
        , Wisconsin, in 1962. In 1966, he married Chiyoko Aikawa, and in the following years they had four sons and later eight grandchildren.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Yamamoto was the founder and President of the Japan Centre for International Exchange, JCIE, a non-government, not-for-profit organisation founded to develop and encourage Japan's contribution to the international community and communication between non-government leaders in different countries. The founding of this organisation was considered a revolutionary concept in Japan at the time. Described as a catalyst for and a facilitator of exchange for a better society and world through communication, cooperation and friendship, Mr Yamamoto dedicated his life to strengthening Japan's international relations and addressing global challenges using non-governmental foreign exchange programs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Yamamoto achieved a great deal during his 40 years as president of JCIE. I would particularly like to note his many initiatives to promote and support exchange programs for young political leaders. His philanthropy in this area had a direct influence in Australia. In 1992, JCIE entered into an exchange partnership with the Australian Political Exchange Council to provide learning experiences and developmental opportunities through regular exchanges. It is for Japanese and Australian young political leaders. From the outset, the exchanges were viewed by participants as highly valued opportunities to gain an in-depth understanding of the host country and particularly its political system. This program has also made possible and fostered communication, understanding and friendship between young leaders of Australia and Japan.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Yamamoto and his staff at JCIE have sponsored 11 delegations of Japanese young political leaders to Australia since 1992 and have hosted 19 delegations for Japan. JCIE has also conducted a young political leaders exchange program with the

        . Mr Yamamoto made an enormous contribution to international relations in Japan. He facilitated an increased understanding and trust between nations with his strong belief in common humanity. He was a world ambassador and was regarded by many to be a true internationalist.

         I also rise to pay tribute to Mr Tadashi Yamamoto, who was a visionary leader in Japan and dedicated his life to building and improving communications channels for a better world. Australia was the beneficiary of his dedication, and Mr Yamamoto's particular support for young political leaders was to our benefit. Mr Yamamoto founded the Japan Centre for International Exchange in 1970 and in 1992 that organisation entered into an exchange program with Australia's
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APEC" rel="nofollow">
          APEC
         </a>
         program. These regular exchanges provide valuable opportunities for Australia's young political leaders to experience firsthand the political system in Japan and to strengthen international ties with that nation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since 1992 there have been 11 Japanese delegations to Australia and 19 from Australia to Japan. These could not have occurred without the deep commitment to the program of Mr Yamamoto and his staff at JCIE. There are many current and former members of parliament in Australia who have benefited greatly from this exchange program, including the Hon. Andrew Robb AO MP, shadow minister for finance, deregulation and debt reduction; Christopher Pyne MP, Manager of Opposition Business in the House of Representatives; the Hon.

         Tadashi Yamamoto's contribution to the Australia-Japan relationship was recognised in 2003 when he was appointed an Honorary Officer of the General Division of the Order of Australia. His citation was 'in recognition of his philanthropic support and initiative in relation to the Japan-Australia young political leaders exchange program'. Tadashi Yamamoto was influential in the conduct of political leaders exchange programs with other countries, including the United States.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mr Yamamoto was an inspired leader whose significant contribution to strengthening ties of humanity across borders will be sorely missed. On behalf of the Australian Political Exchange Council, I extend my deepest sympathy to his family, including his sons, Taro, Saburo, Shiro and Jiro and his eight grandchildren, as well as the staff of the Japan Centre for International Exchange.
