       <p>
        My question is to the Treasurer. The Stronger Communities Program provides small but significant grants for all electorates. We all know how such funds can help our local community organisations with their small projects, such as having their community hall repaired for people to use. In these difficult economic times and in low-socioeconomic electorates like Fowler, this type of resource is vital. Will the government commit to ensure this grant will continue to be provided in future budget planning?

         Mr Speaker, I acknowledge

         as well. I thank the member for Fowler for her question about the Stronger Communities grants. As the honourable member and probably all members would be aware, round 8 of the Stronger Communities Program is rolling out right now in our communities. Members of parliament and community groups will be hearing back around now about the success or otherwise of the proposals they have put forward.
        </p>
        <p>
         Round 8 was announced in the March budget of 2022, the last budget under those opposite, but the budget didn't pass the parliament. So what we did—I pay tribute to my ministerial colleague—was to budget for round 8 in the October budget last year, and that's why it's rolling out right now. The matter of future rounds of Stronger Communities will be the subject, no doubt, of future budget deliberations, but there was no allocation for Stronger Communities beyond round 8. Obviously, in the usual responsible and methodical way, we will go through the merits of this, and we will make a decision in due course.

          I hear those opposite

          . If they wanted it to go beyond round 8, why didn't they budget for it? Why didn't they budget for it? There is a pattern of behaviour here. They make big announcements about how they were going to chip in 50 per cent of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_Olympic" rel="nofollow">
           Brisbane Olympic
          </a>
          funding, and they provisioned exactly zero dollars for it. There is a pattern of behaviour. They were really good at the press release, but they weren't much chop at provisioning in the budget for the things that they announced, and that's the case for Stronger Communities as well.
         </p>
         <p>
          I know that the honourable member for Fowler has asked this question in good faith. I know that she has also asked about cost-of-living pressures on her community in Fowler, that really important community in

           New South Wales
          </a>
          . I wanted to tell the House as well that in addition to deliberating on future rounds of the Stronger Communities grants, when it comes to the cost-of-living assistance we're providing in Fowler, 39,150 people in Fowler will benefit from cheaper medicines; 95,485 people in Fowler are eligible for the bulk billing assistance; 14,840 people in Fowler will get the increase to JobSeeker, Austudy or youth allowance; 725 people aged 55 to 59 in Fowler will get the extra JobSeeker—
