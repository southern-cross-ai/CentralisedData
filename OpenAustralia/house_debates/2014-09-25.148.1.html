       <p>
        Broome is open for business—to quote the local Broomites. Durack boasts the unique town of Broome, situated on the west coast of the Kimberley in Australia's north-west. Over the years, it has become not only one of mine but one of Australia's and international visitors most favoured holiday destinations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Broome is a popular starting point for people looking to get away from it all with its sweeping white beaches, blazing rich red outcrops and turquoise water. And for the more adventurous, Broome is a well-known angler's paradise.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, 16,000 residents call Broome home. Although, from April to October, during the dry season, it sees an influx of up to 45,000 tourists per month.
       </p>
       <p>
        Broome was established in the late 1800s based on the pearling industry which started with the harvest of oysters for mother of pearl. Nowadays, cultured pearl farming enterprises are a thriving industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Broome is a multicultural community, bringing together a variety of European and Indigenous groups. It is quite a unique town. Every year Broome celebrates this union in an annual festival called Shinju Matsuri, which in Japanese means 'festival of the pearl,' and celebrates Broome's Asian influence.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently Broome was announced as the winner of the 2014 Top Tourism Award, hosted by

        2013, the town of Broome suffered an enormous setback when Woodside did not proceed with the James Price Point onshore gas project, which from a Broome perspective unfortunately went to Darwin, leaving locals who had anticipated major growth in the lurch. But notwithstanding this disappointment, the business community has since strengthened its economy.   We have seen an increase in live cattle exports from the port; and the port is supporting many new offshore projects and becoming a very important supply base. Already space is at a premium at the port, and further investment is needed to fill its potential
       </p>
       <p>
        We have heard that local business, Broome Air Services, is going to invest $20 million at the airport in new facilities. This is good news for the region more broadly.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are also seeing further planned investment. There is an industrial project costing $5l million with construction set to commence on the new Broome Road industrial area mid-2015. This project presents potential for 40 new businesses with 900 employees. The nearby Broome North residential development will provide homes for more than 13,000 people. Both these projects are going to support Broome's future growth.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, like many communities, Broome suffers from social problems. It is heartbreaking to know that even in a paradise such as Broome there are children who go without basics such as food. Feed the

        is one of the good Samaritans in the Broome community lending a hand to those who are socially disadvantaged. It is a charity that relies on volunteers and on the kindness of donations. Feed the Little Children supports disadvantaged children by providing 300 meals on two nights per week all year round with a goal of providing meals seven nights a week.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased that the federal government is also making a valuable contribution to Broome. On 24 July, I had the pleasure of hosting the Deputy Prime Minister, the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Truss" rel="nofollow">

        , in Broome to announce the federal government's funding commitments of $550,000 the Broome Volunteer Sea Rescue headquarters and vessel project and $2.7 million to be invested in a new

        base to be located at Broome airport. Both of these are significant contributions by the federal government for the safety of the Broome and the Kimberley community more broadly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tourism, however, in Broome has suffered a little of late, but I am confident that it will once again be regarded as a premium tourism destination for Australian and overseas visitors. So tell your colleagues and your contacts that Broome not only is open for business but is still a fabulous tourist destination.
