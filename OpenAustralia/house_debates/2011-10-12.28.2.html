        Scottsdale facility is vital for maintaining the nutritional and health status of Australian troops because it provides food and feeding regimes that enhance performance.
       </p>
       <p>
        The works will include redevelopment of food technology facilities, upgrades to existing chemistry and nutrition laboratories and improvements to site infrastructure and working areas. The redevelopment will result in a modern food science facility equipped to meet the future nutritional needs of ADF personnel. The estimated out-turned cost of the proposal is $18.7 million plus GST.
       </p>
       <p>
        In its report, in addition to recommending that the project should proceed, the Public Works Committee has recommended that the Department of Defence provide full and complete details on all options considered for all future proposals. The Department of Defence accepts in principle this recommendation and intends to address the issue by updating internal procedures to ensure further details of options considered during business case development are provided to the committee as part of the statement of evidence. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction will commence in early 2012 and be completed by early 2014. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House.
