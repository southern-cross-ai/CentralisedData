        once said that 'necessity may well be called the mother of invention but calamity is the test of integrity'. It has been a tough year for the people of Blair, which contains all the Somerset region and most of Ipswich. Small to medium businesses and agribusinesses in Ipswich and across the Somerset region have already faced the challenges of a two-speed economy, the global financial crisis and then the devastation of the floods earlier this year. This morning I want to highlight the impact we have made in developing and supporting our businesses in Blair, demonstrating the true mettle and integrity of those who have survived these calamities. The federally funded Business Enterprise Centre Ipswich Region in its current guise is three years old and is managed successfully by Tony Axford. It has proved to be a dynamic institution, networking closely with the Ipswich Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the

        </a>
        , particularly in its very successful 'Shop Ipswich' campaign.

        During those three years of the BEC Ipswich Region we have seen great progress. The BEC Ipswich Region has been recognised by Westpac for outstanding community support, by Economic Development Australia for outstanding contribution to the small business community and by the Business Enterprise Centre Australia as the best regional BEC in 2011, with Tony Axford being awarded the best national BEC manager for 2011. Tony also received the inaugural BEC service award in 2011 in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the business community in response to a major crisis event. Earlier this year it was recognised by the

        </a>
        , with the Queensland Disaster Hero award for contribution to the community during the January 2011 floods. During the past year, BEC
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IR" rel="nofollow">
         IR
        </a>
        has assisted 1,424 businesses in the region, held workshops with 1,278 participants and networked functions with 2,668 attendees. Tony once said, 'If the business community works together as a team, great things can be accomplished.'
       </p>

        Meanwhile, the rural and semirural regional area known as Somerset is well served by the Somerset Region Business Alliance, led by Bob Whalley as chairperson and Paul Heymans as his deputy, which has cemented itself in the community. I pay tribute particularly to Paul Heymans, an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT" rel="nofollow">
         IT
        </a>
        specialist, who used the group's internet resources well during the floods earlier this year. The group was successful, like BEC IR, in obtaining $100,000 under the Small Business Advisory Services natural disaster program. It established a 'Buy Local' campaign and organised regular events for its members. I also want to pay tribute to the inaugural Somerset Expo. This year over 7,000 attended the display, which promoted tourism, economic development and prosperity in Somerset. I was pleased to be there running a mobile office and speaking at the event. I am proud to say that the businesses of Blair have demonstrated true grit, determination and mettleâ€”working together, funded and supported by the federal and state Labor governments to build and support stronger communities.
