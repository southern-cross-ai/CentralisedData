        A huge cheer erupted across Ipswich when the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Cup" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , defeating minor premiers the Townsville Blackhawks 32 to 20 at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lang_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Lang Park
        </a>
        . To put that victory into context, the Blackhawks had 582 games of NRL experience to Ipswich's six, and the Jets had to win five games in a row just to reach the final. But they did, playing with their trademark style—audacious, attacking flair, with short kick-offs, jinking runs and offloads aplenty. You take your heart into your mouth when you support the Ipswich Jets. With an attack built on an uncompromising and underrated defence, the Ipswich Jets had their best season in 33 years of history.

        boys took Ipswich from the bottom of the table to being the best team outside the NRL in rugby league. It goes to show that the NRL should support the western corridor bid of Ipswich, supported by Logan and Toowoomba, for an NRL licence. The Walker boys brought discipline to the Jets, together with an unconventional playing philosophy. If you have seen the Ipswich Jets play, you know there is no rugby league team like them, and commentators on the day at Stadium Australia made that point repeatedly.

        However, style can take you only so far. Luckily, the Jets are blessed with talented players across the team, including courageous captain

        , with his wonderful executive offsider, Nicole McPhee, with a fine board. Credit goes to Mark, Johno, Chris and Sandy. I want to make a special mention of a person that has done just about everything for the Ipswich Jets—Jim Landy. He has been a board member, secretary of the club, manager and coach over the years, and his wonderful wife Dot, who is always there on game day. No-one cheers more loudly for the Ipswich Jets than Dot. Thank you also to team assistant Freddie, who is always there to help in any way, shape or form.
