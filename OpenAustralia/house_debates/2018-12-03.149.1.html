       <p>
        'Tis that time of year again when I tell a Christmas tale;
       </p>
       <p>
        About the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        's turmoils, desperation and endless fails.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year it wasn't hard, which story to choose;
       </p>
       <p>
        Because we have a Prime Minister who is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebenezer_Scrooge" rel="nofollow">
         Ebenezer Scrooge
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Before every LNP budget, former Treasurer Scott Morrison sat in his ivory tower;
       </p>
       <p>
        Counting his dollars with an unyielding power.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian people would beg for some investment in jobs, health, action on energy and education;
       </p>
       <p>
        But Treasurer Morrison would always refuse and give nothing but cuts and privatisation!
       </p>
       <p>
        Treasurer Morrison has been the architect of every single cut;
       </p>
       <p>
        For he has put my home town, Townsville, in its current rut.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just like the Ebenezer Scrooge's worker Fred, my home town has been left begging;
       </p>
       <p>
        Workers, families, veterans and pensioners doing nothing but fretting;
       </p>
       <p>
        About how, under the LNP, the local retail worker is receiving a pay cut;
       </p>
       <p>
        And now, due to no action on energy, local businesses are now shut.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are people choosing between medical visits and paying electricity bills;
       </p>
       <p>
        And our pensioners cannot afford to pay for their pills!
       </p>
       <p>
        Prime Minister Morrison has made massive cuts to education and health;
       </p>
       <p>
        All whilst trying to privatise Medicare by stealth.
       </p>
       <p>
        Townsville's unemployment under Prime Minister Morrison has almost doubled;
       </p>
       <p>
        A fact that doesn't seem to make the LNP troubled.
       </p>
       <p>
        For Prime Minister Morrison has been giving taxpayer dollars to the top end of town;
       </p>
       <p>
        At the expense of Townsville's jobs, workers and families—keeping us all down.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just like the plot out of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Dickens" rel="nofollow">
         Charles Dickens
        </a>
        story;
       </p>
       <p>
        Ghosts from the LNP past are coming out of purgatory.
       </p>
       <p>
        Former Prime Minister Abbott has risen—the ghost of LNP past;
       </p>
       <p>
        He's back to wreak havoc—and fast!
       </p>
       <p>
        Then there is former Prime Minister Turnbull who is the LNP's ghost of present;
       </p>
       <p>
        With his anger and disgust for the LNP—I share his sentiment.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the ghost of present, Prime Minister Turnbull, is ringing bells, loudly and true;
       </p>
       <p>
        That led to the landslide victory in Victoria, leaving the LNP black and blue.
       </p>
       <p>
        All of these ghosts are putting their own self-interest first;
       </p>
       <p>
        At the expense of regional workers, and only making things worse.
       </p>
       <p>
        The ghost of yet-to-come has not arrived yet;
       </p>
       <p>
        But allow me to guess and make $100 bet.
       </p>
       <p>
        The ghost of yet-to-come won't be one ghost but millions;
       </p>
       <p>
        For Prime Minister Morrison's future will be decided by Australian civilians.
       </p>
       <p>
        And on election day, the ghosts who have received the brunt of Prime Minister Morrison's cuts;
       </p>
       <p>
        Who have received nothing from the LNP government but peanuts;
       </p>
       <p>
        They will ensure that every one of their votes count;
       </p>
       <p>
        By voting out Prime Minister Morrison and holding him to account.
       </p>
       <p>
        For Townsville will remember all of the cuts to jobs and to health;
       </p>
       <p>
        And how our taxpayer dollars go to those with incredible wealth.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the next election, Prime Minister Morrison will have hard lessons to learn;
       </p>
       <p>
        About how he can't create Townsville's largest economic downturn.
       </p>
       <p>
        And when you are the person responsible for huge job loss;
       </p>
       <p>
        The people of Townsville are going to give you the toss!
       </p>
