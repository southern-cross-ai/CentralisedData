         I thank the member for Herbert for his question. Two and a half weeks ago the Australian government, recognising the instability in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
          East Timor
         </a>
         , prepositioned its Defence Force and, when the request formally came from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timorese" rel="nofollow">
          East Timorese
         </a>
         government to provide military assistance to bring peace and stability to the country, we responded alongside Malaysia and also Portugal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealand
         </a>
         . At the moment there are 1,300
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         personnel directly on the ground in East Timor. There are 2,000 in the total region of East Timor supporting this deployment and another 1,000 supporting it from here in Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         At the moment the key areas of infrastructure have been secured, particularly the airport, the wharf, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations

         compound and also the police headquarters. In the last 24 hours more than 200 weapons have been removed from people on the streets. These are predominantly young criminal thugs and people who are taking advantage of an environment of lawlessness.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a military sense, it is important that Australians understand that the East Timorese army has returned willingly to its barracks. As we speak today, the East Timorese police members are returning to their academy and also to their headquarters. Brigadier
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Slater" rel="nofollow">
          Mick Slater
         </a>
         has been in consultation over the last 24 hours with the East Timorese authorities, military police and political authorities with a view to developing and supporting an effective and appropriate policing strategy for East Timor.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is also important that I advise the House that there has been some concern expressed by some aid organisations about their security in providing humanitarian and other support to the East Timorese. It is very important that Australians appreciate that the priorities for Australiaâ€™s Defence Force in East Timor should be determined by Brigadier Mick Slater, who commands our ADF personnel, in consultation with a higher command of Defence. Nonetheless, I have asked the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_the_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Chief of the Defence Force
         </a>
         to ensure that Brigadier Slater and his officers are aware of the needs of aid organisations, in particular that of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Vision" rel="nofollow">
          World Vision
         </a>
         and its chairman, Reverend Tim Costello, in discharging their responsibilities. In that regard, I encourage all Australians to support not only World Vision,
