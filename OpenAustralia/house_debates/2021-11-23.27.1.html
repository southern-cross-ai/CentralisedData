        On 18 November, the Prime Minister demanded that states drop COVID-19 vaccination mandates. Now it's time for governments to step back and for Australians to take their lives back, the Prime Minister said. Quite possibly the dumbest and most irresponsible thing that this Prime Minister has said, and that's saying something! Since the Prime Minister made his comments, vaccination rates in Australia have fallen off a cliff. On November 17, 136,434 Australians were vaccinated. Yesterday, that number dropped to 23,360. The Prime Minister's comments were aimed at the Queensland government. What's been the effect on vaccination rates in Queensland? The day before the Prime Minister's comments, 47,346 Queenslanders were vaccinated. Yesterday, a mere 5,956. The Prime Minister's irresponsible comments have resulted in dramatic falls in Australia's vaccination rates. The Prime Minister's comments will result in further delays of state borders being opened. The Prime Minister's comments also risk the health and safety of Australians. So those Australians that are looking forward to a holiday in the coming months or a family reunion, if it's delayed, if the borders remain closed, there's one person they can thank for that, and that's their Prime Minister.
