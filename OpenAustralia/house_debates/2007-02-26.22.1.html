        Last week I had the privilege of chairing the judging panel for the Lions Youth of the Year contest. This is an annual contest hosted by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Palm Beach
        </a>
        -Currumbin Lions Club, and this is the third year I have chaired the judging panel. I was assisted by Mr Barry Ferris, a retired school principal, and Ms Maureen Saunders, from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Australia_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         National Australia Bank
        </a>
        , which sponsors of the competition.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Lions Youth of the Year contest has been held annually since 1964, and its aim is to foster youth development in public speaking. This yearâ€™s participants were of a very high standard, which made the judging very difficult. All four participants were interviewed about local and national topics during the afternoon session, and the evening session consisted of answering two impromptu questions, followed by a five-minute prepared speech in front of parents, friends and members of the local Lions branch.

        I want to congratulate Vanessa Bath from

        on competing in this prestigious event. Each of the participants was a credit to their school and their family. Sadly, there was only one winner. The overall winner was Ms Ella Horton. Ella also took out the public speaking award. Ella will now progress to the zone competition, which will be held on 3 March. I wish her well in her endeavours as she progresses through the competition.

        There is no doubt that the youth of this country are extremely competent when it comes to public speaking, and their awareness and knowledge of current affairs is very high. As judges, we were also impressed with the manner in which they volunteered in a number of roles within their local communities. Our country is in great hands for the future.
