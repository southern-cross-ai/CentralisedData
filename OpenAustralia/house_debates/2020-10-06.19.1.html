       <p>
        [by video link] I too want to thank all those in my community, in Victoria, who are following the rules. Our hard work, our sacrifices, are working. Just two months ago, our community had 942 active cases. As of yesterday, we are down to 32 active cases. So we are winning on the health front. But, behind those health figures, there are people doing it incredibly tough.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over 6,000 businesses and 25,000 workers in my community are reliant on JobKeeper payments. There are 16,000 people in my community who are now on unemployment support payments. That's 10,000 more than last December, the second highest increase for a federal seat in the country. There are 17,000 people in my community on pensions. That's almost 60,000 people in my community who have had their support payments cut by this government in recent weeks. Supporting these people is a test for this Morrison government, who, to be blunt, couldn't find Melbourne's west on a map. It's bad enough that their response to the pandemic was too slow, too reactive and totally uncoordinated; now they're taking away crucial support at a time when people need it the most.
       </p>
       <p>
        So, while the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are smiling in the photo ops today, know that I'll be looking for the follow-up. The budget tonight must address the needs in my community and ensure that the people I represent, and those like them across the country, are not left behind.
