       <p>
        When I talk to people in my electorate, as no doubt many others in this place do, and I ask them about their biggest concern, there's no doubt that the No. 1 issue that comes up time and again is the cost of living. I'm very proud to say that I do have answers for them. I'm proud to say that, thanks to this government, we can provide real answers and some solutions as well. I tell them that we know it's an issue, that everyone understands it's an issue, but we are working on it and we are delivering. Conversations like this in my electorate of Adelaide make me proud, because on this side of politics, in our government, we're not just talking; we're taking action.
       </p>
       <p>
        We're delivering on things that ease the cost of living. We're delivering tax cuts, cheaper child care, affordable medicines, expanded paid parental leave and more accessible housing. All of these things will put more money in people's pockets. We've increased Commonwealth rent assistance by 15 per cent, the biggest hike in three decades, or 30 years. And, of course, we're very proud that the base rates of JobSeeker and other payments have gone up under this Albanese Labor government.
       </p>
       <p>
        We've provided electricity bill rebates for over five million households and one million small businesses. Without the electricity rebates this government has put in place, people would be paying much more for electricity. We have supported over 11.6 million Australians to see a

        without out-of-pocket costs—11.6 million Australians who otherwise would have been out of pocket.
       </p>
       <p>
        We understand the financial strains that Australians are feeling, and that's why we're working on more measures. We know the weight is felt particularly at the cash register—at supermarkets or when you're buying petrol—and when you're paying your electricity bill. On this side of the House the aim is simple: to make Australia fair, whether you're a consumer, a business owner or a farmer. To work towards addressing these issues, this government has initiated a thorough review, led by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
         ACCC
        </a>
        , to examine supermarket pricing. This will be a 12-month inquiry, a significant effort. This isn't just paperwork; it's important. It hasn't been done since 2008. In other words, for the years the other side were in government there was no interest in it.
       </p>
       <p>
        We're making sure that Australian working people's money goes a long way. Aussies deserve a fair go. That's why we're committed to delivering the ACCC's inquiry, which will cover various aspects of the supermarket sector. We've heard stories of price gouging on all sorts of products, and we want to get to the bottom of that. That's why the ACCC has been given the task of inquiring into it. The inquiry will examine the challenges faced by small retailers, especially in regional and remote areas, as well as factors affecting prices along the supply chain and potential obstacles to fair competition. Loyalty programs and third-party discounts will also be examined. We expect to have the ACCC's findings by early 2025.
       </p>
       <p>
        We're committed to ensuring Australian shoppers get a fair deal, and our commitment doesn't stop with the ACCC inquiry. We're also independently reviewing the food and grocery code. This code aims to fix power imbalances and promote fairness in the industry. It aims to regulate business dealings among farmers, suppliers, wholesalers and supermarkets, addressing harmful practices in the grocery sector due to power imbalances. By shielding suppliers and ensuring fair practices, the code aims to prevent issues being passed on to Australian consumers through the supply chain. This review will assess whether the code contributes effectively to the food and grocery industry, as it was intended to do. We want to make sure the food and grocery code safeguards suppliers while contributing to industry growth. Ultimately, we want to make sure the systems we have in place are working, so that if they're not we can do something about it.
       </p>
       <p>
        This government is also investing $1.1 million in CHOICE for quarterly price transparency reports, which may name and shame some of those wholesalers and retailers. It's all about a fair go and an equitable market.
