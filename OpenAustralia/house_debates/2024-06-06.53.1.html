       <p>
        I've always actively reached out to the community of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McPherson" rel="nofollow">
         McPherson
        </a>
        to listen to and best understand their concerns and feedback. Today I'd like to report to the House the top issues that are being raised with me.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let me start with transport. The widening of the M1 is well supported but the work needs to be completed sooner. The light rail remains contentious, with an increasing number of people opposing further extensions beyond the current stage 3 to Burleigh. There's overwhelming support for the extension of heavy rail south from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varsity_Lakes" rel="nofollow">
         Varsity Lakes
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Secondly, development—and specifically overdevelopment—along the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        Highway. Residents are concerned not just about the disruption to their way of life that high-density housing brings but also that the developments are not providing the affordable housing that is so desperately needed right across the Gold Coast.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thirdly, crime. Not a day goes by when there aren't concerns raised by residents about houses being broken into, cars being stolen and people feeling unsafe at shopping centres, walking their dogs and in their own homes. Often these crimes are fuelled by drugs. The criminals are high on drugs or they need money to buy more drugs. Clearly, more work needs to be done at our borders and this means more support for the Australian Border Force and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Fourth is the cost of living. Rising prices are hurting absolutely everyone, from young people trying to get ahead to older members of our community who are struggling to pay their rent, let alone for electricity, food and transport costs.
