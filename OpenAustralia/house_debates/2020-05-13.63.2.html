        My question is to the Minister for Health. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Psychological_Society" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Psychological Society
        </a>
        , headspace and other experts say many Australians will need more than 10 mental health consultations to cope with the flow-on effects of COVID-19. To the government's credit it adopted Labor's suggestion to increase the cap on Medicare mental health services in response to this summer's bushfires. Will it do the same in relation to COVID-19?

        <p>
         One of the things we have done is invest very strongly in health. There has actually been a range of inputs, and I thank the opposition for their input, and I thank all of those who have contributed. In relation to mental health and the coronavirus epidemic in Australia, in particular we've invested $669 million in telehealth. I'm advised 47.7 per cent of all consultations in the previous week with regard to standard mental health items were conducted over the phone. In addition to that, what we've also seen is that general telehealth items have very significantly been for mental health. So it doesn't have to be confined to the particular mechanism which the member outlines. What we have opened up with telehealth is a much broader ability to access services.
        </p>
        <p>
         In conjunction with the services provided through telehealth, we have also made sure that there are specific psychological and psychiatric items that have also been made available. On top of that, there was a $74 million investment focusing on support services for people mostly online or through telehealth through organisations such as the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Dog_Institute" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         for healthcare workers, Orygen for young people, Lifeline, Kids' Helpline and so many other different support groups. In particular,

         has led the coronavirus activity.
        </p>
        <p>
         Where there are proposals, the government will always consider them, but what we have done already is—on the advice of the mental health officers; the

         ; and, in particular, the

         Commission and the Prime Minister's Suicide Prevention Adviser, Christine Morgan—establish the arrangements which are in place, and these have been critical to help save lives and protect lives during what is a difficult period. Where there are proposals, we'll always review them, but what we have done so far has been, I would say, potentially world-leading. In particular, the national cabinet will be considering the national mental health pandemic plan this week. We are making very good progress with the states, and I want to thank the Prime Minister for his support and his leadership in drawing that into the national cabinet.
