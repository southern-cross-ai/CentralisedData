        On Monday I had the honour, along with Senator Patrick Dodson, of attending the funeral of a compelling and outstanding Warlpiri leader, Jakamarra Nelson, a person whom I had the privilege to know and who was my friendâ€”a mate. He was 77, and his life was driven by his identity as a Warlpiri man and an acknowledged leader. He spent most of his adult life as a warrior for

        people in the recognition for justice, land rights, self-determination and a voice to parliament. How disappointed he would be today, four years on from the Uluru Statement of the Heart, which simply and modestly asked for a constitutionally enshrined voice to parliament, a national process for agreement making and truth-telling, a desire for a secure voice that cannot just be abolished by the government, as the Howard government did with

        . Jakamarra would be angered, saddened, but not surprised by this government's failure to meet these very modest requests.

       <p>
        What is it that the government is afraid of? Why can't they finally come to terms with our national obligation to just do the right thing? Commit to holding a referendum on a voice. Set up a makarrata commission, a process for truth-telling and decision-making. It is well beyond the time for action. There is nothing to be afraid of. Act now and you will have our support. Fail to act and, whatever you think, history will condemn you.
