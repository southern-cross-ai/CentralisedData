        (2) welcomes the Ministerial Statement in respect of this review by the Government of the United Kingdom which acknowledges the need to protect children from excessive commercialisation and premature sexualisation, and accepts the recommendation that efforts to address this are focused on industry and regulators with government monitoring progress and legislating to protect children if necessary;

        That this House endorse the agreements reached in March 2011 at the Fourth Bali Regional Ministerial Conference on People Smuggling, Trafficking in Persons and Related Transnational Crime, in particular the Ministers' agreement to a regional cooperation framework underpinned by the following core principles:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) irregular movement facilitated by people smuggling syndicates should be eliminated and States should promote and support opportunities for orderly migration;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) where appropriate and possible, asylum seekers should have access to consistent assessment processes, whether through a set of harmonised arrangements or through the possible establishment of regional assessment arrangements, which might include a centre or centres, taking into account any existing sub-regional arrangements;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) persons found to be refugees under those assessment processes should be provided with a durable solution, including voluntary repatriation, resettlement within and outside the region and, where appropriate, possible 'in country' solutions;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) persons found not to be in need of protection should be returned, preferably on a voluntary basis, to their countries of origin, in safety and dignity, and returns should be sustainable and States should look to maximise opportunities for greater cooperation; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) people smuggling enterprises should be targeted through border security arrangements, law enforcement activities and disincentives for human trafficking and smuggling. (
