       To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives:

      <p class="italic">
       This petition of a concerned citizen of Australia draws to the attention of the house:
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The Wage Earners, Small Business and Pensioners in Australia are suffering from the high costs of goods and services, this has been caused by the low top personal tax and failure to increase the level of income of the zero tax, the low level of the estimated value of our coal and iron ore exports and the consequent low price of the reciprocal goods being imported, they are destroying our own manufacturing industries. A successful relatively high personal top tax had been in operation from 1950 to 1970, 66.6% and was well received by the workers but apparently did not relate to the 30% of GDP. Too many of our wage earners can obtain employment for only two or three days a week, cannot earn enough capital to pay the mortgage and are losing their homes. The economy is being destroyed.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The Tax should be returned to approximately the 66.6% and the income level for zero tax raised to $30,000 or what it needs to come to 30% of GDP. The top tax on companies should be increased to 55%, and a much lower tax on the small businesses, this would also help prevent the large companies from undercutting their prices to drive the small businesses out of operation.
