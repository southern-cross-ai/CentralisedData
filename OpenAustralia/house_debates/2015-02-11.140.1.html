         Australia Day
        </a>
        this year I had the privilege of attending the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Shire" rel="nofollow">
         Byron Shire
        </a>
        's Citizenship and Awards Ceremony at the Brunswick Bowls Club. It was a great day. The ceremony started with the recognition of the outstanding contributions made by many citizens and community groups. This year's 2015 Byron Shire Citizen of the Year was awarded to Adrienne Sheppard—a remarkable woman—from Mullumbimby. Adrienne was nominated in recognition of her more than 30 years of community involvement. She has given her time, energy and experience to help those in our community who have found themselves marginalised and in need of help.
       </p>
       <p>
        Adrienne has championed and supported a variety of community groups that are all working to help people in need of assistance and advocacy. Whether it is a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAIDOC" rel="nofollow">
         NAIDOC
        </a>
        family fun day, Yarn Up, a homeless forum or anything else that provides an opportunity to assist the disadvantaged or marginalized in our community, Adrienne is there helping out. Nothing is too much trouble for her. Adrienne's volunteerism and membership is spread over many organisations, which include rainforest regeneration groups; a refugee settlement group, where she was one of the original workers with refugee settlers in the Byron Shire; WIK—Women's Indigenous Reconciliation; Sisters for Reconciliation; and Grace Space, where she supports older people. Adrienne is also involved in a soup kitchen where she serves meals prepared from her own home for people in need in the community. She is also involved in a bush tucker garden maintenance and education program, which I note is a particular passion of Adrienne's.    And she volunteers as a foot masseur for aged residents at Coolamon Nursing Home, Mullumbimby.
       </p>
       <p>
        Adrienne has been and continues to be a constant beacon of inspiration with her gentle nature, positive attitude and deep sense of civic duty. Armed with a very infectious smile, she works tirelessly for our local community. Adrienne is driven by sense of compassion, mixed with love and humour. She treats everyone with the same dignity and respect. I thank her for her dedication and I acknowledge the wonderful honour of Byron Shire Citizen of the Year. It was indeed an honour for me to be there as she was presented with that award.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also note on this day that the

       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate both Tweed Shire Citizen of the Year, George Anderson, and Byron Shire Citizen of the Year, Adrienne Sheppard. We are very fortunate to have such wonderful and outstanding people in our community.
