         I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question. The member for Hindmarsh was a very heavy smoker some years ago and kicked his own habit and is living a much healthier life as a result of it, and I am sure he will have a long life as the member for Hindmarsh as well.

         Yesterday I had the opportunity to congratulate the Leader of the Opposition for finally deciding to support our plain-packaging measures on tobacco. Of course, this is long overdue support for a measure that has been supported by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
          World Health Organisation
         </a>
         , the AMA, the Cancer Council and many other health experts. It took the opposition over a year since this was announced to make up its mind that it would support this measure. That only came after a damaging split on the other side with a number of backbenchers expressing their views. So it is little wonder—

          The interjections will confirm the view of many Australians. It is little wonder that there are concerns about the influence of tobacco companies on public policy debate in Australia. The fact that the coalition has taken $3 million from big tobacco in the last 12 years would obviously raise questions for many. We know that they are the donor of choice for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_American_Tobacco" rel="nofollow">

           Mr Speaker, a point of order on relevance: the question was on the government's position, how it has been received and what is its response. The minister seems to be devoting all of her answer to none of those three.

               I was asked about the influences of tobacco companies on public policy debate and that is absolutely what I am talking about. But, of course, there is good news. There is good news that the tide is turning. There is good news because internationally we are seeing conservative leaders like
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Cameron" rel="nofollow">
                David Cameron

               refusing to take tobacco donations. At the state level we see Liberal Premier Colin Barnett refusing to take such donations. It is reported in the media today that there are a number of backbenchers who also support a ban on the coalition taking donations. I quote the member for
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMillan" rel="nofollow">

               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
                Tony Abbott
               </a>
               will end this while he is the leader'. This is great news that Mr Abbott is apparently going to stop taking donations from tobacco companies. Of course, this would be a big turnaround from last Friday when he went on television asking for extra donations. Now there is an allegation or a suggestion that he might be preparing to change his position. I would like to offer the Leader of the Opposition an opportunity to come to a joint event—
