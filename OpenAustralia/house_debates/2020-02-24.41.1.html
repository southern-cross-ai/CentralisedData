       <p>
        The Launceston City Deal is focused on making our city one of the most liveable and innovative cities in Australia. Two and a half years after it was signed, the deal is delivering for the region. The recent launch of the smart traffic initiative is another integral component to delivering on this promise. I am a firm believer in collaboration to effectively deliver what the community needs. This project is a fantastic example of this. Smart traffic is part of the Greater Launceston Transformation Project, a joint effort between all three levels of government plus the University of Tasmania and Telstra working together to produce significant social, environmental and economic outcomes for our region.

        Though we're lucky enough not to have to deal with the traffic issues of our largest city counterparts, we certainly have our challenges with traffic flow. This system, co-operatively funded with the Morrison government's $2.9 million investment, will not only ease congestion through innovative technology but also go some way to meeting the demands of the future population growth of our greater city region. Also, by using smart technology, we can generate more accurate data to inform greener land-use planning and infrastructure investment, which in turn will support our community in getting from A to B in Launceston by walking, cycling and catching public transport, which can only be a good thing. This project has so much to offer the greater Launceston region, and I can't wait to see how it unfolds after the system becomes fully operational later this year.
