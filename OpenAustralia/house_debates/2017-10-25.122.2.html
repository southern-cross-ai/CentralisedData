       <p>
        As the member for Hotham has ably set out in this chamber, Labor will support tougher penalties for firearms trafficking but what we won't support are ineffective measures. The reintroduction of these measures is a desperate attempt by the coalition to distract from the fact that they are hopelessly divided on guns. Labor will seek to remove the mandatory minimum sentences because they don't work. We need to draw a distinction in this House between being tough on crime and being dumb on crime. Labor will listen to the experts because we want to make sure that we have less gun crime in Australia. We're proposing amendments to introduce new offences for aggravated firearms trafficking, but we won't support measures which will simply cause judges to be less likely to convict.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the case of mandatory minimum sentences, the Attorney-General's Department document 'Guide to framing Commonwealth offences, infringement notices and enforcement powers' states that minimum penalties should be avoided on the basis that they interfere with judicial discretion to impose a penalty appropriate to the circumstance of a particular case; that they may create an incentive for a defendant to fight charges even when there's little merit in doing so; that they may preclude the use of alternative sanctions such as community service orders; and that they may encourage the judiciary to look for technical grounds to avoid a restriction on sentencing discretion, leading to anomalous decisions. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee received a wide range of evidence from stakeholders in inquiries on the two previous bills, which strongly opposed the imposition of mandatory sentences.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Law Council of Australia has written most extensively on this issue. In their policy discussion paper on mandatory sentencing in May 2004, they went through in considerable detail the risks that mandatory sentencing creates. They noted that mandatory sentencing is inconsistent with Australia's international obligations, including the prohibition against arbitrary detention, in article 9 of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Covenant_on_Civil_and_Political_Rights" rel="nofollow">
         International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
        </a>
        . The right to a fair trial and the provision of prison sentences must, in effect, be subject to appeal, as per article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. They also noted that mandatory minimums may breach Australia's obligations under articles 3, 37 and 40 of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child" rel="nofollow">
         Convention on the Rights of the Child
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        More importantly than our international obligation is the simple fact that mandatory minimum sentences make it less likely for convictions to be recorded and can lead to manifest unfairness. The Law Council gave examples of instances in which mandatory sentencing has led to outcomes which I don't think any member of this House would believe are just. They give the example of a 16-year-old with one prior conviction who received a 28-day prison sentence for stealing a bottle of spring water—a month in jail for stealing a bottle of water. A 17-year-old first-time offender received a 14-day prison sentence for stealing orange juice and Minties. I have to say, I went to a decent school, and I'm afraid there were classmates of mine who at some stage would have shoplifted orange juice and Minties, but I don't think anyone would have thought that they should have received a fortnight behind bars. The Law Council gives the example of a 15-year-old Aboriginal boy who received a 20-day mandatory sentence for stealing pencils and stationery and died while in custody. An Aboriginal woman, a first-time offender, received a 14-day prison sentence for stealing a can of beer. These manifestly unjust outcomes occurred as a result of mandatory sentencing.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Law Council points to research which found that, when the public is fully informed about the particular circumstances of a case and an offender, there is a 90 per cent tendency to view judge's sentences as appropriate. That is from work by Geraldine Mackenzie and co-authors, published in 2012, in the
        <i>
         Australian and New Zealand Journal of Criminology
        </i>
        . The Law Council notes too that the imposition of mandatory minimum sentences can lead to unjust outcomes. The Law Council concludes by quoting the then Australian Human Rights Commissioner, the 'Freedom Commissioner', Mr Tim Wilson, now the member for Goldstein. He said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … mandatory sentencing 'is an incremental stake stabbed in the heart of the foundations of our liberal democracy because it assumes that a centralised government with less information can make better decisions about individual cases than a decentralised courts with more information'.
       </p>
       <p>
        The member for Goldstein has always stood for freedom, or so he tells us, so it will be interesting to those on this side of the House to see whether he exercises his freedom of conscience to cross the floor and vote with the Labor Party and uphold the principles that he stood for when he was Human Rights Commissioner—the principles he stood for in 2014 when he described mandatory sentencing as 'an incremental stake stabbed in the heart of the foundations of our liberal democracy'.
       </p>
       <p>
        The criminologist
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kleiman" rel="nofollow">
         Mark Kleiman
        </a>
        describes the trade-off between severity and certainty in his book,
        <i>
         When Brute Force Fails
        </i>
        , and points out that, if you want to have less crime and less punishment, you need to recognise that offenders who are driven by the present are much more likely to respond to certainty—to the probability of conviction—than to severity, to the duration of the sentence. If you are thinking about committing a serious weapons offence, you are probably living in the moment and it is relatively unlikely that severity will play a bigger role in your mind than certainty. Yet that is the trade-off that this bill fails to recognise.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Law Council noted that mandatory minimum sentences could increase Indigenous incarceration rates. We on this side of the House believe that incarceration should be added to the Closing the Gap targets, given that Australia's Indigenous incarceration rate is high and rising. Indeed, our overall incarceration rate is now the highest it's been since 1901. In all the time since Federation, Australia has never locked up as large a share of our population as we do today, with 207 out of every 100,000 adults currently behind bars. It's a higher incarceration rate than in Canada, Japan, France, India, Germany, Indonesia or Britain. We are incarcerating a higher share of our population than we have since Federation, at a time, over the last two decades, in which the murder rate and car theft rates have fallen significantly.
       </p>
       <p>
        This comes at a significant cost to Australians, given that incarceration costs around $300 a day and $110,000 a year. In the United States, where nearly one per cent of adults are behind bars, there's a bipartisan movement towards being smarter on crime, recognising that we need to make better use of monitoring technology and that there are smarter approaches than mandatory sentences. This is a bipartisan push from Democrats and Republicans in the United States. It's a smart-on-crime measure, exactly the opposite of what we see in this government's call for mandatory sentences. We have a government that says we need mandatory sentences in order to make sure offenders are put behind bars. But the Law Council tells us that they will do just the opposite, because when mandatory sentences are in place judges and juries may be less likely to convict, knowing that there is no sentencing discretion.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I want to do something which is a little unusual in this place, which is to pay tribute to those on the other side of the House. One of the great legacies of the Howard government was the package of gun reforms put in place after the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Arthur" rel="nofollow">
         Port Arthur
        </a>
        massacre. It is too easy to forget how quickly Australia acted at that time. The police ministers' meeting took place 12 days after the Port Arthur massacre, before all of the 35 victims had been laid to rest. It is to the credit of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
         John Howard
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Fischer" rel="nofollow">
         Tim Fischer
        </a>
        that they were willing to act and tighten our firearms laws. We refer to the gun buyback, the 600,000 firearms—about a fifth of all guns in Australia—that were handed back into police stations. But it's important to remember, too, the tightening of licensing and regulation requirements, the restrictions on access to semi-automatic weapons and the limits that were placed on sales.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_States" rel="nofollow">
         The United States
        </a>
        occasionally misreads the lessons of Australia's tightening of gun laws, which took place in 1997-98. Disappointingly, following the mass shooting in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Vegas" rel="nofollow">
         Las Vegas
        </a>
        that took place so recently, Leah Libresco wrote in
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Washington_Post" rel="nofollow">
          The Washington Post
         </a>
        </i>
        that mass shootings were too rare in Australia prior to the buyback to show any evidence of progress and that the Australian gun law tightening did not provide clear evidence for the United States.
       </p>
       <p>
        In fact, that is not true. If we define a mass shooting as the killing of five or more victims, Australia was experiencing an average of one mass shooting per year in the decade leading up to Port Arthur. In the decade afterwards, there was not a single mass shooting. The odds of this being due to chance alone are less than one in 100.
       </p>
       <p>
        But the work that Christine Neill and I did when I was at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_National_University" rel="nofollow">
         Australian National University
        </a>
        found this had a significant impact on reducing gun deaths—principally through reducing gun suicides. After all, the person most likely to kill you with a gun is yourself. We found when we looked at the time series that the reforms seemed to cause the death rate to fall a little faster. But, in particular, if we looked at cross-state differences and compared jurisdictions where more weapons were bought back and those where fewer weapons were bought back, the largest fall in gun deaths occurred in the jurisdictions where the most guns were bought back. We didn't see any evidence of displacement effects, and we estimated that the firearm reforms of 1996 save around 200 lives year.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is in no way in my political interest to praise those on the other side of the House, but it is vital for our friends in the United States to get a clear-eyed reading of the impact of the Australian gun reforms of 20 years ago. They were smart gun reforms. They were supported by this side of the House. We supported them because they were based on clear evidence.
       </p>
       <p>
        We call on the coalition today to make sure that their firearms measures are, again, based on clear evidence. We call on them to listen to the Law Council and to prosecutors, who say that mandatory sentences may make us less safe, not more safe.

        </small>
        <p>
         I thank all honourable members for their contribution to the debate on the Criminal Code Amendment (Firearms Trafficking) Bill 2017, which will introduce new mandatory minimum sentences and increase maximum penalties for firearms-trafficking offences. There have been a wide range of statements made in this debate. In particular, we heard repeatedly from those opposite that mandatory minimum sentences should be opposed as they remove incentives for offenders to cooperate with law enforcement or to plead guilty. However, if members had read the amendments introduced by the government, they would have known that they do, indeed, provide for discounts on the mandatory minimum sentences if offenders plead guilty or if they cooperate with our law enforcement agencies. These amendments provide clear incentives for offenders to plead guilty and to cooperate with law enforcement.
        </p>
        <p>
         We also heard from those opposite about the case of former Victorian police chief commissioner
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Overland" rel="nofollow">
          Simon Overland
         </a>
         , who, of course, would not be captured by this bill. The bill is aimed at traffickers—people with intent—not those who make honest mistakes. This was clearly an honest mistake and, of course, he was not charged with any offence. This, as I indicated previously, reflects the discretion that our law enforcement agencies have and continue to exercise each and every single day when it comes to deciding whether to initiate a prosecution.
        </p>
        <p>
         We also heard that juries would be less likely to convict gun runners if they knew they would get a mandatory minimum sentence. As my colleague the member for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Trobe" rel="nofollow">
          La Trobe
         </a>
         , who has a lot of experience in these matters, being a former police officer, said in his contribution, 'Juries are actually tough, and they don't have a problem convicting people who are guilty of crimes, and they wouldn't have a problem convicting gun traffickers.'
        </p>
        <p>
         We also heard from a number of speakers opposite that they do not support mandatory minimum sentences, as a matter of principle. That's interesting because they actually introduced, when they were in office, mandatory sentencing for the crime of people smuggling, in 2010. At the time, Labor's then Attorney-General said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The use of mandatory minimum penalties reflects the seriousness of the activity being prosecuted. It allows the court to determine an appropriate penalty within the minimum and maximum set by parliament.
        </p>
        <p>
         The then Prime Minister,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Gillard" rel="nofollow">
          Julia Gillard
         </a>
         , said at the time:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         This legislation includes mandatory minimum penalties for organisers and created a new offence of providing material support for people smuggling …
        </p>
        <p>
         It was supported at the time by members on that side of the House who are still in the House. The member for Gorton, who was once the Minister for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
          Home Affairs
         </a>
         , supported mandatory sentencing at the time. Others who, funnily enough, even spoke in these debates against mandatory sentencing spoke for mandatory sentencing when the people-smuggling bill was introduced in 2010.
        </p>
        <p>
         The fact is that a combination of mandatory minimum sentences and increased maximum penalties sends the strongest possible message that the illegal trafficking of guns will not be tolerated. Unless a mandatory sentence is introduced, it will remain possible for low sentences to be issued to offenders. I reiterate the fact that, when this bill was debated in the Senate earlier this year, the government, in good faith, supported amendments related to increased sentences for firearms trafficking. This was obviously in line with our election commitment—but also in line with our election commitment that we took to the Australian people in 2016 was the fact that there would be a mandatory sentence for this heinous crime.
        </p>
        <p>
         If members are truly serious about ensuring that courts impose adequate sentences on gun traffickers, they will support all of the measures contained within this bill—but, sadly, it appears that members opposite will not be supporting mandatory minimum sentences. I implore them to get on board with this tough legislation. This bill and bipartisan support for it within the parliament will send the strongest possible message that we won't tolerate gun crime, and it will create the strongest possible deterrent. The Australian people shouldn't be subject to the sorts of violence that can result from gun smuggling. It actually complements the very tough gun law regime that we have place in Australia. Again I would urge the Labor Party to rethink. If it was good enough to introduce, support and pass mandatory sentences for people smuggling in 2010, it's good enough to support mandatory sentences for gun smuggling in 2017.
