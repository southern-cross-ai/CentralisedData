       <p>
        This morning in the House, I tried to move a suspension of standing orders so that the government could talk about the mouse plague across four Australian states. What we're hearing from farmers, particularly in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        , is that not enough is being done by this government when it comes to the mouse plague. Indeed, the federal government have gone missing. In estimates last week, when they were asked about what they're doing about this mouse plague, the federal government said, 'We're not doing anything; it's all up to the states.' That's what they said. It is outrageous that this government doesn't accept responsibility and will not help the farmers across Australia dealing with this mouse plague.
       </p>
       <p>
        What we're seeing with this mouse plague is thousands and thousands of mice all across New South Wales but also in Queensland, in Victoria and in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        . It's estimated to be doing a billion dollars worth of damage, and this government says, 'It's not our responsibility; we are not doing anything.' They don't care about the mouse plague. They don't care about the farmers who are trying to deal with it. It's completely outrageous that this government continues to sit and say, 'Not our responsibility; it's all up to the states.' Even the agriculture minister in New South Wales, a National Party member, is disappointed that the government is not doing anything about this mouse plagueâ€”absolutely nothing. The APVMA still have not approved emergency listing for the chemical to deal with the mouse plague. The government needs to act and it needs to do more.
