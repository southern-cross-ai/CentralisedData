        I rise to speak about the need for all of us to be aware of Kidney Health Australia and the great work they do. I recently met with a constituent from Gembrook, Liz Hoffman, and her beloved Doberman, Buffy, in my electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Trobe" rel="nofollow">
         La Trobe
        </a>
        . Liz is an ambassador for Kidney Health Australia and has raised funds throughout October for the Red Socks Run campaign to increase awareness and support research into kidney disease. Liz has reached the goal of completing 450 kilometres of walking with Buffy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Kidney disease is a silent, incurable illness. 27,000 people in Australia are living with kidney failure and require dialysis or a transplant to stay alive, but there is very little research into the disease, especially in the early stages. Ninety per cent of kidney functions can be lost before any symptoms are apparent. On average, 63 Australians will die every day. Every day, 63 Australians die from kidney related diseases, and, sadly, there is no cure for it. A blood test can assess kidney health and see how well your kidneys are filtering your blood.
       </p>
       <p>
        This October, Kidney Health Australia's Red Socks Run campaign will fund life-changing treatments and vital support services for those living with the disease. Congratulations to Liz and Buffy on reaching the goal of walking 450 kilometres in the beautiful

        in my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to make the House aware of the great work done by Saint Luke's Anglican Church. I'd like to acknowledge a volunteer, not-for-profit organisation in the electorate of Latrobe. I have met with the Food Store at Saint Luke's Church in Cockatoo recently and on a number of other occasions. The food store was established three years ago in 2019 by Julia, David and Graham, who saw the need in the community, stepped up to help and have not stopped since. The food store is a food bank located at Saint Luke's Anglican Church in Cockatoo offering free food and a kind ear for those in need of a little extra help. It operates from the church every Monday from 10 am to 2 pm. All locals are welcome to visit and collect free food.
       </p>
       <p>
        Visitors receive a friendly welcome, a warm smile and a hot cup of tea, which I had. Visitors attend the food store from across the Dandenong Ranges, including the suburbs of Cockatoo, Gembrook, Emerald and even out to Healesville, Pakenham and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narre_Warren" rel="nofollow">
         Narre Warren
        </a>
        . The food store is generously supplied groceries by Foodbank Victoria and local businesses to enable this wonderful service to function.
       </p>
       <p>
        St Luke's Anglican Church are also seeking to upgrade their bathroom onsite to provide hot showers to locals doing it tough. I'm right behind this project and, again, congratulate Julia, David and all their team and thank them very much for everything they do. They're located at 1 McBride Street, Cockatoo and open Mondays between 10 am and 2 pm.
