        Women deserve to be safe. On Friday afternoon, Jennifer and Gretl Petelczyc of Berkeley Crescent in Floreat were shot and killed by their friend's ex-husband, Mark Bombara. The shooter was trying to find his ex-wife, who had escaped the family home weeks earlier fearing for her life. The shooter's daughter, Ariel, has been telling me about her fears for her mother's safety in recent months. It's a heartbreaking story—too much for one person to bear. This event has torn apart two families and rocked my community. I've received so many messages from constituents who have been devastated by this tragedy. Disturbingly, I've also received a few messages from men in our community telling me they feel targeted by the response to this event and suggesting that female victims are to blame. This fills me with rage and deep, deep sadness. We have a huge problem, and we need a huge coordinated solution.
       </p>
       <p>
        Shockingly, the per capita rate of family and domestic violence related assaults in WA is about twice as high as in the other states, and they're just the reported cases. Violence is never justified, and women deserve to be safe. Constituents have told me since that they want to see change.

        Violence is never justified, and women deserve to be safe. Constituents have since told me that they want to see change. Here are a few of the messages I've received. One says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I have personally experienced domestic violence, my sister has, my best friend has, my female friends have and I am furious and exhausted. It affects all women, of all ages, of all socio-economic classes, education levels, race, culture. It is perpetrated by men of all ages, of all socio-economic classes, education level, race, culture.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Another says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our street will be forever scarred by this incomprehensible act of violence and I feel we need to take positive steps forward to offset the negative flow-on effects in our community. The only way through this is together.
       </p>
       <p>
        And a third says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is a national disgrace and a matter of life and death which calls for drastic and immediate measures. I am an 81-year-old woman, sitting at my computer at 4am, with tears running down my face. I can't accept that my great-granddaughter will grow up in a country that can't protect its women and children.
       </p>
       <p>
        My community is angry, exhausted and so, so sad. Making women feel safe will require coordination across federal and state governments, as well as change in our community. We need adequately funded services so we can look after women who have experienced violence. We need to protect women who have a reasonable fear of violence. We cannot let dangerous men have guns, and men must hold other men accountable, so that it's clear that violence is never the answer. The best way to honour the memory of Jennifer and Gretl is to stop this happening again. Women deserve to be safe.
