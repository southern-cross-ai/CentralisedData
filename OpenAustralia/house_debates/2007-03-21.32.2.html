              Mr Speaker, I am aware of the views of Mr Kirk and Mr Walker and Mr Murdoch and Mr Packer. They have all expressed views on broadband. I certainly share the view that broadband is a very important part of Australia’s infrastructure future. But the issue in debate—I notice the member for Melbourne has moved off the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Fund" rel="nofollow">
               Future Fund
              </a>
              —and our quarrel with the Labor Party on this is that the Labor Party intend to raid the Future Fund. That is what they are going to do. They said this fund was not sufficiently locked up. I remind the member for Melbourne that, if Telstra shares are sold by the Future Fund, the money goes into the fund and therefore it is subject to the same restrictions and should be treated in the same way as all the other resources that are in the fund. But there is a very simple and fundamental issue involved here: the Future Fund is designed to relieve future generations from a greater financial burden than would otherwise be the case. That is what it is designed to do.

                 We have enormous Commonwealth superannuation liabilities accruing, and we have put this money aside, no thanks to the Labor Party, in order to look after those liabilities. What the Labor Party intends to do is to rob the savings set aside for our children and grandchildren in order to fund a current policy proposal. I have no doubt, and the Treasurer has no doubt, that this is the first of many. This is the first instalment. I understand that at the news conference today the third question asked by journalists was: how many more policy proposals are going to be funded by raiding the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Fund" rel="nofollow">

                <p>
                 I say to the Labor Party: I am interested in the views of Mr Murdoch, Mr Packer, Mr Kirk and Mr Walker. I sometimes agree with them and I sometimes do not. But in the end I am more interested in the wellbeing of my children and grandchildren—and those who sit opposite are more interested in the wellbeing of their children and grandchildren—than in the views of other people, much and all as I respect the contribution that Mr Murdoch has made to this country and other countries and the contribution that

                 and his late father have made. But in the end my obligation is to future generations, not to individuals in the current generation.
