        I rise to pay tribute to Marie Hodgens, an extraordinary local activist in Chisholm who impacted the lives of so many as a loving mother, a wife to Howard, grandmother, great-grandmother, a dedicated advocate for the community and of course an

        member. Marie's steadfast dedication to environmental preservation was evident through her active participation in the Friends of

        group, which she participated in for an impressive 30 years. Her commitment to young people was clear, as she generously served on the school council for the former Burwood High School.
       </p>
       <p>
        Marie was someone who was deeply concerned for her community. She served on the board of the directors for Box Hill Hospital and was a member of the humanists society and the

        </a>
        . Marie worked as an electoral officer for a number of members of parliament, including the former member for Chisholm,

        . Her service made such a difference to our community. In recognition of her exceptional contributions, Marie was honoured with the prestigious Caroline Chisholm Award in 2005 awarded to her by outstanding former member for Chisholm Anna Burke, which highlighted her invaluable voluntary work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Marie, we express our deepest gratitude for your invaluable contributions to the
