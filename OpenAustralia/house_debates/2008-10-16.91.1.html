        , Elizabeth Broderick, had this to say:

       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day_of_Older_Persons" rel="nofollow">
         International Day of Older Persons
        </a>
        has given us the long overdue opportunity to honour the contributions older people make and continue to make to the strength of our economy and the health and wellbeing of our country. After all, our future depends on it.
       </p>
       <p>
        I guess what Commissioner Broderick did not say was that our present is in large part only possible because of the contributions of older Australians. Many people facing difficulties because of rising cost and low fixed incomes still contribute so much to our communities. I had the distinct pleasure and very great honour on 1 October of presenting at a small function certificates of appreciation to some of the older constituents who contribute to life in our communities.

        Last Monday the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family, Community, Housing and Youth presented their report titled
        <i>
         The value of volunteering: a discussion paper on volunteering in the community and welfare sector
        </i>
        . Our colleague the member for Canberra,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annette_Ellis" rel="nofollow">
         Annette Ellis
        </a>
        , said during the presentation of that report:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is estimated that volunteers contribute around $42 billion to the Australian economy each year.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to mention just some of the recipients of the awards in Longman on 1 October. Firstly, I would like to mention May Payne, from the Caboolture Senior Citizens Club. May has been volunteering for as long as I can remember, and my engagement in public life in the community goes back 25 years. I would also like to mention Vic Kennett, from the Burpengary Meals on Wheels. Vic is a nonagenarian—90 years plus—and he has been Treasurer of the Burpengary Meals on Wheels for 17 years. It is an organisation that delivers meals to people many years younger than Vic himself. Ces Conte, who is from the Caboolture Multicultural Association, has been a tireless worker in our community, particularly aiding the growing number of non Australian born members of the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to mention Uncle Allan Gill, from the Murriajabree
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATSI" rel="nofollow">
         ATSI
        </a>
        Association of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Deception Bay
        </a>
        ; Joy Mason, from the Bribie Island Golden Age Day Respite Centre; and many others, from arts groups, St Vincent de Paul, the 60 and Better Program, horticultural groups, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        and the Vietnam Veterans Association. These people contribute so much to our communities, not just to older people but to younger people as well. I am very pleased to be able to say that I am proudly part of a Labor government that has recognised the contribution of older Australians no matter what form of compensation they will receive from the government through the recent announcement of the bonuses to be paid in December.
