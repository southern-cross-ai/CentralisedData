        I rise to congratulate the Penrith Symphony Orchestra on their 25th anniversary concert, which I had the pleasure of attending last Saturday night.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are not many local communities that can boast having their own symphony orchestra. I am proud to say that under the artistic direction of conductor Paul Terracini and the board, the people of Penrith have enjoyed live classical and orchestral music in our own community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The board is currently chaired by president, David Cervi, and its members are made up of a group of very dedicated volunteers:

        and Anne Plummer. I take the opportunity to thank them all for their fine work.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 25th anniversary concert was performed by the 70-player orchestra in collaboration with a 140-voice choir, which included two children's choirs from the local area. The performers featured three of Australia's finest young solo singers: Sarah Toth, a soprano, Pascal Herrington, a tenor and Alexander Knight, a baritone. Each of these soloists are also graduates of the

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Also performing in this concert were three members of the violin section: Margaret Bournes,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Smith" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Lois Gillan, all of whom are local residents in Penrith and founding members of the orchestra since its establishment in 1988.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another founding member, and perhaps one of the most dedicated volunteers, Jenny Bounds, has been instrumental in the development of the orchestra for 24 years, until her retirement last year. Jenny was awarded an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">

        in 2001 for her services to the Penrith Symphony Orchestra and other musical organisations in our local community. I also acknowledge Jenny's husband, John, who has been a great contributor and member of the

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Among the most senior members of the orchestra—and aged around 80—are Miluska Simkova, a retired professional opera singer, formerly with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , who now shares her talents with the community through her work as a violin teacher; and Fred Backer, a retired engineer and keen amateur double bass player.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the other end of the spectrum, amongst the youngest players in the orchestra are 17-year-old

        and whose four younger brothers and sisters were also involved in the concert as members of the children's choir.
       </p>
       <p>
        Once again I take the opportunity to congratulate the Penrith Symphony Orchestra on their outstanding performances last Saturday night and also on their 25 years of serving our local community and the broader
