       <p>
        Something really special happened a few minutes ago. The coalition government has invested in entrepreneurship and the opportunity for our economy to support efficient businesses, big and small, to delight customers and to see Australian citizens benefit from that policy setting. What has been announced is a redefinition of section 46, the misuse of market powerâ€”a very important and very welcome move.
       </p>
       <p>
        Members in this place might realise that it was some six years ago that I started advocating the case for a root-and-branch examination of our competition laws, our institutions and the technologies and infrastructure that support them. What we found was that the laws were deficient in a number of areas. What we need in our economy to encourage investment and entrepreneurship is a chance for a business to have a fair go. Section 46 aims to ensure that those businesses with substantial market power did not use their economic muscle to win the contest to delight customers but that they had to compete on merit. This is great news for all enterprising people and is another instalment in showing how only the coalition government can put the policies in place to energise enterprise.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the few moments that are left to me, I want to thank Cara Waters and also Emily Green and Tess McCabe for drawing out a concern about the Paid Parental Leave scheme, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPL" rel="nofollow">
         PPL
        </a>
        scheme, and how it can impact on self-employed people. An unexpected or early arrival of a newborn for a self-employed person can mean they might have to go back to work to continue their business. This risks those enterprising women missing out on PPL. Flexibility is required.
