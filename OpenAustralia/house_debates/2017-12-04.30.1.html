       <p>
        A few weeks ago I got the chance to catch up with the year 5 and year 6 students from the St Joseph's Primary School in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarry_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Quarry Hill
        </a>
        . I asked the question: 'What would you do if you were Prime Ministerâ€”what would be your priority?' The students responded with the following: no more coal for energy production, do more to protect the environment, allow marriage equality, end homelessness and support those in need, support asylum seekers and be kinder to refugees, end animal cruelty, and do more to protect our native wildlife. There was even a discussion, division and vote on banning pineapple from pizzas.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to finish with a rap that was presented to me by Ashton and Jedd from St Joseph's Primary School, and I will read it, because I'm not much of a rapper:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Refugees and Migrants, I don't care about the difference, we're all human beings aren't we? Yeah.! That's what I thought! They don't want to be bought. Never judge a book by its cover! They probably lost someone they love. Refugees aren't the problem! The problem is those who don't accept them.
       </p>
       <p>
        The rap goes on, but it basically speaks to social justice, something that is so important to these students and to the entire Catholic footprint within my electorate. Lots of our schools talk about social justice, and lots of our students call on this Prime Minister and this government to do more to support those in need in our community.
