        It was a great honour to pay respect to our servicemen and servicewomen on the

        Day. On that day, 70 years ago, Japan surrendered unconditionally and Australian cities and towns erupted in celebration. Almost a million Australians served in the

        At Ettalong, the Central Coast Sub Branch of the Vietnam Veterans Peacekeepers and Peacemakers Association of Australia did an excellent job of bringing our community together. There were around 100 people in attendance who heard from guest speaker
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Pearson" rel="nofollow">
         Walter Pearson
        </a>
        . Walter spoke very movingly. He gave a wonderful history of the veterans' experience and an incredible insight into the reception given to newly returned soldiers. May I thank Bob Purcell, the president of the sub-branch, and the secretary, Robyn Creswell, for the opportunity to be there and to pay my respects by the memorial at

       <p>
        This is an important moment as part of our Anzac centenary year commemorations, which, I am pleased to say, also delivers back to our community. One way we do this is through the Building Excellence in Support and Training grants. I am pleased to advise that recently this Vietnam veterans branch in Ettalong received a $20,000 grant to assist the work they do, and the Woy Woy Ettalong-Hardy's Bay

        I commend to the House their service to our community.
