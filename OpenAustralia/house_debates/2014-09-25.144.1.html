        I would like to take this opportunity to reflect on a year of government in the electorate of Forde.

        I think it has been a very productive and energising year not only for my electorate but for the nation as a whole—despite the wonderful contribution from my good friend the member for Moreton, on the other side of the chamber. It is hard to believe that we are already into our second year. Since being elected, we have put runs on the board. At the big picture level are abolishing the carbon tax, abolishing the mining tax and significantly reducing the number of people-smuggling ventures. In effect, there has been just one successful venture in the eight months of this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Locally, we have met a number of election commitments already, with $3 million towards the revitalisation of the Beenleigh CBD in addition to almost $1 million of funding for additional

        cameras in the Beenleigh CBD and around the Logan Hospital precinct, Shailer Park and

        </a>
        . Last week I had the privilege of attending the official sod-turning ceremony for the Beenleigh CBD redevelopment with Mayor Pam Parker, representatives from the Beenleigh Yatala Chamber of Commerce and other members of the local business community. This project has been a long time coming—at least 20 years; by some estimates, 30 years. I am very excited about seeing the works commencing over the next few weeks.

        During our first year we have also had a very busy time of ministerial visits to the electorate to ensure that my senior coalition colleagues are aware of actual issues on the ground. The Minister for Health and Minister for Sport has been to the electorate, as have the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Business" rel="nofollow">
         Small Business
        </a>
        , the Minister for

        </a>
        , the Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, the Minister for Industry, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Services. During these visits we have met local residents, business owners, seniors groups, community and sporting groups and various other organisations to see how we can best assist them at a federal level in our local community. Some critics might say they only see politicians out and about during campaigns but over the past year we have been getting out and about in the local community to ensure we meet our constituents where they are. In the past year we have hosted a number of informal meet and greet opportunities, otherwise known as 'a cuppa with Bert', at our local coffee shops around the electorate. We also hosted a forum, looking at vocational education and training, on behalf the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Industry" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . We have held various stalls at our local community fairs and regularly visited our schools to meet with principals, teachers, students and parents. The joy of the job is visiting our local retirement villages armed, with scones and jam and cream, and spending some time with the people in those communities to hear what their concerns are and discuss with them the issues relating to their particular time of life. This Friday we are hosting our annual Forde seniors' expo at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury_College" rel="nofollow">

        , expecting a crowd of some 500 or 600 seniors. I very much look forward to hearing what they have to say.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the next two years I and my colleagues will continue to work not only for the people of Forde but for the broader Australian community. I am always interested in hearing about what improvements we can make to our community. I enjoy meeting with people who are passionate about the region. We certainly have a lot to offer and I will continue to work on building our community into one that is going to be a strong and vibrant community for future generations.
