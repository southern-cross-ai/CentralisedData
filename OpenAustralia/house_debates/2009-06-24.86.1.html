         That the member be no longer hear.

          Can I
         </a>
         seek some clarification. From my reading of the draft
         <i>
          Votes and Proceedings
         </i>
         , the motion moved earlier today and the motion which has just been moved appear to be in the same words.
        </p>
        <p>
         My understanding is that there are some slight differences. I have not prepared the text but I am assured there are some slight differences.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I indeed sought advice from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerk_of_the_House" rel="nofollow">
          Clerk of the House
         </a>
         , as is normal procedure for the Leader of the House, and was informed that they were different motions. If it is the case that they are the same in substance, as
         <i>
          Practice
         </i>
         and standing orders provide for under standing order 114, the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition is out of order and should be ruled by you as such.
        </p>
        <p>
         On the point of order, having looked at the draft
         <i>
          Votes and Proceedings
         </i>
         and the motion moved just now, the two motions appear to me to be exactly the same and I rule this motion out of order.

         Based on my review of the draft
         <i>

         technology has been slightly of assistance—I have ruled that the motion is out of order.
