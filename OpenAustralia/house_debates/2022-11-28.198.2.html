        For over 40 years the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Republic" rel="nofollow">
         Islamic Republic
        </a>
        regime has committed terrorist acts and human rights atrocities against the people of Iran, including shocking instances of gender based violence. The killing of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in September this year, after being arrested for not wearing the hijab in accordance with government standards, has led to an unprecedented nationwide uprising led largely by women whose dignity and rights have been crushed by this brutal regime. Responding with a brutal crackdown, Islamic Republic authorities have killed hundreds of peaceful demonstrators and injured many more.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my electorate and my office I have met with many Kooyong constituents of Iranian background who profoundly appreciate their freedom in Australia but fear for their family and friends in Iran. They have called on the Australian government to actively support in every way possible the brave men and women of Iran in their struggle, including the practical actions included in the petition of more than 50,000 signatures presented in the House this morning. These actions will align Australia with other liberal democratic states and enable us to uphold our democratic and human rights values. I support the spirit and the content of this petition and call on the Australian government to implement targeted sanctions and ensure that we are not supporting this brutal regime.

         I rise for the third time to speak to the deep concern and dismay that many constituents in Bennelong continue to discuss with me about the heavy-handed measures against Iranians by Iranian authorities. It has been 73 days since the death in custody of Mahsa Amini and Iranian people, both in Iran and around the world, continue to rise together in protest.

        </p>
        <p>
         The Prime Minister, the foreign affairs minister and this government have vehemently expressed their resounding condemnation of Iran's treatment of protestors and the serious concerns held regarding Iran's human rights record. In November, Australia joined Canada and

         Today the chair of the petitions committee presented to this place the petitions report, which included 13 separate petitions to parliament regarding Iran, with combined signatures from more than 70,000 people. I have a responsibility to the Iranian and Kurdish communities in Bennelong to continue to stand in solidarity and be their voice to the government on this matter. It's a responsibility I take seriously. I stand today with them in their right to peace. I stand with them in advocating for the rights of women, girls, children, those of all religious faiths and the
