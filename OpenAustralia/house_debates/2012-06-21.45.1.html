        I would like to acknowledge the death of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_O'Hara" rel="nofollow">
         Catherine O'Hara
        </a>
        , born in Ayr in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         North Queensland
        </a>
        in 1935, partner to Vince O'Hara and mother of Shay, Lily, Jane and the fabulous Megan. Catherine was an educator who inspired generations of students to strive for something better. She instilled in so many an education that at its heart had values of commitment, responsibility and diligence. One of her favourite sayings, as it is mine, was, 'It's not the dog in the fight but the fight in the dog.' Catherine valued her own education and thirst for knowledge. It drove her, it fuelled her curiosity and it made her a risk-taker. She believed in the quest for knowledge so intensely that it was interpreted by some as snobbishness, but she wanted more than to be ordinary for herself, for her family and for everyone around her.
       </p>
       <p>
        Catherine loathed self-righteousness, dullness and conformity. I saw this just after Christmas last year up on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darling_Downs" rel="nofollow">

        —and I am amazed that she died so soon after. She would not be boxed, especially as she aged, but great leaders are also great listeners. When people feel they are being heard, powerful change can happen—and Catherine was, above all else, a great listener. She could not abide anyone who did not want to know more and those not interested enough to ask questions. That inquisitiveness extended to books, technology and people's lives. Heaven help you if you did not have anything interesting to contribute to a conversation. Those strong, silent types usually have nothing to say.
       </p>
       <p>
        When Catherine grew up and left school, women of her era were only offered the career choice of teaching or nursing. This stoked an anger in Catherine that almost defined her. Shay, Lily, Jane and Megan described their mum as somewhat of a maverick figure from the fifties and sixties.
