       <p>
        I'd like to acknowledge a staffer, who worked for me when I was a state member of parliament, by the name of Wayne Gregson. Wayne and Linda were a husband and wife team who worked for meâ€”Linda for 14 years and Wayne for 10. Wayne has recently been diagnosed with an inoperable cancer and the prognosis is not good for Wayne. But he's not sad and he's not downbeat. In fact, he's lucky that he can look back and say he has lived his life to the fullest. He's one of the funniest, smartest and most talented journalists that the Central Victorian Bendigo region has ever had. He has an extensive work record, but he has loved life as well as anybody could ever wish to love life. He recently left full-time employment, but then he worked for the radio stations, and he's done an amazing job in that regard. Wayne and Linda have an amazing relationship. They have so many friends and such an amazing social network.
       </p>
       <p>
        I just want to thank Wayne for the 10 years that he worked in my office. He is totally bipartisan and totally without politics but a great supporter. He loves everything to do with Bendigo, the region of Bendigo and central Victoria and he has a fantastic reputation within the journalist fraternity in Victoria. I send my full wishes to Wayne Gregson as he goes through this next battle for the next few months.
