        Few people truly earn the title of local champion but Ray Krueger, principal of Glendyne Education and Training Centre, just south of

        , is one of them. I was honoured recently to attend the opening of Glendyne’s new school oval, which was funded partly from a grant of $47,000 from the Investing in Our Schools fund, which came from the previous coalition government. Of course, the school and the wider community also worked hand-in-hand to realise the vision of a state-of-the-art school oval, to make that dream a reality. The driving force behind the project was the principal, Ray Krueger, who had the vision for better sporting facilities for his challenged students and who took this vision to Simon Boss Walker. Simon took the baton and ran with it, organising the Ride 4 Glendyne, which saw him raise an amazing $45,000 for the project. The Patrick Rafter Cherish the Children Foundation donated another $10,000 towards the oval, and finally the Queensland Baptist Care organisation tipped in the rest of the funds to make the project a reality. Thanks to all these agencies and people like Simon Boss Walker, Ray Krueger, Ben de Jong and

        , the Glendyne students now have a beautiful new oval to use for their sport and recreation.

        Queensland Baptist Care deserves a big pat on the back for the good work being done at Glendyne. It is a very special school. It is really a fantastic part of the community and a strong link between youth at risk and the wider community. Individual learning programs, small class sizes, personalised and family support and beautiful, tranquil grounds all add up to make a great learning environment for the students. The special qualities of Glendyne are well recognised by the local community, with great fundraising efforts made by community groups and charities to help support it. The rewards come in seeing young people who are facing social challenges enabled to live their lives more securely and going on to live happy and successful lives and to play their part in their communities. I think the proof is found in a few comments by former students which I recently found on the school’s website. One student said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The best school ever and I wouldn’t change school for anything because it has changed my life.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another student said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The school that if you take the chance you can get a fresh start.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think that is a marvellous result.
