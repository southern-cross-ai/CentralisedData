        Petition regarding ABC property sale
       </b>
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Thank you for your letter dated 8 May 2009 and attached petition concerning the proposed sale of land owned by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) at 600 Coronation Drive, Toowong, QLD.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The Australian Government provides an overall level of funding for the ABC but has no power to direct the ABC in relation to its property transactions. Under subsection 25(1) of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983, the ABC has the power to acquire, hold and dispose of real or personal property.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The land at 600 Coronation Drive, Toowong is owned by the ABC, and was previously the site of the ABC’s Brisbane headquarters prior to its evacuation in 2007 due to staff health concerns.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       In the case of the Toowong site, the ABC Board resolved that it should be sold by way of a full market tender. The sale of the property in this manner allows any entity, including government and semi-government entities such as the Queensland Government, or the Brisbane City Council, to participate in the sale process. The resolution of the Board in this case is in line with the Commonwealth’s Property Disposal Policies, that is, that properties should be sold on the open market and at full market value, provided there is no alternative efficient use for that property.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The ABC is required to fund the development of its new headquarters at South Bank and, as was noted by the former Government, proceeds from the sale of the Toowong site are to be invested into the new accommodation.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Thank you for bringing this matter to my attention.
      </p>
      <p>
