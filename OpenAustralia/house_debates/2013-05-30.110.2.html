        I rise to speak about some extraordinary work coming from the Wesley Research Institute in Brisbane. I recently had the opportunity to attend the Wesley Research Institute gala dinner in honour of the donors, both individuals and organisations, who give so generously to the institute. It was held at the beautifully restored

        .

        The Wesley Research Institute is a leader in clinical research in Australia. It encourages a culture of medical research in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Hospital" rel="nofollow">

        and throughout UnitingCare hospitals and in the private hospital sector generally. The institute also brings together researchers from other organisations in vital collaborative research. Most importantly, many people are benefiting from the progress that this research is making in patient care. This work, however, could not continue without the generous support of many individuals and organisations, and I was pleased to hear Queensland minister

        APLNG is developing a significant energy project in central and south-west Queensland. The members of APLNG—

        and Sinopec—will fund a major research project to improve the health and wellbeing of the people in the regions in which the project is being developed. The Wesley Research Institute will plan and coordinate the research in collaboration with other research organisations. The researchers will examine what factors determine the health of people in the

        and Gladstone regions and propose solutions to address the issues. APLNG will commit up to $1 million over the next two years for the project, which is also supported by the Queensland government. This is a wonderful initiative and a truly ambitious program that should have long-term benefits for people in rural and regional Queensland, and ultimately in many other parts of Australia and other countries.

        I would like to recognise the dedication of Wesley Research Institute chairman, Martin Albrecht
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC" rel="nofollow">
         AC
        </a>
        , and the board who work so hard to raise money for this vital research. The dinner on Saturday raised $1.3 million—an amazing achievement. It gives me great pleasure to speak of the Wesley Hospital's achievements today. I believe that funding of medical research is the best long-term investment a government can make in the health of the Australian people. The Wesley Research Institute is indeed a leading light in the fields of Australian medical research and practice.
