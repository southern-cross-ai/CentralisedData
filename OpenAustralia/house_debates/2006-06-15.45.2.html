        I have been asked questions recently about disruptive behaviour in the chamber, related to members moving around the chamber and what were seen as orchestrated interruptions, including the display of placards. Concerning the possibility that movement around the chamber by members may interfere with the television broadcast, I am advised that it is not possible to identify which camera is producing the picture being used for the telecast at a particular time. Standing order 62 clearly indicates that members must take their seats promptly, must not remain in the aisles and must not walk between the chair and any member who has the call. I remind members that their individual conduct should be courteous, not only to their parliamentary colleagues but also to those members of the public who are watching and listening in the galleries or via the parliamentary broadcast.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also note that there has been significant noise and disruption during question time over recent sitting weeks. Any member who has the call is entitled to be heard by the House.

        ’s role is to ensure that this happens and to take action if there are attempts to interfere with a member’s right to speak with minimal disruption. Earlier this week a question by the Leader of the Opposition and the response by the Prime Minister were disrupted by a display of placards. Whilst a member with the call may make a passing reference to a displayed object or article, members without the call may not do so and will be dealt with accordingly.
       </p>
       <p>
        The standing orders aim to establish a minimum standard of behaviour expected of members at all times they are in the chamber so as to maintain the dignity of the House and to enable the member with the call to be heard without noise or disturbance. Again, I remind all members to ensure that their language is characterised by good temper and moderation and that directions given by the chair are complied with.
