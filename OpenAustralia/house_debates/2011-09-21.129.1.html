        I take this opportunity to congratulate the Scoresby football club on their outstanding success this year. Last Saturday, I had the opportunity to see some of the Eastern Football League's,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EFL" rel="nofollow">
         EFL
        </a>
        , grand finals at the Bayswater oval. This is the biggest day in the EFL calendar for one of the biggest leagues in the country. Scoresby, which is one of two first-division clubs in the electorate, played in each of the three grand finals that day: the first division final, the reserves final and the Colts first division final. While they only won one of these finals and were narrowly defeated in another, the fact that they were in all three grand finals on the day makes Scoresby, in my view, the most successful club in the league in 2011. This is particularly impressive as they do not have the same access to resources that some of the other clubs with poker machines or very wealthy supporter bases might have.
       </p>
       <p>
        On-field success is, of course, very important for a football club, but it is not the only thing. How a club conducts itself on and off the field is also important. I have been particularly impressed with Scoresby, as I have with the other clubs in Knox this year, in this domain. Large football clubs like Scoresby are a very important part of the social fabric of our society. Along with the schools and churches, the large sporting clubs, particularly football clubs, are the hubs of our local community. A club like Scoresby not only provides opportunities for dozens of people to play footy but also provides a place for the whole community to congregate, socialise and have a sense of belonging.
       </p>
       <p>
        Scoresby football club brings whole families togetherâ€”kids, young adults, parents and grandparents. There are very few other places today where this occurs on a weekly basis. I am proud to be associated with this club as a sponsor and, with my wife, as the Nos 3 and 4 ticket-holders. I congratulate the captain of the first division team, Matt Krawczyk, on his outstanding leadership and being a great role model for our community. I similarly congratulate his team and the other teams for what they have achieved this year. Equally importantly, I congratulate the club president, Phil Llewellyn, and his committee, which consists of Melissa Kavanagh,

        , Paul Major, Brent Cadd, Sean Kavanagh and Jason Wolk.
       </p>
       <p>
        On a more sombre note, yesterday Balwyn Football Club player Shaun Bergin passed away after suffering fatal injuries from an accident in a game played earlier this month. I offer my condolences, alongside those of the EFL and the other clubs to Shaun's family; his wife, Jess; his friends; and his club and team members.
