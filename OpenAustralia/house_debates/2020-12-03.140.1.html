        Today, 3 December 2020, is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day" rel="nofollow">
         International Day
        </a>
        of People with Disability, and events have been planned all around the country to celebrate this. In my speech this morning I thought I would try to touch the hearts of some people around Australia who, no doubt, right now are receiving word that their child—their child to be or they may already have a child—has a disability. In February or March of 2002, my wife and I were just those people. I remember very, very well getting the 10-week scan, the doctor looking very concerned, getting referred to a specialist and then being told that it's unlikely that you are going to bring home a child—and I remember the fear and the trepidation that that caused.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wanted to say to anybody who is in that environment right now, whether you are grandparents, aunts and uncles or of course the parents who are receiving that news, that—whilst of course I'm not making any judgements about people—where there's life there's hope. It's very difficult to raise a child with disabilities but, speaking from experience, Sarah, who was born with a lot of problems and has had over 50 operations—has brought us a lot of joy. She graduated from year 12 a couple of weeks ago. She is a national multiclass swimmer and she is my inspiration. So for any families out there that are facing this right now, children with disabilities bring so much joy to families. I just want to say to families now that may be experiencing this: you are not alone. There are so many different organisations and groups out there that will help you get through this. It's tough, it's hard and it's not fair. There will be a loss of tears, there will be a lot of anger, but your community, your fellow Australians, will wrap our arms around you and we will support you through this. For all those who are living with a disability: your government—and it doesn't matter whether it is us or Labor—and your state governments will do what we can to support you, and God bless.
