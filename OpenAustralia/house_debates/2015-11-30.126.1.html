         </small>
         <p>
          In my speech on the second reading I spoke in support of the legislation before the House, including the package of amendments which emanated from the recommendations made by the Parliamentary
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee" rel="nofollow">
           Joint Committee
          </a>
          on Intelligence and Security. So I do not intend to say any more relation to that, but I do wish to speak briefly in relation to those additional matters that were circulated by the government as a result of the advice that was received by the government last week.
         </p>
         <p>
          As the minister has referred to, the government received advice in respect of the constitutionality of the amendments emanating as a result of the recommendations from the PJCIS. As a result of that advice, the government met with both me and the shadow Attorney-General to seek an additional amendment to those amendments in order to further bolster the constitutionality of this legislative package.
         </p>
         <p>
          There were constitutional issues raised during the hearings of the PJCIS, and I spoke about that in my speech on the second reading. The opposition at that time made it clear, as I do now, that it is of course for the government, in bringing legislation before this parliament, to be certain of the constitutionality of that legislation, and we were provided with a letter from the Attorney-General to the Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, which was made public, assuring us of the government's confidence in the constitutionality of the legislation.
         </p>
         <p>
          In raising with us the issue that there may be further amendments to those that emanated from the parliamentary joint committee, it was also made clear that the motivations for those was in respect of constitutionality, and we again sought assurances from the government that this would assist in the ultimate constitutionality of the legislation before the parliament. The Attorney-General wrote to both me and the shadow Attorney-General on 25 November making it clear that these additional amendments seek to further enhance constitutionality of this legislative package.
         </p>
         <p>
          Once again, I make the point from the view of the opposition that it is of course for the government to be confident of the constitutionality of this legislative package. We appreciate the letter that was provided on 25 November giving an indication of the government's confidence in these new amendments and what they do in terms of the constitutionality of the package, and it is on the basis of that that we continue to proceed forward in support of this legislative package. But it is of course for the government to be confident of the constitutionality. It does, as a result, change the substance of the recommendations that were agreed to by the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliamentary_Joint_Committee_on_Intelligence_and_Security" rel="nofollow">
           Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security
          </a>
          , in particular, in respect of recommendation 15, which goes to the question of a judicial review which ultimately is available to those persons who have their citizenship cancelled by virtue of their own conduct. Whereas previously there was a mandatory requirement in recommendation 15 for the minister to consider whether there were any extenuating circumstances such as would warrant the rescinding of a loss of citizenship resulting from the operation of a person's conduct, that is now a matter of discretion for the minister.
         </p>
         <p>
          Again, we sought clarification from the government in respect of the ultimate ability for judicial review to be available to persons in this circumstance. As the minister made clear in his speech, and as we understand has been put into the supplementary explanatory memorandum, and as was provided in a letter to the opposition again by the government on 27 November, the right of judicial review for all persons who find that their citizenship has been revoked as a result of their own conduct is still available, albeit that it is narrowed by virtue of this amendment. The continued presence of a judicial review is important for the opposition in continuing to support this process, which we do. We also note in that sense that the critical focusing of this legislation which emanated as a result of the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security—that is, the limitation of a loss of citizenship by operation of conduct to those people acting overseas—remains intact and is unaltered by virtue of these new amendments.
         </p>
         <p>
          As result of all of that, the opposition is comfortable to move forward and support this package of legislation. It is important legislation. We do, as a parliament, need to have as our primary responsibility keeping our nation safe. The minister is right when he says that there is an unprecedented level of concern in relation to our nation's security. In doing that, we have to get the balance right of people's rights versus addressing the needs of our nation's security, and the opposition believes that this legislative package ultimately does that.

          </small>
          <p>
           The House has before it today a sheet of government amendments to the bill. In the main, these amendments give effect to the recommendations of the Parliamentary
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee" rel="nofollow">
            Joint Committee
           </a>
           on Intelligence and Security. I spoke to those recommendations in my second reading speech on the bill on 12 November. As the minister for Immigration has indicated, there have been two further developments since that time, and the amendments before the House today reflect both of those developments.
          </p>
          <p>
           The first is the government's correction of an error it made in the earlier form of these amendments. That error was in the drafting of section 33AA(3), which implements the recommendation of the committee that the bill be clear about what level of intent is required for a person to renounce their citizenship by conduct while overseas. The relevant recommendation was recommendation (2) of the committee's report, which read:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
            The Committee
           </a>
           recommends that changes be made to clarify that the conduct leading to loss of citizenship listed in proposed section 33AA of the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Allegiance to Australia) Bill 2015 is intended to be considered in light of the meaning of the equivalent provisions in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Code" rel="nofollow">
            Criminal Code
           </a>
           Act 1995, and is not intended to be restricted to the physical elements.
          </p>
          <p>
           The earlier form of the government's amendments misstated the effect of the equivalent provisions of the Criminal Code. Under section 100.1 of the code, an act is not a 'terrorist act' unless:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           (b) the action is done or the threat is made with the intention of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause; and
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           (c) the action is done or the threat is made with the intention of:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           (i)   coercing, or influencing by intimidation, the government of the Commonwealth or a State, Territory or foreign country, or of part of a State, Territory or foreign country; or
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           (ii)   intimidating the public or a section of the public.
          </p>
          <p>
           In the initial form of the amendments circulated by the government, the bill would have covered acts done with the intention of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause or coercing or intimidating a government or the public.
          </p>
          <p>
           This was a minor slip, but it had major consequences. The conduct elements of the Criminal Code's terror offences are, by design, broadly drawn. Terrorist conduct is distinguished from other forms of criminality by its particular motivation. As originally drafted, an inappropriately broad category of conduct going far beyond the Criminal Code offences would have been captured. Labor raised this matter with the government, and I thank it for making the necessary amendments to correct this error.
          </p>
          <p>
           The second is the government's change to the process by which the Minister is to consider exempting a person from the revocation of their citizenship by conduct while overseas. The committee had, in recommendation (15) of its report, recommended that the minister be obliged in every case to consider exercising his or her power to exempt a person from revocation, according to a range of criteria the committee considered relevant. In the earlier form of amendments circulated, the government had implemented this recommendation. Late last week, however, the government indicated to Labor that the Solicitor-General had advised that the constitutional prospects of the bill would be strengthened if the bill did not oblige the minister to consider exercising this exemption power, but merely permitted him or her to do so. It is unfortunate that this did not occur until after some 40 members of this House had spoken on the bill on the basis that the government accepted all of the recommendations in the intelligence committee's report.
          </p>
          <p>
           The government has refused to release any of the Solicitor-General's advice on the bill, despite repeated requests from Labor. I asked the Attorney-General to release the new advice by the Solicitor-General relating to this particular matter, but I regret that he refused to do so. The Attorney-General did, however, provide a letter to me and the member for Corio, dated 25 November, which apparently summarises the Solicitor-General's advice. In particular, the letter reads:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           The Solicitor-General is of the view that, by imposing a
           <i>
            requirement
           </i>
           that the Minister consider circumstances of excusal from the operation of s. 33AA and s. 35, the effect of those provisions is that the Minister could be regarded as the effective decision-maker, thus violating the self-executing character of the scheme. Were such a ministerial decision to be characterised as an exercise of judicial power, there would be a significant risk that the High Court might take the view the requirements of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapter_III" rel="nofollow">
            Chapter III
           </a>
           of the Constitution, as explained,
           <i>
            inter alia
           </i>
           , by the
           <i>
            Boilermakers case
           </i>
           , would make the exercise of the power
           <i>
            ultra vires
           </i>
           .
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           The proposed changes directly address the concerns of the Solicitor-General by removing the requirement that the Minister
           <i>
            must
           </i>
           consider exempting persons from the automatic operation of the provisions, and by inserting a requirement that the Minister observe the rules of natural justice and give reasons only in circumstances where he
           <i>
            does
           </i>
           make a decision under the relevant provisions, but making it clear he has no obligation to do so — thus obviating the concern that the Minister is the effective decision-maker. The changes are specifically designed to maximise the Bill's prospect of withstanding a constitutional challenge.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           These changes have been reviewed by the Solicitor-General and he has now advised that they have a good prospect of being upheld by the High Court.
          </p>
          <p>
           As with the bill as a whole, Labor has accepted the government's assurances about the constitutional implications of this particular provision, and we will support the government's revised amendments accordingly. It is important to note that the committee's recommendations about what the minister is to consider when deciding whether to exempt a person from the operation of the bill will remain fully implemented by these amendments.
          </p>
          <p>
           I also finally note the government's explanation, in a letter dated 27 November and addressed to me and my colleague, the member for Corio, of the availability of judicial review under the revised form of the bill. The Attorney-General stated in that second letter:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           The basis for the conclusion that the terrorist-related or foreign fighting conduct has occurred may be reviewed by a court. … Any judicial review would extend to whether or not the contract was engaged in, whether the person engaged in that conduct with the requisite intention, and whether or not a person was a dual citizen.
          </p>
          <p>
           I commend the amendments to the House.

           <p>
            Parliament is being treated with contempt. We are dealing with serious issues of terrorism; we are dealing with the serious issue of the relationship between parliament, the executive and the courts. We are dealing with one of the most fundamental issues: when someone, who is a citizen and who might even have been born here, loses their citizenship. In walks the minister with 14 pages of amendments to some of the most fundamental laws in this country at a time when we are dealing globally with one of the most serious questions about how to deal with terrorism and how to make Australia safer. He says, 'Pass this now—I want you to trust me that it's all going to be okay.'
           </p>
           <p>
            These provisions have not been the subject of any inquiry by this parliament. These provisions have not been looked at by dispassionate experts in the field who know that when emotions are running high it is often the worst time to be making decisions about fundamental principles of the rule of law and to be giving the executive more powers. These have not even been looked at by the closed shop of a joint committee, which Labor and the coalition set up to deal with this matter in the past. Instead, the parliament is told just to accept this on trust and that a backroom deal has been done. Parliament is about more than backroom deals between Labor and the Liberals. Parliament is about giving an opportunity to scrutinise what a government is doing when it is trying to use national security issues to gain votes. Blind Freddy can see that that is what has been going on, certainly under the previous regime. What we have here is a

             Tony Abbott
            </a>
            era bill brought back up and given life and now being pushed through the parliament, and it is being done, sadly, with the support of the opposition.

            have said from the beginning that this bill will do nothing to make us safer. We have stuck with a fairly straightforward principle, which is that if someone breaches the laws of this country and take steps that indicate they are going to attack us and attack our people and potentially kill people, if they commit acts that are tantamount to murder and break laws, then you prosecute them in the courts and whatever punishment the courts mete out is what they get. If someone comes to Australia or if someone is born in Australia and wants to bomb us or wants to attack us and they are convicted, then send them to jail. As to the suggestion that someone who is so motivated that they are prepared to blow themselves up and take others with them is somehow going to be persuaded by the fact that they might have their citizenship affected, from the beginning we have said to show us the evidence. The government has none, and it has none because this has been an ideological bill from the start. That is why organisation after organisation that is concerned about safety, that is concerned about terrorism but above all is concerned about the principles that define a democratic society have lined up to say there is nothing in this that will make us safer and it might not work. It suggests that we were onto something. It suggests that we were onto something when we said this bill will not make us safer, and in fact it might contravene some of the fundamental principles of rule of law in this country.
           </p>
           <p>
            The government comes in here with 14 pages of amendments and tells us to take them at face value because they will tidy things up. Have these amendments been drafted so recently, and is there some urgency that means the legislation has to go through now? No. The footer of this document suggests that these amendments were prepared on 27 November at 5.12 pm. They were done last Friday—they could have been out in the public domain and open to scrutiny from commentators, from academics, from journalists and from people who are going to be asked to vote on it but, no, as is the case with everything with this government, transparency is a foreign concept—secrecy rules the day: hold onto these amendments, do a backroom deal and then come here and ask us to pass them. I am very proud that at least on this the Greens will be part of the opposition, because this is a Tony Abbott era bill that will do nothing to make this country safer. I urge Labor: please stop rolling over for the government on this stuff because if you give them an inch they will take a mile. There is nothing that they will not do. They will talk about dual nationals, they will come after sole nationals next and this country will not be any safer for that. I will not be a party to this process of passing bad laws quickly. We do not know what is in these amendments, and 25 per cent of the population do not vote for either Labor or the coalition and they and their representatives in this place deserve to be treated with respect. You cannot come in here on such a fundamental matter and ask us to pass amendments and laws like this.

             The fundamental point made by the member for Melbourne relates to the applicability or success of this bill. The government was guided by what has happened in the United Kingdom, where for some time a bill introduced as I recall by the Blair government allowed for dual citizens to be stripped of their British citizenship, and in fact it went further than that, and that has resulted in a number of people, having lost their citizenship, not returning to the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
              UK
             </a>
             . Our judgement, and certainly the judgement of others, is that that does go to protect our national interest, by providing a situation where we do not render somebody stateless but we disallow the return of that person to Australia if they have engaged in a terrorist act. That is in our national interest. I think the contribution from the member for Melbourne earlier would only reinforce in the minds of good thinking Australians, the vast majority of Australian's, that thank goodness the Greens are not in control of national security in this country.

             on Intelligence and Security, which is made up of members of the government and the opposition, properly contemplated the provisions the government put forward in this bill. It does provide checks and balances, it does provide the appropriate responses and it does allow people to review in certain circumstances decisions that have been taken or ways in which this bill acts. On that basis we do believe we have a balanced approach to what is a very serious issue and, as we have seen in Paris, in Lebanon and elsewhere in recent weeks, this is a significant issue that will only get worse and governments in Western democracies like ours need to respect the rule of law, we need to respect people's individual liberties, but at the same time we need to protect the public. The balance has been struck here. It is a refined bill, a bill improved with the assistance of the committee and with the input of the opposition, and the final proposal does meet the fine balances required in such a response. I can only, again, reject the suggestions made by the honourable member and point to the fact that the Greens have never really supported any national security bill. That is why this government is determined to make sure that we have the appropriate balance in place ultimately to protect the Australian people.
