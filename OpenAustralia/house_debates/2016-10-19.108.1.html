        Unfortunately, it is not only taxpayers who have had to pay the price of this government's incompetence when it comes to this scheme. It is students, far too many students, who have been the real victims—students who have had their time completely wasted; students who now have unfair debt associated with them; students whom this government, time and time again, has left to fend for themselves. Labor have long argued that we want to be on the side of standing up for these students, and that is why we have been calling for a VET Ombudsman for a very long time now.
       </p>
       <p>
        A year ago, in the Senate, Labor moved to establish an ombudsman, and at that time the minister said that he would look into it. He promised to progress the idea. Well, a year has come and gone, and still there has been no action from this government, which has so often been the case when it comes to this particular case. Again, Labor moved first, and the government sat back, dillydallied, did absolutely nothing. But then last week, when these bills were introduced into the House, the Assistant Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocational_Education" rel="nofollow">
         Vocational Education
        </a>
        and Skills, who is at the table now, said in her second reading speech that the government would finally agree and would establish a VET Ombudsman. 'Finally, some action,' we thought. Finally, the students would have someone to help stand up for them. The funny thing is, when you take a look closer look at the legislation which is before the House, when you really have a look at the bills, it reveals that there is nothing in them at all that would create this ombudsman.
       </p>
       <p>
        So, a year after looking into it, after issuing a discussion paper, seeking feedback from the sector on the idea of an ombudsman, we are left with nothing from this government. That is despite the risk of these very bills declaring the idea of an ombudsman to be the most popular idea put forward by the government in their discussion paper. That is despite students, providers and consumer advocates all calling for an ombudsman.
       </p>
       <p>
        More than anything else, this amendment today is about protecting the innocent victims of this government's incompetence when it comes to overseeing the VET

        scheme. It is about protecting those who have suffered the greatest as a result of their mismanagement. This is a practical way to help those students who have been ripped off, who have been left with huge debts, with nothing to show for them. That is why these amendments before the House now create an ombudsman and give them the power to both resolve disputes and represent students. Ultimately, the point of these amendments are to help students with unfair debts and to get redress for the exploitation that they have suffered as a result of those opposite.
       </p>
       <p>
        We cannot give students their time or their hopes and dreams back, but the least we can do is make sure that there is help at hand so that they have some way of trying to progress getting their money back. It is essential that such an ombudsman have the powers and the resources needed to protect students past, present and future.
       </p>
       <p>
        We note that the government is proposing to flick this idea off to a Senate committee inquiry. I stand here today and say that there is not a single member of this chambe

          I thank the opposition for proposing the amendments. I understand the opposition spokesperson, the member for Adelaide, discussed these with the Minister for Education and Training before they were circulated.
         </p>
         <p>
          As I noted in my second reading speech on this bill, the government intends to establish an ombudsman. This will increase student protections and provide a further avenue for dispute resolution. I note that Labor never provided an ombudsman when it established or expanded the

          scheme. Stakeholders have raised a number of different models for an ombudsman, which the government is currently considering. So, whilst it supports the principle of an ombudsman, it will not support the opposition's amendment.

             <p>
              Those sitting behind me are saying, 'It was your scheme; it was your scheme.' Let's have a look at the facts. This was something that was created under the Howard government, and in 2012, when the Labor government expanded the scheme, this mob supported it. This mob actually supported it in 2012, but then they sat back and did absolutely nothing when they were in government. The problem here is one of maladministration and a terrible lack of oversight and accountability. Five ministers over three years sat there, enjoyed having their new title, but did not do any work and clearly had absolutely no idea what was happening on their watch.
             </p>
             <p>
              This amendment makes sure that what happened on their watch can never happen again. It ensures that the government have to publicly release the data on the number of students, on the courses that are in, on how much the loans have grown and on the amount of the fees. They have to release this data every six months, because we know that, whilst we cannot trust this Liberal government to do their job and provide adequate oversight, if it is publicly available we will stand up and do it ourselves. When it comes to supporting vocational education it is Labor who will stand up and fight for a strong sector and a strong
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
               TAFE
              </a>
              system. We know that the sector, academics and the parliament will be able to keep a close eye on the job that five liberal ministers have shown they are too incompetent to do if this amendment is supported. I commend it to the House.

               and vocational education and training to benefit students. This includes requiring VET FEE-HELP providers to publish their maximum fees on the My Skills website and increasing the level of detail available in the annual VET FEE-HELP statistical reports. In light of this, the government believes it is worth examining whether there are further transparency measures that could be incorporated into the new program. That is why, as the member for Adelaide knows, the minister has written to the Chair of the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee, Senator McKenzie, to ask that the committee's inquiry into these bills give consideration to the opposition's amendments as well as alternative models for a VET Student Loans Ombudsman, additional levels of transparency for reporting and any administrative issues related to both the ombudsman and reporting arrangements. The government therefore opposes the amendment.
