       <p>
        Today, there is great sadness on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        . The funeral service was held this morning for Roslyn Bragg; Adam Holt; their children, Madison and Jasmine; and their nephew, Travis Bragg, who were cruelly washed away in the flood that hit the Central Coast last Friday week. The service was conducted by police chaplain Reverend Father Mark Watt. I would like to thank the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Police" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales Police
        </a>
        for the comfort and support that they gave the family over the past week. Last week, I visited the flood areas around
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chittaway_Point" rel="nofollow">
         Chittaway Point
        </a>
        and other areas on the Central Coast with Minister Ellison. We saw at first hand how disaster services were being delivered on the coast. We visited a disaster centre that had been set up by the Premier’s department in the Wyong Council chambers. Many people were there, including people from the Premier’s department, Centrelink, insurance companies and family support services for people affected by the floods. I would like to pass on my thanks to the volunteers of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">
         SES
        </a>
        , the New South Wales Fire Brigade, the rural fire services and the many others who assisted. People were getting trees off houses, clearing roads and getting people away from the flood areas. The community spirit on the Central Coast was fantastic. People were helping one another. It was great to see the support out in the streets. The disaster recovery centre is still open—it was open all weekend—and people can avail themselves of that service.
