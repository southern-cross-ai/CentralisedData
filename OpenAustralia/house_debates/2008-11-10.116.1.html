       <p>
        On 18 October I had the pleasure of joining the Upwey and District Community Bank for their 10th birthday celebrations. The bank has been doing an amazing job supporting local residents. Ten years ago the Upwey community lost their last remaining bank branch when the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         Commonwealth Bank
        </a>
        closed its doors. Fortunately the Upwey community bank was established, with the great assistance of Peter Marke, the chairman, who has been doing an amazing job since its inception; Jean McLennan, the deputy chairperson; and Devendra Desai, the treasurer-secretary. They have shown great leadership and initiative over the 10 years since they established the bank. I would like also to thank the board of directors, including Karel Coxhill,

        , Dot Griffin, John Paull, Graeme Turpin and Alison Burr. They have been doing an amazing job.

        Just to give you an insight into what Upwey Community Bank have done for the local community: over that 10-year period they have donated in excess of $531,000 to the local community, including $96,000 this year alone. Some of the recipients of their generosity include Tecoma Primary School, Selby

        , Kallista Kindergarten, Upwey-Tecoma Bowls Club, Dandenong Ranges Music Council and Fernlea House. Fernlea House in particular has received $45,000 in funding. Again I congratulate all those involved in the Upwey community bank, who have been doing an amazing job over the last 10 years.
