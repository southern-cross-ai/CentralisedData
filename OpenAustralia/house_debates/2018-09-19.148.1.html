       <p>
        I stand here today to put on record my strong scepticism about the Trans-Pacific Partnership, or the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPP" rel="nofollow">
         TPP
        </a>
        , as it is commonly referred to. Labor has tried to make a number of amendments to protect workers and to protect future Australian governments, all of which
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        members have voted down. So I am in a situation where either I have to agree with trade or not agree with trade, so allow me to make my point very clearly.
       </p>
       <p>
        I 100 per cent do not trust an LNP government with trade deals. Time and time again, the LNP have proven that they cannot be trusted to protect Australian workers or to put Australian workers first. The current LNP TPP waives labour market testing and includes clauses that allow foreign companies to sue the Australian government. These clauses are known as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISDS" rel="nofollow">
         ISDS
        </a>
        provisions. To waive labour market testing does not put Australian workers first and, quite frankly, is absolutely nonsensical.
       </p>
       <p>
        It should be mandatory that before a company brings in an electrician, or a carpenter, or a mechanic or a metal worker from another country that the company should first check whether or not there is an Australian citizen who can do to job. This is just common sense, especially in electorates like Herbert, where unemployment is hovering around nine per cent and youth unemployment is anywhere in-between 18 per cent and 20 per cent. To engage in an agreement that allows foreign companies to sue the government because a change in our legislation may impact on the company just clearly demonstrates where the interests of the LNP government areâ€”seemingly with foreign companies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia's economic growth is underpinned by our ability to sell our goods and services overseas, but Australia cannot prosper if our workers are not protected. Australia cannot prosper if our legislation cannot be passed without fear of foreign retribution. That is why, now more than ever, if this TPP goes through the parliament we need a Labor government. Labor will permanently fix the way we do trade deals, to put Australian workers first and to stop future governments from signing up to trade deals that include clauses that allow foreign companies to sue the Australian government.
       </p>
       <p>
        A Labor government will introduce laws that prohibit governments from signing trade deals that waive labour market testing or include ISDS provisions. We are a clever country. As such, we can have trade and protect our workers. It is just that we can't have both under an out-of-touch LNP government.
