       <p>
        I rise today to table a petition that was presented to me by a constituent in my electorate of Macquarie, Mr Daniel Wass. This petition represents the culmination of several years of hard work undertaken by a father separated from his child. Daniel presented this petition to me during the last sitting period and undertook a touching and memorable journey to this place. Along with extended family and friends of the Wass family, Daniel set off from Springwood in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains" rel="nofollow">
         Blue Mountains
        </a>
        on Saturday, 2 February and cycled all the way to Canberra, collecting signatures for his petition along the way. Daniel and his crew of supporters arrived at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        on the morning of Tuesday, 5 February, and I was delighted to be able to meet them at the steps of this place. The Wass family was warmly received by both me and the shadow minister for foreign affairs, and Daniel presented us both with the petition.
       </p>
       <p>
        I first met Daniel several years ago, shortly after the abduction of Sean, and I was instantly struck and inspired by the determination of this father to find out what had happened to his son. Any parent will instantly be touched by the plight of Mr Wass and can readily sympathise not only with his grief but with his considerable anxiety to know that his child is safe and well. Daniel has not heard anything of his son since his removal in 2010, and one can readily imagine the tremendous toll this separation and uncertainty would have on any parent.
       </p>
       <p>
        I rise therefore not only to table this petition but to congratulate all those involved in the search for Sean. At the beginning of this year and after many delays and countless representations made by me and my office, we were delighted to hear that Sean had been placed on the Interpol yellow watch list, a significant escalation of the fight to find him. Shortly before this, Daniel informed me of his plans for both this petition and his awareness-raising journey to this place, and I readily offered my support. We have therefore opened 2013 with some positivity, and, hopefully, reinvigorated spirits as the search for Sean continues.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today marks the culmination and fruition of a small part of what has been, and will continue to be, an exhaustive and lengthy process. It is to be hoped that the great love, compassion and support that has been offered to the Wass family by the local Springwood and Blue Mountains community will continue to inspire and help to assist them through the next stages of the search Sean. I present the petition.
