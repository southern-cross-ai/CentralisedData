       <p>
        I rise today to praise the ongoing work of the Hills Community Aid and Information Service, based within my electorate of Mitchell. The Hills Community Aid and Information Service is a not-for-profit, non-government and non-sectarian community organisation based at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baulkham_Hills" rel="nofollow">
         Baulkham Hills
        </a>
        , near our local Centrelink office. It is responsible for what I regard as some of the most important work in our community—looking after those who, in an ostensibly well-off and well-managed community, often get missed by government and its programs because of the social demographic breakdown of many government programs. This kind of service brings out the best in so much of our community and our people because it is largely a voluntary organisation. Of course, it receives so many generous donations from benefactors in our community and people who are willing to give their money to look after others who are not as well off as them.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to recognise and praise the patron, Alan Overton AM—recently the President of the Parramatta Leagues Club—the inaugural ambassador, Sonya Phillips and the directors—Geoff Green, Gloria Antonio,

        and Ray Whiteman. These people make an enormous contribution to this community foundation that has been set up in north-west Sydney to make a big difference to people’s lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have some wonderful donors who have come on board to ensure that this community foundation of north-west Sydney is a great success. They include Heartland Suzuki, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Australia_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         National Australia Bank
        </a>
        , the Hills Shire Council, DonorTec, Mitronics, the Hills Club, Elkie Photography, Office National, Coffee Club Rouse Hill and Donato Holdings. Of course the federal government has made a significant contribution by ensuring that this worthy foundation is a deductible gift recipient; therefore all money raised through fundraising events which are to the declared mission in the foundation’s articles receive a generous taxation treatment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Residents in Baulkham Hills and in my electorate know the importance and worth of this foundation. However, I would like to specifically acknowledge the efforts of a long-standing pillar of our Hills district community. While he is a resident of the neighbouring federal electorate of Berowra, he has been a part of the Mitchell community through his voluntary work and capacity to care for others across many different levels. Bill Dixon has tirelessly served the Hills and Hornsby shires for more than a quarter of a century. He has served in a variety of roles with distinction, including in the Hills Community Aid and Information Service, with which he initiated the home and community services program in 1983. He provided transport to the isolated and the disabled, long day care and respite to the elderly, and home modifications and maintenance for the frail.
       </p>
       <p>
        In our tough economic times today, the Hills Community Aid and Information Centre also assists families in need, and it is seeing an increased demand. It is also seeing a more challenging time in raising money to meet that demand, and I believe government will have to take another look at and seriously consider ways of ensuring that charity and voluntary organisations are equipped to meet the needs of this upcoming challenge that we will face. The Hills Community Aid and Information Service offers no-interest loan facilities to cover expenses for these families, and also provides many other vital services.
       </p>
       <p>
        While the centre has been operated by the Hills Shire Council and has received federal government funding, Bill has held the office of president for six years and served as its treasurer for 18 years. During this time, he was able to grow the operation to include counselling support and a community bus. He has pioneered a spirit in the Hills and a wonderful community organisation that has delivered so much to so many. He still volunteers at Hills Community Aid and Information Service four days a week, in spite of advancing years, and provides support for emergency relief. He is most active in visiting our local representatives and ensuring that this vital organisation and foundation has the footing to continue. He is motivated by caring for others and he has made a wonderful contribution to our community. He has also served as a volunteer firefighter.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bill Dixon is someone who I regard as one of those fine Australians who has served in so many capacities and adds so much to the fabric of our society. He has also been associated with Meals on Wheels. He became its founding president in 1987. He successfully lobbied the government of the day for seed funding, and was granted $287,000. He went on to assist Meals on Wheels with setting up its organisational systems and structures. He has a fine history in voluntary work and making a great contribution in our community. I want to specifically acknowledge him here today. However, with the time I have remaining, I also want to thank and congratulate all of the directors and the inaugural ambassador of the community foundation in north-west Sydney, praise the work they are doing for our community and assure them that I will be working to help them in any way I can.
