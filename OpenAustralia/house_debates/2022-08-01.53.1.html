        I'm pleased to let the House know that last month the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Lions Club
        </a>
        of Eltham held their changeover dinner. While, unfortunately, I couldn't personally attend, I have heard the reports from the dinner and I'm really pleased to have been updated on the work of this great community group. I want to pay special tribute to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Talbot" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Talbot
        </a>
        , who is a local Eltham legend. I recognise the many years of service he has given to the club and to his local community, and I congratulate him and thank him for once again taking on the role of president.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Lions Club of Eltham was formed in 1976, and it's spent the last 46 years in service to the residents of my electorate of Jagajaga and the surrounding area. Anyone who knows the Lions Club knows that no job is too big and no job is too small. In fact, they pick up so many of those things that fall between the cracks elsewhere. They run a legendary sausage sizzle. I myself have enjoyed it a number of times. And I know that people, particularly older people, in my electorate appreciate the services that they provide.
       </p>
       <p>
        So congratulations to the Eltham Lions. They're part of a broader group of more than 25,000 Lions members across Australia who provide this service in their communities. I'm really proud to provide my support to local groups such as the Eltham Lions. I know that they continue to make lives better in my community and in others across the country.
