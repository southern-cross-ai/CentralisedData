       <p>
        I have long considered violence against women, in particular domestic violence, to be one of the most serious and distressing issues in our community. The date 25 November marks White Ribbon Day, the day declared by the United Nations as the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women. By now, we should all be familiar with the statistics. One in three women are likely to experience physical or sexual violence in their lifetime and one woman is murdered each week by a current or former partner.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although there's been a profound transformation in public awareness of domestic violence and the level of discourse, it remains a longstanding and complex issue. Domestic violence continues to remain one of the most disturbing issues in our country today. More than 50 per cent of all assaults reported to local police in my electorate are domestic violence related and 60 per cent of boys growing up in an abusive household are likely to become abusers themselves. One thing I find even more confronting is that 50 per cent of girls growing up in such an environment are likely to take an abuser for a lifetime partner, and then the cycle goes on; it perpetuates. Domestic violence remains the leading cause of homelessness amongst women. Added to this are the far-reaching personal and social ramifications for our community. The economic cost of domestic violence is currently estimated at $21.7 billion a year. These statistics make it pretty clear that domestic violence is not an area about which we can afford to put our heads in the sand and say, 'It's just a matter for the authorities.' This is a matter for our communities. We must work together to develop and integrate greater coordination of multi-agency approaches and responses to this issue. However, for me it's a personal issue. As a husband, a father of a daughter and a very proud father of six granddaughters, I am petrified at the thought that, statistically, one of these women who mean more than life to me is likely to become a victim of violence.
       </p>
       <p>
        Violence against women is real and it's happening in our neighbourhoods, in our suburbs and in our families. It involves women, no matter how successful, strong or resilient they are and no matter what their ethnic or religious backgrounds are. And most of the victims, through fear of reprisal or harm to their children, do not seek help. The number of unreported cases of domestic violence against women is absolutely staggering. If we are to work towards eradicating domestic violence, we must give women the confidence they need to report these crimes and to engage with our police. We need more of our men to stand up and say that violence against women is not acceptable. We need more men promoting and educating the community about violence against women. The simple fact is we do need more real men. It's not right that women live in fear, not knowing when their partner might once again lash out. And today is also a time we should remember those women who have lost their lives through domestic violence and offer our prayers for them and their grieving families.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's not enough to give speeches as we approach White Ribbon Day. It is imperative we as a community take responsibility and look out for our families, our friends, our workmates and our neighbours. There are a number of organisations in my community working hard to spread the message of violence against women. I would particularly like to acknowledge Karen Willis from Rape and Domestic Violence Services Australia as well as Mary Mullens from Bonnie Support Services.

        I will be taking part in a

        along with many members here and would like to acknowledge Detective Chief Inspector Darren Newman and his team at Cabramatta Local Area Command for hosting a very significant White Ribbon Day event in a couple weeks' time. As a White Ribbon ambassador, I urge all men to take the oath never to commit, excuse or remain silent about violence against women. Take the oath but live by the pledge. We must break this cycle of violence.

          for the Elimination of Violence Against Women. It acknowledges the work of White Ribbon Australia and so many other organisations across the country who work not just on one day but 365 days a year.
         </p>
         <p>
          While it is important that this parliament support White Ribbon Day, it is of concern to know that such a cause still requires so much attention in Australia in 2017. Despite the unprecedented amount of support from government and so many organisations in the community, we are still inundated with stories that continue to shock us all.

          Thirty-five-year-old Blair Dalton was strangled in her Ettalong home, which she shared with her young children. Blair Dalton succumbed to her injuries and died in hospital. A 34-year-old woman in Campsie was left unrecognisable from critical head injuries sustained after allegedly being attacked by her partner with a hammer and a carving knife. A 30-year-old woman in Whalan was allegedly stabbed by a man who was in contravention of an apprehended violence order. Emergency services staff were unable to save her, and she died at the scene. All three of these incidents occurred in the space of one horrific week in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
           New South Wales
          </a>
          during September this year.
         </p>
         <p>
          Sadly, these incidents are not isolated. They are the very real human tragedies and faces of alarming statistics that we simply cannot ignore. One in three women have experienced physical or sexual violence perpetrated by someone known to them. This is often a person who is currently or was formerly in a position of trust such as a spouse or partner. One in four children are exposed to domestic violence in the home. On average in Australia one woman each week is killed by a current or former partner. I find this statistic staggering. And we know there are still so many incidents left unreported.
         </p>
         <p>
          Domestic violence is a scourge on our society. It does not discriminate by geography, affluence or education. Critical to the eradication of the problem is ownership of the issue. Government can and should provide leadership, but in the end it requires each and every one of us as individuals and communities not to turn a blind eye when we believe domestic violence or abuse might be occurring. And, yes, it requires a commitment from all people and men in particular to stand up and condemn violence against women.
         </p>
         <p>
          The breadth of the problem gives rise to the need for victim support services across the country in towns big and small. I rose to speak on this matter a year ago and was pleased that our government had just implemented a $100 million domestic violence strategy which was already making inroads. Recently the government announced the expansion of a very worthwhile pilot program to deliver targeted services to women through specialist domestic violence units. In my own electorate we already see a growing sense of ownership of this issue. The work of Mary's House, a relatively new women's refuge, has been greatly utilised and appreciated. It joins an existing refuge in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lane_Cove" rel="nofollow">
           Lane Cove
          </a>
          area which has done so much with limited space and means.
         </p>
         <p>
          I want to thank the volunteers and staff who dedicate their time to ensuring the safety of women and their children seeking shelter and support in our area. Having worked with both organisations, I have just been so impressed by the efforts of so many volunteers to raise funds to provide the critical needs of those services, and that support has extended to local businesses and other community organisations who have been prepared to get involved.
         </p>
         <p>
          I'm hopeful that the government will be able to lend some financial support to both these services through the current round of the Stronger Communities Program. Their applications have my strong support. Yet I also know that the services for such demand are still inadequate on the

          of Sydney. Much more needs to be done to support women and their children in need of an immediate sanctuary and support in our area.
         </p>
         <p>
          I also want to acknowledge the work of our Defence forces. Locally,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
           HMAS
          </a>
          <i>
           Penguin
          </i>
          has organised a fun run on behalf of Defence in which all the competitors will take the oath:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          … never to commit, excuse or remain silent about violence against women.
         </p>
         <p>
          I applaud those schools in my electorate which have also taken action to promote the cause of White Ribbon Day and to instil in their students that there is no excuse for violence against women, that there is no age too young to call it out and that this cause is one for which we must all accept responsibility.
         </p>
         <p>
          White Ribbon Day is a timely reminder for us all to take responsibility for the violence we see occurring around us. It asks us to act rather than to ignore, and to see it for the crime upon us all that it is, and not as merely a private matter. Together, we must bring about the end of violence against women.

          <p>
           I'm pleased to support this motion put forward by my good friend the member for Fowler. And, like him, I agree that domestic and family violence are the scourge of our time. It is a disgrace that, on average, one woman a week is killed by a partner or a former partner in our nation; it is a disgrace that one in four Australian women has experienced physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner; and it is a disgrace children are being exposed to this violence, with more than half of the women who experience violence having children in their care.
          </p>
          <p>
           While we talk about violence against women, I want to stress that all violence is wrong. But the evidence is undeniable that family violence is gendered. Both women and men are more likely to experience violence at the hands of men: 95 per cent of all violence is reported to be perpetrated by men. While men are more likely to experience violence from other men in public places, women are more likely to experience violence from men they know—and most often in their own home, the very place where they should feel safest. While, statistically, family violence is a gendered problem, the solution must be driven by everyone. It is especially important that men speak out against family violence and that men—all men—are part of the solution.
          </p>
          <p>
           The member for Fowler's motion recognises
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Ribbon" rel="nofollow">
            White Ribbon
           </a>
           Day, which will be held on 25 November. White Ribbon Day was initiated in Canada in 1991 by a group of men in Toronto. Tragically, it was formed in reaction to a horrible episode of violence against 14 female university students. The men wanted to raise awareness of violence against women and to encourage men and boys to be a part of the solution. White Ribbon Day is now recognised in over 57 countries around the world. White Ribbon Australia strives to encourage Australian men to be a part of the solution, to make the safety of Australian women an issue for Australian men too.
          </p>
          <p>
           I want to stress that only some men resort to violence. Most men, most gentlemen, would agree that violence against women is never acceptable. But in order to change the culture that allows some to think it is acceptable, we need all men to speak out when they see any violence against women. We need all men to speak out when they see women being disrespected. We need all men to speak out when they see women not being treated equally.
          </p>
          <p>
           We know that the predominant cause of violence against women is gender inequality. Readjusting the balance between men and women in power, resources and opportunity will only be accomplished when all genders are driven by that same objective. Then it starts out calling out the little things. It's those excuses for bad behaviour that we accept: 'Boys will be boys', or, 'He was just being a lad.' It's the patronising comments: a male tradie saying to a capable woman, 'You better check that with your husband.' It's the sexist comments: the football coach saying, 'Don't be a girl.' It's the gender pay gap that sees women doing the same job as men but earning on average 16 per cent less pay. This is gender inequality and it should be called out every time, even if it is uncomfortable. A brief moment of feeling uncomfortable is nothing compared to the suffering of women who are beaten black and blue—or worse, murdered by their violent partner.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is up to everyone, but especially men, like me, to challenge gender inequality every day, wherever we see it and wherever we hear it. We need to change the conversation so that men are part of the solution, not the cause. Until we have gender equality we will not eliminate violence against women, and until we have eliminated violence against women we need to make sure that women experiencing family violence are given the support that they need from services like the Women's Legal Service Queensland, which is actually based in my electorate of Moreton.
          </p>
          <p>
           This year's White Ribbon 'my oath' campaign is asking men to take an oath. The oath is: I swear never to commit, excuse or remain silent about violence against women. I will be taking the oath and I encourage every Australian man to do the same. Whether you're a politician, a bus driver, a lawyer, a plumber, a teacher, an accountant or a baker, whether you live in Sydney, Brisbane, St George or Sunnybank, every man has the power to stop violence against women. Each time we don't speak out we are giving permission for violence against women to continue and for harm to flow on to children too often. Each time we don't speak out we are empowering the abuser. Each time we don't speak out we are failing every woman and, ultimately, every man.

            I swear never to commit, excuse or remain silent about violence against women. This is my oath. In 2014 I took this oath when I became a
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Ribbon" rel="nofollow">
             White Ribbon
            </a>
            ambassador, as part of my strong belief that women should live in safety and free from all forms of violence. For most of us it comes as the natural way of things, and presents a personal challenge to us when others either do not share our views or, maybe without specific intent—in fits of personal rage or drug induced detachment—breach the trust between a man and woman in relationships.
           </p>
           <p>
            Women are not goods and chattels. They are not, or should not be, subservient to men and, though on average they have less physical strength than men, there is no circumstance where the exercise of physical dominance can be acceptable. Sadly and alarmingly, violence against women continues to be one of the most prevalent human rights abuses in Australia and around the world. As a White Ribbon ambassador I believe all men must act to prevent domestic violence and all violence against women. In recognition of White Ribbon Day, on 25 November, I want to speak out in defence of women experiencing violence. Being an ambassador means taking an active stand against any form of violence committed against women, and those who take this oath make a promise to live by the oath not to commit, excuse or remain silent about this issue.
           </p>
           <p>
            Statistics can be very confronting. They are in this case, depicting an appalling story of abuse of women and children by men. It is true, I have come into contact with some men who have been victims of abuse and violence committed by their female partners, and that is no more acceptable than the violence committed against women. But the numbers overwhelmingly demonstrate that the predominance of violence is committed by men against women—in fact, some are quoted in the wording of this motion:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            (a) one in three women have experienced physical and/or sexual violence perpetrated by someone known to them;
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            (b) each week approximately one woman is killed by a current or former partner; and
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            (c) domestic and family violence is the principle cause of homelessness for women and their children;
           </p>
           <p>
            As men I and my fellow males, particularly those of us in positions of authority in our communities, must confront those statistics. We must publicly stand against violence and abuse. Violence comes in many forms. Emotional violence, where men control finances, isolate women from family and friends, humiliate, demean and belittle, make threats against children or threaten women with injury or death, can cause long-term emotional damage.
           </p>
           <p>
            Anecdotal evidence shows us the vast majority of violence against women goes unreported, and its prevalence has been unbroken and has intensified through the decades. It is an intergenerational issue and the damage is long-term. Victims are left with shame, fear, resignation and powerlessness for change. Women blame themselves for not being perfect, for not trying hard enough, for not living up to what their partner demands. This is an appalling state of affairs. We must instil in our young women and girls self-worth and the complete and utter intolerance of any kind of violence. We must instil in our young men and boys respect for women.
           </p>
           <p>
            The federal government's domestic violence campaign launched last year is part of a $100 million women's safety package targeting how parents raise young boys. Violence against women starts with disrespect. The excuses we make allow it to grow. We must support women who have suffered violence. If someone who has been suffering from domestic violence wants to make a permanent separation, they need support from family and friends and from organisations that offer safe refuge for abused women and children and that specialise in aiding victims of domestic violence. Women's stories are often unheard, but the long-term damage to them and their families is insidious. I encourage males using violence in their relationship to seek professional help and to use their networks to promote discussion and social change. Hurt people seem to hurt people. But we can do better. We need to do better. The wellbeing of both our sons and daughters is at stake.

             I'd like to thank the member for Fowler for his very committed response today regarding this issue. And I want to place on record today my very strong support for this motion of the member for Fowler on behalf of the community groups, advocates and people I have met in my short time that I have been a member of parliament, who are doing everything they can to stamp out, remove and abolish domestic and family violence. I have read the reports, I have heard the speeches and I have listened to the victims. One in three women have experienced physical violence since the age of 15 and one woman dies at the hands of a current or former partner every week in this nation. Every year, that's around 300,000 women who are experiencing domestic and family violence.
            </p>
            <p>
             Like every member of this House, I am really proud to be a strong supporter of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Ribbon" rel="nofollow">
              White Ribbon
             </a>
             Campaign, not only as a representative in this place but also as a community representative. We know White Ribbon's aim is to generate understanding of domestic violence. It acknowledges men speaking to men about stopping violence against women because, as we know, that's the most powerful catalyst for change. Through education, preventive programs, community partnerships and bringing people together, we will see a reduction in these horrific statistics.
            </p>
            <p>
             I want to place on record again today my sincere and genuine thanks for an event that I attended in my local community. I'm so proud to represent schools like
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenala_State_High_School" rel="nofollow">
              Glenala State High School
             </a>
             , which hosted its first domestic violence symposium, simply entitled 'Inala says no'. This campaign event brought together community representatives, parents, students, teachers and the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Police_Service" rel="nofollow">
              Queensland Police Service
             </a>
             . The event served as a timely reminder of this important issue and it really provided important knowledge, support and opportunity for the school community to collaborate on solutions. We heard from speakers like: Professor Ross Young; a school based police officer, Senior Sergeant Paul Ennis; and the Glenala State High School captains, wonderful student leaders in our community, Jonathon Bryan and Sheba Ooms. The school also unveiled two new murals created by the students to highlight the issue, and I want to thank my local newspaper, the
             <i>
              Southwest News
             </i>
             <i>
              ,
             </i>
             for highlighting this wonderful initiative. These murals were made from 262 individual tiles painted by the students. They represented the shared advocacy and solution of the local community on the day.
            </p>
            <p>
             While sadly domestic and family violence remains a part of many Australian communities, I'm immensely proud to see schools like Glenala State High School in my electorate taking a lead role. I want to publicly thank the school principal, Ms Anne Lawson, all the teachers, support staff and particularly the students who really stepped up to show what it means to say no to domestic and family violence.
            </p>
            <p>
             One of the other significant community events that I'm proud to support—I went along to it last year and it will be held again—was organised by a wonderful community advocate, Lome Swan, of Anglicare in the Oxley electorate. People like Bevan Doyle, Bruce Manu Sione, my good friend Uncle Albert Holt, Eddie from Kiwi Daddys and Jeffrey Mwanza, who was a White Ribbon ambassador for 2009 and has been a dedicated social worker in our community, will come together again to celebrate and to recognise the important White Ribbon event on Saturday, 25 November, at a community breakfast.
            </p>
            <p>
             These events being held right across the country shine a spotlight on the scourge which is domestic and family violence. It is not just the community works I want to acknowledge; I want to acknowledge and thank members of workplaces which are now gathering and recognising White Ribbon events. Over the years, I've attended a number of business sites and I want to recognise large organisations like Capral Aluminium which, alongside the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Workers'_Union" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Workers' Union
             </a>
             , have taken a key leadership role on worksites right across the country to highlight the issue of domestic and family violence, to stamp this issue out and to make it clear—whether it be in the community sector or at worksites—that, when it comes to domestic and family violence, our community says no.

              I thank the member for Fowler for moving this critical motion today. Every year we stand up at this time to recognise
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Ribbon" rel="nofollow">
               White Ribbon
              </a>
              Day and to decry violence against women. I look forward to a day when this speech is no longer an annual event. But news from across the globe shows us that this scourge is not dissipating. Of course, it is good that the despicable acts of
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Weinstein" rel="nofollow">
               Harvey Weinstein
              </a>
              can finally come to light and lead to the ruin of his empire, but we cannot overlook the thousands of daily acts of unreported domestic violence across our country. That is why White Ribbon Day is so important.
             </p>
             <p>
              I am proud to say that I am a White Ribbon ambassador and have been for many years. It is an honour and a responsibility, and I take it very seriously. It requires me to pledge never to commit, condone or remain silent about violence against women—a vital pledge that we all should take.
             </p>
             <p>
              The following shocking statistics help demonstrate the prevalence and severity of violence against women. On average, at least one woman a week is killed by a partner or former partner in Australia. One in three Australian women has experienced physical violence at some time since the age of 15, and one in four Australian women has experienced physical or sexual violence by an intimate partner. One in four Australian women has experienced emotional abuse by a current or former partner. Violence against women is not limited to the home or intimate relationships. Every year in Australia over 300,000 women experience violence, often sexual violence, from someone other than their partner. We must remember that it's not just physical violence that matters. Eight out of 10 women aged between 18 and 24 were harassed on the street in the past year.
             </p>
             <p>
              These figures are as terrifying as they are appalling. So, as a government, we must be proactive in trying to turn this around. That is why in the last budget the government committed an additional $39 million over the next three years to community legal centres, with it to be prioritised for family law and domestic violence matters. We're also providing $3.4 million over two years to expand specialist domestic violence units so they can provide essential trauma and services to women who are experiencing or are at risk of domestic or family violence.
             </p>
             <p>
              Housing is also important in addressing the issue of domestic violence. Women who have no alternative home are often forced onto the street or, worse, forced to remain with their abusive partner. So the government has announced a new Housing and Homelessness Agreement that continues to prioritise people affected by violence and family violence. The government will provide an additional $375.3 million over the next three years, from 2018-2019, to fund ongoing homelessness support services, with funding to be matched by state and territory governments.
             </p>
             <p>
              While this funding is vital, it is directed at helping women who have already been abused. But in this, as in all things, prevention is better than cure. This is why, in partnership with the states and territories, the government has launched a $30 million national campaign to change young men's attitudes towards women and violence. While in its early days, the message is getting out there, with almost 42 million online views of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
               TV
              </a>
              commercials, and the campaign website has been viewed over 546,000 times. This campaign is vital. We urgently need to get the message across to the men and boys of Australia.
             </p>
             <p>
              As I have said in the past, I firmly believe that men are not naturally violent. Violent and abusive behaviours are learned. Sadly, for some, violence is a way of expressing masculinity. Or sometimes it simply comes from a complete lack of respect for women. All men must develop respectful relationships with women and we must be an example to each other. We must treat women with respect and as equals. Words can damage. We must consider our language and our actions and how they can be interpreted. Attitudes must change. Violence against a partner is never excusable. No matter how tense relationships may get, violence is never the answer. And victims of abuse must know that it is never their fault. I say to all men that the most masculine, the most manly thing you can do, is to always respect your partner. White Ribbon Day marks the day to make these statements, but that respect must be expressed every day of the year.

                Violence against Women
               </a>
               . And in marking White Ribbon Day it is important to note the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women because that really goes to the heart of what is driving so much of the public response to White Ribbon Day—genuine concern about the prevalence of family violence in our country.
              </p>
              <p>
               I have listened to some of the other speakers in this debate, and I note that they have been talking about the importance of men treating women with respect and as equals. It's important to make those comments because it's not just a lack of respect that is the source of family violence and domestic violence; it is gender inequality. That's what the research says, that's what the work that has been done in relation to preventing family violence says—that the heart of family violence is gender inequality. Therefore, when we look at White Ribbon Day, it is important to acknowledge that men have a role, as the predominant perpetrators of family and domestic violence, in ending family and domestic violence. That's why men's based organisations like White Ribbon and men's behavioural change programs are important in the struggle to reduce and ultimately eliminate violence against women. And that means we require recognition from this place that gender inequality is something that requires concentrated effort to ameliorate and ultimately end.
              </p>
              <p>
               You can't stop domestic violence without dealing with gender inequality, and that is why policies and programs aimed at increasing and enhancing the status of women remain so important in discussing domestic and family violence. When the other speakers in this debate quite rightly talk about respect for women, they need to acknowledge that that respect has to come from an acceptance and acknowledgement that women and men are equal. It's not enough to treat women as equal as a form of discretion; you have to genuinely believe that women are equal to men in order to have meaningful action in relation to family and domestic violence.
              </p>
              <p>
               I commend White Ribbon for the work that it does to engage with men in corporate Australia, in sporting organisations and elsewhere to raise awareness in respect of family violence and the unacceptability of using family violence and of committing violent acts against women and children. I think the work they're doing has been recognised as being incredibly important, and it's part of a much broader movement across our nation to respond to family violence. Of course, government has an important role to play in reducing and ultimately eliminating family violence and domestic violence.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's worth noting that this month is Sexual Violence Awareness Month—and, of course, sexual violence and domestic violence do tend to go hand in hand. As the previous speaker mentioned, so many of us have been touched by the scandal that's currently enveloping Hollywood in relation to sexual harassment and sexual assault by people with power in that particular industry and area. So many of us have been seeing stories crop up in our Facebook posts from friends who have been the subject of sexual harassment and sexual assault. It's quite wearing, isn't it, Mr Deputy Speaker? It's quite grating on the soul to be constantly bombarded with the sense that every woman you know has been the subject of sexual harassment and sexual assault.
              </p>
              <p>
               But let's take that feeling of weariness and turn it into action. Don't be sceptical about the idea that every woman you know has been the subject of sexual harassment or sexual assault. There is a great deal of prevalence. It is unsurprising to me to see how many of my friends are joining #MeToo and saying that they have been the subject of it. What also needs to happen is that the men in our lives need to talk about their role in ending sexual harassment, sexual assault and, of course, domestic violence. That comes back to the issue of equality, of understanding and believing that women are equal to men.
              </p>
              <p>
               So much more needs to be done and said in relation to family and domestic violence. I hope that the government will ensure that domestic violence is back on the

               agenda as soon as possible. I look forward to seeing much more work being done to respond to and reduce and ultimately eliminate family violence in Australia.

                On 25 November 2017 we celebrate
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Ribbon" rel="nofollow">
                 White Ribbon
                </a>
                Day. It's a day when we, as men in particular, stand against violence against women. Just last week in this House, I spoke about the campaign Polished Man, which seeks to stop violence against children. So too we, as men, must do all we can to put an end to violence against women, which happens, unfortunately and sadly, most commonly in the domestic environment.
               </p>
               <p>
                I should acknowledge that not all domestic violence occurs where men are the perpetrators. It sometimes happens where the woman in a relationship commits acts of domestic violence against her male partner, and that is equally damaging to the man that's impacted. But I'll leave that for another day.
               </p>
               <p>
                Today in my local newspaper, the
                <i>
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
                  Sunshine Coast
                 </a>
                 Daily
                </i>
                , there was an excellent article which dealt with the all-too-common issue of domestic violence in my home state of Queensland. According to the
                <i>
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast_Daily" rel="nofollow">
                  Sunshine Coast Daily
                 </a>
                </i>
                , the Queensland Police Union has been lobbying the Queensland state government to introduce an offence under the Queensland Criminal Code of 'commit domestic violence'. Many people in this place, and perhaps those who may be listening, wouldn't know that it wasn't an offence to commit an act of domestic violence. I'll say that again: in Queensland, it's not an offence to commit an act of domestic violence. Whilst some people may be charged with assault, it is not a specific offence. This is something that the Queensland Police Union has been pressing the Queensland state government on, and it's something that I support as a sensible reform.
               </p>
               <p>
                It is only an offence in Queensland if a person breaches a domestic violence order. Whilst offenders can be charged with assault, the Queensland Police Union says that, by introducing the offence of 'commit domestic violence', less time would be spent by police applying for domestic violence orders through the civil jurisdiction of the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magistrates_Court" rel="nofollow">
                 Magistrates Court
                </a>
                . Mr Leavers, who is the Queensland police union president, said it took two officers an average of four hours to apply for one domestic violence order. When you look at the statistics in Queensland, which are absolutely appalling, police lodged 7,144 applications for domestic violence orders with the Sunshine Coast and Gympie courts alone between 2012-13 and 2016-17. What those stats mean is that about 28,000 hours are spent per year in domestic violence order applications. That's work done by the police that could be spent doing other things which are obviously also important for police. Mr Leavers said that the domestic violence epidemic is creating a massive increase in workload for police and is, in turn, affecting police's ability to effectively undertake their job, and that stands to reason. If they are concentrating much of their time on domestic violence breaches, then they can't be out doing other work as well. So I call on the Queensland Labor government to support the Queensland Police Union's push. It's a sensible reform and it's something they should look at immediately.
               </p>
               <p>
                When I was overseas recently, investigating and researching mental health, it really dawned on me that in Europe—which, similar to Australia, is not immune to domestic violence—one of the key causes that impacts on mental health is domestic violence, just as homelessness is often a result of mental health issues. If we want to resolve many of our mental health issues, particularly in our women, we must address the issue of violence against women. Thank you.

                <p>
                 I commend the member for Fowler for proposing this motion in support of
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Ribbon" rel="nofollow">
                  White Ribbon
                 </a>
                 Day, which is 25 November this year. White Ribbon Day is a day that has its genesis in the very thing it stands to prevent. On the afternoon of 6 December 1989, a student from the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Montreal" rel="nofollow">
                  University of Montreal
                 </a>
                 massacred 14 of his fellow female students. Such a horrific act traumatised Canada and brought the issue of violence against women to the forefront of its collective consciousness. In response, a group of men in Toronto decided to speak out and work to stop men's violence against women. In 1991, they initiated a male-led movement known as White Ribbon and the annual awareness-raising event White Ribbon Day.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Continued trauma from violence against women, the ever-increasing public awareness of the number of women and children affected by violence against them by men, and the willingness of men demanding that we all stand up against violence against women now sees White Ribbon as an international effort with actions by men and boys in over 57 countries. This year alone, 39 women have already died in Australia due to violence against them. Countless others are seriously injured both physically and mentally. Much of this violence is also directed at children, or at least done in front of them, causing lifelong psychological impacts on them as well. Indeed, in
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                  Western Australia
                 </a>
                 more of it occurs in my electorate than in any other in Perth.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I'd also like to pay tribute to those women in this parliament, such as the member for Lindsay and others, who have shared their stories with the nation to bring further national prominence to the scourge of violence against women in our society. However, it shouldn't have to take this for people to know that violence against women is wrong. It is simple human decency that at least in words we try to teach and expect our children to learn from a very young age. Alas, despite all the words and rhetoric, any of us who are parents know that it's actually our actions and attitudes that make the difference.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The cyclical nature of domestic violence and violence against women is well understood. That a lack of respect for women begets violence against women is also well understood. But it is here that we have a breakdown, with not enough men willing and able to say to those that they see or know committing acts of violence that it is just not on. And so I'd like to acknowledge a group that gets little acknowledgment in this place, in fact gets quite the opposite most weeks: the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
                  CFMEU
                 </a>
                 in Western Australia. Under the leadership of Mick Buchan and
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_McDonald" rel="nofollow">
                  Joe McDonald
                 </a>
                 , the WA CFMEU have been leaders in the Labor Party and the union movement in supporting paid domestic violence leave, campaigning against domestic violence, providing monetary and other support to women's refuges around WA, and supporting White Ribbon.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Despite what those opposite might think and say, unions do have a very positive role to play in social leadership in this country. In a time of declining union membership, when the union for industries are as male heavy as construction and mining, the CFMEU stands up and says to its members that violence against women is not acceptable. And not only does it stand against it but it also fundraises to support the refuges that support those victims of domestic violence. That is leadership; it is leadership by action. It's the leadership that makes us on this side of the chamber proud to be union, just as the actions of paid domestic violence leave across the union movement make us proud. While we can and should talk about such things in this place, the time for talking really should be over. The government should pull its finger out on paid domestic violence leave.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I would also like the government to consider a White-Ribbon-specific initiative. The White Ribbon Australia Workplace Accreditation Program recognises workplaces that are taking active steps to stop violence against women, accrediting them as White Ribbon workplaces. The program builds on existing gender equality and diversity initiatives, providing the tools to strengthen a culture of respect and gender equality at all levels of an organisation. The program supports organisations to respond to and prevent violence against women, whether it occurs inside or outside an organisation, through supporting women experiencing violence, holding perpetrators to account, supporting all employees to challenge inappropriate behaviour and strengthening gender equality within the broader community. Current White Ribbon accredited workplaces include the

                 There is one final piece of talking that is very important and it is this oath that, as a decent human being, I am happy to make and make often: I will stand up, speak out and act to prevent men's violence against women. This is my oath. My challenge to all Australian men is: will you take the oath too?

                 <p>
                  I first want to commend my colleagues who have already spoken, and particularly the member for Fowler for bringing about this motion. As a father, a husband, a brother, a son and a grandson, I am proud to make women's safety my concern. And, as a member of parliament, I commit to doing whatever I can and whatever I need to do to help end men's violence against women.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  As a society, we have made a lot of progress with regard to changing attitudes and pulling up people when they make a remark or do an action that may be construed as sexist or harmful, but we still have a long way to go. One part of the campaign that I feel is particularly important is recognising that violence against women is not only physical but extends to things like financial abuse, emotional abuse, verbal abuse, social abuse, sexual abuse, spiritual abuse and stalking. This by no means underestimates the harm that physical violence can do but goes to the heart of the issue surrounding violence against women—that is, violence is also sexual and psychological harm and, in some cases, includes threats, coercion or acts that can make someone feel unsafe, violated or unable to live freely.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Some time ago, I was aiding a Dunkley woman by the name of
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Jane" rel="nofollow">
                   Sarah Jane
                  </a>
                  who was dealing with an abusive ex-partner, who also put her child at risk. Speaking to Sarah Jane highlighted to me not only some degree of the harm that domestic violence does but also the ongoing effects and repercussions of dealing with those experiences, not only for her but also for her son. In Australia, one in four children is exposed to domestic violence and one in three women has experienced physical and/or sexual violence perpetrated by someone known to them. This statistic—that it even exists—is far too high and we as a society need to do more.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  As a husband to my wife, Grace, of over eight years and as a father to a young daughter, this issue is particularly pertinent. I don't want to see any violence towards them or to any children or others across Australia. We need to stop all domestic violence against women, as highlighted by
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Ribbon" rel="nofollow">
                   White Ribbon
                  </a>
                  Day, but also against anyone, whether they be children, the elderly, men, women, people of different faiths, people of different ethnicities and so forth.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I again thank the member for Fowler for bringing this motion, which is so important. It's very important to raise this issue not only in this House but right across Australia. I hereby therefore pledge, along with my colleagues in this House, to never to commit, excuse or remain silent about violence against women. I will stand up, speak out and act to prevent men's violence against women. This is my oath.

                  <p>
                   This is too familiar a subject area for me to stand in this place and speak from the data, the statistics or the need to do more. Sure, all of those things are true, and I thank sincerely the member for Fowler for his advocacy and all of the speakers who have contributed to the debate on this motion. I thank them for their awareness and their commitment to the thousands and thousands of victims of domestic and family violence, of whom there are too many, whose stories are too common and whose lifetimes are too deeply affected.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Last year I stood in this place and delivered my own personal account of my experience of family violence. I shared that in here because too often we rattle off statistics and speak as policymakers about the nation's greatest shame but rarely speak as experienced survivors. It had a profound effect not just here but around the world, and I want to place on record my thanks to the thousands of people who watched it, who shared it, who opened up, who disclosed and who shared their own personal stories and to those who reached out.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I think the reason this had such an impact was that it gave people, childhood survivors, women who are victims and those who work in that space the permission to speak honestly and freely about their experiences. It was a reminder of how powerful this place can really be. The stories and disclosures of so many people flooded my office—some of true horror. For the benefit of those unfamiliar with this subject area or who question our nation's need to do more to address this, I want to read into the

                  <p>
                   A woman says:

                  <p class="italic">
                   I too grew up in a house filled with chaos, alcohol and violence. I have a lump in my throat and tears in my eyes at that very admission—it is a secret I hold close, shared only with my 3 siblings.
                  </p>
                  <p class="italic">
                   so thank you for sharing your story as a professional woman, a Mum, a victim, a survivor. I do not have your courage, yet.

                   Another woman reflects on her own childhood. She says that, as a woman:
                  </p>
                  <p class="italic">
                   … I am, at age 62, still astonished at the ongoing effect … on me. 'Surely I can put it behind me now' … are words often echoing in my head, and mostly,

                  <p class="italic">
                   I do.

                  <p class="italic">
                   Bravo … I spent my childhood in perpetual fear, I was abused institutionally and in the family abode. I watched for years—
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   as—

                  <p class="italic">
                   my mother was almost daily bashed … she was in a wheelchair with only use of one arm. She relied on us kids—
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   to do everything for her. The account continued:
                  </p>
                  <p class="italic">
                   My siblings and I never said anything about our abuse … because no one wanted to know.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   A child trapped in the cycle shared her story:
                  </p>
                  <p class="italic">
                   I also grew up in a similar situation. My mother stayed as she had no choice. Along with my sisters, there were five of us, we were subjected to watching the physical and emotional violence my mother endured at the hands of our father; the times as a small child we had to do the shopping for my mother, who didn't want to—
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   go out—
                  </p>
                  <p class="italic">
                   with a blackened eye.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Another woman said:
                  </p>
                  <p class="italic">
                   On one occasion I hid in the property next-door. The neighbours came home and I had to hurtle past them and retreat back to my own house.
                  </p>
                  <p class="italic">
                   I was so embarrassed—nothing was ever said about it. I know they saw me … perhaps they just knew.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Another person said:
                  </p>
                  <p class="italic">
                   My mum would put us to bed—
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   one night—
                  </p>
                  <p class="italic">
                   and then suddenly decide to go on a holiday for 10 days without telling us, we thought it was odd until we realised she was spending her holidays in hospital. That was many years ago, for me, I have never spoken of this not even to my own wife.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Perhaps the email from a legal professional best sums it up:
                  </p>
                  <p class="italic">
                   It is only by sharing stories and making the owners of these stories visible that we can ever hope to change the attitudes of many in the community and improve the lives of children.
                  </p>
                  <p class="italic">
                   In the work that I do within the Court I confront these attitudes daily and am especially dismayed at the ignorance of so many … lawyers and other professionals.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   These are a handful of stories shared with me. They are all unique. They all happened. They all have a theme.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The shame and the degree to which this is hidden in plain sight continue today. We have an obligation to change the story for so many children growing up in the cycle of violence, and we should. There isn't a single person in this country who should not feel empowered to do something about this. We need to ensure that victims can access paid domestic violence leave. We need to get our Family Court system right so that it does not continue to traumatise already traumatised people. It's time to end the ability of perpetrators of domestic violence to cross-examine their victims. We need to acknowledge that one in three victims is a woman, and one woman is dying each week.

                    I appreciate the opportunity to talk about this topic, which is very important, particularly for regional communities. As we know, 25 November marks

                    for the Elimination of Violence Against Women. Obviously, a very important part of White Ribbon Day is raising public awareness and changing the attitudes and behaviour that allow this violence to continue. It is testament to this effort that the White Ribbon movement has now spanned 57 countries.

                    , which, for some reason, has very high rates of domestic violence. But there is a dedicated team of people who are working hard to bring this issue to a close, to the extent that we can. The White Ribbon Day committee there does a fantastic job. It was formed in early 2016. I'd like to make special mention of a number of the committee members here today, including Chair Nicole Paterson, vice-chairs Granton Smith and Andrew Pansini, and also committee members Danielle Haase, Janelle White, Krista Mentjox, Darren Tindall, Alli Gartrell, Ash Morrow and James Cashen.

                    Last year they organised an event in Orange that was extremely well supported. It was a treadmill relay that went for 24 hours nonstop. It drew attention to the fact that 80 women were, tragically, killed in violent incidents Australia-wide in 2016. The relay kicked off with the committee painting a giant white ribbon on the sloping grass roof of the Orange Regional Museum. Each participant in the relay was given a small, handwritten card with the name and details of a woman who had died in violent circumstances in the preceding year, which, I think, really brought the gravity of the situation home for many of the participants and members of the public who passed by and were able to gain information on what the group was achieving. I participated in that relay last year. It had over 50 teams participating, and more than 300 local people registered to take a turn on the treadmill. I can only believe and imagine that this year's will be even bigger.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    As I said, I participated in last year's relay and it was sad that we actually had to hold an event like that to draw attention to this issue, but I think you need to shine a spotlight on this issue in order to bring it to a stop, because the public need to be aware that this can't continue. I think that, for too long, domestic violence has been viewed by the community as a private matter between a husband and a wife, for example. But it's not a private matter; this is criminal behaviour. It's quite often degrading and disgusting behaviour. I think that if the general public knew the details of many of these incidents of domestic violence they would be absolutely appalled at what they learnt. I know that because, in my previous occupation as a lawyer, I came into contact with women who were victims of domestic violence.

                    I'd also like to pay tribute to the Wellington Domestic Violence Collective, Robyn Edwards, Nicolla Giddings, Loretta Stanley, Wendy Peachey, Helen Dowling, Sonsera Boles and Colleen Allen, for their work in raising awareness for White Ribbon Day and organising events in the Wellington community.
