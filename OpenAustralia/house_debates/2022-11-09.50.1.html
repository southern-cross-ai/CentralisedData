        I often rise in this place to lament the lack of country doctors, and I must say I'm quite happy today to have a good story to tell. Dr Holly Deer from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_Brook" rel="nofollow">
         Crystal Brook

        in my electorate of Grey has received recognition as

        at the national awards. She joined the practice in 2012, having been a GP registrar at the Crystal Brook clinic before that time.

        Holly has become a trusted and respected member of the Crystal Brook community, and they really enjoy having her there. She has married to a local businessman and that's a very good thing to do. She now has a family of her own growing up in the mid-north town. In fact, when I rang up Holly the other day to give her my personal congratulations, a couple of those children were making a bit of noise. Like a lot of mothers, she managed to juggle that.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend Dr Richard Mackinnon whose foresight and commitment to rural practice has seen the Crystal Brook Medical Practice not only service the local community with a team of doctors but also become an accredited training practice for registrars, interns and medical students. It is the envy of many regional centres. I just wish I had many more places like Crystal Brook that could attract the number of doctors we need. They provide specialist and allied health services and are a teaching practice.
