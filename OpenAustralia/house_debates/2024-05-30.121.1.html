        With a large electorate like mine, I make sure that I hold at least four mobile offices a month in different townships to given equal opportunity for a face-to-face chat. Generally, the topics brought to me on those days are concerning and quite often deeply personal, ranging from requests for help with problems surrounding government services to notifying me of issues impacting the local area. Occasionally, some people just pop past to give me some positive news. At last week's mobile office in Kempsey, my home town, I was lucky enough to get a visit from the delightful Dianne Fiddes, a passionate advocate for the Lower Mid North VIEW Clubs. Now, my dear old mum has been involved with the VIEW clubs for a long time. For those of you who are not familiar with them, VIEW Clubs offer a network for women to connect with each other in the community whilst at the same time aiding the work of the Smith Family in providing long-term educational support for Australian children and young people in need. Every week VIEW Club members across Australia come together and hear from a guest speaker and exchange ideas on the issues impacting their communities while also raising important funds to help support the Smith Family.

        Dianne popped in to update me on the great work that the local VIEW Clubs have done over the past year. Her region's club have so far sponsored 54 local children, with contributions of over $83,000 that have gone towards supporting them in their primary and secondary school education. That's included digital learning essentials and providing each child with access to the internet, an appropriate device and basic training in digital skills, which we all know are so important today. This is such a wonderful outcome and a testament to what determined regional women can do when they get together.

        I can personally attest that, en masse, the VIEW Club women are a force to be reckoned with, particularly after a few chardonnays at the group's eventsâ€”South West Rocks VIEW Club ladies, I'm sure you know what I mean! But seriously, to every VIEW Club member: thank you for what you do in our community. Each life you have touched has been bettered by the experience, whether the children or the new members. I encourage anyone who wants to lend a hand while making some new friends to get involved. They're always looking for new members. Thank you, Dianne, for the chat in Kempsey. I look forward to hearing the updates, and I also look forward to the South West Rocks VIEW Club Christmas party.
