       <p>
        The COVID-19 pandemic has reminded us that none of us are immune to the challenges of mental wellbeing. We have all felt the pangs of angst, frustration and hopelessness in these past few monthsâ€”particularly if you're from the great state of Victoria, where it's overlaid with frustration and sometimes, yes, anger. Some Australians have tragically lost loved ones before their time to the virus. Finding the strength and resolve to adapt has been more exhausting than normal when isolated from family and friends, particularly when people miss family members' funerals.
       </p>
       <p>
        Countless others, of course, have lost their jobs. Losing work can feel like losing part of our identity, our sense of security, our sense of purpose and, yes, even sometimes our dignity. Without work, we can feel more vulnerable to the roller-coaster of the broader economic uncertainty that sits around this time as a result of the COVID recession. Preserving relationships between workers and employers through JobKeeper has provided some comfort while constructing a real path to a strong recovery. JobSeeker has also helped build resilience for people facing new unforeseen burdens, like homeschooling and separation from support networks. And the federal government has provided assistance in areas like child care and other support grants as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        While social distancing has pushed us apart, it has never been clearer how much stronger we all are when we address those common bonds we share, and that our health overall very much depends on our sense of connection and how we make sure we should prioritise our mental health and wellbeing together. Last month I joined with headspace, in Bentleigh, to host an expert panel of health professionals and volunteers to broadcast their advice and guidance on mental wellbeing in the time of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly for younger residents in our community. They indicate that one of the toughest mental stresses has been our isolation from the fruits of social interaction and engagement, and that making sure we remain virtually connected with friends and family where possible is critically important for all of us and our mental health.
       </p>
       <p>
        At a policy level, a clear take-out was that new mental health challenges demand new innovative solutions. The Morrison government's additional $39.1 million contribution to mental health support in Victoria is a critical part of that. The funding particularly targets and supports younger Australians in secondary school who are very nervous about their circumstances. Now is a critical time, and if anybody wants to review the expert panel then they can do so at the Tim Wilson MP Facebook page, where we've uploaded the content, because any young Australians facing significant mental health challenges at the moment need support.
