        Last week I hosted a seniors morning tea in Parramatta. Around 300 seniors from all across the electorate came for a morning of local entertainment and a talk on eSafety by the local police command. It was a joy to bring local seniors together and celebrate the contributions made by local seniors throughout their lives. First and foremost, I'd like to express my gratitude to everybody who made this event possible. I want to thank the students from Parramatta High, who sang the

        </a>
        ; the Newington seniors choir for their musical performance; the Parramatta Police Area Command for their eSafety talk; and the

        </a>
        for providing the venue, helping to organising the event and being, as they always are, right at the centre of our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Seniors laid the foundation of Parramatta's modern success through their contributions to the local community. They worked hard, built homes, started businesses and raised families. Parramatta's success today is the product of their aspirations achieved. Because of this, local seniors are the fountain of wisdom that we must tap into, respect and cherish. One of the best perks of this job is connecting with the people of Parramatta. What made last week's seniors morning tea a personal highlight for me was being able to meet so many local seniors. They brought with them a wealth of stories and personal experiences as diverse as the places and backgrounds they came from. Many told stories of hope and courage, stories ranging from immigrants building new lives and new homes in Parramatta to locals following lifelong passions, taking risks, creating successful careers and supporting others.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also heard stories of hardship from the many pressures facing local seniors today. Whether it be taking care of children or grandchildren, dealing with a rising cost of living or volunteering to support local communities and social networks, seniors today need our support to help ease the pressure so that they can live out their lives with dignity that they deserve. That's why my office has greater the Parramatta seniors guide to help locals navigate life as a senior. Anybody who would like a copy can sign up on my website to receive one for free. Thank you again to the hundreds of people who attended our seniors morning tea last week. I hope to see you again at the next one.
