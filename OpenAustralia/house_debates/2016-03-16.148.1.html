       <p>
        Every day, 34 people receive the devastating news that they have leukaemia, lymphoma, or myeloma. This is obviously very traumatic for the people and the families involved, and many of them will turn to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leukaemia_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Leukaemia Foundation
        </a>
        for help. The Leukaemia Foundation offers accommodation and many other support services to families in this situation. With some of the treatment, especially if you live in a regional area, you will often have to travel to another hospital a long way away, and you will need accommodation and other support services to be able to undergo the treatment that you need.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Leukaemia Foundation's World's Greatest Shave is their chief fundraiser. It began back in 1998 when a Lismore resident, Cathy Mooney's father Eric, was diagnosed with leukaemia. Cathy and her family got the idea to raise money by shaving their heads. The first World's Greatest Shave took place in Lismore Square back in 1998. More than 200 people participated and $80,000 was raised for the Leukaemia Foundation. Today, it is the foundation's biggest fundraising event: more than 150,000 people from all walks of life shave, wax or colour their hair. In 2007, Cathy was awarded the Order of Australia medal to recognise her work in developing the first World's Greatest Shave. The money raised from this event gives families the emotional and practical support they need, and funds urgent research to save lives.

        Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to share with you some stories of local people and why they are happy to lose their hair this year in the World's Greatest Shave. Teenager Zara Tabor and her friend, Kaisha Bender, decided to do the shave as a tribute to their friend, Siobhan Hoy, who was diagnosed with leukaemia last June. Siobhan joined her friends at The Bottom Pub in Maclean—along with more than 200 other people—to watch them shed their locks. Not only did the night raise $5,000 but the teenagers' hair was donated to a non-profit organisation which makes wigs for cancer patients. Then there is Dain Mavin and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Catt" rel="nofollow">
         Tony Catt
        </a>
        , from Corindi Beach, who were inspired to take part in the World's Greatest Shave by Dain's grandmother, Peg, who has leukaemia herself and is in remission. There are many more stories, but this small sampling shows the determination of people, young and old, to help those with leukaemia, and the Leukaemia Foundation.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge some of the venues and the organisers that have held Shaves across my electorate: they include the Corndale Hall, the Pioneer Tavern at Wollongbar, the Nimbin Hotel and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_Hotel" rel="nofollow">
         Clarence Hotel
        </a>
        in Maclean, and the Moonee Beach Tavern, but there were many more. Thank you to everyone involved and congratulations to all the people and all the businesses involved in this worthy cause.
