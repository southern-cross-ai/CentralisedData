        I rise to speak out against the discrimination by the Liberal government against Victoria, which is still being massively short-changed on infrastructure dollars. Melbourne is the fastest-growing city in Australia. Victoria has around 25 per cent of the population and is the fastest-growing state. In the last two years, Victoria contributed 42.9 per cent of the total jobs growth in Australia. Yet, under the Liberals, Victoria is only receiving 9.7 per cent of funding. Under Labor, Victoria received $201 per head; under the Liberals it's fallen to $105 per head, and it's trending downwards to sink to $46 by 2021.

It's about time Victorian Liberal MPs stood up and called this out. A few crumbs off the federal table are not enough, and
