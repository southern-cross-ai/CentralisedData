       <p>
        I ask leave of the House to amend the notice relating to the time and order of business for the sittings on Monday, 24 November 2014 and Tuesday, 25 November 2014 by omitting the provision for extra sitting time on Monday, 24 November 2014.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I move the motion as amended:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent the following:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) further debate on the motion moved by the Prime Minister in connection with the death of the Hon. Edward Gough Whitlam
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC" rel="nofollow">
         AC
        </a>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QC" rel="nofollow">
         QC
        </a>
        taking place in the Chamber between 9 am and 12 noon on Tuesday, 25 November 2014; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) during the period from 9 am to 12 noon on Tuesday, 25 November:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) any division on a question called for in the House, other than on a motion moved by a Minister during this period, shall stand deferred until after the discussion of the matter of public importance; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) if any member draws the attention of the Speaker to the state of the House, the Speaker shall announce that she will count the House after the discussion of the matter of public importance, if the Member then so desires.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the benefit of the House, this will allow the parliament to sit on Tuesday, 25 November 2014, so that members might complete their speeches on the death of the Hon. Edward Gough Whitlam AC, QC in exactly the same way as we did this week. We think it is appropriate that that continue in the House since it started in the House, and that was the arrangement that the Manager of Opposition Business and I had made before. Until that debate is completed, we will continue to do it in the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Question agreed to.
