       <p>
        I rise in relation to the issue of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord's_Prayer" rel="nofollow">
         Lord's Prayer
        </a>
        being used at the opening ceremony of the parliament each day. There were some comments by some members of this place and in the broader community that suggested that the Lord's Prayer is not an appropriate prayer to be used in this parliament. From my own point of view, I reject that, as do many Australians. In fact, many from my own constituency, when they learned of this suggestion, thought that it had been removed. Let me assure those people that it has not. I know the Prime Minister and many of us in this parliament would share the view that the opening ceremony, which includes the Lord's Prayer, is a very important part of the daily business of parliament. I have a petition that I would like to leave in the parliament. I seek leave to table this petition.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank the opposition. I present this out-of-order petition—it does not meet all of the guidelines—regarding the use of the Lord's Prayer and acknowledgement of country in the standing orders of parliament. This petition was submitted by Pastor Bruce Hallam from the Dalby Churches of Christ and contains some 120 signatures from those in the support of this cause. I can say there are many more in my constituency. I am sure many parts of Australia would have the same sentiment as Pastor Bruce Hallam and the Dalby Churches of Christ and others across my constituency.
