        The government's red-tape stunt will see cuts to the wages and conditions of some of the lowest paid workers in Australia as the government plans to axe the Commonwealth Cleaning Services Guidelines, which regulate minimum pay and conditions for our cleaners. The guidelines apply to cleaners working in government agencies and offices, including
