       <p>
        I joined the federal minister for health to mark the naming of the Biaggio Signorelli Laboratory at the Asbestos and Dust Diseases Research Institute. Biaggio Signorelli was an extraordinary man whose own migrant history weaves a very Australian story. Born in Sicily, he came from humble beginnings to travel across the globe and set up a new life in Sydney with his family at just 10 years of age. His son, Paul, spoke of how his father wept when he arrived in Australia, so excited was he by the promise of this country. He went on to have a very successful career in business, and, most importantly, he went on to raise a wonderful family with his wife, Fina.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tragically, in 2007, he was diagnosed with mesothelioma and died eight months later. Such was his generosity of spirit that in his dying days he turned to his family and said, 'You can't save me, but I want you to save others.' And that's exactly what his family have done. They set up the Biaggio Signorelli Foundation to raise money to fund research and treatment for asbestos and other dust diseases. Their contribution of $1 million to the Asbestos and Dust Diseases Research Institute is a fitting legacy for an extraordinary man. It was a privilege to join the Signorelli family to commemorate Biaggio's legacy and to thank them for their extraordinary work.
