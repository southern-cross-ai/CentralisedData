        ; Annette Mundt, an OAM; and Mick Noble, who was honoured in this years Queen's Birthday honours list. Heather has been recognised with an Order of Australia medal for her longstanding work with Quota Beenleigh. In her 29 years with Quota, Mrs Christensen has helped transform the lives of countless disadvantaged and at-risk children, youth and families. For more than 13 years she's spent hundreds of hours organising the Quota International Beenleigh eisteddfod. She's also played a major role in the Beenleigh Yatala Chamber of Commerce and the junior chamber since 2009. Annette Mundt also received an Order of Australia medal for her service to the Beenleigh community. She's been involved with the Beenleigh Show Society committee since 1971 and has played a leading role in making the annual show an important fixture of our local community. She has also been the senior vice-president of the South-East Queensland subchamber of the Queensland Chamber of Agricultural Societies and has also been involved in numerous other community organisations. Mick Noble has been involved in a number of community organisations, but importantly, he keeps the local Anzac Day services running and contributes to
