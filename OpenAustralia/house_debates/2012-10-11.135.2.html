       <p>
        I am about to read a very compelling email from a constituent that indicates just what political correctness has done to the family unit in this great country of ours. I quote:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr Schultz. I'm a 52 yr old father of four at my wits end. Last week my youngest girl (15) gave birth to a baby boy. We had no Idea she was pregnant and according to the doc she had blocked it from her memory. She told them, not me at the hospital who the father was a 20yr old male. I was told not to intervene as she was in a fragile state and loving my daughter unconditionally I did so. Later I was told after speaking with doctors a doc worker and councilor that my daughter would not have him charged, further they advised her he should be involved in her life. My wife who has spent a week with my daughter in hospital was told she has no say. As parents we have no rights for our baby daughter, the anguish she had to endure alone breaks my heart, three hours I spent trying to help her while she was in so much pain and the shock she went through giving birth. My wife and I raised four great children, we love them dearly and they love us in return. I'm at a loss as to why we were shut out when a snake of a man who was a friend of my eldest daughter and fiance did a thing like this and walks away without penalty. Where are our rights, my daughters rights she is a baby for gods sake. I love my girl and my grandson but their has to be something some avenue we can turn, this bloke is dangerous.
       </p>
       <p>
        He then went on to send me another email yesterday:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Re my daughter Amy. Said social worker con my daughter without our prior knowledge Whilst talking to Amy totally ignored my wife telling our daughter that it was her sole decision in the matter. Prompted her on more than one occasion that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAN" rel="nofollow">
         MAN
        </a>
        should be involved in the upbringing of the child. Attempted to invite herself into our home when the district nurses were due Rang to speak to Amy who was busy at the time with the baby wanting to make app to visit I denied her on the basis that my daughter had said (dad can you keep that women away from me). My wife and I are incredulous that this person without forethought presumed that Kath and I were the same as all parents when all people are different and that she could have access to our child after going through a very physical and emotional time without any ok from us after all this is our baby. One final point this lady made my daughter feel insecure not secure in the family and massive friend support she has.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a result of that, I wrote to three ministers of the Crown at the state level. In particular I wrote to the Hon.

       </p>

        Enquiries made with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">

        Police reveal that, if a complaint is made and is proven, this is a jailable offence under NSW law carrying a substantial penalty by way of a 10-year sentence, could you please confirm this information so that I may advise my constituent.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I would further point-out that the intervention of a Doc's Worker, Councillor &amp; Doctor have not assisted this family in anyway, and may have influenced the 15 year old's decision not to have the adult male charged. This inappropriate interference without full knowledge of the parents may have made the situation worse as this whole affair obviously began when this girl was a 14 year old minor as she is now only 15 and gave birth in mid-September.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am in contact with the parents and have written permission to pursue the matter vigorously on their behalf.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have also written to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attorney_General" rel="nofollow">
         Attorney General
        </a>
        and the police minister and I intend to write to the minister for health in New South Wales to ask why these people employed by the state of New South Wales interfered in and shut down the rights of parents to look after their child, who in fact under the laws of this country is still a minor. I really do despair when these sorts of issues are raised in this politically correct environment that we live in today. They take away the God given right and the appropriate right under our system of democracy for parents to look after, educate and maintain the health of their children.
