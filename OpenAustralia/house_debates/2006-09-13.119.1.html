        I rise to talk of the four
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        clubs in my electorate of Stirling—in Scarborough,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Osborne Park
        </a>
        , Nollamara and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         North Beach
        </a>
        . Together they form a vital part of the community infrastructure of my local area. I am very pleased to say that the North Beach RSL sub-branch has been successful in its submission to the Australian government for funding that will greatly benefit its 400 members. It will especially benefit those who are isolated from the rest of the local community, whether through a lack of confidence or issues of physical or mental health.
       </p>
       <p>
        The North Beach RSL will receive Veteran and Community Grants scheme funding for a laptop computer and a printer. These items will allow its volunteers to produce a regular newsletter containing all the latest actions of the sub-branch as well as vital information for veterans and their families. The North Beach RSL newsletter will be distributed by hand, another enormous commitment by its volunteers. Close to 400 veterans will benefit from this newsletter delivery.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sadly, many veterans live quite isolated lives, and their lives are enormously changed by the human contact that occurs through regular visits to their homes by other veterans and volunteers. This encourages their participation in the North Beach sub-branch and the many activities that it undertakes. This funding gives local veterans a voice, just as all of our veterans should be given a respected and meaningful voice within their local communities and Australian society as a whole. We should never forget the great sacrifices of our veterans in the defence of our nation and their continuing role in our communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Howard government recognises this and, as a result, the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs made the announcement to the RSL national congress yesterday that there would be an extra $400 million over the next five years to ensure that gold and white card holders will continue to enjoy access to free health care. Veterans and war widows with gold or white cards can now confidently access the services of healthcare professionals that they know and trust without having to pay anything themselves. Any veterans requiring a hospital stay can now access the services of large surgical hospitals, regional facilities and small local hospitals close to family and friends. I heartily commend the minister for this program, which will benefit 300,000 veterans across Australia as well as many within my electorate of Stirling.
       </p>
       <p>
        The RSL sub-branches in Stirling, Nollamara, North Beach, Osborne Park and Scarborough, do vital work assisting our veterans. These RSL units ensure that we continue to recognise the role of our veterans and that the veterans can fully participate in Australia’s important commemoration and remembrance ceremonies. They also allow for members to engage in the education of our younger generations, and I congratulate them for everything they do.
