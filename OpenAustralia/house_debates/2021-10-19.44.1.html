        My question is to the Prime Minister. Has the government modelled the impact of net zero emissions by 2050? If the answer is yes, will the government release the modelling? If the answer is yes, when?

         When the government has fully considered these matters, we will be, of course, setting out all of our plans. We will be setting out all of the benefits and all of the matters that relate to those policies. That is the answer to the question. We will be very transparent. Where we have been able to assess the impacts of our policies and to demonstrate those benefits, we will certainly do that. That would be the case in the areas the member has referred to. We'll be doing that before the next election. I suspect we will be doing it a lot sooner before they make their mind up about their 2030 commitment. They asked me about this over a year ago, and they still can't tell the Australian people what their 2030 commitment is. I don't know what the time delay is on that side, but they cannot make their mind up about 2030—

           [by video link] Prime Minister, since real exports are limited to iron ore, aluminium, copper, coal—all smelted with coal—and if all exports then come directly or indirectly from coal and if net zero 2050 is not a lie, can you convince China to give us solar panels for free and convince Australians to turn their lights on only during the day? Isn't how—not when—Bradfield,

           producing zero emissions industries, high-protein algae, electricity, petrol as ethanol, sugar—all manufacturing industries. Isn't 'how'—yourself, Joyce, Albanese are after for our country? This is 'how'.

            I thank the member for Kennedy for his question regarding
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hells_Gate" rel="nofollow">
             Hells Gate
            </a>
            Dam. I know the member for Kennedy is very committed to the agricultural production of northern Queensland as, indeed, the Nationals and the Liberals are very committed to the agricultural production capability of northern Queensland. As the member, particularly, will know, the government has strongly supported the Hughenden irrigation scheme, which I know is a project that he has had a keen interest in over a long time. That is going to unlock significant potential for jobs and opportunities right across northern Queensland, as we will also see with great projects like the CopperString Project, which opens up that entire north-west minerals province which this government is committed to. We are committed to taking those important projects forward for northern Queensland because we believe in the future of rural and regional Australia and the infrastructure and the energy it needs to realise its potential. But, on the issue of Hells Gate Dam, I'll defer to the Deputy Prime Minister.

            </small>
            <p>
             I commend the member for Kennedy for the work that he has done for the people of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
              North Queensland
             </a>
             and as a voice for so many people in so many regional areas. Although at times we might not agree, I absolutely respect the effort he puts into that. He raised the issue of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hells_Gate" rel="nofollow">
              Hells Gate
             </a>
             Dam. We are expecting the business case for that early in the next year. What I can say is that the best chance the member for Kennedy has of getting that dam built is if a coalition government is in place. That would be the best opportunity and the best chance, because we too—and I definitely—have the vision of taking water west to fulfil the national vision that we would open up new agricultural precincts in the black soils of western Queensland, which I know the member for Kennedy knows so well.
            </p>
            <p>
             The member for Kennedy is also a great advocate for North Queensland. It's the coalition government that is moving the North Queensland Water Infrastructure Authority from Canberra to North Queensland. That is the sort of decentralisation package that stands behind our belief of getting people away from this great city into other parts of our nation as well. We also note his work on the Hughenden irrigation scheme, which he has believed in for so long. I know that the member for Kennedy must get some solace and satisfaction from the fact that, after battling for these projects for so long, the prospect and the probability and the commitment to get these projects done—to get projects for North Queensland done—is going to be under a coalition government. He knows those who reside on the other side have nothing more than a plan for the inner suburbs of the cities that are their only hope of ever being supported.
