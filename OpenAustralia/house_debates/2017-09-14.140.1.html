        ? Day we extend our compassionate support to those who are suffering. We encourage everyone to ask people who they think may be vulnerable whether they are okay. But it is also an important day to focus on pathways and solutions. One of the things we have in abundance in the Goldstein electorate is sporting clubs, which provide people with a vehicle for social interaction and participation. Today I want to highlight two sporting clubs that have been fantastic in contributing to the social fabric of the Goldstein community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first is the Brighton Soccer Club, which has over 1,500 players. More importantly, nearly a third, 450, are girls, and 95 per cent are under the age of 18. They are supported by 250 volunteers. They do an amazing job down at Dendy Park, providing a social outlet and sporting competition for young people across the electorate who like to play soccer. I was particularly honoured to turn up to the opening of their new facility last weekend, with Mayor Alex del Porto and club president Andrew Woodmore, to celebrate the new infrastructure they have to support their community, including changing rooms for both boys and girls who want to play. I was particularly honoured to toss the coin to decide the direction the Brighton versus Sandringham game was going to play. They are both within the Goldstein electorate, so I shouldn't pick sides. Brighton won 3-1, but being a Sandringham resident I concede that I supported Sandringham on this occasion, to my detriment. I wish them both all success in the future. They should be very proud of their sporting prowess.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would particularly like to thank the president, Andrew Woodmore, who was there; the secretary, Helen Mastos; and the treasurer, Danny Sarra. I also pay homage to Ruth Kyte, who is one of the big advocates for the introduction of women's sporting facilities, and

        , who was also present on the day.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge the East Brighton Vampires Junior Football Club, which has 840 members, 35 teams, 200 kids who play Auskick, and 350 volunteers. I was very fortunate earlier in the year to be at the opening of their new scoreboard. They have a large new facility at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurlingham_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Hurlingham Park
        </a>
        . I want to particularly acknowledge the fact that they had 13 teams play in the lightning carnival round, 12 that made it into the finals this year, eight that made it into the grand finals, with five premiershipsâ€”a huge achievement for a sporting club. So we congratulate the East Brighton Vampires and pay particular respect to the many volunteers. As I said, there are 350 people in the community who support that club, volunteering their time each Saturday. They are ably led by committee members Ian Jensen Muir; Jarrod Hall, the secretary, who was nominated recently for administrator of the year; and Paul Burrows, the treasurer. Thank you all for everything you do.
