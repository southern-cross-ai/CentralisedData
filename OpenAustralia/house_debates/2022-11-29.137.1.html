        Deputy Speaker, you might have noticed that I'm a little bit sunburnt today. That's because I spent most of the weekend out in the sun, sand and surf in my community on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        . The Central Coast is home to more than 40 beaches, stretching along almost 90 kilometres of stunning coastline, including Soldiers Beach at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norah_Head" rel="nofollow">
         Norah Head
        </a>
        . I'm proud to say that, after longstanding efforts from our community, Norah Head has now been declared a national surfing reserve.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Norah Head National Surfing Reserve stretches between Hargraves Beach and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelican_Point" rel="nofollow">
         Pelican Point
        </a>
        . This unique coastline is home to nine beach breaks, three bomboras and two reef breaks. It has nurtured state and national champions on both short and long boards, and it's now the first national surfing reserve on the Central Coast of New South Wales. On Saturday, I was delighted to join the people who made this happen, when I visited the Soldiers Beach headland for the official dedication ceremony and the unveiling of the new plaque, designed by Steve Curran. I would like to acknowledge the Norah Head Surfing Fraternity, Soldiers Beach Surf Life Saving Club, the Norah Head Lighthouse Reserve, Darkinjung Local Aboriginal Land Council, Aunty Bronwyn Chambers and her grandson, Jack, Norah Head Women in the Waves, Norah Head Sporties, Marine Rescue Norah Head,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast Council
        </a>
        and the Norah Head National Surfing Reserve Committee for their hard work and dedication to this effort on behalf of our entire community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to give special thanks to Debbie McGuigan and Jill Secomb. They describe themselves as just two old ladies, but, without their passion and vision, this project wouldn't be a reality today. The past few years have been tough for our community, and the COVID-19 pandemic presented further challenges in our efforts to secure national surfing reserve status. In a coastal community like ours, the beach is like a second home. I can remember going to Soldiers Beach for morning surfs before school with my dad, Grant, and my brothers. There's nothing like jumping on your board, diving headfirst into the surf and having the cool waves crash around you. As Debbie's McGuigan's late husband, Barry, put it: 'It's ever-changing, pleasant, addictive and exciting. It's pleasant when there's a small wave and you can try your moves. It's exciting when it's big and you've got to survive.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Norah Head's national surfing reserve status means so much to so many people in our community—a community of surfers, swimmers, beachgoers and people who care deeply about our natural environment. Our coastline and our beaches are sacred and we must protect them for the future. I hope, and I know it's our community's hope—and I mention
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Harris" rel="nofollow">
         David Harris
        </a>
        , the member for Wyong, who has been a strong supporter of this project as well and who joined me on the weekend—it's our hope that the declaration of a national surfing reserve at Norah Head will inspire locals and businesses alike to share, respect and preserve our pristine coastline now and into the future.
