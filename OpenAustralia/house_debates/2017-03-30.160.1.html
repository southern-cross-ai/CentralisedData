        In agreeing to the motion that the Federation Chamber adjourn, I want to reflect on some of the wonderful work that is being done in Victoria, and particularly within the Goldstein community. First, I pay tribute to the managing director, Andrew Snell, and the board of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Opera" rel="nofollow">
         Victorian Opera
        </a>
        for a wonderful opening of

         and the Pea
        </i>
        last weekend. In just 10 years, over 300,000 audience members have experienced a performance by Victoria Opera, and over 20,000 of them attended regional performances. During their short history, Victorian Opera have created 14 new Australian works and collaborated with some of Australia's leading companies, venues and learning institutions. That is why the Turnbull government have recognised them as a major performing arts company. We are committed to the accessibility of opera and the arts through tactile tours, and audio-described and relaxed performances that are accessible to the Australian community. Through their Youth Opera Program, Victorian Opera have inspired over 500 young singers and developed over 30 emerging artists. Congratulations to them.

        I also acknowledge the

         Royal Brighton Yacht Club
        </a>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Jackson" rel="nofollow">

        and his team of volunteers, sailors and staff should be applauded for their hard work on this important project. It brings the yacht club not just closer to the water but also closer to people through a public facility that can be enjoyed by everybody. On the occasional Sunday afternoon, when the weather is nice, it might be the perfect place for a relaxing Sunday session for any member who wants to come to the wonderful electorate of Goldstein. I also pay tribute to the work of past commodores

        Last weekend I was thrilled to attend the official jumper presentation for the 2017 season of both the men's and women's—very proud to say 'women's'—teams of Old Brighton Grammarians Football Club, particularly as it was in my new capacity as their No. 1 ticketholder. I am incredibly honoured. It is a title I share, with joy and pleasure, with my friend Felicity Frederico. The passion and commitment demonstrated by so many is evident, particularly by the president, Shane Young; the vice presidents,

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_Scouts" rel="nofollow">

        . I was thrilled to attend their community day for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KIDS" rel="nofollow">
         KIDS
        </a>
        Foundation on Sunday, 26 March. Established in 1908, the Sea Scouts is the largest scout group in Australia, with 248 youth members and 43 volunteer leaders. Their community activities support the KIDS Foundation by providing a water activities day as part of their KIDS Foundation recovery work, along with supporting Melbourne Legacy by providing the same type of service and assistance for people suffering post-traumatic stress disorder. Established in 1993, the KIDS Foundation takes its acronym from 'kids in dangerous situations' and is dedicated to injury prevention and injury recovery. I thank and pay tribute to Russell Burton, the group leader; Janet Cardell, the chair; Gerry Lambourne, President of Brighton North Rotary; and Matt Thiele, who is the Youth Ambassador for KIDS Foundation.

        I reiterate my congratulations to the Moorabbin Scout Group, who I spoke about recently, on their community fun day and the opening of their new scout hall a couple of weeks ago. I was honoured to be part of a presentation in the form of a 'scarf up' from some community leaders. I am now able to lead a patrol. I pay tribute to Group Leader Geoff Gartly and his band of volunteers and scouts of all ages. I also thank

        Finally, I want to reiterate my congratulations to Bayside Church on its 25th anniversary recently.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bayside Church was founded by Rob and Christie Buckingham. I first met Rob through my good friend Rory Grant. Rory has been a friend for many years through his shared involvement with me and his long-term involvement in advocacy, the values of the Liberal Party and campaigning in marginal seats. At Rory's 30th birthday, I met whom I have come to know as 'Rock Star Rob' because he is somebody who inspires so many people towards Christ's mission. At the 25th anniversary, I was honoured to be able to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land that the church meets on, but also to celebrate its mission around its future and a culture of freedom through love of fellow man.
