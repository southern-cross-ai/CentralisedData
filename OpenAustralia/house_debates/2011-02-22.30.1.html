         Health and Ageing

        service at the Palmerston GP Super Clinic. Is the minister aware that the clinic closes at 6 pm every Monday to Friday and is closed on weekends, with patients given the option of ringing the national call centre? What will the minister do to address this government’s chronic incompetence and failure to deliver even the most basic service?

           The Leader of the Opposition might care to listen to this answer, because it is very embarrassing for his own backbencher. When I was there on Friday, I took the opportunity to pursue the issue that the member has been raising. What I thought would be a really good thing to do was to see where I would arrive at the superclinic if it were at a point in time after the superclinic had closed its doors, what the referral system would be and what I could say—

                    There is no point of order, and again I remind members that rising on a point of order is not an opportunity to enter into debate. There are many other avenues available for people to have debate: question time is not one of them.

                     The reason those opposite are so sensitive about this is because thousands of residents in Palmerston have for more than two years been provided with services that otherwise they would have to travel across all of Darwin to get to the

                                Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. If the reason you have ignored the member for Boothby is because you can only take one point of order on relevance during a question then that is fair enough—you can only take one point of order on relevance. But there are many different kinds of points of order that a member can make in this House; and under standing order 86, how will you know unless he says what the point of order is? Under standing order 86 (a), a member may raise a point of order with the Speaker at any time—

                                   . This occupant of the chair would not be the first person who has not offered somebody the call on the basis that they are seeking a point of order. The member for Menzies has been at the end of that with the present Speaker, so it is not the first time that I have not done it. We understand these things; but I simply say that, in toto, the picking and choosing of standing orders that are important is miraculous. When people can ignore the fact that nobody except those who have the call are to make a statement or an interjection, I find it incredible that then they want to find my cooperation on all occasions.

                                    <p>
                                     Ad nauseam, I have suggested that the same standing order should apply to answers as applies to the questions. It would have been a much better solution than ‘directly relevant’. It would have meant that question time is not about the debate; you can have the debate on other occasions.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                     I am happy to entertain discussions about that, but I am also of a mind that the amount of banter that goes on—I agree, from both sides of the chamber—could well be reduced, and question time could revert—if it has ever been—to an occasion when it has been about the discussion and debate on the matters of ideas rather than personalities. I would agree that the amount of debate that is in the answers is a big part of the problem that any occupant of the chair confronts. Something which I have been consistent on is that I cannot fathom why the House does not contemplate applying the same rules to the answers as it does to the questions.

                                                 No, I will not reconsider. The member for Boothby was not the person that asked the question. He had no role in the proceedings before the chamber. If you remember rightly, he rose and I ignored him during the answer to the question. You suggested to me that he might be raising relevance or any other matter, but it was not a point of order. I invite you in your defence of the member for Boothby to actually put to me how the member for Boothby under standing orders had the opportunity to rise.

Firstly, my understanding is that any member can seek leave to table a document at any time with permission from the chamber. Secondly, I have on many occasions seen a member ask a question and the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition, at the end of that answer, seek leave to table a document. And on none of those occasions were they informed that they had no right to do so because they did not ask the question.
