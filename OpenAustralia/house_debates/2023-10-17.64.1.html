        My questions to the Prime Minister and concerns his failure yesterday and today to stand by his previous commitments to voice, treaty and truth. Last time Labor was in power its then prime minister, a mentor to the current Prime Minister, described climate change as 'the greatest moral challenge of our time' and then walked away from his commitment. Is this Prime Minister doing the same thing on voice, treaty and truth?

          I thank the member for Groom for his question which, if I understand it right, was asking about actions of the Rudd government in 2009-10, where the opposition opposed action on climate change and were against it. They voted against any action on climate change not once but twice, along with—I'm sorry to have to raise this, but you know it's coming—the Greens political party. I just had to throw that in there. I got asked about that—it's a matter of history that it occurred.
         </p>
         <p>
          If get this right, the criticism is about the referendum that we put to the Australian people, which those opposite promised to put to the Australian people at every election from 2007 on. Every leader of the Liberal Party, according to the Leader of the Opposition, said they would advance Constitutional recognition, but it didn't happen. They never put it to a referendum. So what we did was put it to a referendum

                On the point of order, this was a question that went over decades—three of them. We are now in 2023 and the question went to what occurred in 2009. It was about Indigenous affairs, it was about climate change, it was about parliament, it was about referendums, and it was about Constitutional change. My point is I don't think it was very direct.

                   Kevin Rudd

                  who supported a 'yes' campaign in the referendum—and who are disappointed that the referendum didn't get up—having opposed it and having spent months asking questions in here, some of which they knew were, quite frankly, absurd, about the

                  and other issues. Those opposite are now promising—depending on whether you watch the

                  , depending on whether you tune into Channel 7 or Channel 9—they will have a second referendum during the next term, which the Leader of the Opposition says is their policy.
