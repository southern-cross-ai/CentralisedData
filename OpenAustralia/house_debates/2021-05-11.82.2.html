         Appropriation Bill
        </a>
        (No. 2) 2021-2022
       </p>
       <p>
        Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2021-2022, along with Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2021-2022and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2021-2022, are the budget appropriation bills for the coming financial year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2021-2022 seeks approval for appropriations from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Revenue_Fund" rel="nofollow">
         Consolidated Revenue Fund
        </a>
        of $20 billion. This bill provides a full year of appropriations for purposes that are non-ordinary annual services of government for 2021-22, including capital works and services; payments for the states, territories and local government authorities; and funding for new administered outcomes not previously endorsed by the parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill also includes a revised Advance to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finance_Minister" rel="nofollow">
         Finance Minister
        </a>
        provision for a maximum of $3 billion. This is down from the total $6 billion that could be issued under 2020-21
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFM" rel="nofollow">
         AFM
        </a>
        provision in the equivalent even-numbered appropriation bill and takes into consideration the evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, allocations that have been made to date and the uncertainty around what may be required over 2021-22.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill includes appropriations for the National Recovery and Resilience Agency, recognising that this involves a new administered outcome and consistent with the Senate-Executive compact, this should be in an even-numbered bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will now outline the significant items provided for in this bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill proposes an appropriation to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Defence
        </a>
        of $12.7 billion. The appropriation will be used to continue delivering on the government's commitments in improving defence capability as set out in the
        <i>
         2016 Defence White Paper
        </i>
        , as well as the
        <i>
         2020 Force Structure Plan
        </i>
        and 2020 strategic update.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill also proposes an appropriation to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Infrastructure" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Infrastructure
        </a>
        , Transport, Regional Development and Communications of over $3.5 billion in 2021-22 to support rail, road and aviation infrastructure throughout Australia and to support local governments deliver key community infrastructure. This bill will provide nearly $400 million to extend the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill additionally proposes an appropriation of $600 million to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Agriculture" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Agriculture
        </a>
        , Water and the Environment. This includes $500 million partly for the plantation development concessional loans to be delivered by the Regional Investment Corporation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Passage of the bills through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Reps" rel="nofollow">
         House of Reps
        </a>
        and through the Senate by 30 June is required to ensure continuity of the government's programs and the Commonwealth's ability to meet its obligations for the 2021-22 financial year.
       </p>
       <p>
        I therefore commend this bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
