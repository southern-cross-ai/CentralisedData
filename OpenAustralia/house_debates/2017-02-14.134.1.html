        I rise to talk on an issue that is of great concern to not only my constituents but also a great number of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        ns—and that is the recent grubby and desperate deal done between the Premier Colin Barnett and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
         One Nation
        </a>
        Party and the decision by the Liberal government to preference One Nation above their Nationals counterparts. Not only has that caused deep divisions over in Western Australia, the ructions are certainly being felt over here in this place. We have already seen the Deputy Prime Minister at odds with the Prime Minister and the cabinet. We have seen a former Prime Minister distance himself from any form of decision-making that involves preferencing One Nation. We are seeing those more moderate members of the Liberal Party contort themselves into proportions that have previously never been seen before, as they try and spin their way into justifying this desperate and grubby deal.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just in case we needed any further evidence as to why it is a desperate and grubby chance to cling to power, let's have a closer look at exactly what those candidates for One Nation have to say, and ask yourself the question: does one really want to be in bed with this party? In this context, Michelle Meyers, the candidate for Bateman, has published words to the effect of justifying the reason why the push and campaign for marriage equality is going so well as being a result of:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …a carefully contrived but disingenuous mind control program, melded together…
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …   …   …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Utilising many of the strategies developed by the Soviets and then the Nazis, they have gone on to apply and perfect these principles so as to make them universal in their application…
       </p>
       <p>
        But—I hear you ask, Madam Deputy Speaker—wait, there's more. Let us have a look to see what the One Nation candidate for Murray-Wellington, Mr Slater, has had to say about marriage equality. He said that allowing same-sex marriage would lead to the legalisation of polygamy. And that is just the tip of the iceberg.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let us have a look to see what Lawrence Shave, the One Nation candidate for Dawesville, has had to say about those in homosexual relationships. In a letter to the editor, he called upon the former
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_of_the_High_Court" rel="nofollow">

        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Kirby" rel="nofollow">
         Michael Kirby
        </a>
        , to resign. Because he has admitted to living in a homosexual relationship, he 'fails the test of public trust and judicial legitimacy'. I stumble over my words because the deeper one digs into this grubby relationship, the worse it gets.
       </p>
       <p>
        We see here that the candidate for the Pilbara, Mr David Archibald, is of the view that chilli pepper powder will prevent cancer. What would
