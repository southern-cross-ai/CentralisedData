        My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister regret saying that volunteer firefighters don't need economic compensation for lost income because they 'want to be out there'?

         Once again, the Leader of the Opposition is misrepresenting what occurred for political purposes, as he always does. There is no issue that the Leader of the Opposition will not seek to exploit for personal political gain, and this is just another example of his lack of character. What he has suggested was not what I outlined when those remarks were made. What was raised in the press conference I was at was in relation to—the first time when the suggestion was made that there may be some—

          , I'd be happy to answer his question, Mr Speaker. It was being raised with me as to whether the Commonwealth would be providing compensation for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_Fire_Service" rel="nofollow">
           Rural Fire Service
          </a>
          volunteers. Now that is not a matter that is normally dealt with by the federal government. I said it was not normally dealt with by the federal government. It is a matter that is traditionally done by the Rural Fire Service. On that occasion, I was reflecting comments made to me when I visited with Rural Fire Service members. They had put to me that, when they were out there, they wanted to be out there protecting their communities. That's what I was talking about. They know that they would prefer not to have fires. They know that they would prefer to be at home with their families and their communities. What I was saying was that, when duty calls, they want to answer that call to duty, because that's what our volunteers do.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Leader of the Opposition has wilfully for months sought to misrepresent that comment to take political advantage of the bushfires, and it shows an appalling quality in his behaviour to politicise any event.

            Commissioner, acted on the basis of the advice we received to provide for income loss payments for Rural Fire Service members when they are out there for more than 10 days, and we did so at the request of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service Commissioner. When we received that request from the New South Wales government, we acted on that request. I think more than $6 million has since been paid to those fire service members on the basis of their being out there for more than 10 days. That same offer was made to other states. It has not been taken up by Victoria; it has a different view.
