        I rise to congratulate the talented and hardworking recipients of this year's Gorton Young Leaders Awards. Since 2009, I've been acknowledging selected year 12 students from the electorate of Gorton who have demonstrated a commitment to active public leadership within their schools and communities through these annual awards. These awards, I think, are an important way to recognise and encourage local young people beyond academic performance and to reward their efforts in giving to their communities. I'm consistently impressed with the remarkable achievements of the prize winners and the fantastic local talent who call Melbourne's west their home.

        This year, we have 14 Gorton Young Leader Award winners across seven local schools in the electorate of Gorton. From the

        All of these students have made significant contributions to their schools and local communities. Many are school captains or vice captains and represent their school or community officially. Some have done specific work running sports and other events, working with disadvantaged communities, helping the elderly and fundraising for various causes. These are the students people seek out for assistance. They advocate for and help others. They put others before themselves and should be commended for their efforts. I will be watching these young people closely as they become leaders of the future.
