        Australia has just celebrated National Volunteer Week. In Hindmarsh, like all electorates, there are numerous volunteer organisations: Rotary, Lions, Apex,

        , a suburb in my electorate, and they recently celebrated 30 years of great community work. As a former committee member of the local neighbourhood watch, I have seen the important role they play in helping to keep our community safe. I try and attend many neighbour watch meetings as often as I can, and the Morphettville Neighbourhood Watch had a good turnout earlier this month. I want to congratulate Ross Bowles, the area coordinator, secretary Allan Wallis and all the members of the Morphettville Neighbourhood Watch on their good work for the community.

        This weekend will also see many volunteers doorknocking for the Salvation Army's Red Shield Appeal, and I will be out there with some of my staff. I would like to take this opportunity to recognise the great work of Major Laurie Venables, who lives in Glenelg and who I have had the privilege of dealing with. Major Venables is an unsung hero. For 71 years he has dedicated time and effort to the Salvos. Major Venables has only once missed the Red Shield Appeal, and to quote Major Venables: 'It's what I was put on this earth to do.' He started collecting donations at the age of eight, and it was great to see a fantastic photo of him and his wife in today's Adelaide

        . Thank you to Laurie and all the volunteers out there for your outstanding contribution in the electorate of Hindmarsh.
