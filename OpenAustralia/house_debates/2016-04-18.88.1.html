        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs representing the Minister for Defence. Will the minister advise the House how the government will secure a sustainable long-term shipbuilding industry in Australia? How will this vital important industry support Australia's interests both domestically and internationally?

         I thank the member for Hindmarsh for his question and I acknowledge his passionate advocacy for Australia's shipbuilders and a sustainable shipbuilding industry in this country. Today the coalition government has announced details implementing our historic continuous shipbuilding plan that will protect Australia's national security while also providing for a sustainable long-term shipbuilding industry in Australia and boosting jobs growth in advanced manufacturing. The government has committed to a program of continuous build of surface ships in Australian shipyards, major warships in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         and offshore patrol vessels in South Australia and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         and Pacific patrol boats in Western Australia. These decisions directly support Australia's national security.
        </p>
        <p>
         Up to 12 offshore patrol vessels to be built in South Australia and Western Australia will provide our Navy with enhanced border protection capabilities to maintain the security of Australia's borders and tackle the criminal people-smuggling trade that flourished under Labor. Up to 21 Pacific patrol boats, to be built by Austal ships in Western Australia—a great Australian company that builds ships for the

          South Pacific
         </a>
         and enable our Pacific island partners to contribute to greater maritime security across our region, including combatting illegal fishing and the people-smuggling trade. These shipbuilding projects, as well as the project to build nine frigates, represent about $40 billion worth of investment in Australia's future naval capabilities and, in turn, in our own shipbuilding industry. These projects will ensure that Australia retains a sovereign capability to build and sustain naval vessels, securing more than 2,500 jobs in Australia for decades to come, securing the skills that this industry will need and will be required under our plan.
        </p>
        <p>
         Compare Labor's mismanagement of Australia's national security and the local defence industry, one of the most dangerous legacies left by a government in our history. First, Labor trashed our budget with wasteful spending. Labor then stripped $18.8 billion out of the defence budget, slashing funding as a percentage of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
          GDP
         </a>
         to the lowest level since 1938. True! Labor then failed to commission a single naval vessel from an Australian shipyard in their entire six years in office. Ten per cent of workers in the Australian defence industry lost their jobs because of the inaction and incompetence of the Labor government. Only the coalition can be trusted to safeguard Australia's defence industry and to ensure local jobs in a local industry.
