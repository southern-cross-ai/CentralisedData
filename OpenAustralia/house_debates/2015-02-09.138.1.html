        I rise today to congratulate the nominees and award recipients of the Macarthur 2014 National Volunteer Awards. The National Volunteer Awards recognise the amazing work and efforts undertaken by members of a local communityâ€”those who are the heart and soul of our community. In December last year I was extremely proud to announce that there were over 70 volunteers and organisations nominated in Macarthur across 14 categories. Today I want to pay tribute to these special people and thank them for their time and commitment to volunteering in my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I bring to the attention of the House 14 deserving National Volunteer Award winners for the Macarthur region: the winner of the Junior Volunteer Award, Danielle Santos; the winner of the Youth Volunteer Award, Nicholas Palmer; the joint winners of the Senior Volunteer Award, Vic Boardman and Marian Martin; the winner of the Business Volunteer of the Year Award, Marina Mikulic, owner of Symphony's on

        Finally I would like to congratulate the 2014 Macarthur Volunteer of the Year Award winner, Adam Taiba. Over the past year Adam has played an instrumental role in raising awareness amongst young people about the consequences of alcohol-fuelled violence. After his father, as I understand it, was king-hit in September 2013, Adam started a campaign to spread the message to students across Macarthur about the dangers, effects and consequences of alcohol. This involved visiting local schools to speak on the issue, helping the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        police commissioner with Operation Unite and raising the issue face-to-face with the Premier,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Baird" rel="nofollow">
         Mike Baird
        </a>
        . In the face of his own family's adversity, Adam has channelled his energy into finding positive community solutions to alcohol-fuelled violence. His commitment to raising awareness of alcohol-fuelled violence amongst young people sets an outstanding example. The way that Adam has approached this campaign has been inspirational to all those who have seen him in action in our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate Adam and all the nominees and award recipients for the Macarthur 2014 National Volunteer Awards. I would also like to thank our nominators and all the volunteers throughout Macarthur for the wonderful work they do in our community. We really do cherish what they do.
