       <p>
        As we all know, in recent weeks and right now, right around the country our children and our young adults are returning to school. From preppies to university and from primary to secondary—I'd like to give a big shout out to all of those kids who are bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and getting out there to get an education. I recall my own high school, the Kepnock State High School in Bundaberg, and in particular—Mr Deputy Speaker Coulton, I know you'll appreciate this—it's motto, which is 'Success is earned'. I say to all of those children: 'There is no doubt that the harder you work the more successful you will be. Always keep in mind that it is never over till it's over. You must continue to work.'
       </p>
       <p>
        And I say to them, 'Don't look at what happens in this place,' because what we know here is that there is half of this room where success is not earned. It's over there; it's with the opposition. Success is not earned with the opposition; it's very, very clear. You don't have to believe me. It's not my statement. In fact, it comes from
        <i>
         The Australian
        </i>
        , which says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The "backroom buffoonery" of factional warlords has left the Labor Party's members with fewer rights than any comparable movement in the world …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …   …   …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Continuing to practise the old ways of machine politics will see trust in the Labor Party continue to wither away.
       </p>
       <p>
        Who was it? It wasn't over here. It was an insider; it was the member for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Adelaide" rel="nofollow">
         Port Adelaide
        </a>
        . I thank the member for Port Adelaide for saying what we all know. Welcome to democracy, member for Port Adelaide. Long may the Labor Party continue to wither.
