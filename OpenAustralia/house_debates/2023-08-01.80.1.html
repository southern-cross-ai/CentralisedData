       <p>
        Before members leave, I wish to give a short statement to the House about the way questions will be put in the House and the Federation Chamber, and therefore the way divisions will take place in the House. As members will be aware, the physical arrangements in the chamber have returned to their pre-COVID 19 forms. From now on the procedural changes will also revert to the standard formulations as provided in the standing orders.
       </p>
       <p>
        What this means is that a question for decision of the House will be stated in the usual form 'that the proposal be agreed to'. Members will still be required to vote 'aye' or 'no' on the voices to a question before the House. However, the reversion to the usual practices of the House will mean that many members might need to cross the floor to the other side of the chamber when voting in divisions. For example, when the deferred division is dealt with this afternoon after the MPI, the question will be stated as: 'That the amendment moved by the member for Goldstein to the second reading amendment moved by the member for Curtin be agreed to.' Members agreeing should vote 'aye' and members disagreeing to the amendment should vote 'no.' As the division has been deferred, of course the bells will be rung. The question that the amendment be agreed to will be stated.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst it's always important for members to listen carefully to the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker in the chair, as this reversion to the usual practice and procedure of the House is not familiar to members, especially the members who have taken their places in the House in this 47th Parliament. I encourage all members to listen carefully when a question is being stated and put to the House for decision.
