        As my first constituency statement, I would like to acknowledge the work of the Little Blue Dinosaur Foundation, an organisation I have built a strong relationship with over five years. Prior to entering politics I served as an expert advisor for Little Blue Dinosaur as an educational and developmental psychologist. Now, as the federal member for Reid in federal parliament, I have taken on the role of government ambassador to the Little Blue Dinosaur to continue my contributions to their work through the significant lens of government policy. I would like to acknowledge the Minister for Communications and the member for Robertson, who are also ambassadors for this organisation.
       </p>

        The Little Blue Dinosaur promotes child pedestrian safety awareness to the community, an issue that is especially important to those of us who are parents. Michelle and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_McLaughlin" rel="nofollow">
         David McLaughlin
        </a>
        started Little Blue Dinosaur in 2014 after their son, Thomas Maxwell Davis McLaughlin, was tragically killed at the age of four in a pedestrian accident. This unspeakable tragedy inspired Thomas's parents to start the Little Blue Dinosaur Foundation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Data from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Institute_of_Health_and_Welfare" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Institute of Health and Welfare
        </a>
        states the most common cause of death of children aged one to 14 is land transport accidents or road trauma. Australian road safety experts tell us children in this age group have proven limited cognitive physical and perceptual abilities, such as limited peripheral vision and poor judgement of risks. The foundation has become a strong voice for children's road safety, and Tom's legacy is realised through the campaigns and community education that the Little Blue Dinosaur undertakes. Currently there are over 60 council partners participating in campaigns across four Australian states.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Little Blue Dinosaur's 'It's holiday time' campaign has been instrumental in reducing dangers to our smaller pedestrians and reminding drivers of Little Blue Dinosaur's message: 'Slow down, kids around.' The campaign also reminds parents and carers to hold hands with their children who are aged 10 years and under. Holding hands with our little ones near moving vehicles is just as important as placing a seatbelt on them in the car.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will do my very best to make sure Tom's voice continues to be heard and thereby increase community awareness of the vital importance of child pedestrian safety. I commend the work that Michelle, David and the team of the Little Blue Dinosaur Foundation have done in Tom's memory.
