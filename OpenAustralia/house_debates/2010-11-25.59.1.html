       <p>
        Krystle Brown is a young woman with a disability which has resulted in her having significant mobility problems that have led to her being confined to an electronic wheelchair. Krystle is a very special person who has been working in my office as a volunteer since she was a high school student. During that time I have seen her grow in confidence and skill.
       </p>
       <p>
        Krystle has a goal, which is to find part-time employment. Since leaving school she has been attending
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        and she is also a client of Castle Personnel, who are working with her to achieve her goal. This year Krystle received a special encouragement award from TAFE in recognition of her achievements. She received a certificate and $500. Krystle is a good worker. She is accurate, efficient and keen, always ready to try new tasks. She is a valuable member of our team in the office. This year I hope Krystle can build on her skills and secure part-time employment.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to encourage employers throughout Australia to give people like Krystle the opportunity to develop new skills and offer them jobs. It is important to remember that people with disabilities have much to offer and any employer who employs a person with a disability will be rewarded by having a dedicated, committed employee who is keen to succeed. Never forget, people with disabilities have abilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I thank Krystle for the work she has done in my electorate office and for just being Krystle. I conclude by wishing everyone all the best for Christmas and the
