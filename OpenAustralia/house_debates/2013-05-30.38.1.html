       <p>
        On Saturday I had the great pleasure of attending the 100th anniversary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Kembla" rel="nofollow">
         Port Kembla
        </a>
        branch of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        . The branch was formed in 1913 and pivotal in the formation of the branch were the iron-workers who were then working in the newly established steelworks at Port Kembla. Branch records also show that numerous in the branch at the time were the seafarers and wharfies, together with the shopkeepers who lived in and around Port Kembla.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Port Kembla branch of the Australian Labor Party has always strongly reflected the community in which it is based. The branch today has members from Malta, Macedonia, Greece, Australia, Italy and just about every country that you would find represented in the electorate. It has had an active role in all of the debates that have featured within Labor Party history and indeed Australian history over those 100 yearsâ€”very fierce debates around issues such as conscription and our roles in our foreign wars.
       </p>
       <p>
        I pay tribute to all of the people who attended and participated in the organisation of this wonderful event. I was very pleased to see there one of my friends
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Wilson" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , who is a fourth-generation member of the Australian Labor Party. He, his mother, his sisters and his cousins were in attendance at that meeting. It was an absolutely fantastic event. I also pay tribute to

        and Vicky King, the president and the secretary.
