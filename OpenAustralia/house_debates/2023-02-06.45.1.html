       <p>
        Like me, many people in my electorate of Fowler came to Australia looking for a safe haven, security and freedom, somewhere we could raise our children and provide them with a good education for a better future. It was therefore an honour to participate in Fairfield City Council's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        citizenship ceremony on Australia Day. For us, Australia Day represents a day that we, as migrants and refugees, can reflect on our journey to Australia and the opportunities that have been afforded to us. For me, it's a day when I often reflect with gratitude.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also attended the Assyrian National Council's Australia Day event, where we acknowledged the opportunities Australia has provided for our multicultural communities, including the Australian Assyrian community, who have made significant contributions in Fowler, which, as everyone in the House will be aware, is home to Australians of more than 150 different nationalities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge two members of our electorate who were recognised for their dedication to our community. Mr Philip Coleman, from Liverpool, was awarded an Order of Australia award for his community work through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church" rel="nofollow">

        , and Mrs Sorathy Pouk Michell, from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Greenfield Park
        </a>
        , was awarded an Order of Australia award for her service to the Khmer community of

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to congratulate all of the new Australians who received their citizenship on Australia Day this year, 2023. Let's seize the opportunities, or create them, now that we are citizens of this great country.
