        I applaud the member for Braddon for his contribution. I too have had many calls from angry Telstra customers and I have done some work on my website about the same issue. I am sure the Telstra people cannot wait for your letter!

        Homeswest housing density is a controversial issue in Perth, particularly in my electorate of Swan. I have briefed the House before on homelessness problems in Swan. At the last glance though, the Homeswest waiting list had blown out to beyond 20,000. It has been high for some years now. I am a supporter of more Homewest housing and my office has helped many people with their problems. Homeswest staff do a fantastic job, in often challenging circumstances. Most

        s would agree that more Homeswest houses need to be built to address this shortage. With a list of over 20,000, the federal government needs to address the issue of having more than just 20,000 nationally, and should look at the total number required Australia wide.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, the approach of the former West Australian government has caused considerable angst, concern and upheaval across the electorate. Their approach was to concentrate new Homeswest housing developments in certain suburbs. Many of the suburbs in my electorate of Swan were part of the Labor government’s density plan. In 2007, the Western Australia minister said in a written response to

        and Cannington all had public housing densities exceeding the average of 4.14 per cent.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have never supported these Homeswest housing hubs as a solution to the Homeswest housing shortage. Development must be spread evenly throughout the Perth metropolitan area. Community organisations in Rivervale and Manning have been particularly active on this issue. I recently met with Steve Neates, from the Manning Community Association, who informed me that Manning has Homeswest allocation levels at 18.24 per cent of the suburb—supplied by the Department of Housing—compared to Como which has 3.27 per cent, Kensington which has 7.72 per cent and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salter_Point" rel="nofollow">
         Salter Point
        </a>
        which has 3.14 per cent, and so on. Many other residents of that area have spoken to me about the problems with anti-social behaviour, as well as the public housing density in that particular suburb.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Rivervale, Christina Bylinski, who is involved with the Belmont Resident/Ratepayers Action Group, otherwise know as BRRAG, has been an active voice, pointing out a Homeswest housing density of 14 per cent, and in particular in her street, over 50 per cent. Christina has been passionate about her street and suburb and is committed to seeing that the integrity and value is maintained. Christina first approached me during the 2007 election campaign and I applaud her tireless and committed work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Both of these groups have called for the gradual reduction of housing densities and a halt to any new developments in their affected suburbs. I support these calls. I note that the urban renewal living homes problem has stated objectives of: (1) the reduction in high concentrations of public housing; (2) the refurbishment of houses for sale, to both the public and existing tenants; (3) better land utilisation through the re-subdivision and refurbishment of public rental housing; (4) infrastructure enhancements, upgrading of streetscapes and public open space; and (5) community development.
       </p>
       <p>
        The only such project in my electorate is the Queens Park Quattro project, which is described as an ‘innovative, urban renewable project’ to redevelop the former Maniana housing area. The actual project was initiated by the previous government—I will recognise that—but is being continued by the current government. The website states of this particular area:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Since the first release at Quattro: The New Queens Park in December 2008, demand for lots has been extremely strong. The latest release, Stage 2B, was no exception with all lots selling within one day!
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a fantastic program for public housing. I have had a look through the area. It is modern, it is refreshing and it is a place that may people would like to live in. Queens Park is a suburb that is dear to me. I have many friends there who are involved with the Queens Park Football Club, the junior football club, and it is great to see that this area, Maniana, has actually been revived from its previous life of a run down state housing area. Rivervale and Manning, with 14 per cent housing density, should be considered for any future similar schemes, as long as the focus is aimed at reducing the density back to the target amount of 11 per cent. I am pleased to hear that the Minister for Housing and Works, Troy Buswell, is committed to reducing public housing in Rivervale to 11 per cent over time, but I am here to remind Troy that he needs to make sure that he keeps his promises to the people of Rivervale and Manning and to make sure that he implements that target and works towards it.
