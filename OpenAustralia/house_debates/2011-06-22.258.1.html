       <p>
        On Friday, 9 June I was delighted to present
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Barker" rel="nofollow">
         Michael Barker
        </a>
        with an Australian flag. Michael is a wonderful young man who has been selected to represent Australia at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Olympics" rel="nofollow">
         Special Olympics
        </a>
        . In June of last year, Michael was selected in the Australian soccer team which will represent Australia at the Special Olympics. Michael will take the flag with him to the Special Olympics, which are to be held in Greece between 25 June and 4 July this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Originally joining the Special Olympics as a basketball player, Michael soon picked up soccer and swimming as additional sports. Michael has a long history of representation at state and national levels, with gold, silver and bronze medals in all of these sports. Michael's team is comprised of young men with an intellectual disability who are enthusiastic and excited to represent their nation. The understanding and support of the Special Olympics team provides an environment where hidden talents are revealed and new skills discovered. This opportunity allows participants to improve their health and fitness, develop self-confidence and improve their social capacity.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate Michael on his selection, a reflection of his hard work and dedication to his training. I would also like to recognise the important contribution of Michael's mother, Diane, and his coach, Helen Stevens, in providing a launching pad for Michael to pursue his love of soccer and to represent this nation. Michael will make an outstanding ambassador for our nation and, indeed, for the people of Macquarie.
