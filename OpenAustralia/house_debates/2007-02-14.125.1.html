       <p>
        In 2006 there were 336 road fatalities in Queensland. That corresponds to one person in Queensland being killed every 26 hours. This is a tragedy of immense proportions and, as a Queensland based federal member of this parliament, I want to say that it is really time for us to do all that we can, both at the local level and at the government level, to try and address this terrible tragedy that we are facing on our roads every day of the year.
       </p>
       <p>
        A great number of the people killed are in the 17 to 39 age range. I want to enlighten the House on some specific figures because they are very instructive about the demographics of those killed. In Queensland, between the ages of 17 and 20, there were 42 fatalities. Between the ages of 21 and 24, there were 34 fatalities. Between the ages of 25 and 29, there were 29 fatalities. Between the ages of 30 and 39, there were 61 fatalities. Each one of these figures represents a loved one and a terrible tragedy. Unless you have experienced that sort of trauma, you can only imagine the terrible suffering that would occur within a family. It is time that all of us in positions of influence within our community do all that we can to try to redress this terrible issue.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, there are many causes of accidents and fatalities, ranging from speed and fatigue to poor driving skills that embrace using a mobile phone while driving, trying to eat a hamburger while driving, trying to have a smoke while driving, and simple carelessness and recklessness. We will not discount mechanical failure, but significantly alcohol is an issue. Another issue is complacency and, when it comes to young drivers, inexperience. It really is time for all of us to say that enough is enough.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are a range of solutions, and it is important to compliment and commend governments where they are trying to do something. I will say that the Queensland government is trying to do something but I do not think it is trying to do enough. I am delighted that here in the chamber on the government side I am surrounded by Queensland colleagues. I am very honoured by that because they are terrific Queensland representatives who I know share my passion for trying to tackle this terrible tragedy on Queensland roads. In December last year, I learnt the terrible news that constituents of mine, the East family, suffered the loss of two of their young sons out of a family of three. The death of Daniel and Toby East—two brothers who died when their car collided with a pole on
