       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity to speak about something that every member in this House is passionate about: eradicating domestic violence. Both sides of this House abhor domestic violence and have worked together, through successive governments, through the national plan. Having been given the opportunity to be the shadow assistant minister for the prevention of family violence, I've travelled through my electorate and also around Australia, talking to support groups, police and other organisations about what is required to stamp out domestic violence. Whilst the plan is commendable and those support networks are there with the funding for what I would call the 'back end'—the services that are provided to, and are so needed by, victims—in my opinion, and in the opinion of those I've spoken to, the failing is in the lack of funding of the front end. We need more funding for, and more concentration on, prevention because that is what will change this scourge. That is what will change our nation.

        It is a generational change. It will not happen overnight, and it will not happen without the support of parliament—all levels of parliament—communities, businesses, industry, schools and sporting groups. It has to change at the most granular level. It has to start in primary school. The message is that it is not okay to have domestic violence in our society and that the standard that you walk past is the standard that you accept. We need to have a curriculum from kindergarten through to university that is part of our sporting groups and supported by industry and business to be able to make that generational change, to change the mindset of our children growing up and to change the mindset of men and women as to how we act and how we respect other people.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the proudest moments that I had in my last term was being able to secure $6.5 million for a hub-and-spoke model, of 24 one- and two-bedroom units in Kempsey, to provide those wraparound services. But wouldn't it be nice if we didn't have to have those wraparound services? It takes that change—it takes that mindset to make a change. And I am happy to work with all members of this House to do so.
