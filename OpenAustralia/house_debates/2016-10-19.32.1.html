        The National Disability Insurance Scheme, a Labor initiative, has offered hundreds of thousands of people with a disability in our country a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to access supports that will give them a life of choice, purpose, meaning and true citizenship. In my state of Queensland, the rollout has commenced in Townsville and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charters_Towers" rel="nofollow">
         Charters Towers
        </a>
        for children under 18, and for all eligible residents on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Island" rel="nofollow">

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        It is extraordinary that the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Social Services
        </a>
        believes that he does not need to consult widely with the community on changes to the board of the National Disability Insurance Agency. In fact, he thought it was fair to have the board members read in a national newspaper that their jobs were being advertised. Now, more than ever, strong and connected leadership at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIA" rel="nofollow">
         NDIA
        </a>
        board level is essential. Bruce Bonyhady should not be used by the minister as a scapegoat for the problems he has with his system.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have moved into the full rollout of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        , and this is not the time to make substantial changes to the NDIA board. Bruce Bonyhady's leadership has been second to none. He is highly qualified in his professional expertise and he also brings an additional vital key ingredient to the tableâ€”he is the father of two sons with a disability. Once again we see this government putting money before people. The significant transformational change that the NDIS offered people with a disability was a leadership role that was genuine and valued, and people with a disability for the first time have genuine choice and control over their services, and yet we see the minister making decisions about board appointments that seem to be based on financial and business expertise.
