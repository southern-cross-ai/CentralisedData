        My question is to the Minister for the Environment. Will the minister inform the House of the Morrison government's plan to modernise our environmental protection laws, providing greater certainty for business to create jobs whilst maintaining stringent environmental protections?

         I thank the member for

         for his question. Australia's unique plants, animals, landscapes and places are central to our nation's identity and quality of life, and they're recognised the world over. Likewise, our economic activity is dependent on the services and benefits provided by nature. Industries like agriculture, fisheries, forestry, tourism and manufacturing all depend on a healthy environment.

         Earlier this year, I tabled in this parliament the Samuel review of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Protection_and_Biodiversity_Conservation_Act" rel="nofollow">
          Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act
         </a>
         . Professor Samuel found a comprehensive reworking of the legislation is required, with reform best delivered in stages. Consistent with this view, last week I released the government's reform time line and pathway document. This document sets out a clear and detailed road map for reform, informed by Professor Samuel's recommendations and developed through consultation—a consultation I'm committed to continuing. Our pathway provides stakeholders with clarity and certainty. Let's be clear: these reforms represent a once-in-a-generation opportunity to improve environmental outcomes and simultaneously facilitate economic development, but the reality is that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">
          EPBC
         </a>
         Act is complex, and meaningful reform can only be achieved by adopting this staged and pragmatic approach.
        </p>
        <p>
         As the Business Council of Australia said recently, the government—the parliament—has two choices. It can continue to allow a muddled and confused system that is not helping the environment or the economy or it can take the first step to improve the environment and create more jobs in regional Australia. The state premiers and chief ministers at national cabinet are in agreement, and they've set out three clear steps: a commitment to implement single-touch environmental approvals, the development of a first set of national environmental standards, and subsequent phases of reform to build on these streamlining efforts. Make no mistake: if we don't get the process moving, it will end up hurting both the economy and the environment. But this is a challenge that the Morrison government will not shy away from, and I hope Labor joins us on this journey. Those opposite can work with the government to support the bills that are currently before the parliament or they can let, in the words of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCA" rel="nofollow">
          BCA
         </a>
         , 'this muddled and confused system' live on, stifling growth and not helping our environment. If the parliament doesn't support these bills, the occasion for real reform, focused on Graeme Samuel's key themes of accreditation, harmonisation and standards, will be lost and so too will the opportunity to provide better outcomes for our unique environment for generations to come.
