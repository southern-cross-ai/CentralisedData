        Thirteen thousand Australian women are diagnosed with breast cancer every year. On average, seven women die from breast cancer every single day in Australia. If these statistics do not change, this figure will rise to 47 women every day by 2020. The Mater hospitals in Brisbane treat more than 700 women every year who have breast cancer. To assist women diagnosed with breast cancer, the Mater Chicks in Pink was established in 2004. Rarely do women think that it could happen to them, but when it does Mater Chicks in Pink is there to help.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mater Chicks in Pink provide tangible services for these women. This can include care packs or financial assistance, from parking vouchers to counselling and cleaning services. Mater Chicks in Pink provide specially fitted mastectomy bras to women who undergo the loss of one or both breasts. They also provide wigs for ladies who lose their hair through chemotherapy.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Creative Arts Therapy and Creative Express programs provide women with a chance to celebrate their milestones, shared difficulties and past experiences and help each other move forward despite being at different stages of breast cancer treatment. There is also a special Mummy Memories and Me counselling group for those ladies with terminal breast cancer and young children.
       </p>
       <p>
        But of course none of these wonderful services can be offered without the support of generous donations from the community. I was honoured to be a part of the

        International Women's Day Fun Run held earlier this year on 9 March, which raises funds for the Mater Foundation's Chicks in Pink program. It is celebrating its 23rd year and, indeed, I met a lady who had participated in every one of the events over those 23 years. The International Women's Day Fun Run is one of the largest fun runs of its kind in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year was no different with more than 8,000 runners and walkers taking part. It is one of Brisbane's largest female-oriented fun runs and brings together women and girls of all ages, backgrounds and fitness levels. Congratulations to Saint Aidan's who raised the most money and had the largest number of participants of any school in the competition.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was a great honour to be able to present some of the running awards at this year's fun run and I was even more pleased to hear that the team reached their fundraising goal of $150,000 for Chicks in Pink. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the hardworking team at the Mater Foundation including
