       <p>
        I would like to sincerely thank members of the committee who have joined me in ensuring that during these recent COVID-safe sittings of parliament we continue to facilitate the important process of petitioning. The committee has continued to meet via teleconference, with a minimum of disruption, to consider petitions and related matters and plans to do so until further notice.
       </p>
       <p>
        It has been particularly important for the committee to work flexibly during this time, because the House petitioning system continues to see a great deal of engagement by the Australian people. For example, an e-petition tabled in the last sitting period collected over 300,000 signatures, which is the third-largest number of signatures on an e-petition to date. Another petition which recently closed collected over 100,000 signatures, and many more experienced large amounts of engagement by the public.
       </p>
       <p>
        This means that around half a million people have exercised their rights, and engaged directly with the parliament, over the past few weeksâ€”a great result for democracy and the House e-petitioning system, and an indication of the consistent popularity of petitioning as a way for people to have their say.
       </p>
       <p>
        These figures also demonstrate the usefulness of the e-petitioning system as a means for Australians to continue petitioning the House, while remaining COVID-safe. As a committee, we are pleased to be able to facilitate these important rights of all Australians while they remain socially distanced.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you, and I look forward to further updating the House on the work of the Petitions Committee in the future.
       </p>
