        I proudly represent the mighty suburb of Willmot in the Chifley electorate. One of the best things about the area is the many huge-hearted, passionate and hardworking people living there. Over 15 years ago, nearly a dozen of these people attended a computer publishing class at the Willmot cafe. At the end of the course, they were set an assignment to create an imaginary newsletter. Using their newly acquired skills, they decided to do just that and created what became known as '

        </i>
        ', which, for years, as a bi-monthly publication, kept residents up-to-date on important issues. Underneath the title of the newsletter are the words 'Helping build a better community'. And that is exactly what they have been doing. From social issues, community event updates and handy numbers to quotes, jokes and recipes,

        has been a valued resource delivering positive insights into the terrific things happening in the Willmot community. Sadly, last month we saw the final addition of

I take this opportunity to thank each and every one of the volunteers for all their contributions over the 92 editions. In particular, I thank Pauline Garmonsway, Ann and Bill Dorman, Molly Ames, Robyn Reeves, Carol Brewer, Derek Jobson, George Baggaley, Jenny and

        Our community recently said goodbye to Lynette Cameron, at a service in Minchinbury just the other week. I wish to not only pay respect to her but thank her. For over 20 years Lyn tirelessly gave her time volunteering to support women and the community of Tregear. Through her position on the Tregear Public School P&amp;C, and as president of the Tregear Festival, she was highly valued and respected by many. I had the privilege of presenting Lyn with an MP's recognition award at the 2017 Coral McLean Awards for her contributions to our area. I had personally seen the amount of work she had done. Even after her six children left school Lyn continued a strong relationship with Tregear Public School, helping run the school's breakfast club. Life wasn't always easy for Lyn, who had to support six children and care for her ill mum on her own. But she was a fighter and she never gave up. Her good friend Ivy Roberson said, 'Whenever a family member or a friend needed something, Lyn was the first one to offer a helping hand.' Having battled with diabetes and health issues, we lost Lyn to a heart attack at the age of 72. My sincere condolences go out to Lyn's family, including her children, grandkids and great grandchildren. She will be sorely missed by many. Vale Lynette Cameron.
