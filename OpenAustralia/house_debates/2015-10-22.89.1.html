        My question is to the Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science. Will the minister update the House on Australia's achievements in science and technology, particularly with respect to the Prime Minister's science and innovation prizes awarded last night?

         I thank the member for Herbert for his question. He is very fortunate to represent

         in Townsville, one of the finest universities in the country, arguably the best marine sciences university in the tropics in the world and a world leader in tropical health. They too are making great scientific breakthroughs.

         It is very important when there is a great success in Australian science and innovation that we mark it and we note it. Last night, the Prime Minister's science and innovation awards were awarded here in

          Great Hall
         </a>
         . I was fortunate to be able to attend with the Prime Minister. I will not say 'surprisingly', but it was a first science event that I have been at with the huge number of people where there was a standing ovation for the Prime Minister after his speech. I think it speaks volumes about the support for our innovation agenda in the science community and the opportunity to grow the new economy in Australia to match agriculture and mining as one of the staples of our economy in jobs and growth.

         There were new Australians awarded science prizes and innovation prizes, joining the long list of Australians who have made great discoveries in research and science. The

         The inaugural prize for innovation this year was won by Professor Graeme Jameson, with whom many people would be familiar, including the member for Newcastle, in whose electorate he lives. He works from the

It is estimated that he has saved the Australian economy $36 billion because of the Jameson cell over the last few years. It has actually—

         The deputy leader does not think that is an achievement? We think it is a great achievement. What it highlights is that we in Australia are still at the forefront of great research and science developments, whether it is things like the black box recorder; spray-on skin; wi-fi, which was created by

         This will only be advanced by the Prime Minister's innovation and science agenda that we will be announcing later this year, which will have short-term, medium-term and long-term reforms that will turbocharge the innovation economy in Australia. Scientists like Graham Farquhar and Graeme Jameson will have new opportunities to even further impact the economy, jobs and growth.
