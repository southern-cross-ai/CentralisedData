       <p>
        I have made representations on several occasions, both to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Post
        </a>
        and to Minister Coonan, seeking approval for an Australia Post agency to be established at the newsagency of one of my constituents, in Farmborough Road, Unanderra. To date my representations have been unsuccessful and the request has been refused. I am hoping that yet another petition signed within a short time frame by more than 1,000 local residents might lead to a reconsideration of this decision by the government and Australia Post, and I intend to formally table the petition in the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        The arguments in support of the proposal advanced by Mr Harper include the need for such a service, as indicated by the large number of signatures on the petition from the local residents. He points out too that the postal agency would be of great benefit to many elderly residents who live nearby and do not have transport. It would service a growing number of retirement villages and nursing homes in the area. The service would also be available to workers at the Unanderra industrial area, following the closure of the mail exchange in Glastonbury Avenue. Population increases in the surrounding neighbourhoods of Unanderra,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmborough_Heights" rel="nofollow">
         Farmborough Heights
        </a>
        , Coachwood Estate, Mount Kembla Heights and Highview Estate mean that the demand for postal services has outgrown the one available local postal service. I find it very hard to understand why Australia Post has responded by saying a new post office is not warranted. That is certainly not the view of local residents.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government made an election commitment in 2004 that it would ensure that the needs of elderly and disabled Australians and those living in regional and rural Australia would be taken into account. Why then are the needs and wishes of local residents, many of whom are elderly and without access to transport, being ignored by Australia Post? I urge the minister and Australia Post to respond to the request of the petitioners and approve an Australia Post agency at Mr Harperâ€™s newsagency on Farmborough Road, Unanderra.
