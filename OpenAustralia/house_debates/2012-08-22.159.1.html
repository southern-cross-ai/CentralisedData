        When we think about what makes a city liveable, safe and reliable, public transport services are among the top of the list. But among Geelong's six train stations, we have what I would say has to be one of the worst train stations in Victoria. Corio train station is wedged within a narrow stretch of land next to the Shell refinery. The building sits isolated beside a poorly maintained car park on a no-through road. Unmanned and poorly lit, it hardly invites usage. In fact, the vandalised location sign on School Road makes the station hard to find unless you know it is there. The station is not on a bus route. I have even heard stories of taxis refusing to pick up passengers there.

        In a city such as ours, to have a station so poorly regarded really is a disgrace. A well-serviced station would improve access to Melbourne, as well as Geelong, for passengers in Geelong's northern suburbs. The trip from Corio station to Geelong station takes just nine minutes, much quicker than the bus, which can take up to 40 minutes from the CBD to Corio village shopping centre. Indeed, it is concerning to me that suburbs such as Norlane and Corio, where the need for public transport is arguably the greatest, are the least well serviced by trains. Corio station would be better patronised if it was safer to use and easier to reach. The station faces the wrong way, reflecting its history of servicing Shell's old Narita Gardens and

        School. Narita Gardens no longer exists and Geelong Grammar kids perhaps do not use the station as they used to.
       </p>
       <p>
        The opportunity now is for the station to service the people of Geelong's north, who are so poorly serviced by public transport. To do that, the station needs to be turned around, face Corio, and improved pedestrian access opened up through to Melbourne Road. As one of the landholders in the area, the subject has been raised with Shell itself, and I am pleased to say they are happy to have the conversation. Similar issues of safety exist in relation to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Shore" rel="nofollow">

        station. This station is the face of Geelong on the Melbourne to Adelaide run. We have to thank the volunteers who welcome the Overland services week in and week out, and ensure no passenger is left unattended. They really deserve our deepest appreciation for their kindness and commitment.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no welcome committee at Corio station, which is even more isolated than North Shore. If the Victorian Liberal government is serious about addressing the issues of disadvantage in Geelong's north, then investing in improvements to Corio train station should be part of the priority list. Good public transport improves access to jobs and support networks. It also creates a sense of belonging and ownership in a community. Everyone deserves to feel that about their city.
