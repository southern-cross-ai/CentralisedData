        I rise today to raise the issue of health care on behalf of the people of the Lalor electorate, because they, like me, are confused. They are confused because, when they compare the Primary Health Networks with Medicare Locals, they can hardly get a cigarette paper between the two. Information on Primary Health Networks on the Department of Health website states that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHN" rel="nofollow">
         PHN
        </a>
        s will be:

       <p class="italic">
        … working directly with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        s, other primary care providers, secondary care providers and hospitals. Care will be better coordinated across the local health system so that patients requiring help from multiple providers receive the right care in the right place at the right time. PHNs will work with other funders of services and purchase or commission high quality, locally relevant and effective services for groups of patients at risk of poor outcomes.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is all highly valuable work. Then, we have what was written about Medicare Locals in a press release from the Minister for Health,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Roxon" rel="nofollow">
         Nicola Roxon
        </a>
        , 2011, which stated:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … the new Medicare Locals will have the important role of working with GPs, nurses, allied health professionals, Indigenous health organisations and Local Hospital Networks to identify and respond to gaps in local health services—and help patients and professionals navigate our complex system more easily.
       </p>
       <p>
        My question is: what is the difference between a Medicare Local and the new Primary Health Networks? The answer, I fear, is: not a lot. There is, however, one significant difference—the word 'local' is no longer a feature. It is disappointing that the Abbott government is closing Medicare Locals at a cost of almost $200 million, which is money that could be better spent providing health services.
       </p>
       <p>
        Medicare Locals were established after careful research and significant input from those who were expert in the provision of health services. The model is sound, and the only reason for closure, it seems, is political. I have met with South Western Melbourne Medicare Locals several times over the past 12 months, and I have found them to be very well informed. In fact, their knowledge of our current health services and the features of health locally is outstanding. They understand the local issues and they are doing very important work.
       </p>
       <p>
        My question is: with the new version of Medicare Locals at a cost of $200 million, when you look at the map, the difference that you see, quite clearly, is that in metropolitan Melbourne the three new super Medicare Locals all meet in the CBD of Melbourne. My concern is shared by those locally. Does that mean that the head offices will all be in Carlton in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Melbourne" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the local will be gone forever?
