        Mr Deputy Speaker, on indulgence: I would like to update the House on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airlines_PNG" rel="nofollow">
         Airlines PNG
        </a>
        flight
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CG" rel="nofollow">
         CG
        </a>
        4684. I thank the member for Blair for his assistance. I regret to advise the House that the missing plane, Airlines PNG flight CG4684, has been located but that the plane has crashed. A PNG search and rescue reconnaissance helicopter located the crash site this morning. The site is located just north of the village of Isurava at an altitude of approximately 5,500 feet. The helicopter landed some way below the crash site. A group of PNG police officers disembarked from the helicopter and are now attempting to reach the crash site, but the terrain presents obvious difficulties of access.

        consular officers have contacted all of the families of the nine Australians on the flight and in the last hour have advised them that the crash site has been located. Obviously, our thoughts are with the families at this time.

        helicopter will attempt to land near the crash site, but this will entirely depend upon the terrain and the weather conditions. The ADF Caribou aircraft, which was stationed overnight in Port Moresby, containing additional PNG search and rescue personnel and the Deputy Head of Mission from the Australian High Commission at Port Moresby will depart Port Moresby at 11 am this morning for an up to 45-minute flight to the Kokoda village, which is approximately a three-hour walk from the crash site, leaving open the prospect of three separate parties trying to reach the crash site at high altitude in very difficult circumstances. Regrettably, I am advised that the weather is closing in, is deteriorating and is very likely to hamper these efforts, both by air and on foot, after about midday today.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am not in a position to give any advice as to the condition of the passengers and crew on the plane but, given that a crash site has been located, we have very, very grave concerns about the safety and welfare of the nine Australians, the three

        <p>
         Mr Deputy Speaker, on indulgence: on behalf of the opposition I join with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the government in expressing our deep concern about the reports of this plane crash in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
          Papua New Guinea
         </a>
         . Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends of those who were reportedly on this plane. I commend the government on its rapid response to the news of this incident as soon as we learnt yesterday that the plane had gone missing. I acknowledge the efforts of our consular, military and rescue personnel, who have been ready to take action in conjunction with the PNG officials as and when required.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is obviously a matter which touches the hearts of so many Australians. Australians are renowned for their sense of adventure. They like to experience all that the world has to offer, and over recent years walking the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokoda_Track" rel="nofollow">
          Kokoda Track
         </a>
         has become a pilgrimage for many Australians. A day that would have started out with so much excitement and anticipation has ended up with a plane crash, and that touches so many people. I thank the government for keeping us informed, and we certainly offer the government all support in its efforts to work with the PNG officials to locate the plane. We understand it is in very difficult terrain and our full support must be with the rescue teams, who will be involved in a very difficult mission. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those involved.
