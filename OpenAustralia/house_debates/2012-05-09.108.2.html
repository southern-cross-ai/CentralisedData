         Australian Capital Territory
        </a>
        . Land is in reasonably short supply in Canberra, and the rezoning of land to residential in the Greater Molonglo area, of which Weston Creek is a part, has opened up an opportunity for DHA to secure land and develop new housing which meets Defence standards in Canberra.
       </p>
       <p>
        The site is located approximately two kilometres from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_College" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence College

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Defence
        </a>
        over a 12-month period. The remaining sites will be sold for complementary development.
       </p>
       <p>
        The development of the site involves the provision of infrastructure of 73 single-dwelling lots, of which 50 will be used by Defence families, plus three multi-unit sites which are expected to yield up to 47 dwellings. The first stage will provide this infrastructure and involves the design and construction of roads, stormwater drainage, sewer, water, natural gas, telecommunications and electricity. Once the infrastructure is completed, construction of the 50 dwellings for Defence will be undertaken.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project costs of $39 million, inclusive of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">

        This site has been used for tertiary education purposes since its development by the New South Wales government in 1969 for a teachers college. When colleges of advanced education were amalgamated into universities it was transferred to the

        This proposal will involve road and civil infrastructure development, followed by the construction of 345 dwellings for an integrated residential community for the Department of Defence and other families. Following site development, construction will be undertaken to deliver 345 dwellings in five precincts. The site will provide housing for families of personnel posted to

        The project costs of $202 million, inclusive of GST and escalation but excluding cost of land, will be met by DHA and recovered through the sale of surplus lots and the DHA sale and leaseback program.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
         ATO
        </a>
        —proposes to undertake an integrated fit-out of new leased premises at 913 Whitehorse Road, Box Hill, Victoria. The ATO has a substantial presence in the Box Hill region and is currently located in a building at 990 Whitehorse Road, Box Hill, which has a lease in place that expires on 30 June 2014. It is expected that relocation into a new building will provide the ATO with considerable advantages in terms of building design, operational performance and operating cost efficiencies, and long-term viability through improvement in building infrastructure. The estimated out-turn cost of the proposal is $36 million plus GST. The developer will commence building works on site in June 2012, with demolition and excavation for the basement areas being the first tasks. Subject to parliamentary approval, the proposed integrated fit-out works are scheduled to start in May 2013 and be completed by 1 April 2014. The ATO is expected to commence occupancy of the building in April 2014. I commend the motion to the House.
