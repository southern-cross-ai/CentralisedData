       <p>
        My question is to the Minister for the Environment and Energy. Will the minister update the House on how the government is reducing the pressures on energy costs for businesses such as the Nowra abattoir, which employs 220 Aussies, or Argyle Meats in Nowra, which employs more than 30? Is the minister aware of any obstacles to delivering energy reliability and affordability?

         I thank the member for Gilmore for her question and acknowledge her deep concern about the rising electricity prices from Berry to

         . Just yesterday I met with the owner of a major abattoir in Junee that has gone from 32 employees less than two decades ago to 210 today. He is the biggest private employer in the Junee area and he has seen his electricity prices increased by 35 per cent year on year to nearly three-quarters of a million dollars. That is why we on this side of the House are focused on important reforms to the energy markets, trying to get more gas into the system, ensuring that we can reduce the cost of the transportation of gas, reining in the network costs, which can be up to 50 per cent of a household electricity bill, investing record amounts in storage, whether it is in battery storage or in the pumped hydro facilities that the Prime Minister has so encouraged, like

         I am asked if there are any obstacles to this approach. We know that those opposite, the Leader of the Opposition, who always turns his back when we are talking about energy policy, has refused to acknowledge the folly of his ways. Just four days after the election of
