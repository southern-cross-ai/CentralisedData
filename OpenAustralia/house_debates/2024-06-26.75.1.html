          Mr Speaker, you made a ruling in response to the Manager of Opposition Business a few weeks ago. That ruling was made at the request of the opposition. You also indicated that if we had questions like this, we'd start looking at just simply going to the next question.

           On 30 May at 2.19 pm, the Manager of Opposition Business asked me to direct the Treasurer to cease his repeated practice of undignified personal attacks. That was raised by the manager, and I agreed with him at the time that personal reflection on other members shall be considered highly disorderly. In light of that, we're going to continue with the practice from 30 May to ensure that those sorts of remarks aren't made. Out of respect for the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, I will ask her to begin her question again without that remark and make sure that she's complying with practice and standing orders.

           <p>
            My question is to the Prime Minister. Under this Prime Minister, families and small businesses are hurting, with core inflation having now increased for four consecutive months to 4.4 per cent. As the Reserve Bank Governor said last week, 'groceries, petrol, health, education, rents, insurance, expenses are all going up.' Isn't this another example of this Prime Minister's weak leadership letting Australians down?

              interjecting

              That question and the reframing of it says more about the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and her character than anything else. Just like we saw on the weekend, the Leader of the Opposition go from a so-called policy announcementâ€”that we know now was actually a mistake that led to them change their positionâ€”into a full-scale personal attack.

                 Mr Speaker, I refer you to the multiple rulings by Speaker Smith, where he made clear that if he was letting a question through that was borderline in any way that the rules of relevance were wide open. That ruling was made repeatedly by
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Smith" rel="nofollow">
                  Tony Smith
                 </a>
                 when he was in the Speaker's chair. This question is exactly in line with all of those precedents.

                 <p>
                  I have a series of precedents and decisions by former speakers here. The issue I have with this question is that it wasn't a tight question. It was a very broad question revolving around a whole range of issues regarding the Prime Minister's leadership. If you're going to ask a broad question about someone's leadership and the decisions that they make, and you frame in with a range of topics, of course the Prime Minister is going to be pretty broad in their answer. This is not a question that we've had before about a fact, or a figure, or a yes, or a no. It was a broad statement raising a number of issues. So if we're going to have these types of questionsâ€”just as has happened in previous parliaments, including the immediate parliament before this one, where I was a memberâ€”you're going to have a very broad answer. The Prime Minister has the call.

                   Thank you, Mr Speaker. I'm asked a question about leadership and I'm happy to answer a question about leadership. We know that, for the Leader of the Opposition, any endorsement is the kiss of death. In the pre-selection for the Queensland

For Andrew Constance, he said, 'Having been a senior cabinet minister, Andrew has a wealth of policymaking experience.' Well, guess what? He backed two horses in a three-horse race, and the third horse won. The third horse won with Dave Sharma. Then he endorsed Hollie Hughes, but the shadow Treasurer had something else in mind.
