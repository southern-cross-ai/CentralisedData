       <p>
        I rise today to speak on a matter that is of the utmost importance to my constituents: education funding. If we on this side of the chamber are successful at the next federal election, we will make the biggest investment in public schools in history. We'll provide no less than an additional $14 billion to transform public schools right across the nation and to ensure that our students have the best possible start in life. I'm pleased to say that this fantastic policy will be of great benefit to my community of Macarthur, with Macarthur public schools set to receive over $23 million of this additional funding. That $23 million is a substantial funding boost, and I look forward to being re-elected as part of a Shorten Labor government that will deliver on this fantastic commitment.

        This isn't about blindly throwing money at an issue. This is about a real investment in needs based funding that will truly make a difference for the students, teachers and parents of Macarthur. We know the things that make a difference in our schools. For example, one more teacher to provide one-on-one attention for a child with learning difficulties makes a huge difference. That's why Labor will put this additional investment on the table. We want to ensure that all students from Macarthur, and, indeed, across the nation, have the opportunity to reach their full potential. Education is a silver bullet to a bright future. I would encourage all locals to jump onto the website www.fairgoforschools.com.au.
