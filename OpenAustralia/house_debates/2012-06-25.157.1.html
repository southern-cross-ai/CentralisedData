        . First, we announced a special $5 million program to help lift grassroots participation in the game. As patron of the Mt Druitt Town Rangers Football Club and in an electorate where it is estimated there are nearly 10,000 people who play football, I was delighted that the government had committed so generously, boosting participation in what is already one of the most popular of all codes in Sydney.

        In 2010 there were approximately 90,000 registered footballers in Western Sydney playing in junior and senior competitions, accounting for over 20 per cent of participants nationally. There are more registered football participants in Western Sydney than in

News of a Western Sydney franchise was welcomed by the entire community but most notably by the football fraternity. While many will lay claim to the origins of football in Australia, Western Sydney has a compelling place in the game's history. The first recorded match played in

        Given the region's strong links to the game of football, it was fitting today that the new Western Sydney franchise was unveiled as the Western Sydney Wanderers, the same name as that first team. And when they make their debut in October against the

        The club has a great deal of building to do in the months ahead, but they have a CEO in Lyle Gorman and they have signed a coach and three players all with links to the region. Head coach,

        . His career, an impressive career, included 58 appearances for the Socceroos over 11 years, scoring eight goals.

       <p>
        Like many others who grew up in Western Sydney, I am delighted the game's heartland is being represented in its premier competition for the first time since 2004. This is terrific news and I cannot wait to see them play. While few of the game's founders will still be around, I am sure that many of their children and grandchildren are still active and involved in the game in Western Sydney and they will rejoice when a local team proudly takes to the field in the A-league. Our funding the game where it is played most will pay dividends in the years to come both in terms of the social fabric but also our sporting prowess.

        Finally, on the day when we welcome our own A-league side, I want to recognise that today is Matilda's star and
