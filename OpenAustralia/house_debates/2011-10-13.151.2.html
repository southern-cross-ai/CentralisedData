       <p>
        In the last two years I have had the opportunity to see the excellent work of Ngala, the well-known
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        provider of early parenting and childhood services. Ngala is known for its support and guidance for families and young children through parenting programs. On this occasion, I would like to pay tribute to them for their Home Interaction Program for Parents and Youngsters—HIPPY. HIPPY is 'a two-year home-based parenting and early childhood enrichment program', targeting families with young children living in disadvantaged areas. Ngala runs a HIPPY program based in Girrawheen, a suburb within my electorate of Cowan. I thank them for their excellent work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fifty-one HIPPY sites are run around Australia through funding received in the 2007 federal budget. I understand that full federal funding is due to expire at the end of 2012, with the amount halved for next year. Ngala have recently applied for interim funding to enrol 25 new families in 2012-13 but that is 10 fewer than their usual target, and they are awaiting a response from the government.
       </p>
       <p>
        Aligned with the National Early Childhood Development Strategy, Investing in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Years" rel="nofollow">
         Early Years
        </a>
        , HIPPY works with vulnerable families to improve outcomes for children and their parents. The HIPPY approach develops the foundations for learning in the home during children's crucial early years. HIPPY recognises the significance of children's early learning experiences and that parents are children's first and most important teachers. Families start HIPPY when their child is between 3½ and four years old and continue during the first year of formal schooling.
       </p>
       <p>
        A key component of HIPPY is regular home visits. This emphasises the value of the home as a place of learning. The program operates within the local community, employs community members and utilises the strengths and skills that already exist within each family. Regular group meetings for parents foster a sense of belonging, reduce the sense of isolation and increase families' awareness of community services and support.
       </p>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age" rel="nofollow">
         The Age
        </a>
        4 program is based on simple activities, while the Age 5 program also includes Parent Packs with information about child development. Delivery is tailored to meet each family's literacy level and English-speaking ability, while acknowledging other issues that may be impacting on the family. A storybook is included as a basis for some activities. These books have now been translated into several languages.
       </p>
       <p>
        The impact of the program reaches beyond simply enhancing children's school readiness. The activities offered in the program provide opportunities for positive interactions between children and their parents around learning and literacy. In turn, this enhances parent-child connection and bonding. Overall, the program increases parents' knowledge of child development and developmentally appropriate activities as well as awareness of their child's learning style. This improved understanding and parent-child connection has a positive impact on family relationships and the self-confidence of parents. Current HIPPY Girrawheen enrolments total 69 families, with 22 from Cowan. HIPPY Girrawheen covers the suburbs of Girrawheen, Balga, Koondoola, Westminster and Mirrabooka. These five suburbs have low socioeconomic assessment scores and have a significant number of residents from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. This is shown in HIPPY Girrawheen enrolments, with approximately 80 per cent born overseas, from a total of 15 different countries, with the majority of those being from Somalia, Sudan and Burma. The five target suburbs are marked by high unemployment levels, a high proportion of single-parent families and a high proportion of rentals. In Girrawheen, 24.5 per cent of households earn less than $500 per week. Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of enrolled families face complex issues. These issues may include isolation, financial stress, unemployment, housing insecurity, maternal depression, low parental education levels, poor English literacy, having a large number of young children, family discord and sole parenting. All of these are known risk factors in terms of optimal early childhood development. The presence of multiple risk factors in the early years significantly reduces children's chances of healthy development, often leading to suboptimal outcomes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just as multiple risk factors negatively impact on children's development, accumulative protective factors can also help change a child's developmental pathway, promoting good outcomes. In recent quantitative and qualitative research conducted on HIPPY, there is clear evidence of the positive impact of enhancing protective factors within enrolled families, particularly in building social networks, reducing social isolation and improving family relationships. Further, HIPPY has been demonstrated to be effective and appropriate for disadvantaged families in both culturally and linguistically diverse and Anglo-Celtic communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although there is a chance of receiving interim funding for 2012-13, there is no commitment of federal funding for the program beyond that. I am certainly drawn to the program through a sense of providing parental responsibility and playing a role in providing leadership in children's lives. I think this program is a good thing and that it deserves federal government support. I thank the HIPPY Girrawheen team for its great work.
