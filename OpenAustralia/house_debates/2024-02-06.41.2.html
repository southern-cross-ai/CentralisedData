            The Treasurer does make a point. We have just introduced very significant legislation before this parliament to give every Australian a tax cut. Every Australian taxpayer, whether or not they own their home, all 13.6 million of them. What do those opposite talk about? They've had two weeks to think about their first question and it has nothing to do with what we're doing and something to do with something that no-one will ever do.

                When it became clear that we were going to have a position of supporting every taxpayer getting a tax cut, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition—because the leader went missing for a while—charged out there and she said, 'We will fight this legislation in the parliament'. She went on and said, 'We don't even know what it will look like.' She actually said that. There's no gap between the sentences—

                    Yes, I have answered the question. Now I am adding to it, giving a bit of colour and movement. Last night I was there watching

                     Nemesis
                    </i>
                    , watching all the coalition of hatred along there, an hour and a half that explains in three parts why they were such a hopeless, divided government full of hate of each other. It was all played out. I was reminded that the Leader of the Opposition's big commitment to be made leader was that he would smile more. He was going to be like

                    smashing through the walls—his clear hatred, full of negativity, full of abuse. Come on, if you were fair dinkum, you would vote against our measure and you would commit to roll it back, just like your deputy absolutely promised to.

                           Our legislation will give every taxpayer a tax cut, all 13.6 million of them. One of the great divides that we are seeing play out in Australian politics at the moment is the concept of aspiration. Those opposite think that, for people to aspire, they have to be someone who has been to the right school, had all the right background, been part of the elite and that they are the only people who aspire.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                           In this nation, what I know as I go around is that every taxpayer in the electorate of Holt has aspiration, every single one—every cleaner, every supermarket worker, even those who work at Woolworths, those 200,000 that this bloke wants to lose their job. Every single worker in this country aspires to a better life for themselves and for their families. That's why, in an electorate like Holt, people have come from all over the world for a better opportunity for their kids, for the next generation. So we think that this is the right decision for the right time.

                          <p>
                           It's not an easy decision. We knew that there would be pushback. We knew that those opposite in their heart of hearts would object to this so strongly, even though I'm not quite sure what their position is today on this. We knew they would object to it. But we knew that it was the right thing to do. I said at the

                             I said that our core principles would be no-one left behind and no-one held back. That's why we wanted to make sure that those battlers who weren't going to get a single dollar under the existing frame of the Morrison tax cuts got a tax cut, got a break, because that's not just good for them; it's good for the economy as well. But we also wanted to acknowledge that you can't say that there are cost-of-living pressures out there on middle Australia and then not be prepared to do everything that you can to make a difference. We will make a difference, which is why these tax cuts should be supported.

                                          I resisted talking about negative gearing and the member opposite! But Senator Kovacic said this:
                                         </p>
                                         <p class="italic">
                                          We should not be afraid to consider tax changes, whether they be capping the number of properties that can be negatively geared …
                                         </p>

                                          That was in her first speech. You know, that's where you go along and you think, 'What do you really believe in?' There it is, just there, from September 2023. And then the member for Menzies had this to say about negative gearing:
                                         </p>
                                         <p class="italic">
                                          Every lever must be on the table.
                                         </p>

                                          I'll tell you what we're doing about housing: we're focusing on supply. That's what we're doing: focusing on supply. We had a tax change in the budget to encourage build to rent. That was the tax change that we had in the budget. I'm not sure if they noticed it, because they were just too busy opposing everything—which is what they do. Except, maybe—I'm not quite sure what their position is on these tax cuts, because they're asking questions about everything but.
