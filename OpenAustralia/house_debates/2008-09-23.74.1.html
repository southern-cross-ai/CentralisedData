       <p>
        I would like to talk about the community spirit that has been well and truly alive within my electorate of Dickson over the last few months. During this time six local shows took place, spread right across what is now a very vast electorate. We need to acknowledge the committees that, each year, volunteer their precious time to make these events go ahead. Why are these events important? They provide the opportunity for all of the community to come together socially and for local businesses and producers to display their work and products. They also allow the children within the district to experience and learn firsthand about the local talents their community offers and to seek involvement in community events.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was able to visit the shows and I have much admiration for the long hours and the many months of planning that go into each and every one. I would especially like to thank all the show society presidents and their committees: Mr Peter Eggleston, President of the Toogoolawah Show Society; Mr Don Connolly, president of the

        show; Mr John Drynan, president of the Esk show; Mr John Lautenbach, president of the Dayboro show; Mr Noel Kammholz, president of the Lowood show; and Mr Frank Lippett, president of the Samford show.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the representative for Dickson it is important that I have as many opportunities as possible to speak with people and I am grateful to the show societies for allowing me to have this. As always, our stall was involved over the days of the shows and we were visited by literally hundreds of people of all ages. I think it is a time to listen and to realise that to hear the issues of our communities we need to reach all ages. I find that there is no better way to understand their individual issues than by being out and about, not just at these shows but by taking a caravan out in the electorate, by conducting mobile offices and by attending events, schools, community groups and the like. It also gives my constituents the opportunity to offer suggestions and to have frank debates with me about local, as well as federal, issues.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge today the many people who volunteer their time to staff my stall and to offer assistance to all of my constituents:

        and the other people who provided assistance to make the stall possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        In closing, I would like to again congratulate all of the show societies. These shows provide a wonderful opportunity to display the best elements that our local communities have to offer. Quite often people from outside the region visit, and they are encouraged to take up residence as a result of seeing the community spirit which is alive and well at these shows. It is a great credit to all of the local people who put these shows together year after year.
