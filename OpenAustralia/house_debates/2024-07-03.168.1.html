        list. Ken Gourlay was awarded an Order of Australia for service to sailing, and he certainly has given a great deal of his life to sailing. Coming from a sailing family, he is the Vice Commodore and a life member of the Tamar Yacht Club. He has competed in several Sydney Hobart Yacht Races and the Three Peaks Yacht Race and has introduced many young people to the sport. In November 2006 he set off on a quest to sail around the world alone, nonstop and unassisted. He completed the circumnavigation in the record time of less than 180 days, raising over $100,000 for the

        in 2007 for his efforts, was Tasmanian Australian of the Year in 2008 and, in 2010, was inducted into the Tasmanian Sailing Hall of Fame. Although his citation is for service to sailing, it is also a tribute to his generous nature and his life of philanthropy. Mr Gourlay said he was flattered by the recognition, although it was unexpected, saying, 'Sailing has given me this whole wonderful life and taken me places, and this is another thing it has helped me achieve.'

        I have the best job in Tasmania, I get to deal with amazing businesses all the time that are inspirational and to be part of a Tasmania that has grown so much after the last few decadesâ€¦people want to come to us and they want to buy our products, they value Tasmania as a brand and I feel proud to be part of the community of businesses that have made that happen.

        Congratulations to both Ken and Michael. I've had the pleasure of getting to know both of these gentlemen well over the years, and I know both to be very humble and unassuming men that care deeply for their community. These honours are a well-deserved recognition of their lifetime of service and their contribution to the community of Tasmania.
