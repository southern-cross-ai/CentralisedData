       <p>
        This third stage of redevelopment will include 14 project elements encompassing fuel farm works, training accommodation, medical and dental facilities, trainee living-in accommodation, combined messing facilities, physical fitness training facilities and office accommodation. The estimated outturn cost of the proposal is $331.5 million, plus

        precincts, Brisbane, Queensland.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposed knowledge based research business initiative will be a collaborative venture between the CSIRO and a number of Queensland government agencies at two key locations in south-east Queensland. These are: the Ecosciences Precinct at the Boggo Road Urban Village in Dutton Park and the Health and Food Sciences Precinct at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coopers_Plains" rel="nofollow">
         Coopers Plains
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The Ecosciences Precinct will be a centre of excellence focusing on climate change adaptation, better managing Australia’s natural resources and environment, and growing Australia’s farming, mineral, forestry, marine and tourism industries so that they are competitive and sustainable. It will consist of laboratories, offices and appropriate support facilities, including staff interaction areas. The Ecosciences Precinct will also create one of the largest concentrations of scientists in their field in Australia. Similarly, the Health and Food Sciences Precinct will consist of laboratories and support facilities, as well as a pilot plant for the development of new food products.
       </p>
       <p>
        The two precincts will foster increased sharing of skills, equipment and facilities. This will enable efficient and cost-effective research. They will collectively provide accommodation for 1,200 science professionals and support staff. The building designs will maximise opportunities for interaction between the partners, to provide flexibility in the use of space and to meet the changing needs of the research.
       </p>
       <p>
        The cost of shared facilities will be attributed between the partners and the specific costs of any special facilities will be incurred by the individual agency. The estimated completion cost for the two developments is $375 million, of which the CSIRO component is estimated at $85 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        In its report the Public Works Committee has recommended that this proposal should proceed subject to the recommendations of the committee. The CSIRO accepts and will implement those recommendations. Subject to parliamentary approval, it is anticipated that early packages will be let to allow site establishment works to commence in February next year for the Boggo Road site and main works to commence at the same time on the Coopers Plains site. On behalf of the government I wish to thank the committee for its support and I commend the motion to the House.

       </p>
       <p>
        The C17 heavy airlift infrastructure project will deliver the necessary permanent facilities and airfield pavements to support C17 operations at its home base, RAAF Base Amberley, and expanded infrastructure at deployment bases, RAAF bases Edinburgh, Darwin, Pearce and Townsville, to allow the large aircraft to operate effectively.
       </p>
       <p>
        This project will allow the C17 aircraft to provide a new responsive global airlift capability that will significantly enhance the
