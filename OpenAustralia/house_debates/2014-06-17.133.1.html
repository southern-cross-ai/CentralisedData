        Many would have noticed that this week in Canberra the 2014 National General Assembly of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government
        </a>
        meetings are being held. With 900 delegates and the theme of 'Getting down to business', it gives all of those community leaders, in those very important roles that they play within local government, an opportunity to interact with those of us in this place in Canberra. It is an opportunity for local government to put on the national agenda issues that are indeed important to local government, highlighting issues of urban communities, rural communities and territories to government and parliamentarians in this place. At the end of it all, we are individuals that live in communities that are governed at a state level and a federal level. But it is ultimately about community, and the old saying that 'all politics is local' is indeed very true. Local government is indeed about local grass-roots politics.

        In the electorate of Lyons, I have 13 municipalities and I love them all dearly. Many of them are here today. They represent what are the very diverse and dispersed communities around my state of Tasmania and my large electorate of Lyons. Tasmania, ultimately, in many ways is a microcosm of our nation with urban communities, rural communities and regional communities. I am really pleased to welcome here this week the Mayor of the
