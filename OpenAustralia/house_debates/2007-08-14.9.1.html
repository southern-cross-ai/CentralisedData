        Mr Speaker, I seek indulgence to convey to the House the member for Calare’s situation. Peter has asked me to simply thank you all for the expressions that you have given, not only the members of the parliament but the staff of the parliament, the media and the broader Australian community. I pass on those thoughts from Peter. I have been speaking to him on a number of occasions. He is preparing for a battle—he has had plenty of those in this place—and he is very positive in relation to the battle against cancer. He would like all of you to know that he does thank you for those feelings that have been expressed. He said to me that they will be not only a great comfort to him but a great support in the challenge that is ahead.

         Mr Speaker, on indulgence, I know that I speak for every member of the House in passing on to the member for Calare our sincere and genuine good wishes. Cancer is a terrible disease; it afflicts many Australians. We hope that his fight against it is successful. We very much have his welfare and that of those close to him in our thoughts and prayers at this time.

          Mr Speaker, on indulgence and on behalf of the federal parliamentary Labor Party, I endorse the remarks made by the member for New England and by the Prime Minister on behalf of the government.

           Peter Andren
          </a>
          is known to all of us in this place. Whatever our political disagreements may have been with him from time to time, all members would be united in this: he is a person of integrity, he is a person of great decency and he is a person who has always sought with courage and conviction to bring forth his views into this parliament. He has never been a person to have taken a backward step when it comes to those things to which he is deeply committed. As the Prime Minister has said on behalf of all of us in this place, we wish him and his family well in what will be a big battle ahead for him. Our thoughts and our prayers are with those who are near him and with Peter himself.
