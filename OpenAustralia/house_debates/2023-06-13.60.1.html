          . There are a number of occasions, and we've been through this a lot over the years and there are many precedents under Speaker Smith, where, if a question is asked about someone that goes to a period prior to them holding the portfolio, the first question that can only be asked is to refer to the quotation where as a minister they have reference back to it and to ask whether that is correct. Simply referring to it and then asking a different question—certainly, in our whole time in opposition, that never got it over the line. The first question always had to be providing the quotation exactly in line with that precedent, asking whether that was accurate and, then, subsequent questions could come based on the answer the minister had then given. That's the way it's worked here the whole way through.

            is very clear at page 555:

           <p class="italic">
            … where Ministers have made statements either inside or outside the House about matters that may concern their actions before becoming a Member and/or a Minister, questions have been permitted on those statements.
           </p>
           <p>
            The question was, very specifically, in relation to quite extensive statements the minister who's received the question made about this matter on

             </i>
             . Questions of this nature are problematic because, as members know, standing orders are clear that ministers can only be asked about questions about which they are currently responsible for. Whilst the deputy leader did frame the question around media statements and comments that were made, I want to be clear, and the minister has indicated she's happy to take the question, moving forward, that members can only ask questions about issues, in the statement, around page 555, 'where ministers have made statements either inside or outside the House about matters that may concern their actions before becoming a member and a minister', that questions have been permitted on these statements, twice. I'm going to allow the minister to be careful with her answer to make sure she's conforming with the standing orders but also in making it relevant to the question regarding her statement, not regarding anything before she was a minister but regarding her statements as a minister. I give her the call.

I'll tell you what really shocks me and what really disappointments me about this is that, once again, we are missing the point here. A young woman who worked in this place has made a serious allegation that she was sexually assaulted in her workplace.

                The question was within the standing orders. The minister indicated her willingness to answer the question. The point of order now is on relevance. The direct question was: was the minister or her office aware prior to 15 February 2021 of the allegations aired on

                 The deputy leader will resume her seat. For clarity for the deputy leader, if that were the question, it would have been ruled out of order. Moving forward, because you're asking a question about a decision or an action that was taken before she became a minister. Your question was framed around her media interview. That's why it was permitted under the standing orders. You can only ask the Prime Minister or ministers questions about what they've been responsible for since they've become Prime Minister or a minister. So, the minister is being relevant. I'm going to listen carefully to what she says to make sure she is within standing orders. So far, she is. I'll give her the call. She has two minutes remaining.

                  The Deputy Leader of the Opposition asked me if I stand by what I said on Monday, and I do. I'll tell you why I do. Because it shocks me that, in this place today, we have these sorts of questions when, what the issue here is, a young woman who worked in this place has made a serious allegation that she complains and has further alleged that her complaint was not dealt with appropriately by her employer. You bet I asked questions; you bet I took it seriously. Would I do the same again? I 100 per cent would. There is a reason that only 13 per cent of sexual assaults are reported to police in this country.

                    It's on standing order 91, which is about disorderly conduct. This is a conversation that is highly emotive, and there are questions to be answered here, but I do not think it's appropriate for any member of this House to be yelling across the chamber at another member to just simply 'shut up'. I don't think that's appropriate.

                        It's on your ruling, Mr Speaker. The minister's non-answer to the question relates to your ruling. I want to ask to your ruling and quote from practice: where ministers have made statements either inside or outside the House about matters that may concern their action before becoming a minister, questions have been permitted on those statements. I am not sure what in your ruling narrows the answer that the minister was entitled to give so that she could not address the question I was asking her.

The key point is the final two words that were just read out by the deputy leader, which is about questions having been permitted on 'those statements'. The question can only be asked about the statement that has been made while the person was a minister.

                             is about statements that they've made as a minister regarding another issue. Whatever the minister may or may not have said on that interview, you can ask questions about.

                              Just to be clear on this point: what the minister said in her interview on Monday went specifically to the question of who had known what prior to the episode being broadcast. I'd suggest to you that the deputy leader is entirely within the standing orders in the question she's asking.
