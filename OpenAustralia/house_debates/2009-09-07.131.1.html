       <p>
        I recently had the pleasure of meeting with young motor trades pre-apprentices and apprentices who have been given a head start by the Motor Traders Association Apprenticeships Plus program. This program is a federally funded, six-week training course for pre-apprentices. The most recent class was generously hosted by Jim Kalamiotis at Penrith Mazda, who opened his dealership to 16 young people aged between 15 and 22, to help begin their motor trades training. The pre-apprentices who recently graduated from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MTA" rel="nofollow">
         MTA
        </a>
        program completed the first six subjects of a motor trades course and have learned some of the basic skills needed in the industry. This not only makes them more attractive to potential employers looking to take on new apprentices but also helps to give them confidence and direction.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to congratulate Jim, service manager Robert Borg and the team at Penrith Mazda for their commitment to giving young people opportunities to begin their trades training. I would also like to acknowledge Michael Wentworth of the MTA for his enthusiastic support of each program participant and his passionate belief in giving young people a go, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Palmer" rel="nofollow">

        of the Schools Industry Partnership, who has been involved in linking the MTA with young people in the area.
       </p>
       <p>
        A trades qualification is just as valuable as a university degree. Combined with the two trades training centres in my community funded by the Rudd government, programs like the one run by the MTA are helping to give young people a chance to realise their potential and make a positive contribution to our community.
