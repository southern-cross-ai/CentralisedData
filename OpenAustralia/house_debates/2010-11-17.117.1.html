       <p>
        I rise to acknowledge the random acts of kindness that happen continually in my electorate of Wright and, as I noted in my maiden speech, the numerous generous acts that happen on a daily basis throughout my electorate by the silent majority who go quietly about their business. However, it would be remiss of me not to mention the good work done by the Jimboomba branch of Cancer Council Queensland, who held their annual Relay for Life a few weeks ago. Relay for Life is a walk which is a national fundraiser of which you all would be aware. The people in attendance were the family and friends of cancer sufferers who wish to acknowledge and offer support to those who are suffering, to those families which are affected and, more importantly, to those who have survived the  most dreadful and indiscriminate disease that is cancer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite it being a wet day in Jimboomba, which caused the relocation of the walk to an undercover car park at the nearby shopping centre, this did not dampen the spirit or enthusiasm of those who attended. It is most comforting for those who attend to witness the proud local community spirit and support. The Jimboomba branch encourages the Relay for Life participating teams of walkers to theme their participation by dressing up in team colours. Seeing teams of people dressing up in a variety of costumes, coloured hair and team T-shirts added to the atmosphere of making it a fun night, helping to reflect on the sadness that cancer brings not only to the person afflicted but to the whole family involved. I was humbled to walk the first lap with a group of survivors of cancer. How lucky they are to have achieved this status.
       </p>
       <p>
        Besides being a great event to raise community awareness of how far-reaching cancer is within society, the event also showcased the community at large, who gave generously towards the fundraising contributions. This year, the Jimboomba branch alone raised over $55,000. This is a remarkable outcome for such a small but growing community in my electorate, and it is indicative of the community spirit. These are the unselfish, random acts of kindness offered by one of my local community groups. This $55,000 will go towards much needed research that Cancer Council Queensland provides. With this event in mind, I would like to acknowledge the years of work by this organisation and its long-term president, Ada Banks, and her committee. Her family were also affected by cancer some years ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another local campion of fundraising for the Cancer Council in Jimboomba, and now employed by them, is Di Dixon. Di has also worked tirelessly for the community for many years and I congratulate and acknowledge their work and selfless endeavours for the benefit of others.
       </p>

        Groups like these throughout the electorate of Wright need to be congratulated for their continued and tireless efforts for the benefit of others. Schools throughout Wright are currently celebrating their awards nights where students receive acknowledgement for academic, athletic and leadership achievements. It is a special time for the seniors as they prepare to leave one phase of their life and commence another, whether it be preparing to enter the workforce, head off to university or to take the more fashionable gap year.
       </p>
       <p>
        A recent highlight for me was to attend the Boonah State High School award ceremony last week. The new principal of the school, Bronwyn Johnstone, is very proud of her new charge after her promotion to the Boonah school. I also acknowledge the out going P&amp;C president Wendy Creighton, whose guidance and drive has contributed to many of the schools successes. To Wendy: on behalf of the community, I thank you for your years of professional service.
       </p>

        in Jimboomba also conducted their awards ceremony last Friday. Amidst the talent of academic and sports awards, it was the musical presentation by a range of ages that was most appreciated by their peers. The college experiences growth in student numbers each year as the local community grows and develops.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also acknowledge the Beaudesert State High School for their school based apprenticeship award night held recently. Students participated in the workforce as part of their curriculum to achieve workplace certificates in numerous fields—a great initiative that gives both the student and the employer the benefits of try before you buy. Part of the success of the Beaudesert skill based apprenticeship scheme is the commitment by the parents of the students, of which a few would awake at 3.30 am to have select students at their chosen place of employment by 4 am—a fantastic effort which will be rewarded by instilling a strong work ethic in their child. To the students, parents and staff of the school: I congratulate you.
       </p>
       <p>
        I hope that Wright continues to provide opportunities and a well-balanced education for our young people, for they are the future of Australia. I take this opportunity to wish all the seniors that are leaving year 12 every success with whatever endeavour they choose.
