          <p>
           I want to thank the member for Fadden for his question. He, like I, together with the member for
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McPherson" rel="nofollow">
            McPherson
           </a>
           , have a deep passion about Australia's tourism industry. We are very much looking forward to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games" rel="nofollow">
            Commonwealth Games
           </a>
           and what we will be able to showcase of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
            Gold Coast
           </a>
           to the world.
          </p>
          <p>
           I also know that, as part of his interest in tourism, the 2016 Tourism Investment Monitor, which was released by Tourism Research Australia, shows that the total value of Australia's tourism investment pipeline is some $60 billion, or thereabouts. They also estimate that hotel transactions were about 4.2 billion last year, with more than half of those transactions on the Gold Coast. In 2018, as I mentioned, the Gold Coast will host the Commonwealth Games.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Games" rel="nofollow">
            The Games
           </a>
           will put our great city on the world stage. It is going to boost tourism in a city that has about 30,000 people reliant on it. That is why the coalition government was pleased to put $156 million into the Commonwealth Games four years early, representing our commitment.
          </p>
          <p>
           But I note that the member for Fadden asks about the rule of law. Members in the chamber may have seen some footage that was recently released in relation to
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
            CFMEU
           </a>
           officials. They were hurling abuse and intimidating safety officers on the Commonwealth Games site. So what was it that the CFMEU was saying? I have to say, Mr Speaker, I am mindful that often there are children in the gallery and children watching on
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
            TV
           </a>
           . So I will be considerate of that in terms of reading it out to the House. The CFMEU said: Beep—'you'—beep. 'I'll'—beep—'drive you, eh? Drive you'—beep. 'You know what? You know what? I know your phone number. I know where you live'— beep. 'I'm telling you now. I'm'—beep—'telling you'—beep. That was what the CFMEU said.

             The strange thing, Mr Speaker, is: it is not the language that the Labor Party find offensive. The fact is: there are another four letters that the Labor Party find deeply offensive. Those four letters are: '
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABCC" rel="nofollow">
              ABCC
             </a>
             '. That is what the Labor Party find offensive. That is what they do not like to hear about. We know already that they have been given 11 million reasons to look away when it comes to building and construction sites—11 million reasons for 'Bikie Bill' to turn away from the kind of outlandishness that we see—

                CFMEU
