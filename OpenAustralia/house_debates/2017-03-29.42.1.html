        Recently in parliament we held a neurological event to raise awareness of the difficulties faced by people with Parkinson's disease, motor neurone disease and multiple sclerosis. We hosted Alzheimers Australia, Brain Injury Australia, the Huntington's Association, the Muscular Dystrophy Foundation and groups associated with hereditary neurodegenerative conditions.

        Since 2013 I have been the chair of the Friends of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_Disease" rel="nofollow">
         Parkinson's Disease
        </a>
        , and I was honoured to have been part of this event, later introducing Gary and Jayne Latham, Monica Hall and Bettina Clayton-Greene and her daughter Jamielle to the Prime Minister. At that meeting they talked to him about the difficulties they face, particularly as the rate of degeneration for their illness is not always recognised in the implementation of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        . They also spoke about research initiatives, which are being funded by the coalition government, and about the neurological interventions, such as the deep-brain intervention, that can be used to reduce tremors but only for some sufferers of Parkinson's Disease.

       <p>
        Steve Sant, the chair of Parkinson's Australia, spoke of the need for neurological nurses. As we already know in Gilmore, they make an amazing difference to the quality of life for those suffering from these illnesses. Thursday, 11 April 2017 is World Parkinson's Day. The theme for 2017 is Pause for Parkinson's as part of the Shake It Up Australia's campaign. In Gilmore we will host a lunch for our local Parkinson's Support group.

        My friend and colleague Senator John Williams, better known as 'Wacka', has recently been diagnosed. I am sure he will approach this with the same tenacity and courage as he does with in this placeâ€”
