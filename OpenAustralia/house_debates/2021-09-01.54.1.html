        ended his term yesterday. Born in Vietnam in 1954, Hieu Van Le arrived in Darwin in December 1977 as a 23-year-old boat refugee with little more than the clothes he was wearing, having fled at the end of the 10-year

         Governor of South Australia
        </a>
        and, on 1 September 2014, Governor of South Australia, a role in which he has been so warmly received by the South Australian people and in which he has served with dignity, professionalism and humility.
       </p>
       <p>
        As patron of more than 200 organisations, Hieu Van Le, most often accompanied by Mrs Lan Le, became the people's governor. Hieu will be replaced by career diplomat Frances Adamson, who becomes the third woman to serve as South Australian Governor. I congratulate Frances Adamson and wish her well in the role. I also thank Hieu Van Le and Mrs Lan Le for their service to South Australia, and wish them every happiness in the next phase of their lives, in which I have little doubt they will both continue to serve South Australia in some capacity.
