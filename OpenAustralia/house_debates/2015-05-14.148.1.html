       <p>
        I rise to pay tribute to a great local school in my electorate, and indeed the local high school of my home suburb of Glenwood:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenwood_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Glenwood High School
        </a>
        —which recently commemorated the historic achievement of their 10th anniversary.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since 27 April 2005, Glenwood High School has served as a beacon of opportunity in our local community. It has fostered a very diverse and harmonious environment which reflects the very best of our nation—anyone, irrespective of their race, colour or creed, can write the next chapter of our Australian story.
       </p>
       <p>
        Approximately 52 per cent of students are from a language background other than English. This is not only a wonderful statistic that reflects the reality of everyday life in multicultural Australia but it is a credit to the ethos of the school that each and every day every student at Glenwood High School is instilled with what one former student called a 'feeling of belonging and a sense of purpose'.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was a wonderful event on 27 April this year, and wonderful to be part of those commemorations. I want to particularly acknowledge the school community for putting on a great day. It included two assemblies for junior and senior students, showcasing the history of the school. There were performances, and we had former students telling their success stories. When you heard these young people, who had gone through this local high school, and saw what they are doing now—everything from studying, going into design to be being real success stories in their fields—you can see what a great school this is.
       </p>
       <p>
        I must also acknowledge the founding principal, Mr Russell Turner, who joined for the day, and also the P&amp;C, who funded the creation of an anniversary garden at the front of the school.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was a wonderful day. It included a mini fair in the quadrangle for students, with food trucks selling a variety of food. Games were conducted, and there was live entertainment. It was a truly enjoyable day.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to give some recent examples of the calibre of students from Glenwood High School. Recently, as part of the Anzac Centenary commemorations, I conducted a Greenway Anzac Day writing prize.
       </p>
       <p>
        The judges in this were selected from our local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        s, national servicemen, and some other community organisations. I was not involved in the judging, and they certainly did not look at the names of the students and the schools that they came from before judging. But it is telling that Liam Lengronne and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Gleeson" rel="nofollow">
         Patrick Gleeson
        </a>
        from Glenwood High School won the intermediate and senior prizes, so two students from the one school winning those.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to particularly acknowledge their librarian, Rada, and also everyone involved in the performing arts at Glenwood High School. Not only was this a wonderful day of celebration, but it also showcased their talents in music, Indigenous performing arts, and their Punjabi dance number. I pay tribute to all the students and teachers of Glenwood High School and wish you all the very best in the next decade to come.
