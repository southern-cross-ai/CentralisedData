        I rise today to deliver a speech written by Matthew Drennan, a communications student on placement in my office, about the upcoming bushfire season. This is an issue that I am very close to as it coming up to a year since the bushfire emergency greatly affected my electorate.

        and the historic town of

        </a>
        were devastated by the bushfires that started on 17 October last year. Tragically, a Lake Munmorah resident lost his life while protecting his home. Just under 3,000 hectares of land were affected with three homes and 15 sheds and businesses destroyed by the fire. Included in this was Wallarah House, an historic house in Catherine Hill Bay that was built in 1887. This bushfire could have been more devastating and damaging if it was not for the excellent firefighters during those tough days. Many people were evacuated from their homes including residents in Lake Munmorah,

        , Catherine Hill Bay and elsewhere.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish to also remind everyone that in the arrival of the bushfire season it is extremely important to be prepared. Planning out bushfire survival plans allow residents to know what to do, where to go and what to take in the event of a bushfire. Having those decisions already organised and planned out means that residents will be able to act quickly and safely. Making changes around the home will also be helpful especially when it comes to gutters and surrounding trees and gardens.
       </p>
       <p>
        Knowing your type of area and its history with bushfires is also important for bushfire safety. In
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        there are six different ratings of bushfire danger, which can show just how disastrous a bushfire could be at that time. During the Low, Moderate, High, and Very High ratings is the best time to plan and review your bushfire survival plan and monitor the conditions. During the Severe rating, it is best to leave you home in the early part of the day unless you are prepared to defend your home in the conditions. In the Extreme rating it is also best to leave early unless your home is designed or modified to withstand a bushfire and you are also mentally prepared to defend as well. In the Catastrophic rating, the highest rating of bushfire danger, residents should leave their home early and enact their bushfire survival plan.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the event of a bushfire there are three alert levels that should be monitored. The Advice alert level indicates that a fire has started but there is no immediate danger.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Watch" rel="nofollow">
         The Watch
        </a>
        and Act alert means that the fire is increasing in danger and residents should start to use their plans. Finally, the Emergency Warning alert means that residents are now in danger and actions should be taken immediately.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the lead-up to a serious bushfire it is important to take the advice of the emergency services and stay aware of changing or dangerous conditions. Last year in the Shortland electorate, local residents worked well with firefighters and other services.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is almost a year since those devastating bushfires affected areas and communities in my electorate such as Lake Munmorah and Catherine Hill Bay. With that in mind, it is important to remember that being prepared and knowing of the dangers in the bushfire season will help reduce the dangers and risks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Matthew has made a fine contribution in my office. I am sure that he is going to be an outstanding employee and employer and I am sure that the contribution that he will make in the area of communication is enormous. Shortland electorate was devastated last year by bushfires which caused enormous hardship and extreme pain to many people in the area. We had people in evacuation centres, and we want to be prepared for the onslaught of this year's bushfire season. So Matthew has made a fine contribution to this debate and to getting people prepared for the bushfire season and I thank him for that.
       </p>
       <p>
        In conclusion, I would just like to add a couple of words to the debate that we have previously had in the MPI and urge each and every member to go back to their electorate and to show leadership, encourage social inclusion and to put out a message saying no to racism and no to discrimination, and yes to the community coming together and standing up for everything that is good and right. Australia is a great country and as a great country we want to see it remain that way into the future.
