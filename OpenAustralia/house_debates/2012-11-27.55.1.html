       <p>
        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's statement yesterday and to the statement today by Slater &amp; Gordon which I am holding my hand and which states that, in relation to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWU" rel="nofollow">
         AWU
        </a>
        matter, a conflict of interest arose between two clients. The statement indicates that, because Slater &amp; Gordon acted for the AWU, the Prime Minister acted for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Wilson" rel="nofollow">
         Bruce Wilson
        </a>
        personally and that, when Mr Wilson disclosed the use of the slush fund to purchase the Fitzroy property, Slater &amp; Gordon ceased acting for both clients. Does the Prime Minister still claim that as a partner of Slater &amp; Gordon she did nothing wrong?

         I did nothing wrong. Nothing the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has said or done during the course of today actually raises, as a matter of fact, any wrongdoing. What we have seen from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is that she has repeddled allegations I first dealt with in 1995. She has repeddled matters I dealt with comprehensively on the public record yesterday. She has repeddled matters out of an affidavit drawn by a person associated with the formation and operation of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
          One Nation
         </a>
         . She has repeddled these matters associated with making wilder and wilder and more and more ridiculous claims in the media.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is because the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and the opposition generally under this leader, are on a mission of sleaze and smear but they have not got anything credible to say. They are just repeddling incredibly old allegations or matters I have dealt with comprehensively on the public record. Indeed, the Manager of Opposition Business's point of order to try and get an out-of-order question into order actually made the point that these matters have been dealt with by me in statements comprehensively made.
        </p>
        <p>
         So, to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition: I have dealt with this matter over many long years. I have dealt with it comprehensively in front of the media. I have answered questions in here. I have been truthful in those answers. I did nothing wrong, and no amount of smear, repeddled from the best part of 20 years ago, will ever change that.
