         I thank the member for Solomon for this question and his long-standing interest particularly in Indonesia but also in the Pacific. This morning there was a 5.6 magnitude earthquake in Java. Media have reported that at least 162 people have lost their lives. More than 700 have been injured. It is estimated that some 13,000 people have been displaced with more than 2,000 homes damaged. I have conveyed, through to my friend President Widodo, Australia's condolences at this tragic loss of life. We will stand ready to provide our friends in Indonesia with support, as Australia always does.
        </p>
        <p>
         In Honiara this morning there was a 7.3 magnitude earthquake at 10 kilometre depth. There are reports of aftershocks. All staff of the Australian high commission are safe. There are no known injuries but the roof of the high commission annex has collapsed, which would point to likely damage throughout the city. Staff have been moved to higher ground because there was a tsunami warning that was issued. Our high commission is seeking to confirm the safety of all Australian in the Solomons. There are difficulties because phone lines have gone down, so there are communication difficulties there.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has stood up a consular emergency task force to lead consular response and support.

         </a>
         police are out doing damage assessment. We have placed someone in the national disaster response centre to assist with the initial response. We have contacted Prime Minister Sogavare to once again indicate that Australia stands ready to assist. We have, of course, historically played an important role in the Solomon Islands.
        </p>
        <p>
         Anyone with concerns for Australians in the Solomons can contact the consular emergency centre on, if they're in Australia, 1300555135, or if they're outside Australia +61262613305. We await further news. Senator Wong will be giving a statement to the Senate around about now as well. I hope that not just all Australians are safe. I think I can speak on behalf the House to say that we hope that the impact of this devastating earthquake is minimised and we stand ready to provide support.

          UTTON (—) (): I thank the Prime Minister for the update in relation to the situation. We extend our condolences in particular to the families in Java who have lost loved ones and those in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Islands" rel="nofollow">
           Solomon Islands
          </a>
          that will be panicking with about where their loved ones are in some circumstances right now.
         </p>
         <p>
          It was a harrowing experience in 2018 in Lombok where there was an earthquake there. To see the devastation to the local people, to the infrastructure—which, of course, in many cases is just not built to the standards that we would see here in Australia—the loss of life; the loss of livelihood for many of those people in villages and in the cities was quite devastating.
         </p>
         <p>
          We don't know the extent of the damage yet, but it will require assistance from Australia no doubt. As the Prime Minister rightly points out, our country will always stand with our near neighbours, with people in our region, in particular those from the Solomon Islands, from Indonesia and from elsewhere. We will always provide them with support in their hour of need. We have many staff, of course, in Solomon Islands at the moment, so we wish them safe passage, and I'm sure that they will be part of the response and recovery, and support to those within the community. We will lend any support to the government to make sure that we can respond in an appropriate way—as I say, as we have done in the past and as we will always do.
