       <p>
        Students in my electorate of Lindsay are working hardâ€”students like Diya from Claremont Meadows Public School. The teachers and students at Claremont Meadows Public School know Diya as someone who is hardworking and always ready to drop everything for her fellow students. These qualities make Diya a great pupil and peer and a fantastic young person.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another outstanding student in Lindsay is Aarin from Kingswood Park Public School. Aarin's school motto is 'strive for success' and Aarin embodies this spirit. Success doesn't always mean winning. Aarin strives to be a respectful, diligent and reliable student and friend. That's why I was proud that Diya and Aarin are the two local students to first receive my Lindsay Quiet Achiever Awards. Students going about their work with dedication and commitment deserve to be recognised and applauded for their efforts. As we head into the school award season, I want to make sure students quietly and humbly achieving are amongst the cohort of award recipients.
       </p>
       <p>
        I care very much about the future of all students in Lindsay. Our local students will be at the forefront of emerging industries and technologies in defence, space, advanced manufacturing and more. That's why I established the Lindsay Jobs of the Future Forum. I look forward to presenting more local students with the Lindsay Quiet Achiever Award, recognising them for their outstanding efforts this year.
