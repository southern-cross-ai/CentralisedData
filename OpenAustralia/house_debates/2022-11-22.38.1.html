        My question is to the Minister for Industry and Science. Can the minister tell us about the Prime Minister's prizes for science and what the Albanese Labor government is doing to prioritise science?

         I'd like to thank the member, because the member knows, as we all do, that science plays an exceptionally important role in solving complex problems, improving the quality of life and national wellbeing. We are a country that is blessed with an overwhelming number of smart people who are applying their know-how in ways that are making a difference both here and in the global community. Our history is littered with great examples of this—for example, the late Professor Frank Fenner, a biologist whose work contributed to the eradication of smallpox, an Australian who did great things for us here and overseas.
        </p>
        <p>
         It's right and fitting that we find ways to celebrate and encourage others down the same path, which is exactly what we did with the Prime Minister's awards for science here last night. After a two-year break due to COVID, we put together the nation's scientific and research community in the

          Can I
         </a>
         say, it was a great honour for the Prime Minister, for me and for other parliamentarians to witness the achievements recognised through those prizes. We are honoured by the presence of many of those recipients here in the gallery today. Thank you for your great work.
        </p>

         's science prize recipient is Professor Trevor McDougall. His study of ocean thermodynamics improves the accuracy of how we model the effects of climate change, and his work is used by oceanographers the world over. As we know, in the fight against climate change, listening to science matters.
        </p>
        <p>
         The prizes also recognise excellence in science teaching. It was overwhelming to see the passion from both George Pantazis, from Marble Bar Primary School in East Pilbara, and Veena Nair, from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewbank_College" rel="nofollow">
          Viewbank College

         in Melbourne. Both are building enthusiasm and curiosity for science and ideas in the next generation.
        </p>
        <p>
         We also recognised top new innovators, like Dr Pip Karoly from Melbourne, whose work is improving the tracking and treating of epilepsy, based on her research into seizure forecasting. Her work shows why we need to believe and have faith in our ideas. Our government knows this, and that's why we're looking to attract and retain talent through a diverse

         workforce pipeline. Our reconstruction fund will help back commercialisation of Australian discoveries, like the types encouraged by Associate Professor Brett Hallam, who's worked to commercialise research that dramatically improved the performance of solar cells by a mighty 10 per cent—not a small feat and well done! He received the PM's Prize for New Innovators.
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, if I may, can we just also acknowledge and thank Professor Graham Durant for his outstanding 19 years of service to Questacon, also known as 'the shrine to grateful parents across the country'—a distinguished service to the nation and the science community. Well done to Graham.

          on indulgence—As it was the Prime Minister's science awards, I very much associate myself with the comments of the minister. It was a terrific evening last night. You certainly improve substantially the

           on indulgence—I associate the opposition with the comments that have been made about the Prime Minister's Prizes for Science and extend our congratulations to all of the winners—a very impressive and distinguished collection of Australians. I particularly want to mention the two awardees for science teaching, George Pantazis and Veena Nair. The diversity, both in terms of gender and the national backgrounds of those who won awards, was particularly noticeable and speaks volumes for Australia as a nation.
