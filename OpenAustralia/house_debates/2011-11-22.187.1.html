        I rise to speak about the most recent openings of the

        projects in my electorate, which have delivered tremendous educational benefits for students and of course supported jobs in our community through the economic downturn in 2009 2010. I will also mention the upcoming launch of the

        kitchen garden at Aspendale Gardens Primary School.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two weeks ago at the Parkdale Primary School I joined acting principal Leanne Armao and the wider school community to officially open the school's federally funded $3 million multipurpose centre. This remarkable upgrade incorporates a full-sized gymnasium, canteen and learning area and gives students a state-of-the-art facility that was only a pipedream before the announcement of the stimulus package. I would like to acknowledge the past principal of Parkdale Primary School,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Johnson" rel="nofollow">
         Craig Johnson
        </a>
        , for his dedication not only to the school but to seeing this project through from the planning stage to near completion. Thanks must also be given to acting principal Leanne Armao, school council president Craig Fry, former school council president Lee-Anne Harrison, the staff and the school community for their contribution to their success of this facility.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week it was Aspendale Primary School's turn to celebrate the official opening of their federally funded $2.3 million dollar library and learning centre. This dedicated facility was the first major construction project undertaken at the school since the 1950s and delivers a new library and six additional classrooms which are tailored towards an open-plan learning style that transforms conventional teaching practices. Credit must go to Aspendale Primary School principal Phil Anthony, to the staff, school council president Cameron Gosling, former school council president
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiona_Smith" rel="nofollow">

        and the whole school community for making this historic upgrade a success.
       </p>
       <p>
        This Friday I will join with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keysborough_College" rel="nofollow">
         Keysborough College
        </a>
        principal Heather Lindsay, Acacia Campus principal Andrew Sloane and the wider school community for the opening of the college's $1.97 million science centre. The college is a multicampus school, where over 80 per cent of the students come from a non-English-speaking background. Recent graduates from the college have continued their education in science, engineering and biomedical fields at university. This new science centre is a fantastic addition to the college and will further enhance the educational and employment opportunities for our community. Finally, on 9 December I will join Aspendale Gardens Primary School to launch their $60,000 federally funded Stephanie Alexander kitchen garden. The Stephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden program was made possible by a $12.8 million federal government investment over four years. Students at Aspendale Gardens Primary School have the opportunity to grow, harvest prepare and share fresh food while learning the importance of making healthy choices. Aspendale Gardens Primary School's garden incorporates vegetable plots, fruit trees, a compost system, a worm farm, a hothouse and a chook pen. I know that the students are very excited about their garden and about learning about healthy eating and where their produce comes from.
