       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) acknowledges the targeted killings and kidnappings of Assyrian clergy and ISIL's destruction of a recorded 45 Assyrian churches between June and July 2014;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) acknowledges the forced displacement of hundreds of thousands of Assyrians since the invasion by ISIL in Iraq and Syria, notably in Mosul and the

         Nineveh Plains

        (10) recognises and condemns the:

       <p class="italic">

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (12) notes the aspirations of the Assyrian people for the establishment of an autonomous region in the Nineveh Plains and welcomes the in principle agreement of the

         Iraqi Government

        to be respected in the post ISIL makeup of Iraq and Syria.
       </p>
       <p>
        The parliament this week is focussed, quite rightly, on the budget and on the robust political debate in Australia, but we should not forget that there are people around the world facing the most horrendous of circumstances. Included in that are the Assyrian people of Iraq and Syria, who are currently being subjected, it must be said, to genocide.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Assyrian" rel="nofollow">
         The Assyrian
        </a>
        s, the indigenous Christian people of Iraq and Syria, have long suffered persecution, particularly since the fall of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein" rel="nofollow">
         Saddam Hussein
        </a>
        , but since the rise of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISIS" rel="nofollow">
         ISIS
        </a>
        —Islamic State—we have seen an attempt to eradicate the Assyrian people and to destroy their culture and their heritage. Recently, the United States Secretary of State described ISIL as 'genocidal by self-proclamation, by ideology and by actions'. Former
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secretary_of_State_Hillary_Clinton" rel="nofollow">
         Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
        </a>
        has said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I'm sure now we have enough evidence that what is happening is genocide, deliberately aimed at destroying, not only the lives but wiping out the existence of Christians, Yazidis, and other religious minorities in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
         Middle East
        </a>
        in territory controlled by ISIS.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is right and proper that this House associates itself with these sentiments and declares that enough is enough, the genocide must stop.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Assyrian people have been subject, of course, to persecution for many, many years. The world has witnessed the destruction of Assyrian holy sites, of ancient cultural artefacts and the obliteration of places of worship. We have seen footage of masked men with sledgehammers rampaging through museums and galleries, in an attempt not only to kill Assyrians but also to destroy the heritage and culture of this great and ancient civilisation. It cannot be allowed to occur.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is right and proper that the United Nations Special Adviser on the Prevention of Genocide make recommendations through the Secretary-General to the Security Council to recognise, prevent and halt crimes being perpetrated by Islamic State. As the member for Fowler, the member for Calwell and other members of the House, with the support of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, have said before: it is also right that we plan for a post-Islamic State world for the Assyrian people in which they can live in Iraq, in particular, in freedom—in their homeland in freedom—with all of the necessary protections and the necessary abilities to make their own decisions within Iraq for their own protection. This is very important. We cannot simply wait and hope and pray and work for the defeat of Islamic State without planning for the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Assyrian community in Australia has been very vocal in ensuring that this is the case, particularly the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_Universal_Alliance" rel="nofollow">
         Assyrian Universal Alliance
        </a>
        , led by Hermiz Shahen and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_David" rel="nofollow">
         David David
        </a>
        , who, again, have worked with me, the member for Calwell, the member for Fowler, the member for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingsford_Smith" rel="nofollow">
         Kingsford Smith
        </a>
        and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, and have met with the Leader of the Opposition, to progress this case. It is they, I know, who are also very keen to see this motion adopted in the House of Representatives, as does every
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Assyrian Australian
        </a>
        and as does every Australian concerned about human rights anywhere.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Assyrian people have been forced from Iraq in massive numbers. Many of them were forced from Iraq into Syria, seeking refuge in Syria, and they have now been forced out of this nation, which has given them some degree of protection over the last 10 years, into other countries in the Middle East. Many Assyrians have sought and achieved to find refuge and homes in Australia. They have become fine and upstanding Australians, but they do not rest and will not rest until their brothers, their sisters, their cousins can achieve the same protections as they have. And not necessarily by seeking asylum elsewhere.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have not met an Assyrian who seeks to leave Iraq out of choice. Assyrians have been forced out of Iraq. This is a land which has been their homeland for thousands of years. This is an ancient and noble civilisation which has done so much for the world. They have been subject, as I said, to terrible, terrible incidents since the fall of Saddam Hussein, but none worse than what they are being subjected to now, which, it can clearly, soberly and regretfully be concluded, is genocide. This attempted genocide cannot be allowed to succeed. We cannot look back on this age and think, 'If only the world had done more, we would not have lost one of the world's great civilisations: the ancient Assyrian civilisation.' The ancient Assyrian civilisation has given the world so much over many thousands of years and it is now time for the world to step in and offer them some protection in return.
