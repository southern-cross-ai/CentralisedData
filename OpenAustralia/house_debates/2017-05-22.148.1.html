        I often boast that my electorate is the most multicultural in the country and use opportunities like this to share stories of the wonderfully integrated community which I represent. While these stories often centre on the large Chinese and Korean diasporas, these two groups are just some of the many ethnicities that call Bennelong home.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_University" rel="nofollow">

        . This event celebrated the cultures of all

        . Normally, these groups would hold their own events, diluting their effectiveness and community reach. The SAFAL Fest unites all eight motherlands into one dazzling two-day festival. The festival hosted local and international stars to celebrate the region's diverse arts and culture. There was plenty on offer, with film screenings, filmmaking and writing workshops, arts exhibitions, book readings, music and dance performances, a talent quest, a seven-minute short film competition and awards. I had the honour of opening the event with a dedication to the great Bengali Nobel prize-winning poet of 1913,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabindranath_Tagore" rel="nofollow">
         Rabindranath Tagore
        </a>
        . He is held in reverence throughout South-East Asia and beyond. We then enjoyed an amazing awards ceremony on Saturday night.
       </p>
       <p>
        SAFAL Fest was put together by the Australian South Asia Forum. The forum is a not-for-profit, with a view to bringing Australians of South Asian heritage or those with an interest in South Asia onto a single platform that will achieve greater cohesion, assimilation, cultural recognition and economic empowerment. SAFAL Fest chairperson Ashi Gholkar, director of performing arts Kedar Pagaddinnimath and director of literature Rekha Rajvanshi made sure the event was a success, helped by representatives from Macquarie University Richard Howitt, Dr Iqbal Barkat and Deputy Vice-Chancellor Tim Beresford.

        I was particularly pleased to note that a large part of the funding for this event was provided by the federal government. We committed to giving $5,000, and I am very pleased to note that this was provided to the SAFAL team in April. I am proud to be part of a government that has made a commitment to our local communities. I look forward to continuing to support all our local groups and celebrations.
       </p>
       <p>
        While this was put on by the local South Asian communities, it was open to all. It is always pleasing to see local residents rallying around and celebrating the cultures of our neighbours. Our community's strength is in its diversity. This fusion of cultures is what makes our part of Sydney great and what makes me so proud to be its representative.
