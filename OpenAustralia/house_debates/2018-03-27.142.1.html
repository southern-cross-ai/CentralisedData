        Many of my colleagues will be aware of the plight of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankston_Dolphins" rel="nofollow">
         Frankston Dolphins
        </a>
        football club, as I have told their story a number of times before in this place. Much to the Dunkley community's horror, in late 2016 it was revealed that the Dolphins
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VFL" rel="nofollow">
         VFL
        </a>
        team had had their VFL licence revoked and had been placed in voluntary administration due to significant debt. This club, an important part of the prominent sporting community in Dunkley, has produced a number of elite players who went on to play in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Football_League" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Football League
        </a>
        for several different clubs, including players and the coach of the premiership Bulldogs team a couple of years ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        I met with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
         AFL
        </a>
        and helped set up the Save the Frankston Dolphins Steering Committee, whose first meeting was held in my office, as well as a GoFundMe page. A great number of people came together to support the Dolphins' fundraising and efforts towards readmission to the VFL. The Dolphins' creditors agreed to keep the club afloat and, following the production of a sound plan to become financially viable and put in place strong governance structures, I am proud to say we were successful in lobbying for the VFL licence to be reinstated late last year. Next weekend, on Saturday, 7 April, the Dolphins VFL team for 2018 will run out onto the ground.

        As I was saying, next weekend, on Saturday, 7 April, the Dolphins team for 2018 will run out onto the ground for the first home game in what feels like a very, very long time. The story of the local club who faced what at times felt like impossible challenges has inspired a lot of pride amongst the community. A huge crowd is expected, and I will also be there supporting our local footy team.

        Fundraising and sourcing funding has been a big part of this journey. Last week I joined the Dolphins VFL team, both players and management, as well as the member for Frankston and the management of SkyBus, the chartered bus service taking people from Frankston to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tullamarine_Airport" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and vice versa, for their official sponsorship partnership with the Dolphins and the naming of the footy oval as SkyBus Stadium. This is a major step forward for the Dolphins, securing their primary sponsor throughout 2018 and beyond. Then, on Thursday, I joined the Leader of the Opposition in Victoria,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Guy" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and the outstanding Liberal candidate for Frankston,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Lamb" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , to further the investment in our local community. It was announced that the Liberal state opposition would be committing $650,000 to lighting of a broadcast match quality standard for SkyBus Stadium if elected. This wouldn't have happened without the terrific advocacy of the Liberal candidate for Frankston, Michael Lamb.

        The Dolphins story is worthy of a movie blockbuster. We could not have had more of a happy ending, and we hope to see a premiership for the Dolphins soon to add to their trophy cabinet by the end of the season.
