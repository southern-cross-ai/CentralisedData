        I wish to speak today about a true blue Territory organisation that has and deserves the support of this government and the community so that more opportunities are available for the important people in our community who live with disabilities. The

        has many unsung heroes. The people at the Handicapped Persons Association, better known as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPA" rel="nofollow">
         HPA
        </a>
        Inc., I believe are all unsung heroes and set an example to the Australian community. HPA was started in 1963 by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Garner" rel="nofollow">
         Harold Garner
        </a>
        , when he presided over the first meeting of what was then known as the Mentally Handicapped Persons Association. HPA assists 90 to 100 people with intellectual disabilities and mental illnesses through the provision of employment and training options, generates sales revenues in excess of $1Â½ million and receives Commonwealth funding in excess of $900,000.

        The organisation, under the direction of Paul Goggan, has 23 full-time employees and more than 16 casuals. The staff are truly inspirational, and I challenge anyone to work harder and to be more dedicated than they are. I have seen these men and women on several occasions. They love their work and they love having a go. HPA is governed by a board that is committed to the provision of services to people with disabilities in our community. They are Magistrate Daynor Trigg, the President, and

        At one of the HPA business arms, Kokoda Industries in Winnellie, Paul Jolidon overseas a carpentry workshop that manufactures a wide range of timber products, including palettes, survey pegs, lattice and garden edging. Under the direction of

        outdoor furniture, marketing signs, pet beds, bike racks and room dividers, amongst many other products. Ausdesigns is managed by Margaret Marron and is the industrial sewing company that specialises in the design and manufacture of eye-catching handbags, conference satchels, tourist gifts and a host of other fabric products. Damien Davy looks after Kokoda Industries Palmerston, which manufactures a range of steel and timber outdoor furniture.

        , for her dedicated management and for providing accommodation and support services to over 40 people with intellectual disabilities. You will not find a happier, more self-respecting group with a greater sense of community and achievement than these people in the Territory. This really is an exceptional story.
