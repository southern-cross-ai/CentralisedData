        I rise to pay tribute to the life of a remarkable champion of the Greenway community, Graeme Shakespeare, who lost his battle with incurable cancer on Tuesday. He was a long-time resident of the Gateway Lifestyle Village in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanhope_Gardens" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and he was one of the organisers of their annual

        morning tea, which was always extremely well attended by everyone in the local area. Graeme had been recognised in the past by Cancer Council New South Wales as a star volunteer. As reported in the local media, Mr Shakespeare, who had incurable liver cancer, said he did not help out for any reward. He said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is a big honour for me as I do what I can to help those living with cancer.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Cancer Council commented:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Graeme is easily recognised because he is always smiling. He is dedicated to raising awareness of cancer and is a strong advocate of the support programs provided by Cancer Council

        .

        He was a wonderful man and a great friend. One time when I held a Pink Ribbon barbecue my staff noted down that he wanted me to know that he attended a Pink Ribbon event for motorcyclists on that particular weekend, and $90,000 was raised for

        . He was always a regular at the Blacktown Relay for Life. He will be very sadly missed and in typical style Graeme requested that in lieu of flowers a donation be made to the

        and that everyone present at his funeral wear a touch of pink. My sincere condolences to Graeme's family and friends on this very sad news.
