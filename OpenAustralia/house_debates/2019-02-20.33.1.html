         Repatriation General Hospital

        Labor government. The South Australian members of the federal Labor Party, stood by and let it happen. My local community was devastated by Labor's actions. Our veterans were devastated, our community was devastated, and the wonderful, caring repat staff were devastated. No fewer than 119,000 people signed a petition protesting the closure. Despite this, in December 2017, the heartless former state Labor government closed this iconic and important community hospital. The closure of the Repat was a terrible blow to my community, reduced access to health services for residents in southern Adelaide and, in particular, reduced access to vital therapy services for our veterans.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor's decision also disregarded the sentimental value of the Repat site to our veterans and their families, many of whom were cared for at the hospice in their last days or whose funeral services were held in the Heritage Chapel. I am so proud to be part of the Liberal team that is reversing Labor's appalling decision and replacing the services our community say that they want to see on the site. On Sunday 17 February, I stood alongside Premier Steven Marshall to launch the Repat master plan. Together, the state and federal Liberal governments are reactivating the Repat so we can provide vital health services for our community in a safe and loving environment.
