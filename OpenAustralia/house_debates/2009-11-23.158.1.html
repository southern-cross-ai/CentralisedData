       <p>
        I rise to present a petition with the signatories of 512 Australians, urging that 13 August be declared the annual national marriage day. Other members have also presented these petitions, and on 16 September I presented the request of 7,071 Australians asking for this declaration. There will be more.
       </p>
       <p>
        The petitioners see undeniable correlations between family breakdown and other pathways to poverty, educational failure, serious personal debt, crime, welfare dependency and addiction. The Rudd Labor government must clearly uphold the law of Australia that marriage is defined as being between a man and a woman, particularly for the benefit of their children, with no compromises. That is not to deny rights for same sex relationships dealing with issues such as superannuation, but it is to mark a line in the sand and clearly dismiss attempts to redefine marriage by stealth.
       </p>
       <p>
        The commitment from Mr Rudd in 2007 was clear: no schemes would be created that mimic marriage, yet currently,

        legislation provides for legal ceremonies to be conducted by celebrants. Having avoided this issue in his address to the

        on Saturday, the Prime Minister must now take a stand against attacks on the law of this nation that protects marriage.

        I congratulate the organisers of this petition, including the

        Petition to declare the 13th August as National Marriage Day
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We, the undersigned citizens of Australia draw to the attention of the House of Representatives, the undeniable correlations between family breakdown and the other pathways to poverty, educational failure, serious personal debt, crime, welfare dependency and addiction.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In recognition of the positive contribution that intact, stable marriages make to the well-being of children and society we call upon the House of Representatives to demonstrate its support for marriage by declaring the 13th August each year as National Marriage Day.
