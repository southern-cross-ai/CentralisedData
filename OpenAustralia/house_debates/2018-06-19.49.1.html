        My question is to the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services. Will the minister update the House on the importance of creating a tax system that rewards the effort of hardworking and aspirational Australians, including those in my electorate of Brisbane. Is the minister aware of any threats to the government's agenda.

         I thank the member for Brisbane for his question. I only wish that the people in Longman had somebody as hardworking as the member for Brisbane. Let's hope that before too we'll see

          <p>
           That is precisely why this government has put in place a tax system that is designed to help all Australians, whether they be business owners, employees, the young, the old and everyone in between. Under our personal income tax changes, under our tax plan, 94 per cent of taxpayers will pay no more than 32½c in the dollar. Those opposite, unbelievably, would not only stand in the way of that tax cut; they would hit Australians with more than $200 billion worth of new or increased taxes. It's enough for many Australians to think: what is the point? What is the point of expanding their business? The Labor Party will tax it. What is the point of doing an extra day of work, of going for that promotion or doing some overtime? Labor will tax it.

             What is the point of trying to get ahead and build a savings nest egg? Labor will tax that, too. Worst of all, what is the point of trying to be self-sufficient in retirement when Labor will just pocket your tax refunds through their mega retiree tax? It is death by a thousand taxes for the dreams and aspirations of millions of everyday Australians.

               Of course, we all know why. Tellingly, we heard why from the member for Sydney, who reflected the views of those opposite when she said, 'Honestly, this aspiration term; it mystifies me.' They do not know what 'aspiration' means. For the benefit of those opposite, I'll educate them. It means 'wanting to get ahead'.

                 It means having more opportunity for yourself and for your family. Those people opposite want to cut down the aspirations of millions of Australians, and the Leader of the Opposition calls hiking up taxes 'brave'. I call it a smash-and-grab. There is nothing brave about that. There is nothing brave about ripping off older Australians. There is nothing brave about ripping off workers—young Australians who have low-balance superannuation accounts—and there is nothing brave about the Leader of the Opposition.
                </p>
                <p>
                 We know that Australians want lower, simpler and fairer taxes. The Labor Party stands for higher taxes, and the Leader of the Opposition would deliver those.

                  My question is to the Prime Minister. Can this arrogant and out-of-touch Prime Minister confirm that, under his government's tax policies, an investment banker from Woollahra earning a million dollars a year will get a tax cut of over $7,000 a year, and that the bank will get a company tax cut, with $17 billion going to the big banks, but that a shop assistant from Caboolture will only get a tax cut of $10 a week, and that's before they lose up to $77 in penalty rates?

                   I want to thank the honourable member for raising the subject of penalty rates, because he is sitting with a group of Olympic-class champions at getting rid of penalty rates—trading them away one after the other. How many students working on weekends at

So if that's the definition of 'progressive', it is much more progressive than it is today. So the Labor Party has no basis for complaining about the equity of the tax plan.
