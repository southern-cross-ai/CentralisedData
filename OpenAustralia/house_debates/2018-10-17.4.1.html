        On behalf of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Standing Committee
        </a>
        on Health, Aged Care and Sport I present the committee's report on the inquiry into biotoxin related illness in Australia together with the minutes of proceedings.
       </p>
       <p>
        Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).
       </p>
       <p>
        by leave—Mould is a naturally occurring part of the environment and is harmless to most people. For some, mould may cause an allergic reaction that is usually temporary. In rare cases an infection can occur. In addition, some individuals have described experiencing a range of often-debilitating cognitive and physical symptoms which they have linked to being exposed to mould or a water damaged building. This experience has been described as chronic inflammatory response syndrome, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIRS" rel="nofollow">
         CIRS
        </a>
        . This report outlines seven recommendations which pertain to mould, CIRS-like symptoms and unexplained and complex illness more broadly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Firstly, the committee has recommended the Australian government produce and publish information on and conduct further research into dampness and mould in the built environment. Specifically, this research should cover the health impacts, prevalence and effective methods of prevention and remediation of dampness and mould. To ensure quality and consistency of method, the committee has recommended greater regulatory oversight of the mould testing and remediation industries. In addition to helping prevent buildings becoming significantly damp or mouldy in the first instance, the committee has recommended a review of the adequacy of existing building standards and codes. A number of individuals provided personal accounts of living in a rental property with mould or water damage and also experiencing significant health issues. To enable prospective tenants to make an informed decision about their living arrangements, the committee has recommended they be provided with information about disclosure and rectification of any previous or existing mould or water damage in a property before entering into a residential leasing agreement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Throughout this inquiry, the committee heard that people presenting with numerous symptoms that are seemingly unrelated have had difficulty in finding a diagnosis and treatment. Consequently, many of these people spend considerable time, money and effort consulting multiple doctors without success. To help address this issue, the committee has recommended the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Health
        </a>
        conduct a review into the treatment of patients who present with complex illness that is difficult to diagnose. This review should consider issues including how to provide these patients with effective and timely treatment and what further support for medical professionals is needed so they can effectively assist these patients.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee has recommended research be commissioned into CIRS-like symptoms in order to assist in the diagnosis, treatment and management of CIRS and also examine any links CIRS may have with mould and biotoxins. In addition, the committee recommended the development of clinical guidelines for general practitioners for CIRS-like conditions to help ensure a consistent and evidence based approach to the diagnosis and treatment of patients presenting with these symptoms. Developing clinical guidelines in consultation with patient groups, medical practitioners and health bodies will ensure they are effective and targeted.
       </p>
       <p>
        This report has tackled a difficult area of health and public policy. CIRS is not a syndrome broadly recognised by health experts in Australia. Yet the committee heard heartbreaking evidence from individuals who suffer from multiple and often severely debilitating symptoms which they link to mould exposure. Often those symptoms have ruined lives, making employment and normal social interaction near impossible. We owe it to those Australians to do more to ensure their very real health needs are better understood and treated.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank my fellow committee members, particularly the member for Robertson, for their collective work in the preparation of this report. I also extend my thanks to the many experts and patients that gave of their time to provide testimony, often about very personal stories which were hard to talk about in a committee environment. Finally, the committee has been well served, as usual, by the committee staff, who perform their roles with great dedication and professionalism. I commend the report to the House.

        </small>
        <p>
         by leave—I too rise to endorse the seven recommendations of the report into the inquiry into biotoxin related illness in Australia as part of the work of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
          Standing Committee
         </a>
         on Health, Aged Care and Sport. I would really like to thank committee members, the chair and the secretariat for their work on this inquiry and for this report. May I also thank the Minister for Health for his referral of this particular issue to the committee. Throughout the inquiry, the committee received nearly 142 submissions and 39 exhibits, and heard from countless professionals in the medical, construction and mould remediation spaces at our public hearings.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is so much that can actually be said about this report and the recommendations, but, to be honest, it's the stories behind each and every submission that was received that are the real reason this report is being tabled and the reason that the committee has made such strong recommendations. After sharing my story regarding my own experience of biotoxin related illness last year, I was contacted by hundreds of Australians, sharing their own stories. Certainly, that continued even after the announcement of this inquiry. Many people along the way shared with me their doubts and their concerns that an inquiry of this type would not validate their experiences of suffering with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIRS" rel="nofollow">
          CIRS
         </a>
         -like illness. Yet the committee heard story after story of people who are suffering. As the chair has just indicated, some really heartbreaking stories were heard. We also heard of their struggle in being believed and we heard of their challenging road towards a diagnosis. Many people recounted their experience of bouncing from doctor to doctor, with no answers and yet with a debilitating, complex condition. This was really a common theme, and I'm pleased to be able to say that I really believe this report validates those experiences. I think it does let people who are suffering and who are really struggling with this particular condition know that they are being heard and that they are being listened to.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm so pleased about two recommendations in response to the hearing of the committee and the submissions received in particular. Recommendation 5 of the report recommends that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Health
         </a>
         review current processes around treatment and consider guidelines relating to the treatment of complex conditions such as CIRS. Recommendation 7, particularly, goes further, recommending that the Department of Health work with patient groups, health bodies and medical professionals to develop clinical guidelines for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
          GP
         </a>
         s around the diagnosis, treatment and management of conditions such as CIRS-like illnesses. This is a strong recommendation and I'm pleased, because I really do believe that having clear guidelines for treatment will benefit so many who are struggling with this condition.
        </p>
        <p>
         It's certainly my hope that through the work of this inquiry those people who currently are suffering can be assured that not only will they be believed but that there will be a plan for diagnosis and treatment. This is certainly the first step, but one of the things that the report also found was that many professionals in the medical space appearing before the committee agreed that there was a lack of evidence and research. There was also a consensus that there was need for further research. That's why I also endorse recommendation 6, outlining a recommendation that the Australian government commission the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health" rel="nofollow">
          National Health
         </a>
         and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Research_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Medical Research Council
         </a>
         to conduct further research into CIRS and related symptoms, with a view to better inform medical professionals and to support the work outlined in recommendation 7.
        </p>
        <p>
         A number of submissions were made in relation to the challenge of remediation, about water-damaged buildings and a lack of consensus and clarity on a consistent approach to that. That is why I believe that recommendations 2, 3 and 4 go some way towards helping address those issues. I recognise that a lot of these issues are state and territory responsibilities, but this report points to that and particularly looks at further research into the adequacy of building codes and standards related to the prevention and remediation of dampness and mould in buildings.
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, I again place on record my thanks to the Minister for Health for his reference to the committee, and for his ongoing personal support in relation to my own journey, and for his work in the health space. We don't know the exact number of Australians living with CIRS, but I do hope that as a result of the recommendations included in this report we might have a greater understanding of this illness and of those who are suffering so that they can be well.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would encourage and urge the government to consider very carefully these recommendations and support them, particularly those recommendations around developing guidelines for GPs and the need for greater research into this issue. I commend the report to the House.
