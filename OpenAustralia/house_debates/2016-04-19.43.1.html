        When the member for Wentworth toppled the member for Warringah we were told that it would be just like John Lennon's

        We started this parliamentary term with this government giving a billion-dollar tax break to multinationals and we are ending the term with them opposing Labor's sensible multinational tax measures: closing debt deduction loopholes, ramping up penalties on multinationals and giving the tax office the resources it needs to get tough on tax avoiders.
