       <p>
        I rise on this occasion to acknowledge
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Donaldson" rel="nofollow">
         Julie Donaldson
        </a>
        , a local intensive care nurse at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosford_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Gosford Hospital
        </a>
        , who has put away her stethoscope for the last time and retired from her nursing career. Julie's career spans 35 years. She started working in the intensive care unit at Gosford Hospital in 1989 and has an impressive list of achievements under her belt. Anyone who happened to work alongside Julie will know the incredible dedication, commitment, passion, compassion and exceptional care she tirelessly brought to her nursing career.
       </p>
       <p>
        Julie always provided outstanding care and assistance to patients in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICU" rel="nofollow">
         ICU
        </a>
        . Never losing composure, she was unfaltering and confronted any challenge with perseverance and a sense of calmness. Often a source of wisdom and knowledge, Julie would be sought out by doctors and colleagues for advice on all manner of circumstances. A facilitator of further training and education for fellow nurses, she was always looking for ways to strengthen the profession and build up the skills of her colleagues.
       </p>
       <p>
        Julie was responsible for helping to establish the baby basket for those babies who started their lives in the ICU. These baby baskets go a long way towards helping parents of newborns provide the best care possible for their young babies. Julie's charitable endeavours did not stop there. She initiated the 100 club, which aims to support multiple charities on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        and right across Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        A truly selfless public servant, always putting others first and never seeking recognition for all the amazing work that she has undertaken, Julie is the personification of humility and an inspiration to many who have known her and have worked alongside her. She has set the bar high, and I know that our community will miss her dearly in her retirement.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will now read a couple of thank-you messages sent to me from her colleagues at Gosford Hospital. This is from Jodie: 'It was always a pleasure working with you. Your knowledge had no boundsâ€”absolutely endless. We had many a fun night shift. Congratulations on a stellar career, my friend. Now, to enjoy your retirement. So deserved. Congratulations'. And this is from Cath: 'Well, the guru is finally hanging up her stethoscope. Sad day for staff and patients. Julie, I have loved working with you back in my ICU days. So much knowledge and compassion that made you one of best nurses ever. I will always treasure my memories of us working together.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Julie, on behalf of the people of the Central Coast, I want to express my thanks and my gratitude to you for your service as a nurse for the last 35 years. Congratulations on a phenomenal career.
