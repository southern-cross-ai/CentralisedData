        As you'd be well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker Mitchell, for Melburnians the past few days have been very emotional. People have been reconnecting with the things they've been so desperate to be doing and, even more importantly, with the people they love. Let me be clear: I rise here to say they have earned it. The people of Melbourne have been magnificent over the last 18 months. I'm so proud to be a Melburnian and so proud of what Melburnians, and in particular people in the electorate of Scullin, have achieved.
       </p>
       <p>
        I acknowledge the great leadership of our Premier,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Andrews" rel="nofollow">
         Daniel Andrews
        </a>
        , and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Sutton" rel="nofollow">
         Brett Sutton
        </a>
        , who have been consistent in keeping people and communities safe and communicating effectively what they have been doing in the interests of our communities. But it's the people of Melbourne at large whom I want to acknowledge here. There have been so many cynical and opportunistic voices talking us down and, in fact, putting people and communities at risk, but Melburnians have stood strong against them. Frontline workers—healthcare workers, retail workers, cleaners—have done an incredible job. A big shout-out to the teachers, who've done an incredible job of managing learning from home. But our successes are the work of everyone—people who've sacrificed so much to stay safe and to keep all of us safe, with care, selflessness and compassion. I say again: thank you to everyone. There are so many inspiring stories that I could tell. I'm sure you could too, Deputy Speaker, as could my friend the member for Jagajaga, who is in the Chamber. There have been so many acts of generosity and leadership: neighbours checking in on each, the pop-up vaccination clinics, including the ones that are open right now—and I think about the Macedonian community and their cultural centre in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Street" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        —making sure that everyone has the chance to stay protected.
       </p>
       <p>
        One thing that has been clear to me, and concerning to me, is the way in which this pandemic has exposed cracks and weaknesses in our society, and how it has affected some in the community more than others. This is an important question that governments should be addressing right now, and an Albanese Labor government will address it, but there is an example that we can have regard to—that is, the behaviour of the people I'm so proud to represent in this place. The people of Melbourne have recognised that some people have dealt with the pain of restrictions better than others, that some people have been left more isolated than others, and the way in which they have responded has been nothing short of inspirational. I'm so proud of everyone that I represent for all that they have done, and I really hope that everyone can stay safe and enjoy these hard-won freedoms.
