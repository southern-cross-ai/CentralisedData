        I rise today to talk about a wonderful and dynamic part of the Dunkley electorate, Langwarrin. Although Langwarrin covers a geographical area of only 24 square kilometres, almost 22,000 people call it home. Langwarrin is also home to a number of nature reserves, parks and gardens. Some of the more prominent sites are the Langwarrin Flora and Fauna Reserve, the McClelland Gallery and Sculpture Park, and Cruden Farm.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Langwarrin Flora and Fauna Reserve, formerly known as the

         Langwarrin Military Reserve

        , is one of Langwarrin's most well-known landscape features set over two square kilometres. After World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

        , the reserve was used as a military hospital and subsequently for occasional military training until 1974 when it was taken over by the Balcombe military camp and was used for training about
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Reserve" rel="nofollow">

        and school cadet units. As I noted in my maiden speech, my father started his career training in the Army at the Balcombe army barracks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Eventually in 1982, the state government then purchased the reserve from the Commonwealth government but these days it is used by locals and visitors as a recreational nature reserve boasting a number of picturesque walking tracks including an amazing new military trail and walking path which were recently worked on as part of the local

        Another impressive place which calls Langwarrin home is the McClelland Gallery and Sculpture Park. Set in eight hectares of landscaped bushland and featuring a sculpture park, it is now home to the famous moving

The gallery was named in honour of renowned Frankston artists Nan and Harry McClelland. The McClelland Award is Australia's richest sculpture prize and is awarded by the gallery biennially, and it was supported by the gallery's patron and Langwarrin resident, the late

        and resided at Cruden Farm in Langwarrin up until her passing in 2012 at the ripe age of 103. The garden at Cruden Farm is a result of 80 years work and is considered the heart of a working farmâ€”a small piece of country set amid dense suburbia. Every year in mid-April, the gardens are open to the public to raise funds for a not-for-profit medical research organisation,

       <p>
        As you can see, sport plays a big part of the social fabric of Langwarrin. During the election campaign, I was pleased to make a number of funding announcements for several well-deserving Langwarrin sporting clubs. Langwarrin Football and Netball Club is set to receive $10,500 in federal funding to upgrade women's amenities, Langwarrin Tennis Club will receive $10,275 in funding to install solar technologies and the Langwarrin Soccer Club will receive $15,000 under the Stronger Communities Program to construct a much needed utility shed. Langwarrin is also well represented by basketball, dancing and horse riding. Langwarrin Pony Club and the Peninsula Adult Riders Club provide cross-country, dressage and show jumping facilities for equestrian enthusiasts at the Langwarrin Equestrian &amp; Recreation Reserve.
       </p>

        I recently had the pleasure of meeting with Langwarrin resident and Paralympian Emma Booth to congratulate her and her horse Zidane on their terrific success at the recent Rio 2016 Paralympics as part of the Australian dressage team. Langwarrin is a great place to live, and I encourage people to come and visit Langwarrin.
