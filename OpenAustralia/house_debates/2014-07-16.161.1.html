        It is with great sadness that I stand in this parliament today to express my, and I know the parliament's, condolences to the family, friends and comrades of Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey. Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey's service to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Army
        </a>
        included six tours to Afghanistan from 2008 through to this year. These were

       </p>
       <p>
        I have spoken in this place many times now, sadly, about the death of Australian soldiers while on service overseas, and I do not think we should underestimate the work which this man has done. He was from the 2nd
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commando_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
         Commando Regiment
        </a>
        , a special forces unit which does great and special work for us. Unfortunately, the broader Australian community have no real idea—and dare I say most members of this Parliament have no real idea either. I am fortunate to have had an insight into the work of the commandos and other special forces units, as well as all of our men and women in uniform overseas, during the period in which I was a minister in the Defence portfolio in the previous government. I have the utmost respect for these men and women who wear this uniform on our behalf, and particularly these men and women of the special forces who do such difficult, dangerous and often tragic work.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">

        express my condolences—and I know my family's and I am sure the parliament's—to Todd's family: his mum, Kerrie Baker; his dad, Wayne Chidgey; his partner, Karla Hosie; his brothers, Paul and Adam; and his niece, Kayla. Of course, I also express my deep condolences to his comrades in the 2nd Commando Regiment. That regiment, sadly, has had many losses during this war in the Middle East Area of Operations—in this case in Afghanistan over what is now some years.

        We know that Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey is now peaceful and at rest. He was farewelled by his mates during a private memorial service held at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabul_International_Airport" rel="nofollow">
         Kabul International Airport
        </a>
        , and he is now being laid to rest at home on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , attended the funeral representing us and the people of Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Everyone who knew Todd talks about his loyalty. His family have written a wonderful statement about their love for this brave young man. He was a loyal son; he was a loyal brother; he was an absolutely loyal teammate, a professional soldier from 2 Commando Regiment.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know, having observed the reaction of second commando and other units across the defence forces when one of their members is lost, they will continue to swing behind and give support to Lance Corporal Chidgey's family. He was a man who was very highly respected by his colleagues. They described him as:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … a brilliant bloke to know and work with, who was loyal to the core and would do anything for his mates. He was a consummate professional and a dedicated soldier. Lance Corporal Chidgey was one of the hardest working members of the Regiment, who never sought recognition or reward.
       </p>
       <p>
        It may be true he never have sought recognition or reward but it is worth stating what he was awarded because it says a lot about what he dedicated himself to and the service he gave.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lance Corporal Chidgey was awarded:

        I think it is worth reflecting that as we approach the centenary of Anzac, we are now paying homage, giving our respect to and saying goodbye to another man who will join the great pantheon of those who have been lost to us while serving overseas proudly wearing an Australian uniform in the cause of peace and justice and in the knowledge that they are fighting to safeguard our national security.

        Todd, you have now returned to us from active service. We thank you for your service. Rest in peace.

         I share the member for Lingiari's sentiments and I join with him today to express the gratitude of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
          Central Coast
         </a>
         and indeed of our nation to Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey. We express our deep sadness and sorrow at the death of a fine soldier, who died in Afghanistan on 1 July. I take this opportunity to express my deep condolence to Lance Corporal Chidgey's parents, to his brothers and to his partner. All Australians share their grief and our hearts go out to them.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is no greater sacrifice an Australian can make than to give his life in the service of his country. Lance Corporal Chidgey was held in high regard by his unit in Afghanistan and by his mates. His loss will be deeply felt by all who knew him, as a loyal mate and as a talented and professional soldier. His colleagues have described him as a brilliant bloke to know and work with, loyal to the core and someone who would do anything for his mates.
        </p>
        <p>
         Serving as part of the Protective Security Detachment, he was considered a consummate professional and a hardworking, dedicated soldier. Lance Corporal Chidgey deployed on six tours to Afghanistan ranging from two weeks to six months, and he never sought recognition or reward. Yet, since joining the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         in 2006, Lance Corporal Chidgey received a number of honours and awards.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have indeed lost one of our finest. In the words of

         community. May I add that he will also never be forgotten by the people of my electorate of Robertson, by the people the Central Coast, who know and respect the contribution of soldiers past and present.
        </p>
        <p>
         Twenty-nine-year-old Lance Corporal Chidgey was born in Gosford. The funeral took place yesterday on the Central Coast. I understand there were around 450 mourners in attendance, including the Prime Minister,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">

His colleagues in Afghanistan are also in my thoughts. Their contribution to peace and to our national security will forever be remembered. May he rest in peace.

         <p>
          It is with great sadness I join with my colleagues today to pay tribute to the late Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey of the 2nd
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commando_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
           Commando Regiment
          </a>
          , who died in Afghanistan on 1 July this year, just 29 years old. In doing so, I thank him for the service and the sacrifice he has made for Australia in helping to secure our nation and in preserving democracy throughout the world.
         </p>
         <p>
          Lance Corporal Chidgey was born in Gosford,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
           New South Wales
          </a>
          , in 1985. He joined the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Army
          </a>
          in March 2006 under the special forces direct recruiting scheme. On completion of his initial employment training he was posted to the then 4th Battalion Commando, the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
           Royal Australian Regiment
          </a>
          , now the 2nd Commando Regiment, in September 2006. Lance Corporal Chidgey deployed on six tours to Afghanistan ranging from two weeks to six months.
         </p>
         <p>
          Lance Corporal Chidgey's colleagues in the 2nd Commando Regiment have described him as a brilliant bloke to know and work with, who was loyal to the core and would do anything for his mates. A consummate professional and a dedicated soldier, Lance Corporal Chidgey was one of the hardest working members of the regiment who never sought recognition or reward. The commanding officer of the 2nd Commando Regiment, whose identity is protected, spoke of Lance Corporal Chidgey as a dedicated commando and loyal friend to his mates at the regiment. He said:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Todd was the kind of soldier and person who would do anything for his mates.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Todd was a dedicated and committed Commando, who served his country, his unit and the Australian community. We should celebrate his service, his life and his contribution to ensure a better world and keep this in our minds as we mourn his passing.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is the nature of commandos that aspects of their work, their actions and often their identities must not be disclosed. Many times before in this place I have spoken about the special bond that exists within commando regiments. When a soldier joins the commandos, he and his family are commandos for life. The commandos are more like a brotherhood than any other regiment I know, so when one of their fellow commandos dies in action it is like losing a brother. Today I would like to pass on my sympathies to the 2nd Commando Regiment. I know that you have lost a brother and I also know that Lance Corporal Chidgey's family will take comfort from the ongoing support they will receive from you—I know they will continue to provide ongoing support; I have seen it in the past—and the love and respect that you have shown their son.
         </p>
         <p>
          Lance Corporal Chidgey's family have said that they will remember Todd as the consummate gentleman, a son and a brother who was well mannered, who was loyal and always there for his family. They have said he never forgot a birthday and he was extremely generous. If you were his friend, he would stick by you. He was a champion of the underdog. My deepest sympathies and respect go to Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey's mother, his father, his brothers, his partner, his extended family and friends and his fellow commandos. Australia will never forget his sacrifice. May he rest in peace.

           I thank the good member here to my right for allowing me to jump ahead of him on this important condolence motion for a fine Australian soldier, Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey. As

           once said, 'A nation reveals itself not only by the men it produces but also by the men it honours and the men it remembers.' So today I stand here on behalf of the government with a sense of pride and a sense of solemn sadness to pay tribute to and to remember a man who has revealed the very best of us—the very best of our country. We pay tribute to Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey—the 41st Australian to die in Afghanistan in the service of us, the people of Australia. I pass on the government's sincere and heartfelt sympathy and support to his family—his mother, Kerrie, his older brother, Paul, and his younger brother, Adam.
          </p>

           Todd was 29 years old. He was born in Gosford,

            Australian War Memorial
           </a>
           . His name will join the many other names in that place; his name will join a company of heroes—men and women whose lives were shortened because of a call for patriotic duty. His name will forever be enshrined on a bronze panel so that generations will know that brave men stood and fought against tyranny.
          </p>
          <p>
           As people walk beside those bronze panels, it is instructive that we all remember that behind every name is a story of patriotism and bravery, is a story of grief and loss, is a story of communities that have lost their men and their women, is a story of brothers and sisters alone, is a story of families that have lost a part of them. Australia does not forget those who fight and serve; we remember them—not because we glorify war but because we commemorate those who have fought in the pursuit of peace.

           will never forget that they have mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters. They voluntarily leave the safety and comfort of their homes to serve on our behalf, to fight tyranny, to ensure justice and to fulfil a long-held dream of citizens of the world that a promise of safety and security is not abstract but can be tangibly real. I am sure I speak for many in this place, and so many who are within its wider walls outside of our parliamentary colleagues, when I say we are immensely proud of this young digger, Lance Corporal Chidgey. We thank his family for their sacrifice of a son and their sacrifice of a brother. Lance Corporal Chidgey died in the service of his country—be under no doubt of that. With six tours in eight years, that man knew what it meant to serve. He will be remembered as much for being a servant of our nation as a warrior for the cause of peace. We will remember him.

            I rise to contribute to the debate on the Prime Minister's condolence motion on the passing of Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey. Lance Corporal Chidgey was a respected and professional soldier serving his sixth tour of duty in Afghanistan. He served with the 2nd
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commando_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
             Commando Regiment
            </a>
            , based in Holsworthy, in the electorate that I proudly represent here in the federal parliament, as well as with its previous incarnation, 4RAR. The 2nd Commandos are the elite of the elite—a professional team who serve on the front line and beyond; a unit which carries above its weight in combat duties due to their exceptional skill, their professionalism and their courage, for which they are internationally known and respected. The 2nd Commando Regiment has correspondingly suffered a large share of casualties, and with each of those we feel deeply as a family.
           </p>
           <p>
            Lance Corporal Chidgey lived a life dedicated to serving our nation with distinction. Our thoughts go to his family back in Gosford, who have our deepest sympathies for the loss of their beloved son and brother. Corporal Chidgey was deeply respected by his colleagues who described him as 'a brilliant bloke to know and to work with.' He was someone who was loyal to the core, and someone who I think would do anything for his mates. To my mind, he seemed the kind of man who wanted to make the world a better place. His six tours of Afghanistan will have contributed greatly to that goal.
           </p>
           <p>
            When the final last soldier departs Afghanistan we should look back at what we have achieved, and I believe the greatest achievement concerns the education of young girls. We know that in 2001 there were only one million children in Afghanistan in school, and almost none of them were girls. We know today there are over three million young girls receiving an education in Afghanistan. This not only brings benefits to those people individually; that education benefits Afghanistan society. What those kids get from being educated will be passed on for years and years down the track. That is perhaps our greatest achievement—something we all should be proud of, just as we should be proud of the sacrifice of Corporal Todd Chidgey.

             I rise to pay tribute to a man who has served his nation proudly since first enlisting in the Army on 8 March 2006. As the Prime Minister said in the House on Monday, Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey died on 1 July while on his sixth tour of Afghanistan. Lance Corporal Chidgey is Australia's 41st soldier lost in 13 years of involvement in Afghanistan.

             Twenty-nine year old Lance Corporal Chidgey was born in Gosford,

             , in September 2006. Lance Corporal Chidgey deployed on six tours to Afghanistan, ranging from two weeks to six months. During the ceremony, Army Chief Lieutenant General David Morrison said:

            <p class="italic">
             Lance Corporal Chidgey died while in the service of our nation in an operational theatre, and today we are honouring this service as we grieve his passing … Chidgey's mates now mourn his loss alongside his mother, father, brothers and partner. He will be missed but never forgotten by the 2nd Commando Regiment, and wider

            </p>
            <p>
             Chidgey had dedicated his life to serving Australia, and was described by his comrades as a fine Australian soldier who had dedicated his life to serving his country and one of the hardest working members of the regiment. Lance Corporal Chidgey will be remembered as a brilliant bloke to know and work with, who was loyal to the core and would do anything for his mates. Others who knew him will remember him for his professionalism and his strong work ethic and composure under fire. I would like to express my profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. Chidgey's family described him as a true gentleman and champion of the underdog; a man for whom family was everything.
            </p>
            <p>
             Those who risk their lives for our nation deserve a special mention in our history books. Our greatest sympathies must go to those families who lose their loved ones to war. Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey will always be remembered and our thoughts and prayers are with his family and friends. Lest we forget.

              I rise to speak on the condolence motion for Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey, a member of the commandos. He was born in 1985. I had been married for 12 months, for the first time, by 1985. We are talking about a 29-year-old man with his whole life in front of him. His family have lost a son, a brother, a father and a partner, and his mates in the Army have lost a colleague and a mate.
             </p>
             <p>
              I note with great pride that the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition,

              , Lieutenant General David Morrison. I never knew the man but we have covered his career and perceptions of people from around the place. He had completed six tours of Afghanistan ranging from two weeks to anything up to six months, and he was still only 29 years old. We have lost one of our very best soldiers, but we have also lost a great person.
             </p>
             <p>
              I would like to assure his family that his child will be looked after by Legacy. I think it is appropriate at this time that we pause to reflect on the role that Legacy plays in our community, because people coming through today will deflect the importance of Legacy. We have lost our 41st soldier and the role of Legacy in our community will ensure that his child has a great life, remembers and respects his or her dad, and is given every opportunity, because Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey has lost his life in service to Australia. I think we should always remember the role of Legacy.
             </p>
             <p>
              My condolences go to Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey's family. To all who serve: those of us in this place have seen the worst of it but we have also seen and heard the best of it. I have a nephew who has just signed up to join the Army. He is doing it with great pride and he is looking forward to it. I think to serve your nation is a great role. But we have lost one of our best. To Lance Corporal Todd Chidgey: you will not be forgotten. You will always be revered. You will have a place in our hearts forever. And to his family, again, my personal condolences and those of everyone in this House. May he rest in peace. Lest we forget.

               at Kapooka in 2004 and 2005. He knows full well the dedication, the service, the sacrifice—all the attributes that make fine soldiers and which are passed on to those men and women who pass through

               at Kapooka. He knows because he saw it in the eyes of those recruits as they marched out proudly, the sun gleaming on the bright buttons on their wonderful khaki uniforms at those great passing out parades. Certainly, there are no finer people in this nation than those who don a khaki uniform, those who don any military uniform, in the service of our great nation.

               and the 2nd Commando Regiment. He also received a number of honours and awards since joining the Australian Army, such was his dedication, such was his great service.

               At the time of his death—as I said, 29 years young—he was enlisted on his sixth tour of Afghanistan. We should just reflect on that: 29 years young; six tours of that strife-torn, war-torn country. His death in Kabul brings the total number of Australian soldiers who have died in Afghanistan to 41 since 2002: 41 families left to grieve, 41 sets of friends left to grieve, and the Australian Army, a family in itself, mourning the loss of those fine warriors.

               He was a fine Australian soldier, who dedicated his adult life to serving our country. He was regarded for his professionalism, his strong work ethic and his composure under fire. He was farewelled yesterday at a service on the

               , his home district, where his commanding officer described him very appropriately as a dedicated commando and as a loyal friend, the kind of person who would do anything for his mates. 'We should celebrate his service, his life and his contribution to ensure a better world and keep this in our minds as we mourn his passing,' his commanding officer said. Mateship, honour, service, sacrifice—they all embody the spirit of Anzac. They all encompass what those fine recruits from Kapooka do when they pull on the khaki uniform.
