        <p>
         The Minister for Employment has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Australian Government is aware of the report and the challenges being faced in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Melbourne" rel="nofollow">
          North Melbourne
         </a>
         and other regions affected by structural change. Transitioning from heavy industrial manufacturing to higher value added production calls for a national, strategic response rather than a piecemeal response based on hand-outs and subsidies.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In this respect, it should be noted that in 2012 the previous government announced a new subsidy to Holden, which it claimed would 'guarantee' its operations until 2022. This 'guarantee', of course, proved to be illusory. I also note the comments by senior
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors" rel="nofollow">
          General Motors
         </a>
         management that the company would not have continued Holden's manufacturing operations in Australia, regardless of how much Government funding was provided. The same is true of Ford. Toyota, of course, was seriously undermined by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMWU" rel="nofollow">
          AMWU
         </a>
         's court action to prevent its employees from even considering changes to its enterprise agreement that would have enabled the company's Melbourne operations to become more efficient and competitive, without impacting on pay and conditions.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I also note recent media reports on 1 December 2014 on the previous Government's automotive "assistance" policies, which stated that:
