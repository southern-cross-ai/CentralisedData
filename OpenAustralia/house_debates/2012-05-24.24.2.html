        of Australia preserves valuable Commonwealth records as part of archival resources of Australia and makes them available to present and future generations of Australians. The National Archives presently leases a number of facilities across Australia, with the largest record storage facilities being located at Mitchell and Greenway in the Australian Capital Territory,

        in Victoria. A comprehensive strategic planning study undertaken by the National Archives on the existing record storage capacity and capability against projected future requirements confirmed that repositories were operating at close to full capacity. Current estimation is that the National Archives will be full in 2015.
       </p>
       <p>
        A 2010 survey of Commonwealth agencies identified a backlog of 165 shelf-kilometres of archives that will in time be transferred to the National Archives. The National Archives preservation facility and Mitchell refurbishment projects were developed under the two-stage capital works budget approval process. The new National Archives preservation facility and refurbished existing Mitchell facility, together with an internally funded upgrade of the Archive's Sydney facility, will provide gross space until 2031.

        </a>
        will be relinquished. The new facility will enable the National Archives to partly address the 165 shelf-kilometre backlog, provide sufficient storage for growth until 2031, provide greater capacity and capability for a digital repository, and provide improved preservation and conservation work areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subject to parliamentary approval, a multistage procurement process will commence in 2013. The successful developer will commence work on construction of the new facility and the integrated fit-out in 2015, with occupancy planned for mid-2016. Also, subject to parliamentary approval, work will commence on the existing Mitchell facility refurbishment in 2017 and be completed in 2019.

       </p>
       <p>
        Security at defence sites remains a high priority for the government and for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Defence
        </a>
        . Defence continues to review and improve its protective security arrangements to ensure that its most valuable asset, people, remain safe and able to conduct their important role. The $205.52 million base infrastructure works project is part of the wider defence base security improvement program. It proposes to deliver a range of infrastructure enhancements to 16 sites. This project is part of Defence's response to the government's 2009 review of defence protective security arrangements. These enhancements have been designed specifically to reduce the risk to defence personnel from the possibility of a terrorist attack.
       </p>
       <p>
        Protective measures include the provision of alert and surveillance systems, electronic access control and detection systems, improved command monitoring and management facilities, and enhanced entrance and reception facilities. The infrastructure solution delivered by this project has been developed in conjunction with a range of other protective security improvements which are being implemented across the entire defence estate in Australia. These include legislative changes, policy and procedural improvements, the introduction of armed response capabilities at some sites and other minor infrastructure works.
       </p>
       <p>
        Defence is working closely with local planning authorities as well as the relevant roads and traffic authorities to ensure that any disruptions during construction are minimised. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is scheduled to begin in late 2012 and is planned to be completed by mid-2015.
