       <p>
        As I stated in my inaugural address only two days ago, as the local member of parliament, a mother of two and a qualified speech pathologist, I maintain a keen interest in education, particularly in the local schools. I also stated that it was no accident that my first official engagement as the local member was to visit Ashwood High School. Thank you to Bardia Zarrinnam and Lula Tadeffe for showing me around the school. Ashwood High is a great school. It received a $15.5 million investment from the previous state Liberal government to rebuild the school. But, like with many schools in Chisholm, I'm sure that there is always more that can be done.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many schools just need that little extra to assist with playground and sporting equipment, procurement of musical facilities, furniture, computer equipment or library resources. Some schools may need small-scale extensions or refurbishments, while others may need funds for their master planning. I encourage all schools in Chisholm to apply for funding through the Australian government's Local Schools Community Fund website. The fund is open to eligible government, Catholic and independent schools—not just the 57 schools but all 63 campuses—and schools in my electorate can apply for one project between $1,000 and $20,000. Applications open today and close at 5 pm on 30 September 2019. Projects will need to be completed by 31 December 2020. Applications can be submitted online through SchoolsHUB at schools.education.gov.au.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the member for Chisholm I promise to be a strong voice for Chisholm, and that includes for all schools in Chisholm. I note that funding for all 34 public schools in Chisholm will increase by around 55 per cent per student over the next decade. As such, I'm proud to be part of a government that prioritises education, as this government seeks to ensure projects can be covered for all schools regardless of size.
