        Many members in this place would have fond memories of story time as a child or of studying hard for exams in the quiet and peaceful environment of their local library. Many members may in fact still take themselves and their families to the local library for research, social activities or simply to track down a book they have been meaning to read for a while. I can clearly attest to the large number of residents in my electorate who enjoy the spoils of the

        and Miller libraries. I know this because many of those residents who enjoy using those libraries have overwhelmingly voiced their outrage at a plan by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Liverpool City Council
        </a>
        to close those two important facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The council is looking to close the Green Valley and Miller library branches in my electorate, as well as libraries at Moorebank and Casula, as a means of reducing council running costs. I am sure this House can appreciate that this plan was certainly not welcomed by local residents. The local papers have been inundated with letters to the editor and online comments calling on the councillors—that is, the Independent and Liberal councillors—to reverse their decision.
       </p>
       <p>
        The residents are furious over the lack of public consultation before the decision was made, as well as the prospect of having to travel further to reach the nearest library in areas where public transport is not adequately provided. I wish to share some of the comments that residents have been making. Kylie Clark wrote:

        I am in walking distance to Green Valley library and I have taken my children there since they were little. Every Friday they have their share story time which the kids love. The kids gets so excited to go to the library which has helped develop their love for books …
       </p>
       <p>
        Another mother echoed those sentiments by saying:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Any time of the day there are people there and in the afternoons it is full of local school kids. The study rooms are well utilised and the staff are friendly and helpful. I don’t think that Liverpool will have the same atmosphere and it would forever change—
       </p>
       <p>
        if they closed the library. And finally, a male perspective to the debate from Alex Boromisa:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Liberal and Independent councillors used their majority of votes to pass a motion which takes away libraries from the most disadvantaged communities in South Western Sydney. They have even declined to consult with those communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The majority of Liverpool councillors have decided not to listen to what their community wants. They have decided to put the bottom line ahead of what is in the best interest of local residents, and I find that somewhat disturbing. Accordingly, I have moved a notice of motion that was seconded by my colleague, the member for Werriwa, which calls on this House to note the importance of public libraries in communities across Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The motion calls on the House to recognise that libraries provide access to information technology, research and educational resources, and recreational materials for many people who otherwise could not afford them. The motion also congratulates public library staff for their commitment to lifelong learning in the community and notes that public library collections help address disadvantage by ensuring free and equitable access to collections for all community members. Importantly, the motion also calls on this House to express concern over the actions instigated by the Liverpool City Council to close the Green Valley, Miller, Moorebank and Casula public libraries.
       </p>
       <p>
        The needs of the local community should be a real consideration for these councillors. I urge them to show some common sense in this matter. If, for nothing else, the retention of local libraries engenders a love of books and a love of lifelong learning, I would have thought that would be something significant that a local council could contribute to. If they did that they would assist in the development and success of the youth in their area. I know about the issues of the bottom line and the costs associated with running such facilities, but I think the costs of not doing that in a modern community would far outweigh the benefits they see in closing those libraries.
