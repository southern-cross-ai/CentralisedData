        My question is to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister promised on 100 occasions to the Australian people before the election that he would cut power prices by $275. He's never mentioned that figure since. At the moment 500 families a week are going onto energy hardship arrangements because they can't pay their bills—a nearly 60 per cent increase on Labor's watch. Will the Prime Minister apologise to these struggling families?

         I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. Of course, he was a part of a government that had 22 policies but didn't land one. Four gigawatts out; one gigawatt in. Indeed, he might want to talk to his deputy, who said that the current energy crisis is not one that has been created 'since they arrived in power'. That's what she had to say. Others, of course, have commented similarly about the reality which is the mess that they left for us. They left Australia with a national energy grid built for the last century. They changed the law, as we heard earlier today, to hide the energy price hike before the election. They actually hid the energy price hike. They concealed, from the public and the energy market, construction delays and the hefty cost blowouts on the

         2.0 project. In 2019, they promised to reduce the wholesale electricity price to less than $70 per megawatt hour by the end of 2021. Instead, it was $286—

          The Prime Minister will pause. Leader of the Opposition, continually yelling at me has never happened before from the role of the Leader of the Opposition. It's got to stop. If the Leader of the Opposition wishes to take a point of order, he shall always receive the call. That is the appropriate way, rather than simply yelling at me.

          <p>
           The point of order is relevance. The Prime Minister was asked a very tight question. There are families who just can't work out how they will pay their bills under this government at the moment, and we get this glib response from the Prime Minister. I ask whether it's your ruling that the Prime Minister is relevant to the question that he's been asked.

           <p>
            The point of order was raised on relevance. The Prime Minister at this stage is being relevant, but I'm going to make sure, given that he's provided context around the question and is halfway through—whilst he's setting the scene for why this situation is, the question was: will he apologise to Australian families? That's the question. That's the question that he's answering. I'm just going to ask him to be relevant for the remainder of his answer. The Leader of the Opposition on a point of order.

                   I've answered that, and I've also asked the Prime Minister—given he is answering the question about whether he will apologise to Australian families, which I appreciate that members perhaps would like a yes/no answer to. But, under the standing orders, I don't have the power to compel a minister or prime minister to answer the question. I'm just going to ensure, for the remainder of the answer, that the Prime Minister is directly relevant to the question. The Prime Minister has the call.

                    I understand the embarrassment of the Leader of the Opposition, because he asked a question about energy prices, and they voted against energy price relief. They voted against it.

                    , as well. Every premier and chief minister supported the energy price relief plan. Those opposite voted for higher prices, and now they think the solution is the most expensive form of new energy.

                    The Leader of the Opposition said that there were just four little outstanding issues with regard to announcing the detail of nuclear: safety, disposal cost and location. Apart from that, it's all fixed. But the shadow minister's come up with some other beauties as well. His three issues are technical feasibility, financial feasibility and community acceptability. Apart from that, it's all sweet. He can't find a single member who wants one of these nuclear reactors in their—
