        by leave—I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the following from occurring:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) Government business having precedence from 7.30 pm to 9.30 pm on Wednesday, 21 October, or until the conclusion of the second reading debate, with the exception both of a Minister summing up the debate and the question on the second reading being put, on the Customs Amendment (China-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Bill 2015 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (China-Australia Free Trade Agreement Implementation) Bill 2015, if earlier, at which time the House shall stand adjourned until 9 am on Thursday, 22 October;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) during the period from 7.30 pm to 9.30 pm any division on a question called for in the House, other than on a motion moved by a Minister during this period standing deferred until after Prayers on Thursday morning; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) any variation to this arrangement to be made only by a motion moved by a Minister.
       </p>
       <p>
        The effect of this motion is that the House will sit from 7.30 to 9.30. The adjournment will be negatived between 7.30 and 8.00. So, the House will continue to sit as though there had been no interruption. The agreement we have reached with the opposition is that until 9.30 but between 7.30 and 9.30 no divisions or quorums will be called. My understanding from the clerk responsible for these matters is that there is about 9¾ hours of debate on the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement. This will take us almost to the end of that debate by about 9.30 tonight, especially if colleagues are generous and reduce their time to 10 minutes rather than 15 so that everyone who wants to gets a go, and so far that seems to be what is happening. Then tomorrow morning we will have potentially about an hour or three quarters of an hour or maybe a little bit more of finishing off with those speakers who did not get a chance tonight, who went home after 9.30. And then the minister will sum up and the bill will be passed.
       </p>
       <p>
        That means that if members were planning on going out they can do so knowing that they will not miss a division. But if they are listed to speak on the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement then obviously they should stay until their chance to speak. I thank the House for its cooperation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Question agreed to.
