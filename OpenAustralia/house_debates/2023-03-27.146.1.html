        Anzac Day is nearly upon us, and more and more Australians are turning out to support Anzac Day. Across my electorate alone, 27 ceremonies will be conducted. A back-of-the-envelope calculation is that, for me to be able to attend each of those dawn services, I would have to serve nine consecutive terms in this House. When we notify each of the people in my electorate about the upcoming ceremonies, we send out a post pack. We like to celebrate one of the local heroes that made a contribution which, as a nation, we honour.

        This year, we'll be celebrating Lance Corporal Bernard Sidney Gordon. Gordon was one of the local recipients of the

        award, one of the highest honours that can be bestowed on a soldier. He was presented the award by the late Queen Elizabeth

        during her Australian tour in 1954. Bernard, otherwise known as Barney, enlisted in the Australian army in 1915 whilst living in Townsville; however, when he returned, he returned to Beaudesert. Gordon was awarded the

        in August 1918 for single-handedly attacking the crew of a machine gun post. He was then awarded the

        later that month for bravery and devotion.

       <p>
        On 26 August 1918, in east Bray, France, Gordon and his unit were faced with a decision: to be captured or to capture. Gordon led his unit through an intense fight to take out machine guns which were shooting at the company, and then they captured and returned with several prisoners. Unaided, Gordon and his men then attacked the enemy lines again, capturing the post, disabling machine guns and bringing in yet more prisoners. Gordon's leadership and courage were the perfect example of the bravery required for the VC recipiency. Gordon was wounded on 1 September while the battalion was advancing in the

        area. He returned to Australia in late 1919 and was discharged in April. He then took up residence at a dairy farm near Beaudesert. He ran his dairy farm for 43 years before moving to

        in 1962 due to poor health. His daughter Caroline Gee continues their farming legacy today in the district.
       </p>
       <p>
        He passed away on 19 October 1963. Barney Gordon's living memory lives on with his children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, the Gee family, whose names are synonymous with rugby league in our community. Barney Gordon is just one of the many Australian soldiers who should be recognised and remembered on Anzac Day this year and in many years to come. I encourage all to visit our local ceremonies to pay respect to those who fought for our nation. Lest we forget.
