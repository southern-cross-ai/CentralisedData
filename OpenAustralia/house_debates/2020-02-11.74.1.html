        My question is to the Prime Minister. The proponents of the Collinsville coal power plant have said it will require a taxpayer indemnity from carbon risk, which the

         Australian Industry Group
        </a>
        says could cost taxpayers $17 billion. Will the Prime Minister provide that indemnity?

         . Right across the country, we believe in jobs and we believe in ensuring that manufacturing continues to be able to get access to the reliable power it needs to ensure that it can support jobs and livelihoods into the future. So, before the last election, our government committed to undertake to look at what the reliable power generation options were to support heavy industry in North Queensland. That review then led to the series of options that were put before the government, for which the government has agreed to support undertaking feasibility studies to assess those options and how they can support jobs in North Queensland.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are technology agnostic when it comes to ensuring we have reliable power generation in this country. We want to ensure that electricity prices come down, not go up. We want to ensure the lights stay on, not go off. We want to ensure that industries, whether they be in North Queensland or anywhere else, that provide the livelihoods for Australians continue to be maintained. We will assess the options that support those jobs. The simple question I have for those opposite—

           On direct relevance. The question goes specifically to the indemnity and the taxpayer funded indemnity. It is in two parts. Both only go to that point, and that's the one point the Prime Minister hasn't touched.

            I do have to say that I agree with that, and the Prime Minister's had more than a preamble. The question was very specific indeed and, whilst the Prime Minister is entitled to talk generally at the start of his answer, he needs to either come to that question—but he certainly can't have a question for the opposition.

                  Sorry? I've actually got a copy of the question because we take notes. It was a very specific question. The Prime Minister's entitled to have a preamble. He's gone well beyond the normal preamble. He needs to address himself to the specific part of the question or wind his answer up.

                   What I was seeking to do was to say that the feasibility study of the Collinsville project is what the government has committed to undertake. The matter that the member has raised with me, in this question, is not currently before the government. It's not currently before the government. It's not before us.
