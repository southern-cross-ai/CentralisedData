        I'm very happy to report that the mood at the field day was indeed very positive. We Western Australians—as you know, Deputy Speaker—are a resilient mob and, despite the difficult season we've been experiencing in many parts of the wheat belt, we certainly experienced a very positive, up-beat crowd. The strong showing by the Liberal Party was welcomed, and I spent much of the two days standing in the same spot talking to constituents—which I know you would appreciate, Deputy Speaker—and my sore feet were definitely testament to that.
       </p>

        Congratulations to the organisers. Well done once again for a fabulous two days. All of us enjoyed experiencing the thrill of Western Australia's agricultural industry, and I look forward to returning next year, which will be my fifth Dowerin field day in a row.
