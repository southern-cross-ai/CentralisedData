        I rise to express my congratulations to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Brooks High School
        </a>
        Pentagliders from Launceston, who won the world championship title in the Fl for schools program in Malaysia last night. This week in the House I have already given two updates on their progress, and I was most proud this morning to hear of their fantastic success on the world stage.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Fl in Schools Program is a science, technology, engineering and maths based education competition implemented in high schools around the world. Over 35,000 Australian students take part each year. This year, a team made up of current and former students from my local high school in the electorate of Bass—Brooks High School, a working-class area in the northern suburbs of Launceston—has continued Australia's tradition of achievement in this program.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am also pleased to announce here in the House today that they also took out the fastest car and best engineering awards. These young people should be very proud of their achievements. I understand the kids have been presented with their trophies and scholarships to London City University. Amy, Tristan, Jack and Nathan: well done. We are extremely proud of you. To their teacher, Murat: it has been a long hard road to the top, but you have done an excellent job. You have made Tasmania—indeed, Australia—proud.
