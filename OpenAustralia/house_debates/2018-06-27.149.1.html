        , Peter was instrumental in developing the concept of both the National Anzac Centre and the 2014 Albany Centenary of Anzac commemorations.
       </p>
       <p>
        I first met Peter in 2011, when he was chair of the Albany Centenary of Anzac Alliance. Geoff, Laurie and Peter shared a vision to re-enact the first convoy of Australian and

        troops departing for Egypt to train for the campaign at Gallipoli. Their incredible vision came to fruition on 1 November 2014 with a nationally recognised event commemorating the departure of more than 41 warships carrying over 30,000 troops and 8,000 horses. Six warships and a submarine were involved in the re-enactment, with over 40,000 spectators from all over Australia attending the four days of commemorations.
       </p>
       <p>
        These commemorations included a massive all-schools and armed forces march and ceremony at the Anzac Peace Park, addressed by Governor-General Sir Peter Cosgrove; a moving dawn service; a beach concert overlooking 30,000 poppies in the sand at

        ; and the opening of the National Anzac Centre by then Prime Minister Tony Abbott and then New Zealand Prime Minister John Key.
       </p>
       <p>
        The National Anzac Centre is an amazing legacy of Peter's hard work. It takes visitors on an emotional interactive journey, assuming the identity of one of 32 actual service men and women on their journey from Australia to the battlefields of World War I and their ultimate fate. In its first year of operation, more than 90,000 locals and tourists took this poignant journey into Australia's Anzac heritage, and the National Anzac Centre will remain one of Albany's most visited attractions for many generations to come.

        It was my privilege to be asked by another legendary WA veteran,

        </a>
        , former member for Cowan, in his capacity as the then president of RSL WA to be co-sponsor and referee in support of Peter's nomination for this honour. It gives me great pleasure to close by thanking Peter for his incredible contribution to veterans and our nation's heritage and to congratulate him on being awarded this well-deserved Order of Australia medal.
