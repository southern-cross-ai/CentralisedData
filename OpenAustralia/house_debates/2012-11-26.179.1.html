       <p>
        This is one of my last opportunities this year to share some positive news about the electorate of Forde. First of all, I am very proud to announce that the Beenleigh
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCYC" rel="nofollow">
         PCYC
        </a>
        has taken out the best branch of the year for 2012 for the third year running. This is a major accomplishment for the Beenleigh PCYC considering there has been a staff restructure and major renovations occurring in the branch. Their
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Tribes" rel="nofollow">
         Two Tribes
        </a>
        program was also victorious in the award of excellence category. This program has grown over the past 12 months with 36 young foreign nationals having now taken part in learning how to build self-esteem and self-belief. I thank the branch manager Mark Haestier, and assistant manager Matt Massouras, as well as Miss Wendy Captain from the Beenleigh State High School, and Evangeline and Eddi Goodfellow, for making the Two Tribes program the success that it is today.
       </p>
       <p>
        I very much value the contribution the PCYC makes to our community, and we look forward to that contribution continuing for many years to come. They continue to go above and beyond by reaching out to young people and helping them to get the most out of life. They deliver a number of crime prevention and youth welfare programs. In fact they deliver more than most of the PCYCs in Queensland. They deliver programs to help with youth employment, leadership programs, programs for Indigenous children, programs for women who have experienced domestic violence, youth homelessness, people with disabilities and life skills programs like cooking and child protection. More recently they commenced the Block Program, which provides young people with strategies to deal with bullies who tease them, intimidate them and harass them. The members of our community would be lost without their ongoing support and dedication.
       </p>

        In other great news in the community another of our organisations, the Beenleigh Tennis Club, recently was awarded the highest honour in the state of being named the most outstanding club at the 2012 Queensland Tennis Awards. My congratulations go to the coaching staff, Ian and James Rapkins, Alison Scott,

        Finally, I congratulate Park Ridge State High School and Loganlea State High School for cleaning up at the recent South East Regional School Based Traineeship and Apprenticeship Awards. It was great to be there to see our local youth take home four of the six major awards, as well as eight of the 13 individual industry awards. Well done to Nellie Fitzpatrick from

        for taking out school based trainee of the year and the business services award. Congratulations also to fellow Park Ridge High School students Tony Norio, Danica Clancy and Loganlea high school's Dudley Monaghan for winning industry awards.
