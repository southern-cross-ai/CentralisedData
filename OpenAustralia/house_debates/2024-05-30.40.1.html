        On many an occasion I have taken the opportunity to stand up in this place in support of our veteran community, not only the 6,000-strong community in my electorate of Spence but the over-half-a-million veterans nationwide, some of whom are in the chamber presently. They, like me, would be aware that when the Albanese Labor government was elected the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Veterans'_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Veterans' Affairs
        </a>
        had around 42,000 claims languishing in its backlog, and that number only counts the claims that hadn't even been picked up by someone at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVA" rel="nofollow">
         DVA
        </a>
        to get the ball rolling. The Albanese Labor government takes seriously its duty to those Australians who have put on the uniform and served our country. I know this to be true, not just by its words but by its actions too.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the week since the Treasurer handed down our third budget, we have heard those opposite complain about reckless spending and the size of the Public Service. However, those opposite seem to have been rather quiet when it comes to discussing the additional $6.5 billion expected to be paid out in military compensation payments. What they see as a cost blowout, we see as a result of our government reducing the DVA claims backlog down to zero, a feat only possible through DVA receiving staffing and resourcing levels it hasn't seen in the past 30 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Supporting our veterans isn't a part-time activity reserved for special occasions. I'm proud to be part of a government that always had our veterans' backs, and to them I say: thank you for your service.
