       <p>
        The new federal boundaries of Gilmore have been confirmed. I have made it my business to acquaint myself with the new areas of Gilmore and the people living there. I am grateful to my colleague the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Minister_of_State" rel="nofollow">
         Special Minister of State
        </a>
        and the member for Eden-Monaro,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Nairn" rel="nofollow">
         Gary Nairn
        </a>
        , who has assisted me in the familiarisation process as I gradually move about. Over the last few weeks I have opened an outreach office in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batemans_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Batemans Bay
        </a>
        which is located in the Stockland Shopping Centre and will be manned by both staff and volunteers. Because the electorate is so geographically elongated I thought it only fair to constituents to provide an accessible service rather than to expect them to travel to Nowra for an appointment. In addition I have instituted a series of regular village stops, an extension of a practice I have followed since becoming the member for Gilmore. Recently I was given a visual tour and a briefing by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eurobodalla_Shire_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Eurobodalla Shire Council
        </a>
        on issues affecting the community, giving me a better appreciation of matters affecting residents in the new areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Batemans Bay region is not only very picturesque but very vibrant. I know that many residents of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        visit regularly on holidays and day trips. The local economy depends significantly on the tourism dollar, so in that respect that part of the electorate has similarities with the Shoalhaven and Kiama regions. Recently I was made aware of some service problems with the Batemans Bay Hospital and, in that context, I will be working cooperatively with the state member for Bega,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Constance" rel="nofollow">
         Andrew Constance
        </a>
        , to see whether we can get a better deal for the community. In fact I have set up a meeting with local doctors to discuss that very issue.
       </p>
       <p>
        Batemans Bay has also seen the establishment of a marine park by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        government and that has created some angst in the community. The approach by the New South Wales government in establishing the park has raised some questions reminiscent of a previous pattern that I have witnessed in other coastal areas of the Gilmore electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        My predecessor has achieved much during his term as member, and I am hopeful of building on that record. This will take a lot of effort by many people, and I am hopeful that in the months ahead I will be given ample opportunity to meet with local community groups and to listen to their hopes and plans. So far I have been made very welcome. As we get to know each other there will be opportunities identified where I can assist the community to obtain funding. For instance, this week I distributed a survey to gauge the feeling in the community over the prospect of expanding the campus of the University of Wollongong in Batemans Bay. Of course, the announcement in the budget last night of further funding for universities bodes very well for the Batemans Bay complex.
       </p>
       <p>
        With regular feedback of this kind, the aspirations of the community can be identified and energy focused on getting the best outcomes through a cooperative approach. I look forward to being elected again as the member for Gilmore and hope that between now and then I can show the people of Batemans Bay my sincerity in representing their views to government and being part of their community.
