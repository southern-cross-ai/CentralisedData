       <p>
        Once again I am forced to point out the government’s negligence when it comes to looking after infrastructure in my electorate. Recently the government announced the commencement of the construction of the new
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hume_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Hume Highway
        </a>
        on- and off-ramps at Ingleburn. Businesses and residents have been fighting for these access points to be constructed for some many years, and news of their construction was very much welcomed. The joy, however, was short lived, as businesses in the industrial estates of Ingleburn and Minto are now forced to reach into their own pockets to pay for part of the construction costs because the government has refused to come to the party.
       </p>
       <p>
        The ramps will cost a total of $13.8 million, and the federal government has decided that it will meet only two-thirds of the cost. Through some twisted logic, the federal government has decided that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbelltown_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Campbelltown City Council
        </a>
        should meet the remaining cost of some $4.5 million. The federal government has held a gun to the head of the Campbelltown City Council by forcing the council to meet part of the costs for this critical piece of infrastructure; otherwise, it would not be built. The council have decided that local businesses will be charged a special levy in order to meet the costs. I am not criticising the decision of council in this regard. Their hands were forced in this matter by a complete lack of interest by this government in providing and improving transport infrastructure in the south-west of Sydney.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is unfortunate that local businesses are now going to have to wear part of the costs. Naturally, they are upset about the additional cost of a special levy, which for some will be up to $30,000, and the effect it will have on their businesses. The levy translates roughly to a 16 per cent increase in the rates for all businesses in the industrial estate. The ramps are an important part of the development of the infrastructure in the electorate which will allow it to grow and thrive. There are direct employment and economic benefits that will flow from the construction of these ramps. The construction of these ramps will also assist in easing local traffic congestion. It will also help get some trucks off the suburban streets, improving the safety of all residents of Campbelltown.
       </p>
       <p>
        For these ramps, the federal government has decided to overturn the long held protocol that infrastructure around federal highways is funded by the federal government. Local businesses are now paying the price for this decision. The businesses that face the levy have every right to be angry about paying it but they should direct their anger in the right way—at the Howard government, a government that continues to ignore the needs of local residents. I call on the government to overturn this decision and fund in full the Hume Highway access ramps at Ingleburn.
