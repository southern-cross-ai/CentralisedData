        I rise to support Australian ginger growers, many of whom are in my electorate, who are concerned about the long delays in implementing a statutory levy for research and development in the ginger industry. I have been informed by Mr Gant Davison, President of the Australian Ginger Growers Association, that the latest advice from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Agriculture" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Agriculture
        </a>
        , Fisheries and Forestry is that it may not be able to implement the levy even by the delayed commencement date of 1 April 2011. There is overwhelming support for this levy among ginger growers, heightened by the urgent need for research into combating the disease
        <i>
         Pythium myriotylum
        </i>
        . This disease is responsible for severe rhizome rot and was first identified by ginger growers in the 2007-08 growing season, with some producers reporting total losses in some blocks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ginger growing is a small but very important industry in Queensland, with approximately 50 per cent of processed ginger being exported. Ginger growers have been going through the process of instituting a statutory levy for research and development for their industry and are appalled by the delay being experienced with government departments. The levy was voted on by ginger growers according to all the guidelines outlined in this parliament and received 88.2 per cent support. This levy is needed to fund research and development for the industry and attracts a government matching contribution.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will briefly summarise the history. Late in 2009 the framework was set to have the statutory levy voted upon by all ginger growers. In January 2010 it was put to a vote and overwhelmingly supported. On 23 February this year the levy proposal was lodged with the department. The department raised a number of questions, which were promptly answered. Industry was advised that all the issues had been addressed and that the matter would be progressed. Everyone expected an implementation date of 1 October this year. That date has passed. The industry has now been advised that the next nominated date, 1 January 2011, will be impossible, and now an April date is also being placed in question. No assurances are available as to when this will start.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is simply not good enough. We know that the government does not have a high regard for the importance of rural research. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Finance_and_Deregulation" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Finance and Deregulation
        </a>
        has been trying to cut expenditure on rural research for a long time, but it is time for the government to act. This research is vital for the industry. The delays are simply unacceptable. The parliamentary secretary needs to take urgent action to make sure that these administrative arrangements are dealt with promptly.
