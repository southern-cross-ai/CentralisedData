           I thank the member for Forrest for her question. I can assure her that, every day, this government's focus is clear: it is on jobs, growth and community safety. Every day, we are implementing our plan for a strong and prosperous economy and a safe and secure Australia. I can assure the member for Forrest that this government has already cut the overall tax burden that Australians face by some $6 billion. We have abolished the carbon tax, saving the average household $550 a year. We have abolished the mining tax, which means that Australia is once more a good place to invest. We have supported small business with the best budget ever for small business, with a tax cut just for small business, with the instant asset write-off just for small business. We have delivered free trade agreements with our three biggest trading partners. We are rolling out the biggest infrastructure program in the history of the Commonwealth. And we are cutting red tape by some $2 billion every year. I can inform the member for Forrest that our plan is working, the economy is strengthening. In the March quarter, the Australian economy's growth was almost the fastest in the developed world.

             In the March quarter, housing construction was up by 4.7 per cent and that is the best result in six years. In the March quarter, exports were up by five per cent and that is the best result in 15 years. Service exports were up by eight per cent and that is the best result in eight years. Over the last 12 months, retail sales are up by 4.9 per cent. In July, car sales set a new record. So our economy is strengthening where it matters most when it comes to jobs. There are now more than 335,000 extra jobs in our economy than where things were in September 2013. That is 335,000 more people in work now than at election time. The participation rate is up because people are more confident. Female participation is at the highest level on record.

             job ads are 9.3 per cent higher now than a year ago and have risen in 10 of the last of 12 months. And the cost of living is down for so many families not just because of the abolition of the carbon tax but because interest rate cuts mean a family with an average mortgage is $1,500 a year better off. This government has a plan. The plan is working. We are delivering for the good people of our country.
