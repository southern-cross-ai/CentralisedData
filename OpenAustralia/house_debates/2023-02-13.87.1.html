         (â€”) (): I want to thank the member for Pearce for her great question. Earlier this month, I went to the remote

          Western Australia
         </a>
         n town of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzroy_Crossing" rel="nofollow">
          Fitzroy Crossing
         </a>
         , accompanied by the member for Durack, to meet with members of the local community recovering from the devastating floods caused by Ex-Tropical Cyclone Ellie. The damage that has been done to crucial infrastructure and homes in the region is very significant. The floods devastated families, disrupted businesses and supply chains and has sorely tested community resilience. We have all seen those terrible images of a very broken bridge that once crossed
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzroy_River" rel="nofollow">
          Fitzroy River
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Importantly, this government acted very quickly through the Minister for Transport,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_King" rel="nofollow">
          Catherine King
         </a>
         , to change heavy vehicle access for road trains to ensure the freight of food and essential supplies kept moving to north Western Australia. I want to acknowledge and thank Senator Glenn Sterle; there is no greater advocate, in this whole building of advocacy, for trucks and truckies and the freight industry as a whole. What we do know is that essential supplies to Fitzroy Crossing and the Kimberley require a detour of 7,400 kilometres. It's an extraordinary detour, and that's why it's important we make sure the road trains are as big as they safely can be and carry as much as they can, delivered by Aussie truckies.
        </p>
        <p>
         This government continues to work closely with the WA government to support the ongoing recovery. I want to acknowledge the Minister for Emergency Management, Senator Watt, and his team for all they are doing to help those in Fitzroy Crossing and other affected areas like Derby and Broome.
        </p>
        <p>
         Commonwealth support is available for those in natural disaster impacted communities through the $1,000 Australian government disaster recovery payment and income subsidies through the disaster recovery allowance. National Emergency Management Agency officers have been deployed to Western Australia to work with the WA Department of Fire and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Services" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         and with the local council in Derby-West Kimberley. Further,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEMA" rel="nofollow">
          NEMA
         </a>
         personnel have been on the ground in Fitzroy Crossing, assessing the damage with the local communities and also with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFES" rel="nofollow">
          DFES
         </a>
         and WA Main Roads.
        </p>
        <p>
         NEMA is working very closely with the National Indigenous Australians Agency to identify recovery needs at the community level. We know that traditional owners need to be part of the conversation on how we support those communities to recover and rebuild with resilience in ways that are culturally appropriate and of course needs based. Services Australia have deployed extra staff to that remote region as well, and they have served admirably as they had to relocate to a new office when their office was significantly damaged. I want to thank the local services manager, Zara, who the member for Durack and I visited, and her whole team for all of the work they are doing with the community to ensure people are well supported through this disaster.
