       <p>
        Last week's brutal killing of Hannah, Aaliyah, Laianah and Trey has devastated our south-side community. I want to give my condolences—and, I am sure, on behalf of the House—to Lloyd, to Sue, to Nathaniel and to their entire family, who were so brave at last night's memorial service in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_Hill" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to pay tribute to all victims and all survivors of violence, including those who are right now afraid for their lives. I want to thank the first responders, including neighbours—people with no training, who were good Samaritans—but also the police and the ambos who came onto the scene, and I thank them for being there at last night's memorial, as well as the fireys and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , who turned out in massive numbers. So did so many people in our community, because so many people were connected to Hannah and to her kids. Sergeant

        , from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCYC" rel="nofollow">
         PCYC
        </a>
        , who worked with Hannah, spoke, and so did her friends Nikki and Lou, and they really gave voice to some of the great loss that our community is feeling. Hannah looked after thousands of kids in her time at the PCYC, my son amongst them, and she was so connected to our community. There's distress. There's devastation. And people want action.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DV" rel="nofollow">
         DV
        </a>
        service that looked after them—all of the DV services. I want to particularly mention Brisbane Domestic Violence Service. I want to encourage everyone in this House to redouble their efforts to support victims and survivors.
