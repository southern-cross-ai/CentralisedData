       <p>
        I rise today to speak in support of the efforts by the community in Ormeau to have Boral, the operator of a quarry in that area, comply with the approval requirements that have been imposed on them for the expansion of the quarry. It is clear from Boral's activities over the past few years that they are resistant to complying with the approvals that have been granted in relation to the operation of their quarry, to the extent that a surveyor's report in 2007 clearly stated that the land that they had utilised for quarrying operations had encroached into the Pimpama Creek, which was well outside of approvals, and the recommendations from the surveyor were for them to lodge a notification with natural resources to either purchase that land or to remediate the creek. They have failed to do that in the five years since that advice.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, they continue to fail to comply with the council obligations imposed on them in terms of numbering trucks, operating within the approved operating hours for the quarry, and ensuring that dust and noise suppression obligations are adhered to. So I call on Boral, as a good corporate citizen, to comply with the obligations that have been set on them.
