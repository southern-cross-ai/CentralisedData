        Last week, the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman released its annual report for 2016. The report further revealed the extent of the failure of the Turnbull government's second-rate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        . There has been a 160 per cent increase in complaints to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIO" rel="nofollow">
         TIO

        Launceston had the dubious honour of having the highest rate of NBN complaints in Tasmania, and, frankly, I am not surprised, given the prevalence of the run-around between NBN Co. and retail service providers. My office is inundated with complaints about homes left without usable internet or landline connections and the lack of coordination between wholesaler and retailer.

        It's just not good enough that you have businesses that rely upon telecommunications services to sustain their operations suffering from service failures and a run-around as to who is responsible. We all know that vulnerable people like our elderly rely upon the connection provided by telecommunications providers for a range of things, including life-saving medical services. The TIO report is a damning indictment on the federal Liberal government and their failed NBNâ€”
