       <p>
        I rise to acknowledge in this parliament a very important event in the life of my electorate, the opening of the new Anzac Park Public School in Cammeray. My area of Sydney is home to many great schools. However, increasing enrolments have seen incredible pressure placed on local public schools. The decision of the

        government to fund new schools on the lower

        has therefore been very welcome.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following the opening of the fine new Cammeraygal High School in

        in 2015, I was delighted to recently attend the official opening of the Anzac Park Public School in Cammeray. The school is a world-class facility and incorporates the best of technology and design to provide a wonderful educational setting for the 1,000 students it has the capacity to enrol.
       </p>
       <p>
        It has been built on the site of the old Anzac Memorial Club. The club always held a special place in the hearts of local veterans. It is therefore pleasing that this connection with the Anzac tradition is reflected in the name of the new school. The school opened its doors to kindergarten students this year and it was a special moment to see so many of those foundation students excitedly participating in the opening ceremony with such obvious pride.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate all those who have been involved in seeing this school become a reality, particularly the impressive teaching staff led by its first principal, Unity Taylor-Hill, and the parents who have been intimately involved in its establishment. I have no doubt that Anzac Park Public School will become one of the state's finest and ensure a quality education for the many students who will come through its doors.
