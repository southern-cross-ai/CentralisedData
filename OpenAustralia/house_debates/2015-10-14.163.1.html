        I rise today to talk about an outstanding asset in my electorate of Richmond, which is the Tweed Regional Art Gallery. The gallery is one we are all very proud of, particularly with the addition of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Olley" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Art Centre in 2014. The gallery is an outstanding establishment which brings enormous social, cultural and economic benefits for communities on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Located on the outskirts of Murwillumbah, the gallery is an architectural gem situated amongst panoramic views of the

        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweed_River" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . It is, indeed, a stunning location.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am unashamedly a huge fan of the gallery, and I am not alone in that. Recently we were thrilled to learn that the Tweed Regional Art Gallery and the Margaret Olley Art Centre have been listed among the top one per cent of attractions in the world by global travel site,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TripAdvisor" rel="nofollow">
         TripAdvisor
        </a>
        , which is a great achievement. The gallery was recently named the fourth best museum in TripAdvisor's 2015 Travellers' Choice 'Top 10 Museums—Australia', and was listed as number eight in the 'Top 25 Museums—South Pacific' list, which is also a great achievement. Of course TripAdvisor is the world's largest travel site with travel reviews and opinions covering 4.9 million areas in 45 countries. As the fabulous gallery director Susi Muddiman recently said: 'I am so pleased that our visitors, especially interstate ones, regard the gallery and our programs so highly. To be listed in the top five museum destinations in the country and in the company of such wonderful facilities, is excellent news for us.'
       </p>
       <p>
        The gallery is a leader in our region's art tourism market. It brings in over $7 million annually to the Tweed economy, and it continues to attract record crowds. It attracted almost 123,000 visitors in the year of operation since the opening of the Margaret Olley Art Centre, which is another great achievement.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2014 we unveiled the Margaret Olley Art Centre, which is a permanent exhibition that is a painstaking yet remarkable re-creation of the home and studio of one of Australia's most loved and respected artists. Margaret Olley had spent some of her childhood in the Tweed and for this reason she bequeathed $1 million to the gallery to have her personal belongings moved to reproduce what has been called 'the most famous rooms in Australian art'. As the local MP and member of the former Labor government I was very proud that we were able to contribute an additional $1 million to make the Margaret Olley Art Centre a reality.
       </p>
       <p>
        I acknowledge the contribution and commitment of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweed_Shire_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Tweed Shire Council
        </a>
        to the gallery. I also thank the gallery staff, their hardworking volunteers, and also the friends and foundation members of the gallery, all of whom contribute so much to its success.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Margaret Olley Art Centre truly has put us on the world stage, and I am very proud of this exceptional gallery. It is one that is fostering the vibrant art community of northern

        and attracting visitors from all around the world. In my area are very fortunate to have one of the highest proportions of artistic communities in New South Wales and, indeed, in Australia. I think it is also reflected by the wonderful art galleries that we have.
       </p>
       <p>
        Madam Deputy Speaker, please, you and others in the chamber should come along and visit the Tweed Regional Art Gallery. It is a remarkable asset.
