        In March of this year, many of the residents of Stuarts Point, just north of Kempsey, were evacuated from their homes in the middle of the night due to health concerns as a result of flooding into septic systems, which discharged into the yards, streets and, in some instances, homes of the residents of Stuarts Point. For over two decades the community of Stuarts Point have been waiting for the delivery of a sewer project and, thanks to the hard work of the members of the

        </a>
        and the Kempsey Local Aboriginal Land Council, this project will now be realised. Last Friday saw the first-ever agreement between the shire council and the Indigenous land council to acquire the land in Stuarts Point to deliver this long overdue and much-needed project. The agreement is not just delivering better residential infrastructure but also creating a stronger bond with the Indigenous community. I'd like to acknowledge Kempsey Local Aboriginal land Council Chief Executive Officer Greg Douglas for his tireless efforts, along with Craig Millburn, Robert Fish and Mayor Liz Campbell. I also acknowledge

        . Well, that was the musical backdrop as I strapped on my footy boots to play for the Wrinkled Horns Vikings rugby team last Saturday against the

        </a>
        s hosted a special charity and sponsor day in front of a larger-than-normal crowd on what was a very cold day for Port Macquarie. The Viking first-grade team wore a special one-off set of jerseys which were later auctioned off at the Port City Bowling Club during the post-match function. Despite the freshly worn and not so freshly smelling jumpers, the bidding was aggressive and very generous from a healthy crowd of players and supporters.
       </p>
       <p>
        The auction raised more than $10,000 for the Make a Difference organisation, who are sponsors of the local Orange Sky Laundry Van and other charitable services. Make a Difference supports disadvantaged people living in the community and most recently stepped in to help with the flood relief across the Hastings. The fundraising from Saturday aims to complete the fit-out of a food and coffee van and to expand the Make a Difference service in the community. Congratulations to the Viking rugby club and thank you to everybody who was involved on the day. It was a lot of fun for a very good cause.
