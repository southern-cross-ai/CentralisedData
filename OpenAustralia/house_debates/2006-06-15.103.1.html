        Today I rise to outline some of my concerns about an issue affecting many of my constituents and about which they are very passionate—that is, Australia’s live animal export trade. For at least six years the Howard government has known about the atrocities committed at Egypt’s Bassatin abattoir but, as usual, has failed to act.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia exports more than half a million live cattle every year to almost a dozen different countries, largely in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
         Middle East
        </a>
        and South-East Asia. Between December 2004 and June 2005 alone, 11,298 sheep died before stepping off the boat. Despite this, the agriculture minister only suspended the trade when confronted with the public reaction to the graphic report on
        <i>
         60 Minutes
        </i>
        . But temporarily suspending the live animal trade with Egypt is only a very small first step. The next step should be the finalisation of a memorandum of understanding covering the welfare of Australian cattle and sheep shipped to Egypt. This was promised by the Howard government in 2004 but they are yet to deliver.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have received an overwhelming amount of correspondence from constituents within the seat of Adelaide who are gravely concerned with animal welfare issues that arise from Australia’s live export trade. One constituent wrote to me stating that he was ‘deeply distressed by the unspeakable cruelty animals exported to the Middle East are subjected to’. The federal government has the power to ban exports permanently. The live export trade should not continue until these issues of animal welfare are properly addressed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor has already taken action on live exports. Labor’s shadow minister for agriculture and fisheries, Gavan O’Connor, has already put the industry on notice. He has met with industry leaders and stated that an incoming Labor government would have no hesitation in withdrawing licences, suspending or even banning this trade if the animal welfare issues are not adequately addressed. My own personal position on this matter is a little more staunch than this because I have serious concerns about how the Australian government can be convinced that these animal welfare issues will be addressed on the other side of the world. Labor should instead be focusing the industry on expanding the carcass trade.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Howard government must announce whether it is planning on lifting the suspension on live animal exports. I call on the government to let the parliament and the people of Australia know when the suspension will be lifted. It is my very firm view that no amount of profit legitimises brutality. The Australian government must take a united stance against cruelty to animals and should start by showing some real leadership on this issue by pursuing the memorandum of understanding and by putting an end to brutality ahead of corporate profits.
