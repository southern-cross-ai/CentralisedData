       <p>
        In last year's budget the coalition government announced the Stronger Communities Program to fund small capital projects in local communities across the country, with each electorate having $150,000 funding to allocate in each round. The aim of the fund is to work with small communities on projects that will deliver a social benefit and help contribute to a more vibrant and viable community.
       </p>
       <p>
        In round 1 of this program my office received 49 expressions of interests for funding totalling almost half a million dollars. The Paterson Independent Community Consultation Committee had the unenviable task of narrowing down so many worthwhile applications to $150,000. I commend them for their outstanding work. Now the work of that committee has just got a little bit harder. With round 2 expressions of interest closing last Friday, my office received 59 expressions of interest totalling almost $600,000. The committee has their work cut out for them as they examine these expressions of interest and determine the priority projects of most merit.
       </p>
       <p>
        My office will then make contact with those groups deemed to have the priority projects and invite them to make the formal grant application. Of course, my office will help them with those submissions. I would remind all local government, and incorporated not-for-profit organisations, that they are eligible to apply for grants between $5,000 and up to a maximum of $20,000 in the future. Applicants are required to confirm matched funding in cash or in kind at least on a dollar-for-dollar basis.
