       <p>
        With the death of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fidel_Castro" rel="nofollow">
         Fidel Castro
        </a>
        , it is tempting to follow the old custom of never speaking ill of the dead. However, I agree with the comments of Professor Carlos Erie, who has written:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If this were a just world, these facts should be etched on Castro's tombstone;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He turned Cuba into a colony of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_Union" rel="nofollow">
         Soviet Union
        </a>
        and nearly caused a nuclear holocaust.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He sponsored terrorism wherever he could and allied himself with many of the worst dictators throughout the world.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He was responsible for so many thousands of executions and disappearances in Cuba but a precise number is hard to reckon.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He condoned and encouraged torture and extrajudicial killings.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He forced nearly 20 per cent of his own people into exile, and prompted many thousands to meet their deaths at sea.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He claimed all property for himself and his henchmen, strangled food production and impoverished the vast majority of his people.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He outlawed private enterprise and wiped out Cuba's large middle class and turned Cubans into slaves of the state.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He persecuted gay people and tried to eradicate religion.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He censored all means of expression and communication.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He establish a fraudulent school system that provided indoctrination rather than education.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …   …   …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He brooked no dissent and built concentration camps … incarcerating a higher percentage of his own people than most modern dictators ...
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …   …   …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He turned Cuba into a labyrinth of ruins.
       </p>
       <p>
        As was said about Castro in a letter in the
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miami_Herald" rel="nofollow">
          Miami Herald
         </a>
        </i>
        :
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He had a peaceful death, but in his final days he should have experienced a lot of suffering; he should have been dragged through the streets of Havana, like Mussolini in Italy, and then hanged.
