       <p>
        I would just like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the importance of the wine industry. What a vital industry it is—not only to our nation but, particularly, to my state of Tasmania. I also take this opportunity to recognise those businesses that make such a valuable contribution to the Tasmanian economy within my electorate of Lyons.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to recognise many of those family businesses that are striving to grow and capitalise on the reputation and the growing reputation that Tasmania has for producing some of the world's best cool-climate wines—particularly pinot noir, but also, increasingly, grapes that supply many of the very best sparkling wines produced in this country. Not only are they of world renown to the judges, but, I suspect, from a commercial point of view, most importantly to the consumers who enjoy those wines. Indeed, Tasmania is the jewel in the crown of an important national industry, driven by quality, that is growing domestically but also, increasingly, looking to markets that we have overseas. Our reputation is for the quality of Tasmanian grapes and the brand that supports that.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the challenges, though, for the industry is indeed the wine equalisation tax. Many recognise that the original intent of this tax and the rebate associated with it are no longer supporting regional vineyards, the tourism enterprises many of them are involved in and the employment that they create. There are anomalies within the scheme: for example, the fact that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        producers are also eligible for the rebate. Reform, indeed, is needed, and I call on the government to engage with industry on this as a matter of urgency. Our exports increasingly need to be focused on quality.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will just acknowledge the four major wine regions within the state that encompass the electorate of Lyons: the
