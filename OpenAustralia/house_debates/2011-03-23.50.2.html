        I stand today to support and endorse
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Newman" rel="nofollow">
         Campbell Newman
        </a>
        as the next
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         Premier of Queensland
        </a>
        . We also need a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberal_National_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Liberal National Party
        </a>
        member to represent the people of Ashgrove, a state seat within my electorate of Ryan. We need a strong and effective Premier of Queensland, and I can think of no-one better than Lord Mayor Campbell Newman. You do not get a reputation around Brisbane and Queensland as ‘Can Do’ Campbell without having a strong track record of action, commitment and delivery. There is no doubt that Campbell will deliver for the people of Ashgrove as their local member and for all Queenslanders as their Premier, just as he has for the people of Brisbane for the past seven years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Having worked closely with Campbell since 2002, I know he will make an outstanding contribution to state politics and the state Liberal National Party team, both as a member and as leader. Campbell’s energy, passion and commitment to Brisbane and Queensland are something I admire, and I know he will work tirelessly and faithfully for the people of Ashgrove and deliver the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        to government in Queensland.
       </p>
       <p>
        Campbell’s experience in senior management and in the military and his commitment to getting on with the job of delivering services and outcomes for Brisbane residents and Queenslanders will stand in stark contrast to the tired Bligh Labor spin machine. I have every confidence that Campbell Newman will be able to make this unique situation work and, furthermore, run an effective and powerful campaign to be both the leader of the LNP and the Premier of Queensland.
