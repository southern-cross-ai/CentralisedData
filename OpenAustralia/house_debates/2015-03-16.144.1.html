        ) ( I rise today to inform the House of a successful student representative council forum held in the Lalor electorate on Wednesday, 11 March. This is a process that I have initiated within the electorate, where we call together student representative councils, where they exist, or leadership teams from every school across the electorate for two sessions for the year. We held the first of the 2015 sessions last week. It was an absolute pleasure to work with students from across the electorate across the day. They demonstrated a deep understanding of leadership, cultural change and their school community as well as their broader community. They also demonstrated real pride in their achievements and a strong understanding of the challenges that their communities face.

        The participants who support the program help me to get in touch with the issues, concerns, attitudes and opinions of the young people in the electorate. It is an absolute pleasure to spend the day with these young people and listen to their stories, and schools should be very proud of the contributions they make on the day. Most schools went back with a project of some sort to improve their school culture, and I am looking forward to seeing them later in the year to hear about how those projects went. I also make special mention of Melbourne Islamic School, which joined us for the second time, and the terrific contributions their students made. The Grange College hosted this forum this year, and I would like to thank Melanie Whyte and Taki Tuariki, the college captains, and Travis Walsh and Jonathan Lim-I for their support on the dayâ€”ushering students, but being absolutely useful on the ground as we began each forum and before they joined those forums.
