       <p>
        Last week I gave my first speech to this House. It was a humbling and moving experience and one I will always remember. So many people have helped me along this journey that it was not feasible to thank them all last week and, as such, I would like to take this opportunity to thank some of the many individuals who took the time to support and encourage me in my two campaigns over the past 10 months,
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberal_Party" rel="nofollow">
         The Liberal Party
        </a>
        is a grassroots movement that relies on the blood, sweat, toil and tears of thousands volunteers—each of whom strives to make a real difference to our country. The Liberal Party in Wentworth is no different. Between last year's by-election in October 2018 and the general election of May 2019, thousands of people gave their time and invested their effort to help return Wentworth to the Liberal column. I will always appreciate the trust placed in me by the Wentworth Federal Electorate Conference, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FEC" rel="nofollow">
         FEC
        </a>
        . I was not a born and bred local and had not been active in the party over a long period. I did not know many of them and they in turn did not know me. But I was welcomed with open arms by the FEC, and for that I will be internally grateful.
       </p>
       <p>
        In particular, I would like to thank my campaign team: Harry Stutchbury, Sally Betts,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Fay" rel="nofollow">
         Sam Fay
        </a>
        , Darel Hughes, Natarsha Terreiro, Luke Barnes, Will Nemesh, Andrew Bragg and Yosi Tal. Without their efforts, I would not be here today. I'll take with me many fond memories of countless campaign meetings, late nights and endless phone calls. A candidate could not wish for a more dynamic, hardworking, dedicated and selfless campaign team.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to my campaign team many local Liberals committed themselves to my campaign, undertaking countless hours of letterboxing, doorknocking, street stalls and pre-poll voting. It would be impossible to name them all, but I would like to thank Toby Moore, Georgia de Mestre, Annabelle Young, Zac Scott, Sal Sefionidis, David Tsor,

        From the Liberal Party headquarters, I would like to thank
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Stone" rel="nofollow">
         Chris Stone
        </a>
        , Andrew Hirst, Simon Berger, Bonnie Marshall and Luke Nayner for their tireless efforts. Thank you also to my state parliamentary colleague

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Wallace" rel="nofollow">
         James Wallace
        </a>
        , Trent Zimmerman and Chris Rath. Their guidance and support has been invaluable in every step of this journey. To my new staff—Harry Stutchbury, Luke Barnes, Toby Moore, Jodie Lyons and Deyi Wu: thank you for joining me on this journey. I look forward to serving the people of Wentworth with you.
       </p>

        I've been lucky to have the friendship and support of many community members and groups across Wentworth: from

        One of the most rewarding parts of being a candidate has been delivering important outcomes for local organisations—commitments made to the Woollahra Men's Shed, Bondi Cottage, the Lokahi Foundation—
