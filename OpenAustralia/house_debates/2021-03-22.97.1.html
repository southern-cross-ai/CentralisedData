        My question is again to the Prime Minister, and I refer to his previous answer. Why hasn't the Prime Minister asked his staff whether they sought to undermine Brittany Higgins's loved ones? Is the Prime Minister's refusal to answer questions about whether he asked about the actions of his office just another example of 'don't ask, don't tell'?

         I refer the member to my earlier responses on this matter. There is no information that's been put before me that suggests that this has been undertaken, and I've been very clear to the House about that. When it comes to the issues that this House is dealing with in regard to the matters involving Brittany Higgins and the many other issues that have arisen since, these are issues that I know have caused deep distress across the Australian community. What they are seeking from the government is what we are seeking to provide, and that is to ensure that, first of all, we put in place immediately the support line and assistance to people who are working in this House to ensure that, if they find themselves in a position where they need to reach out and get counselling and supporting, that service is being provided. The government has taken action to put that in place. In addition to that, there is the multiparty committee process which has been put in place under the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_Discrimination_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">
          Sex Discrimination Commissioner
         </a>
         that will investigate these issues and ensure that they bring back recommendations to this parliament.

           On direct relevance: all the information the Prime Minister is going through is important and is known. There is an issue that is not known, which is what he's been asked—about whether he's asked his staff—and that's what he should be being direct to.

            In terms of the question, certainly the Prime Minister was relevant in the first part of his answer. I was allowing him to give some context, but it is true: the rest of the answer can't continue on the lines that it's going. But I allowed him to give some context, given the nature of the question.

             Let me conclude on this. The next element that the government is responding to is the recommendations from the deputy secretary of my department to put in place a complaints process that members of this place and their staff can access. That work is continuing to be done, and there has been liaison with the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_Discrimination_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">
              Sex Discrimination Commissioner
             </a>
             so that we can deal with the issues that are at the centre of the matters that have so impacted this parliament and the people who work here, and of course concern around this country. That is what my government is focusing on.
