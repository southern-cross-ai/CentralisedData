       <p>
        We are in a Labor created cost-of-living crisis and that's about to get worse. One of the most important and enjoyable things you can do is to have fish and chips on the beach or in a park with a partner, your family or friends. However, this simple pleasure is going to be taken away from us because federal and state Labor governments have decided to persecute our fishermen.
       </p>
       <p>
        In June a joint media release from federal and Queensland Labor said they're going to ban gillnet fishing—no consultation with the community, no consultation with our fishermen, and short time frames. This is going to happen by the end of this year. Then we'll see at least 90 licensed fishermen having significantly reduced incomes or being wiped out totally. It's simply not right. We're talking about people's lives here: fishermen and fisherwomen's lives, fish-and-chip shops, and fishmongers. This cruel federal Labor government is taking away the rights of these fishermen to earn a living.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was talking to one of these fishermen. He happens to have a daughter who's in grade 12—a straight-A student who wants to go to university to become a doctor, a

        , and we certainly need more of those in rural and regional Australia. Now, with the stroke of a pen in Canberra, this dream is being taken away. It's absolutely disgraceful. What about the effect on the communities and the chandleries? As we know, the fishermen operate in a tough environment, out in the sun and salt. They need a lot of shackles, ropes, floats, anchors and all those sorts of things. Without this, the chandlery shops are going to go out of business—and the ice producers. When a fisherman catches a fish he bleeds it and puts it on ice and that way keeps it nice and fresh so we can enjoy eating the fish. He's going to be out of business. The boatbuilders and repairers will go out of business. The outboard sales and service will go out of business.
       </p>
       <p>
        What does it mean for the average Australian when you take 2,000 tonnes of fresh, wild caught fish out of the equation? It is simple supply and demand. When you take the supply out, the price will go up. Then we'll be relying on more imported fish. Rather than having fish from our pristine waters, we'll be importing lesser-quality fish, and prices will skyrocket.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm not taking this lying down. I've written to Minister Tanya Plibersek. Surprise, surprise: I haven't received a reply. I'm calling on Minister Plibersek to come to my electorate, do some community consultation, talk to the fishermen, have a discussion and see how the fishermen fish. They actually have to sit on the nets, follow the nets and make sure that they're looked after. This absolute rubbish about looking after the

        </a>
        —these nets don't go within 60 kilometres of the Great Barrier Reef—is just another Labor lie. I have a big message for all the recreational fishermen out there. I'm a recreational fisherman myself. I love to recreationally fish with my family and friends. We have an absolute ball. When this cruel Labor government punishes and persecutes professional fishermen, we'll be next. They'll be coming for us.
       </p>
       <p>
        The wild caught fishing industry in Queensland deserves to be protected and deserves to be supported. The wild-caught fishing industry is sustainable, and the fishery is in good condition. The wild-caught fishing industry is operated by a quota system that has been developed by science. The wild-caught fishing industry is heavily regulated. They have to check in at night. They have to have their logbooks. The wild-caught fishing industry is heavily monitored via

        . The wild-caught fishing industry is run by professional men and women, and has been for so many generations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia, we must stand up and support our professional fisher men and women. Do not let this cruel Albanese Labor government destroy our primary industries.
