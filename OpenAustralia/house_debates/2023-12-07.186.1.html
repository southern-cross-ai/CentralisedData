       <p>
        As we move into the holiday season this year, I stand before you with a very heavy heart, compelled to address an issue that demands our collective attention: the crisis of violence against women. It is crucial that we confront the stark reality that violence against women and girls remains one of the most prevalent and terrible violations of human rights in this nation. Police across Australia respond, on average, to 720 incidents of domestic violence each day. This is one incident every two minutes. Unfortunately, over the Christmas festive season, these incidents spike by over 20 per cent. Christmas is meant to be the most wonderful time of the year, but we know that, for women and children experiencing domestic abuse, it is far from this. In fact, it can be quite a frightening and isolating time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The theme for this year's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Day" rel="nofollow">
         International Day
        </a>
        for the Elimination of Violence against Women was: '
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNITE" rel="nofollow">
         UNITE
        </a>
        ! Invest to prevent violence against women and girls'. This is not just a call to action but a reminder that each of us bears a responsibility to contribute to the creation of a world that is free from the shackles of violence towards women.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is imperative to recognise that family and domestic violence do not discriminate. They transcend age, cultural background, occupation, education level, income bracket and location. This is not someone else's problem; it is an issue that touches us all, whether directly or indirectly. We cannot turn a blind eye to the fact that, on average, every 14 days a woman loses her life to domestic violence in our country. Behind each tragic incident are shattered families, grieving communities and a society that must grapple with the uncomfortable truth that we have not done enough.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last month's International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women was a symbolic occasion. It was a stark reminder of our duty as representatives of the people. We must strive to ensure that every Australian, regardless of gender, can live a life free from violence. This fundamental human right must be at the core of our legislative policy endeavours.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Albanese government, in collaboration with state and territory governments, has embarked on a comprehensive and ambitious journey with the National Plan to End Violence against
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_and_Children" rel="nofollow">
         Women and Children
        </a>
        2022-2032. This plan not only sets the goal to end violence within one generation but also focuses on prevention, early intervention, appropriate response and, critically, the support and healing of victims-survivors.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have committed substantial resources, $2.3 billion to be precise, to prioritise women's safety. This includes funding for prevention initiatives and education programs and support for organisations such as Our Watch, which plays a vital role in primary prevention efforts. One of my first votes in this chamber was for legislation that enshrined 10 paid days of family and domestic violence leave for all employees, including casuals. This landmark initiative aims to foster an environment where victims can access the support they need without fear of jeopardising their employment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our efforts to fix the escaping violence payment, to secure funds for frontline services and to build a robust frontline workforce are important steps, yet we must recognise that these are not just the end but, rather, the beginning of a long journey towards eradicating the deeply rooted issue of violence against women. It is a journey that requires collaboration across party lines within communities and among individuals. We must foster a culture where silence is replaced by open conversation, where victim blaming is replaced by empathy and where the notion that violence is inevitable becomes a relic of the past.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let us stand united in our commitment to building a safer Australia across this festive season so that it may be a joyous time for everyone. Have a merry and safe Christmas everyone.
       </p>
