        One of the most rewarding times as a federal member is to go to the opening of a long-awaited project in the electorate for which you have fought and which the community has supported you with. Last Friday, on 8 September, I was pleased to cut the ribbon at the official opening of the new
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundary_Road" rel="nofollow">

        overpass at Narangba, with the Queensland acting main roads minister. The project was finished under budget and six months ahead of schedule.
       </p>
       <p>
        Back in September 2013 I was elected. In January 2014, many businesses contacted me about the inadequate overpass at Boundary Road. I fought with the previous member for Longman, young Wyatt Roy—there he is in this picture with the former Deputy Prime Minister—for 'Boundary Road, just build it'. Well, it has been built. I am very pleased to announce it has been built. It is officially open, and it is going to benefit many residents, in

        , and businesses through increased productivity and less time stuck in traffic. They now have a new six-lane overpass on Boundary Road with longer on-ramps. It's future-proofed, so when the

        The coalition, in and around the Petrie electorate, spent $2 billion on infrastructure, including: the Gateway Upgrade North project; the Moreton Bay Rail Link; the Rothwell roundabout, soon to be finish in late October; and the
