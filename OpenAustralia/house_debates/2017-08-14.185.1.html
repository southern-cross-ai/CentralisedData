        On 29 July, I attended the Revesby Rovers Soccer Football Club trivia night at Panania Diggers Club. It was the second year that the club has run this fundraiser. It was a great night. It was held to support the club, to help cover the costs of running the club and to contribute to its ongoing work in the community. Revesby Rovers have been part of the local community since the 1950sâ€”it is actually the oldest club in the entire Bankstown area. The club plays at Amour Park. I want to thank

        , the President of Revesby Rovers, and all the other committee members who were there on the day for their hard work, and look forward to working with the club in the future.

        On 31 July, I attended a regional football facilities forum, which was organised by the Bankstown District Amateur Football Association and the St George District Football Association. More than 10,000 people play football in my electorate every Saturday, and they do so under the auspices of the St George and Bankstown associations. It was a fantastic event. Basically, it was about helping clubs to understand more about how to apply for various funding programs, how to engage with government and a whole range of other issues. It was great to see Peakhurst United,
