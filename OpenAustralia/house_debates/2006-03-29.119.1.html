        The Department of Defence intends to deliver new single residential accommodation, associated facilities, infrastructure and services on three bases, at Enoggera and Amberley in south-east Queensland and Holsworthy in New South Wales. The strategy being adopted by the Department of Defence is to engage a strategic partner for a number of components. The overall out-turn estimated cost of the project is $406 million at net present value over 30 years, including buildings, infrastructure, service of the facilities, maintenance and life cycle costs. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is planned to commence in early to mid 2007 and to be completed in 2009. I commend the motion to the House.
