        My question without notice is to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acting_Prime_Minister" rel="nofollow">
         Acting Prime Minister
        </a>
        . Is the Acting Prime Minister aware that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosecurity_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Biosecurity Australia
        </a>
        have endorsed the import risk assessment on bananas that states that there is no substantive risk sufficient to stop Filipino bananas from coming to Australia? Is the Acting Prime Minister also aware that, since Filipino agricultural wages are $4 a day and our award is $17.50 an hour, Biosecurity’s decision will therefore result in 6,000 jobs in the banana industry vanishing, 2,000 jobs in northern

        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         Far North Queensland
        </a>
        backpacker tourism vanishing, and a loss to the Australian economy of $400 million a year? Further, does the Prime Minister believe that anyone would accept that 20 million cartons of bananas will come into Australia but not a single microspore of the Philippine’s 23 contagious diseases?
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, in light of these dangers and the dangers of diseases and pests to our native flora and fauna, which currently occasion all plant material to be confiscated at airports, would the Acting Prime Minister not agree that allowing 300,000 tonnes of plant material in, with at most only 10,000 tonnes being inspected, is a decision that should at least be delayed—

            I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. I know that his concern on behalf of local banana growers in his electorate and his part of Queensland is a very sincere one. I absolutely appreciate it is a sincere concern and that is why he has raised the matter in the House today. I can advise the member for Kennedy and the House that
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosecurity_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             Biosecurity Australia
            </a>
            has issued a final import risk analysis report on bananas from the Philippines and that is open to appeal until 12 December—that is, open to appeal for 30 days from the day of the decision. I think it is very important to note that the import risk analysis process is transparent, a scientific assessment and independent of government.

              Well, it is independent of government. It is reviewed through public consultation and through the scrutiny of an Eminent Scientists Group. We do take in this country a conservative approach to quarantine, as we should, and the import risk analysis proposes that bananas only enter Australia under strict quarantine measures relating to seven groups of pests of quarantine concern. These measures include sourcing bananas from demonstrated low-pest areas, field inspections and auditing by
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AQIS" rel="nofollow">
               AQIS
              </a>
              , disinfection treatments and mandatory pre-clearance of fruit by AQIS inspectors in the Philippines. In particular, AQIS officers will be involved in inspecting, verifying and auditing systems and processes in the Philippines both before and during the exporting of bananas.
             </p>
             <p>
              There will be a mandatory pre-clearance arrangement, with the presence and involvement of AQIS inspectors in the Philippines, in applying quarantine conditions in the field, including in packing houses. There will also be audit and verification by AQIS of systems and processes used by the Philippines to certify any exports, and Philippines exporters will be responsible for reimbursing the full cost of AQIS inspections. In addition, there will need to be a combination of laboratory and field experiments prior to exports occurring.
             </p>
             <p>
              I understand that this is a matter that deeply concerns the member for Kennedy and I understand he is representing the concerns of his constituents. This is a process independent of government—a transparent process, a process of scientific assessment and a process that involves the scrutiny of the Eminent Scientists Group. The matter is open for appeal until 12 December.
