        One of the great things about being a member of parliament is the people you meet and the people you get to represent, and that goes for all sides of the parliament. I am very biased about my people. We all talk about what we produce in the Mallee, but our greatest asset is our people.
       </p>
       <p>
        A great example of that is an organisation called the Lucas Foundation. A young child in Mildura contracted botulism and went to hospital in Melbourne, and his family had to find a way of supporting their child for such a very long time as they were travelling over 600 kilometres backwards and forwards to be by their child's side. Out of this journey, the Lucas Foundation was formed. The Lucas Foundation's stated case is, 'A helping hand to Sunraysia's children and their families'. It is to stand by parents and to assist financially the parents and families of very ill children. They are not government backed, just community backed. One of the things I have in my office is a painting I bought for $500 to raise some money for the Lucas Foundation. It proudly hangs in my office in Mildura.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another great example are Sunassist. They are a small organisation with a whole lot of cars and a whole lot of volunteers. They will go and pick up someone who needs to go to a medical appointment or an elderly person who needs to get their groceries. It is another example of a great volunteer organisation.

        While our statistics in the electorate of Mallee show high unemployment and high disadvantage, the highest statistic that we have in the state is, unbelievably, volunteerism. We actually have the highest volunteerism in the state of Victoria in my part of the world. I think it comes from the independence of country people and knowing that if we do not work together, we will not get the services that we need.
       </p>

        This was evident last week, when the Prime Minster came to Horsham and partnered with the community. The Prime Minister gave a cheque of $1 million—actually, he gave $1 million plus $100, because he got $100 out of his own wallet; we wedged a bit more money out of him! But, because the community is raising $1 million to build an oncology wing, the Prime Minister contributed $1 million, and the state government—we hope—will soon commit to a further $1 million, so that we can have good cancer services. But the volunteerism, the commitment of people—who are not wealthy people—being prepared to put their hands in their pockets and contribute to a cause, and the community spirit are things that I am really proud about. I said to the Prime Minister at the time: 'You have visited now. You can see why I am very biased for my patch, and why our country people deserve to be recognised.'
