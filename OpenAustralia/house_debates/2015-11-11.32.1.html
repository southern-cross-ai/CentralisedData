        I stand to acknowledge the remarkable contributions of a young man who just happens to be my godson, a young fellow by the name of Lochlann Fanning, 20 years of age, who has overcome incredible adversity in his time. Some 10 years ago, he had a horrific horse accident while out riding with his mother, Anastasia, and sister, Isabelle. He fell. He was wearing a helmet. He spent a number of weeks in an induced coma and some seven months later was released from the

        in Brisbane. He suffered relatively severe physical disabilities but no mental disabilities.

        As a result of that,

        , the country magazine presented weekly, did an article on him last week. It just made me proud of what he had achieved. It reminded me, when we are down here in this place, of how important family should be to all of us.

        Lochlann, to you: for what you have done in overcoming serious disability, I applaud you for the tenacity and for the strength that you have shown in getting on with your life. Lochlann has worked for the last three years at the Gracemere saleyards. I would encourage any of those listening and all in the gallery: if you are ever in

        at the Rockhampton Gracemere saleyards, pop in and say hello to Lochlann. He will be easily distinguished, as he is a character. He has just finished his final year of accountancy with an accountancy practice in Rockhampton, and I wish him the best in life.
