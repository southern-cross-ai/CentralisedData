        I welcome the council of south-east Queensland mayors to Canberra, once again, for their annual visit. As someone who has lived in Ipswich all of my life, I am committed to South-East Queensland. One in seven Australians live in south-east Queensland and for the past 10 years 20 per cent of the economic and employment growth in this country was in south-east Queensland.

        While they are here, the infrastructure Prime Minister—as he likes to call himself—can have a listen to the mayors of South-East Queensland. One of the projects he can think about is the Darra to Springfield rail extension to
