       <p>
        The Department of Defence is seeking to upgrade the Cocos (Keeling) Islands airfield for use by heavy aircraft and to improve airfield safety for civilian and military aircraft. Proposed works include a permanent construction wharf; strengthening and widening the runway, taxiways and aprons; extending the runway; removing legacy waste; and enhancing airfield lighting, drainage and flood prevention infrastructure. The estimated cost of the work is $567.6 million, excluding

        </a>
        . The project was referred to the Public Works Committee, ably chaired by the member for Moreton, on 24 November 2022. Following its inquiry, the committee has recommended the House of Representatives resolve, pursuant to section 18(7) of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, that it is expedient to carry out this project. The committee has also recommended that Defence provide the committee with a project midpoint briefing. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence in mid-2023 and be completed by mid-2026. On behalf of the government I would like to thank the committee for undertaking a timely inquiry. I commend the motion to the House.

       <p>
        The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is proposing to redevelop the Australian High Commission in Abuja, Nigeria. The proposed work will involve construction of a new permanent chancery compound on the current site and will include new chancery guardhouses, head-of-mission residence, and staff and services facilities. The estimated cost of the works is $38.3 million, excluding GST. The project was referred to the Public Works Committee on 24 November 2022. Following its inquiry, the committee has recommended that the House of Representatives resolve, pursuant to section 18(7) of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, that it is expedient to carry out this project. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence late 2023 and be completed by 2025. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee, ably chaired by the member for Moreton, for undertaking a timely inquiry. I commend the motion to the House.
