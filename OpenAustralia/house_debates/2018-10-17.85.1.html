        My question is again to the Minister for the Environment. Last week, when asked how Australia would meet its Paris carbon pollution reduction targets, the minister said the government would 'build one billion trees'. Does the minister plan on sharing this environmental breakthrough with other nations so they can also build some trees? What other fantastic forestry sector innovations is the minister relying upon to avoid real action on climate change?

         I'm so thrilled to be getting so many questions on the environment. We love to talk about the environment on this side because we're doing a good job. People can trust us. Australians know they can't trust you opposite. Building—I would also say growing—one billion trees. People may have noticed, going back a few weeks ago, the agriculture minister announced a new forestry plan. That is what I was referring to in the media.
        </p>
        <p>
         We don't make an apology on this side for focusing on getting electricity prices down. That's what we're focused on, but we can look after the environment and the economy at the same time. We are doing this in a responsible way whilst growing the economy. The Australian people know they can trust us to do this. You can't trust those opposite. What's their record? What are they talking about? They're talking about a 45 per cent emissions target. They're talking about a 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target. You cannot trust them.
        </p>
        <p>
         Don't just believe me. Why don't we get some quotes about what other people have said about Labor. What about the

           The Leader of the Opposition—I almost forgot.

           said, 'the rush away from coal and gas-fired electricity power stations to renewables is a little unseemly in its haste because we are potentially crucifying hundreds of thousands of manufacturing workers.' The Grattan Institute said that Labor's claim that prices would go down as a result of a higher emissions reductions target is 'unlikely to be sustainable', 'could accelerate plant closures', 'requires higher consumer prices' and 'is inherently uncertain'. Just one more: the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Council_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Business Council of Australia
           </a>
           has described Labor's 45 per cent emissions reduction target as 'economy-wrecking'. The Australian people know they can trust us with the environment and the economy. They can't trust that lot.
