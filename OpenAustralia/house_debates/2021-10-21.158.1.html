        I rise to update the House on two very important projects in my electorate of Robertson: the Peninsula Recreation Precinct at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umina_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Umina Beach
        </a>
        and the funding for commuter car parks in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woy_Woy" rel="nofollow">
         Woy Woy
        </a>
        and Gosford. A number of local Labor representatives have been spreading a whole lot of misinformation in my community recently, and I want to set the record straight. After all, political point scoring by the opposition delivers nothing for the community; it just delivers points to the opposition. I'm committed to an even better future for local residents and to make the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        an even better place to live and work, not to advance personal political interests or personal attacks. I think that locals expect more of their representatives—

        Sitting suspended from 11 : 24 to 11:34
       </p>
       <p>
        I think that locals expect more of their local representatives than name-calling, misinformation and downright misleading commentary on projects that have taken time to get right so that they do meet the needs of our region. The Morrison government is absolutely committed to seeing the $8.25 million upgrade of the Peninsula Recreation Precinct become a reality. I've had a number of meetings with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast Council
        </a>
        , including when it was dominated by Labor councillors. Since then, it has come under administration. I've met with the Deputy Prime Minister's office and the department of infrastructure to seek to reach a funding agreement that will deliver what the Umina Beach community needs. This year alone I've met with Central Coast Council 10 times regarding the delivery of this commitment and to advocate on behalf of local sporting groups, including the Umina United Eagles Soccer Club, Umina Bunnies Junior Rugby League Club and the Southern Spirit Cricket Club.
       </p>
       <p>
        These clubs have made it clear that they want two separate facilities, each with a club room, storage, change rooms, toilets and a canteen. That's exactly what I intend to help deliver. Many of the initial designs we received from council didn't meet these requirements and simply weren't good enough. I've also been advised that the Central Coast Council's project manager for this development has actually changed a number of times, causing further delays in getting an agreement signed. This is one of the many results of the council's economic challenges, which have been well known and published; they're well known in our community. They've resulted in an inability to deliver local infrastructure projects like these. After numerous changes to the scope of this development, we're now at a stage of getting what our community wants and deserves. I'm advised that the funding agreement is almost complete and funding should be able to be made available to the council shortly. These buildings are much more than simple amenities. They're places where the local community can gather and belong. That is what this project is about. That is why I have fought so hard to get this project right, and I'll continue to advocate until it is delivered and used by all in our community.

        The Morrison government is also committed to delivering on more commuter car parking in Gosford and Woy Woy. In the 2019-20 budget the Australian government committed $5 million towards the Woy Woy commuter car park under the Urban Congestion Fund, and $30 million to fully fund the 600 commuter car spots in Gosford. The Woy Woy car parking is 100 per cent funded through the government and will be delivered through Transport for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
         NSW
        </a>
        . But I'm incredibly disappointed and frustrated by the delays that we've seen to this project. Currently, the car parking is in the design and planning phases, and some engineering issues have been identified across possible sites. These include all of the potential sites being flood prone due to their proximity to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_Water" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane Water
        </a>
        , the requirements for extended retaining walls and the need to relocate rail assets. It's a big project. The car parking at Gosford will also be funded by the Australian government and will now be delivered with Transport for NSW, which is undertaking scoping activities to identify a suitable side. I do thank Transport for NSW, because the project was delayed, as scoping that was initially being undertaken by Central Coast Council was not able to be completed by them when they went into administration last year. Council advised they could no longer undertake the delivery of the project, so the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        government is now helping to deliver this commitment to my community, and I thank them.
       </p>
       <p>
        I do assure local commuters that I will continue to work with the New South Wales government on the scope of these projects and ensure that they are delivered as soon and safely as possible. I'm advised that, by the end of next year, the government expects around 75 per cent of the projects under the Urban Congestion Fund to be completed or to be under construction. I will be fighting and advocating every single day, as I have since the project was announced, to see the Gosford and Woy Woy projects delivered as part of this number.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Morrison government recognises the importance of delivering on crucial infrastructure initiatives like this. This car parking for our hardworking commuters here on the Central Coast not only means that commuters can get home sooner and safer, and perhaps leave home a little later to be able to get to the station; it means that they can spend more time with the people who they care about and less time stressing about whether they're going to be able to get a car park, whether it's going to be a suitable walking distance to the station or whether they're going to miss their train and have to wait for the next one.
       </p>
       <p>
        In a commuter belt like the Central Coast, car parking is incredibly important. In an area like the Peninsula, we have so many young families who play sport and soccer and all the other sports that are available down at the Peninsula Recreation Precinct, and there is a need for the skate park to be upgraded. These infrastructure projects are really important and I will advocate every day until they are delivered.
