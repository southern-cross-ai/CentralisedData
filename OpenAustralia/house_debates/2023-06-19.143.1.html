        I'd like to congratulate the Muswellbrook Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who recently held their business awards ceremony. The awards celebrate Muswellbrook's wonderful businesses and individuals and recognise the amazing food, products and services that they provide for the Muswellbrook community. Muswellbrook is a small town, but it's packed with amazing businesses that would show up any others in the country.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ekulpoint took out the category Excellence in Microbusiness for their incredible work in helping people map their memories. A Corp. Computers won the Excellence in

        award. This was followed up by Warrior Disability Services, which was a highly commended small business. Small businesses are so important, especially in smaller towns like Muswellbrook, so well done to A Corp. Computers and Warrior Disability Services for leading the way.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Royal Hotel Muswellbrook took home the award Excellence in Large Business. I was at this wonderful establishment not too long ago. Let me tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, it has everything a great pub needsâ€”good food and cold beer! I can see why they won this award. Blackrock Industries were highly commended in this category. Well done to Steve Fordham, who does so much for his community and for

        in general. Good on you, mate.

       <p>
        It's always great to see new local businesses popping up. So congratulations to Muswellbrook Laundrette for winning the Outstanding New Member category.
       </p>
       <p>
        Local radio is important in communities like Muswellbrook. I also enjoy listening to the local radio station, Hunter Valley AM 981, 2NM, as I drive around the electorate. Their recognition in winning the Making Muswellbrook award is well deserved. Congratulations to the team!
       </p>
       <p>
        Tourism is an area that is always growing in the Hunter. That's because of businesses like Hunter Belle Cheese Room, which won the category Excellence in Tourism. Highly commended was

        's By The Lake. Congratulations to Hunter Belle, which also took out the top prize for Business of the Year. I cannot wait to come and try some more cheese again soon.

        Upper Hunter Conservatorium of Music won Outstanding Community Organisation, with Richard Gill School being highly commended.
