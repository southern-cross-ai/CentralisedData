        It's great to be back in Canberra again, although I'm not so certain about the weather, after the beautiful winter weather we've had in Queensland over the last six weeks. We get to come back down here and recommence our discussions about how best to move the country forward. I am sure all of us here would rather be out in our electorates and speaking with our communities than here in Canberra, because back in our electorates and in our homes we are able to reconnect with and better understand the concerns of everyday Australians. I would like to think that over the past few weeks I've had that opportunity in a range of areas, whether it be at the local footy club, the

        , coffee meetings or mobile offices. It's been great to be out in our local community, finding out what their thoughts and concerns are.
       </p>
       <p>
        Once again, one of the big issues they've constantly raised with me is safety and security in our communities. I am pleased to say that the community has welcomed our announcement recently of the confirmation of another seven federally funded

        cameras, which, once installed, will bring Logan City Council's surveillance camera network to over 250. This investment of some $525,000 was delivered and will provide for a mobile surveillance camera in the region as well as fixed cameras. This efficient modern technology enables our authorities to quickly and efficiently deal with issues as they arise. Not only that, if there are incidents in the community, this CCTV network has been very useful in solving crime. The residents, the local council and the police have all expressed just how valuable this investment is for the area and how much of a difference it makes knowing that safety and crime prevention remains a top priority for every level in our region.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've also learned how our community will continue to go above and beyond for a good cause, even when that means braving a freezing cold winter's morning in Queensland—that means single digits but not minus—getting dressed in lycra and riding kilometres on a bicycle. I am sure that's an image many would be impressed with. I was so inspired that I finally decided to join them and, with an enthusiastic crew, do the Tour de Logan. What a great event, run by our dedicated Loganholme and Beenleigh Rotary clubs.
