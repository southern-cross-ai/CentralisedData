        I rise to honour the life of an extraordinary woman. Patricia Gould, from Albury, died aged 87 years 10 days ago. There are not many people who spend their final days living directly opposite a green space and family playground named in their honour.
       </p>
       <p>
        Patricia, or Pat, was awarded an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        in 2004 among a range of honours during 43 years of service to local government. By then, she hadn't even finished as one of Australia's longest serving female councillors, including seven terms as mayor, before retiring in 2016.
       </p>
       <p>
        But Pat was much more than accumulating plaques and milestones. At her heart, she was a caring wife to husband, Noel, and mother to five sons. As the family grew and left the nest, by her own recollection, Pat would eventually assist no fewer than 73 community groups and organisations. Among her proudest accomplishments was establishing Albury's Family Day Care program and the inception of the Upper Murray Regional Library.
       </p>
       <p>
        Through her life, Pat had an unwavering affection and devotion to both her city and her family, delivered with poise and decency. Kylie King, Albury's current mayor, had this tribute:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our beautiful city would simply not be what it is today without Patricia's leadership, determination and forward thinking, and we as a community have much to be thankful for.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leaving behind her children and their wives, nine grandchildren and a great-grandson, Patricia Gould's funeral will be held in Albury tomorrow. May she rest in peace.
