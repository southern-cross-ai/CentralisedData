        I would like to acknowledge the life of a great Australian, Jason
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Watts" rel="nofollow">
         William Watts
        </a>
        —a really great bloke. He is being farewelled right now in Melbourne. Jason and I met when we joined the Army together. We went to the Defence Force Academy and the

        </a>
        . He has always been known as a loyal, kind, professional, thorough, non-judgemental bloke—a wonderful dad, a wonderful husband, a wonderful son. He loved cricket and footy. He was an outstanding sportsman, but he was humble and grounded. He loved his mates and was always there for his mates. Most of all he loved his family. Wattsy, you fought the good fight and ran a great race. Rest in peace.

        Jason Watts died of leukemia last week. He joins his wife, Jules, who was struck down by breast cancer in March this year. Jason and Jules are survived by their sons Connor, 13, and Dylan, 10, who have been embraced by the families and Jason and Jules's mates. If anyone wants to make a contribution to the boys' future, maybe a fundraising auction item, please go to www.wattsonourmind.com. Jason William Watts—what a great bloke.
