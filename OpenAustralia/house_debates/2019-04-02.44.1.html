       <p>
        The choice that faces small-business owners in Fisher in May is stark. On one hand, they have a Liberal-National coalition government which has cut their business taxes and will cut them further, has extended their instant asset write-off and has reduced their red tape by nearly $6 billion. We've introduced 20-day payment terms on government contracts and created billions of dollars of new export opportunities through free trade agreements. On the other hand, they have a Labor Party which wants to increase company taxes, introduce a 30 per cent tax grab on discretionary trusts, send energy bills skyrocketing with their extremist ideology, increase penalty rates and leave small businesses vulnerable to $8 billion dollars in holiday back pay for casual workers who've already received their extra loading. It is a choice between a Liberal-National government that is delivering our first budget surplus in 12 years, has created 1.2 million new jobs and has the second-fastest growing economy in the G20 or an economy-destroying Labor Party more interested in placating the unions and the Greens than in increasing prosperity for all of us. Small and family businesses are the backbone of this country and the lifeblood of my local community.
