       <p>
        I wish to share an experience that I and many others have had with Canberra Cabs here in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        . It is now on a voice activated service and the conversation with the computer goes like this:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Welcome to Canberra Cabs. Please give the full address, including street number, street and your suburb.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you say ‘
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        ’ it says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Sorry—I cannot understand that.
       </p>
       <p>
        So you say ‘House of Representatives, Parliament House’ and it says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Sorry—I cannot understand that.
       </p>
       <p>
        You repeat ‘House of Representatives, Parliament House’ and it says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Is that 8
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_Square" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament Square
        </a>
        , Parkes?
       </p>
       <p>
        You say ‘No’ and it says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Do you know the address?
       </p>
       <p>
        You say ‘Yes’ and it says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Please tell me.
       </p>
       <p>
        You say, ‘House of Representatives, Parliament House’. It answers:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We have your address as 150 Sanders Place,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGregor" rel="nofollow">
         McGregor
        </a>
        . Is this correct?
       </p>
       <p>
        You say, ‘No.’ And so it goes on until it identifies places such as 1,000 Riverband Rd Wallaroo. There is no Wallaroo in the ACT. There is one in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        , one in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        and one in Queensland. I hope not too many cabs have been dispatched to Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. I have had the experience of the voice-activated machine hanging up on me, so that is a bit worrying. I have complained in a letter to Canberra Cabs. They have said that overall the implementation has been successful and that they are in the process of entering 1,000 buildings into the system. I hope they get around to entering Parliament House. If this were not so serious it would be hilarious. Drivers are unhappy, but I am most concerned for our elderly residents who will not be able to use this system and who will find themselves isolated, very often in a cold Canberra winter. This outfit is operating like a monopolist. Lift your game, Canberra Cabs, and stop operating and behaving like a monopoly.
