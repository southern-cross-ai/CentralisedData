        Raise our Voice Australia asked young people to speak up about something that matters to them so their voices could be heard at the highest level. I received a speech from 12-year-old Twaha Noor who attends Richmond High and the agricultural centre of excellence. It's on something important to many people in my electorate of Macquarie—gender equality. I'd like to read it so Twaha's young voice can be heard loud and clear by everyone in this place. She writes:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        "What is your definition of gender equality?"
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Well mine is having equal rights and the same opportunities no matter what gender you are.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am a girl and I have faced multiple setbacks in life just because of my gender. At a young age, different people have told me that I can't do specific things because I am a girl. I've realised that this sort of discrimination can happen anywhere. Work, school, anywhere you name.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My experiences are proof that gender inequality starts at a young age, meaning it has a profound influence on how you experience and approach life. When doing group work in primary school, my confidence and sincere efforts often meant I was being called "bossy" and "selfish". However, when a boy took the lead, people thanked and respected them. In saying this, I want people to understand that it's not their fault this happens – it's a disturbing societal problem where people are treated differently for reasons they cannot control.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you, Twaha, and the nearly other 30 young people who raised their voice.
