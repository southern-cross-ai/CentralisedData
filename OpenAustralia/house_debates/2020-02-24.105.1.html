        My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister outline to the House how the Morrison government's policies and clear and balanced plans are providing certainty for Australian families and businesses, both now and into the future? How does this compare against the risk of alternative approaches?

         I thank the member for Goldstein for his question, and I commend him on his excellent piece in the weekend press. Our government, as I just said, is getting on with the job of delivering on the commitments that we made that have been able to be delivered because of the strong financial stewardship of this government, which means we can invest in the things that make a big difference to Australians.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are getting on with the job of putting people into jobs. We've seen more Australians get into jobs. We've seen more than 1.5 million people come into jobs, and we've pledged to make another 1.25 million over the next five years.
        </p>
        <p>
         We're getting Australians into their first homes, as we promised they would do. I was with the member for Deakin just last week, as we saw more and more people come through the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme and get access to their first home.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are putting money back into the pockets of Australians, as we promised, with the tax cuts that we delivered and legislated. And that legislated plan delivers more tax relief in the future. We are delivering the infrastructure that we promised to deliver and that has been the discussion point today in question time. We are standing by our farmers and our graziers when it comes to drought and when it comes to flood. It's a year since those terrible floods up in

         </a>
         , and we continue to stand by them. We are standing by the small business owners, with lower taxes and less paperwork and ensuring they are getting paid on time, as we promised and said we would do. We're increasing the incentives to get apprentices on the tools in those small businesses, building the future skills capabilities of our country in the sectors and the industries that need them, particularly in our defence industries. We're keeping Australians safe, as we promised we would do. Through our investments in defence, through our investments in border protection, through our investments in border protection, through our investments in law enforcement and counterterrorism efforts, we are keeping Australians safe. We're expanding our trade borders to ensure that we create more jobs. We are protecting our environment with new initiatives on waste management and on reducing emissions without increasing taxes, as we said we would do.
        </p>
        <p>
         Those opposite have a different plan for this country, and the cat was belled on the weekend. Their no-plan—zero assessment, zero costing—of a policy of apparently having zero emissions in 2050 demonstrates the zero ideas the Leader of the Opposition has, proving that he is today the same 'bill Australia couldn't afford' as the previous Leader of the Opposition was. That reckless commitment to their un-costed 2050 target betrays something very important. It betrays that the Labor Party is disconnected from the aspirations of Australians and is hardwired to the shouty voices who sneer at the livelihoods and the jobs of Australians in our suburbs and in rural and regional Australia. They're disconnected from that.
