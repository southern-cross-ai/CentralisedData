       <p>
        I've got great news for the House. This government's tripling of the bulk-billing incentive has made a profound change in my electorate of Bendigo. I can proudly say that 18 of the 20 medical centres surveyed in my electorate are now bulk-billing at least one of the eligible groups. In fact, 50 per cent said that they are now bulk-billing everybody that comes through their door. This is an exciting day for usâ€”that we have been able to turn around bulk-billing in my electorate. They said that the incentive was a direct measure that saw more

        s choosing to bulk-bill, and they are so relieved that they don't have to have those awkward conversations with patients who are seeking care when they need it.
       </p>
       <p>
        What I'm also excited about is that the clinics who continued to bulk-bill, despite those opposite freezing the incentive and the rebate for so long, are now being paid what they should be paid for bulk-billing their patients. I am so excited to see the clinics in my electorate embracing bulk-billing and to see it restored. We have even seen some of the old bulk-billing signs pulled out and put out the front, encouraging people to see their GP because the clinic will now bulk-bill. This is just the beginning of what we are doing to restore Medicare and rebuild bulk-billing in our electorates.
