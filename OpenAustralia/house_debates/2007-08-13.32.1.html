       <p>
        I want to briefly refer to the technology known as radiowave therapy. This originated largely through the research of Dr John Holt. Under standing order 43, I would like to present to the House a petition from around 1,735 of my constituents and people from outside my electorate in relation to this therapy. They have signed a petition drawing attention to the need for research into radiowave therapy as a treatment for diseases, in particular cancer; asking for not less than $100,000 for research and requesting that the Medicare rebate be reinstated for radiowave treatment. This treatment is strongly believed by many to be highly effective in the treatment of cancer. Certainly anecdotally the evidence suggests that Dr John Holt has achieved some considerable success with it. It is important to note that serious clinical work is being undertaken by the Radiowave Therapy Research Institute, which is privately funded and based in Perth. I would like to table this petition, as I understand is permissible under the by-laws pertaining to this place, and to encourage people to take note of the potential of this new technology and the hope it may offer many. I hereby present the petition.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The petition read as followsâ€”
