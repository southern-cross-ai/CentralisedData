        I rise to speak about the Building Better Regions Fund, a fund that focuses on creating jobs, driving economic growth and building stronger regional communities into the future. Recently we had announcements from the minister, the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiona_Nash" rel="nofollow">
         Fiona Nash
        </a>
        , regarding the first round of the BBRF program. The minister tells me that she was blown away by the level of enthusiasm shown by applicants. Nearly 550 organisations from across Australia made an application to the infrastructure stream.
       </p>
       <p>
        Barker is a truly committed community, focused on working towards a better future. They're hardworking, dedicated constituents who volunteer their time. This is the main reason so many applications in Barker were successful. Speaking of this success, let me turn to the first of such successful applications. It was the Riverland Exhibition Centre, for a $400,000 contribution towards a new presentation pavilion that will provide an air-conditioned and acoustically finished auditorium for 300. It will come with the usual multifunction kitchen for cooking demonstrations, catering support and the like. It will leverage the existing facility of the Riverland Exhibition Centre to expand its use and attract new events. I give high praise to Tim Grieger and his hardworking committee of volunteers for submitting such a worthy application.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second such successful application dealt with the Murray River Maritime Trail, for a $400,000 or so contribution towards the trail. It will see upgraded landing facilities at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_Reach" rel="nofollow">
         Swan Reach
        </a>
        , at Nildottie and at Mannum. Each of these upgrades will allow these river towns to access additional tourism as people spend time in the town after using the infrastructure and getting off the very many historical paddle-steamers that traverse the river.
       </p>
       <p>
        The third such successful application was a $400,000 contribution to the new Bordertown racing community centre, which will see the provision of a new two-storey racing and community centre and increased use of the racing club site both for racing and community activities, providing community integration and helping to avoid isolation. This will drive greater economic growth—12 full-time equivalents in the construction phase and eight full-time equivalents ongoing. The Bordertown Racing Club's Max Fryar and secretary and manager Sonya Lodewyk are to be congratulated, as is Frank Mastrangelo, who did all the design work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another successful application—my personal favourite—is a second home for Ryder-Cheshire in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Gambier" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Gambier
        </a>
        , at a cost of $530,000, from the federal government. The construction of a second Ryder-Cheshire home in Mount Gambier will provide assisted accommodation for five adults with physical or intellectual disabilities, allowing them to have 24/7 care. I'm particularly proud of this application, because they made numerous attempts to get this far. They took on the feedback and presented a better and better application each time. Praise must be given to all the hardworking volunteers and board members of Ryder-Cheshire, including president Neville Gilbertson. A special mention also goes to Jerry Leech, who put in an enormous amount of work on the plan and the application itself. Not a week went by that Jerry wasn't in contact with my office about the application.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Mount Gambier all-weather track attracted a funding grant of $1.5 million. This will see the Mount Gambier thoroughbred horseracing track rebuilt. The new track will ensure consistent conditions and safety for participants and will allow additional race meetings to be scheduled. There will be 12 full-time equivalents in construction and 24 during operation. Sadly, the Mount Gambier track has been beleaguered with a string of race meeting cancellations in recent years due to heavy downpours. Congratulations to Nick Redin from Thoroughbred Racing

        and John Fartch and his hardworking committee at the racing club.
       </p>

        And finally, probably the jewel in the crown, is a $4.5 million contribution to a new multicommunity and sporting facility at Loxton. This much-needed and longed-for sporting facility was heralded by the community. I can't do it justice, I'll leave it to Mayor Leon Stasinowsky, who, on receiving the advice of this grant, said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is a milestone in the tireless efforts of the community stakeholder reps, elected members and staff who have again demonstrated the spirit and generosity within our community and their willingness to work and unite behind a common goal, resulting in a positive and a great outcome for the Loxton community.
       </p>
       <p>
        This outcome sees $4.5 million of federal grant funds go towards a $12 million project. It is a great outcome.
