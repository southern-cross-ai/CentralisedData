       <p>
        I am pleased to come into the parliament today to speak about the direct impact that federal government assistance is having on Whyalla steelmaker Arrium in my electorate. I am pleased to advise that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Knob" rel="nofollow">
         Iron Knob
        </a>
        mining area work is underway, which is the installation of a new beneficiation plant—or a wash plant—which will enable Arrium to accelerate the processing of low-grade iron ore and to enrich it at both the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Baron" rel="nofollow">
         Iron Baron
        </a>
        and Iron Knob mining areas. The purchase of these plants was made possible by the coalition government delivering on its election commitment and providing a loan of $49.2 million. Most pleasingly, I must say, is that $25 million of the $49.2 million has been invested with local contractors, including for the electrical and mechanical work, crane hire and earthworks. That is a real shot in the arm for Whyalla, and very welcome. Minister Hunt has continued to pursue good outcomes for Arrium. At the moment we are working with four potential buyers. The money that the federal government has invested goes toward not only the beneficiation plan, but the 70,000 tonnes of rail that has been ordered by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARTC" rel="nofollow">
         ARTC
        </a>
        being installed at the moment, generating a further 60 jobs in the installation of that rail. This is all adding to the momentum that government can supply in this space. As we talk to the potential buyers, we are also looking at different areas that the federal government may be able to assist to make the operation more profitable.
