       <p>
        The electorate of Murray is well known for its highly successful horse breeding. We have some of the best thoroughbred stables in Victoria, and Nagambie is the home of champion

        . Black Caviar was born in 2006 at Nagambie, on the great

        . We have great young and mature-age people involved at all levels in the industry, as well as with horse eventing and pony clubs.

       <p>
        I want to congratulate 22-year-old Anna Parry, from Powlett Plains in the south-west of my electorate, who was part of the successful three-rider team that won a silver medal at the Pony Club Australia National Championships held recently in

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Anna Parry has been riding since she was four and competing at show events since she was nine.
       </p>
       <p>
        Victoria was crowned overall champion for its performance across all disciplines. This is particularly commendable since there were only three riders from Victoria and they had to be placegetters in every event.
       </p>
       <p>
        All sports require dedicated volunteers, and I want to congratulate Frances Corry from Nathalia, who has given years of voluntary service to pony clubbing in Nathalia and across the whole state. Frances has been secretary-treasurer of the northern zone pony club region since 1967. This region stretches from Mildura to Cobram and is the largest zone in the state. Frances has also served at all levels of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pony_Club_Association_of_Victoria" rel="nofollow">
         Pony Club Association of Victoria
        </a>
        . As well as working in administration, Frances is a rider herself and has been an instructor since 1961â€”a truly amazing effort. She has made a significant contribution, and I commend Frances and all of those who enjoy horse riding in my part of the world.
