        This is a government with no standards and no shame. They've engaged in maladministration. They've engaged in rorting, and it's all with the express purpose of electing people to this place who should not be here.

It has the taint of illegitimacy over it, the taint of complete illegitimacy over it. This behaviour is obscene banana-republic style behaviour. If you heard about it happening in another country there'd be a lot of tut-tutting from those opposite. We know that they've engaged in match fixing. We know that they've engaged in cheating.
