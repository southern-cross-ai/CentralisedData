        One of the most significant public debates occurring in Australia at present does not relate to the carbon tax, the mining tax or, indeed, offshore protection. It is around improving the lives of the more than 750,000 Australians who live with a disability and their family and friends who often fill the critical role of being carers and principal points of support.
       </p>
       <p>
        Driven by the advocacy of many in the disabilities sector, including one of my constituents and friends, Bruce Bonyheady, Chairman of Yooralla, and aided by a comprehensive review by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Productivity Commission
        </a>
        , we are moving towards a national disability insurance scheme to ensure better resourcing for those in need and better coordination and application of services across state boundaries. This is a most welcome reform for what is a broken system. I am delighted the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">

        has bipartisan support, which we in this place must all work hard to ensure continues.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another area affecting those with disabilities that is often raised with me relates to the funding and quality of education services available to children with a disability, be it a profound physical and intellectual disability or children with high-functioning autism and Asperger's syndrome. At a Kooyong community forum I recently held at Our Holy Redeemer Parish Hall in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrey_Hills" rel="nofollow">
         Surrey Hills
        </a>
        , a constituent raised the case of his 10-year-old grandson who has a primary diagnosis of Asperger's syndrome and comorbidities of a chronic tic disorder and motor dyspraxia. The child's schooling experience has been varied, with his original local primary school having a negative impact on him while his current primary school is far better suited. What concerns the parents is that when the child is ready to move on to secondary school there are limited options available in Victoria where a modified social and academic model of education can be provided.
       </p>
       <p>
        This does not seem to be the case in other states such as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        ,

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        where I am advised access to disability support funding at both primary and secondary levels is more attainable for children diagnosed with high-functioning autism or Asperger's syndrome. Having such disparities in opportunities for children with disabilities not only is fundamentally inequitable and unfair but goes against the recommendations of a key body like the Australian Advisory Board on Autism Spectrum Disorders, which has its first principle:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Every child and adolescent with an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASD" rel="nofollow">
         ASD
        </a>
        has access to an educational service appropriate to his/her needs.
       </p>
       <p>
        The board's position paper, released in April of last year, suggested there is an estimated 10,625 children aged between six and 12 years with autism spectrum disorder. It said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Levels of funding support and educational service provision vary greatly from state to state.
       </p>
       <p>
        It went on to say:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Currently, many students with an ASD in Australia are not receiving the appropriate educational support and services they require to meet their diverse learning needs.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are positive initiatives being undertaken, like the $190 million four-year Helping Children with Autism initiative which increases access to early intervention for children up to six years old through professional development for teachers and staff to build greater understanding and expertise in working with children with ASD.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this respect, I am very pleased that the coalition took to the last election a comprehensive policy to provide students and their families with portable funding through an education card for children with disabilities worth up to $20,000 per year and indexed to inflation. To be used at an educational institution of choice, this was a $314 million commitment designed to help up to 6,000 students with a disability. In implementing the card it will be critical to work at ministerial council level to reach a national agreement on the definition of 'disability'. This will provide for greater consistency and certainty for parents, students, teachers and other relevant stakeholders. It is expected that, initially, use of the card would be provided to those with more profound disabilities, but, as the federal budgetary position improves, it could be rolled out to all students with a disability, including those with autism and Asperger's syndrome. We have also announced positive initiatives around the education tax rebate to include education costs for children with disabilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I finish where I started. The bipartisan commitment to a national disability insurance scheme is a significant positive development for those with disabilities, but more needs to be done around the provision of educational services for children with autism and Asperger's syndrome. The current situation varies too greatly between states. The coalition has made some very positive announcements and I hope they become bipartisan in the not too distant future.
