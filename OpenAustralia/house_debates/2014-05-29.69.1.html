        Madam Speaker, my question is to the Minister for Health. I remind the Minister for Health that a Medicare co-payment was introduced in 1991 by the Hawke government, and I ask: is the minister aware of advice received by the Hawke government at the time, and is that advice still relevant to the challenges faced by the health system today?

         I thank the member for Casey for his question. The problem in the 1990s with Medicare, as Prime Minister Hawke pointed out, was that it was unsustainable without a co-payment, and that is why Labor supported a co-payment when it came to our medicine scheme. We have a co-payment there to make our medicine system sustainable and we are arguing, as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hawke" rel="nofollow">
          Bob Hawke
         </a>
         did then, that we need a co-payment to make our system sustainable going forward. I want to get a better understanding of why there was common sense in the Labor Party then, but there is not now except of course for the member for Fraser, who is supportive of a co-payment as well, but I will come back to him in a second.

          <p>
           Why would the Labor Party be so sound in their policy thinking, why would they want to support a sustainable Medicare system in the 1990s but in 2014 the Leader of the Opposition is opportunistic and does not want to support a sustainable Medicare? Obviously it is because of the people that were around at the time. I looked to the then Minister for Health,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Howe" rel="nofollow">
            Brian Howe
           </a>
           . He had to say this in 1991 when the Labor Party believed in something and they produced a co-payment to keep any care sustainable. He said:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           It was to enact a number of changes designed to ensure that Medicare remains a sustainable, equitable and efficient universal health insurance system.
          </p>
          <p>
           They were wise words from the then Labor health minister. But where would he have got his advice? I had a look at some of the comments that he had to make and he said at the time:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           The measures being introduced in this budget related to the preliminary findings of the National Health Strategy.
          </p>
          <p>
           The 'National Health Strategy'? I thought: who put that piece of work together? Who put those wise words together? If you have a look at the member for Jagajaga's website, she is happy to skite that:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Prior to entering parliament, Jenny was the director of two major strategic reviews reporting to Brian Howe, including the National Health Strategy.
          </p>
          <p>
           I thought: let me seek further confirmation.

                  Brian Howe
                 </a>
                 . It says, 'For further information about the advice â€¦'â€”to the then governmentâ€”'in relation to the co-payment, contact Jenny Macklin, the director of the National Health Strategy.' All I ask is that common sense prevails in the modern Labor Party. If Jenny Macklin was the mother of the co-payment and
