       <p>
        Late last year I was honoured to attend Marine Rescue
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norah_Head" rel="nofollow">
         Norah Head
        </a>
        to present a 15-year Service Medal to Bill Hignett, Coxwain Certificate to Fiona Perram, and a Marine Rescue Leading Crew Certificate to Peter Langdon.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bill has had a long and distinguished history of service to the public. He joined the army at the age of 17, served as a paramedic from 1974 and, in 1987, he was awarded honorary life membership in the order of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John_Ambulance" rel="nofollow">
         St John Ambulance
        </a>
        . He has been captain and president of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        Rural Fire Service. He joined Marine Rescue New South Wales at Norah Head in 2013. He is a rated radio operator and is completing his watch officer rating. He is the Norah Head fundraising officer and communication centre manager. The recognition of his service is certainly well deserved.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fiona Perram received a Coxswain Certificate. She is the first-ever female coxswain of the Norah Head unitâ€”quite an achievement. She has spent much of her life on boats, both in Australia and abroad, and is thoroughly enjoying being a skipper with Marine Rescue.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations to Bill, Fiona and Peter on their fantastic accomplishments with Marine Rescue. Their contribution, and those of their fellow volunteers at Norah Head, is helping our boating community stay safe on the water this summer. Congratulations to all our Marine Rescue people throughout Dobell and the
