       <p class="italic">
        (d) the overall security situation in Sudan is deteriorating at an alarming rate, having severe humanitarian consequences with millions of civilians in both North and South Sudan in need of protection and critical humanitarian assistance;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) Sudan, after Zimbabwe, is the second largest recipient of Australia's humanitarian and development assistance in Africa—since 2004, the Australian Government has provided $136 million to Sudan;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) the North/South Comprehensive Peace Agreement signed in 2005 that ended over two decades of civil war is at risk, due to recent violence, with outstanding issues such as border demarcation, oil revenue sharing, currency and citizenship status, unresolved;

        (b) insecurity and inaccessibility remain amongst the biggest challenges facing the delivery of assistance by humanitarian agencies to vulnerable populations;

        That this House:

        (1) affirms its strong support for all forms of early childhood learning and recognises the importance of pre-school on the development of children and as a foundation for their future education;

         Gillard Government

        (3) notes that the Gillard Government has not considered the consequences of its 'Universal Access' policy on Victorian kindergartens where 'three-year-old kindergarten' is more commonly offered than by other jurisdictions;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) notes that the consequence of 'Universal Access' on Victoria's kindergartens is that many will no longer be able to offer 'three-year-old kindergarten' programs because facilities are often shared between three and 'four-year-old kindergarten' programs;
       </p>

        (5) acknowledges that this policy will effectively remove the choice for many Victorian parents of sending their three-year-old children to kindergarten;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (6) notes that some rural kindergartens could face the risk of closure because there is a shortage of qualified teachers in rural areas, and due to the increase in mandated hours, many rural kindergartens will no longer be able to share teachers;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (7) notes that warnings of this imminent crisis for Victoria's kindergartens have been given directly to the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth by the Municipal Association of Victoria, parent groups, kindergarten operators and parliamentarians; and
