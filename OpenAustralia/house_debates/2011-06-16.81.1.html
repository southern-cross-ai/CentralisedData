        I rise to speak about sarcoma cancer and the work of the Hannah's Chance Foundation
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        Committee, specifically the work done to raise awareness of sarcoma cancer since the untimely death of swimming legend Tracey Wickham's daughter Hannah Ciobo in 2007. For those unacquainted with Hannah's story, Hannah was only 19 years old when she lost her battle with sarcoma. Like many young women, Hannah was a young, vibrant schoolgirl. She was a sister, a daughter and, for a very short time, a wife. She met the love of her life Tom O'Driscoll when they both received treatment for similar conditions. Tom and Hannah were engaged, planning the rest of their lives together, but when Hannah's condition deteriorated a wedding ceremony was hurriedly held at her bedside. Hannah was a wife for three hours before the sarcoma cancer took her life.
       </p>
       <p>
        More than 1,000 people in Australia are diagnosed with sarcoma each year. Sarcoma predominately affects young people between 12 and 25 years of age and makes up to 25 per cent of the total cancers in children. There are close to 100 varieties of sarcoma, making up three per cent of all cancers, including bone, muscle, blood, lymph vessel, nerve tissue and fat tissue sarcomas. The cancer is very aggressive, killing two in five patients. The role of Hannah's Chance Foundation is to support patients and their families, and to raise much needed funds to assist in finding a cure. The foundation has been establishing a band of supporters all around Australia to ensure increased awareness throughout the community. Each year, Hannah's Chance Foundation takes part in the International Sarcoma Awareness Week. Last year, more than 21,000 participants from around the globe participated in the initiative, raising more than $640,000. Locally, the Gold Coast committee worked tirelessly over three separate events raising $35,000. I would like to commend the efforts of the Gold Coast committee's Leigh Webb, Karen Erskine, Carmen Thompson, Aideen Quigley, Nadine Delahunty and Angela Morris. Without the dedication of these women, the success of last year's fundraising events would not have been possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year, the committee has been busy organising events to be held on the southern Gold Coast between 13 and 24 July. The first event will be the 3rd annual Butterfly Dinner Dance, which is sold out. It will be held in the Twin Towns Showroom, on the border of Queensland and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        —most likely, the largest charity ball ever held on the southern Gold Coast. I welcome this event as an opportunity to promote and create awareness for Hannah's Chance within the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McPherson" rel="nofollow">
         McPherson
        </a>
        electorate. The support from local businesses for this event and for this cause has been overwhelming.
       </p>
       <p>
        To date more than 30 businesses have helped sponsor the event. I would like to commend the consistent efforts over the last three years by Gary McNeill from Formula Energy, Mark Goody from Camping World Currumbin and Sharon and Rick Gobain from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Beach" rel="nofollow">

        pool shop. I would also like to acknowledge a local Currumbin jeweller, Rex Horsley, for his generous donation of a $6,500 diamond necklace, which will be raffled off. In addition to the Butterfly Dinner Dance, the Gold Coast committee for Hannah's Chance are holding the 3rd annual Sarcoma Surf Tag Team Challenge at Palm Beach—again, within the McPherson electorate. Last year, the event drew international media coverage for sarcoma awareness and, of course, it creates great opportunities for the Gold Coast to be showcased around the world.
       </p>

        Sarcoma survivor and former Australian pro-surfer, Richie Lovett, is a Hannah's Chance ambassador. Richie underwent a full hip replacement as part of his battle against sarcoma. His inspirational story has inspired many young sarcoma sufferers, including local Elanora high school student, Corey Webb. Like Richie, Corey shares a passion for surfing. Corey was an upcoming surf life saving champion at the Palm Beach Surf Life Saving Club before being diagnosed in January last year. He was just 14 at the time and the diagnosis came as an additional shock to the family, with Corey's father, Tony, already battling sarcoma tumours. After intensive chemotherapy, Corey is in rehabilitation, getting back into his love for surfing and is completing year 11 at high school. Corey's mother and Tony's wife, Leigh Webb, has been a wonderful support for the boys and has spent many hours planning and organising events for the Gold Cost committee of Hannah's Chance Foundation.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to conclude by commending the efforts of those directly involved with the Hannah's Chance Foundation and extend my sympathy to the many young sufferers battling life with sarcoma. I encourage the public and ask for their support for this not-for-profit organisation so that, collectively, a cure can be discovered.
