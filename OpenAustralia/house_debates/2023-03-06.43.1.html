        It's been great to meet with local sporting clubs over the last two weeks to see the upgrades to their facilities.

        , who is the coach and manager of the Southern Districts competition, to discuss the Albanese government's election commitment for upgrades to this ground.

        I also caught up with Kemps Creek United Soccer Club's Ross and Michael, who showed me the difference the Stronger Communities grant had made. They've put in special synthetic turf, which this season will make the goal mouth more playable.

        , for the invitation to attend this year's competition launch. On the night, it was a delight to hear the clubs' positive stories from last year and their goals for the 2023 season. The competition has over 10,000 players aged from five to over 55, with girls, boys, women and men playing this year. Most clubs report significant increases in players, especially in the women's competition.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's lovely to see all of our communities come together to support our local teams, and I hope that this year they'll see an even greater turnout. I look forward to following the success of all our soccer teams this year.
