        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to reports that the asylum seekers from the

        will be separated from other inmates at the

         Tanjung Pinang
        </a>
        detention centre because of growing resentment and tension about the preferential treatment of the
        <i>
         Oceanic Viking
        </i>
        asylum seekers. Will the Prime Minister confirm that the new fast-track access policy for some asylum seekers includes special protection in the detention centres?

         One never knows with the member for Murray whether it is going to be an attack from the right or the left—that is, whether we are being too harsh or too soft or the Indonesians are too hard or too soft—and you can do that if you do not have a policy, other than the reintroduction of temporary protection visas, which saw nearly 100 boats arrive after that with nearly 10,000 people.
        </p>
        <p>
         The honourable member’s question goes to the accommodation of asylum seekers in this particular centre. I refer to the arrangements in place for the housing of individuals at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanjung_Pinang" rel="nofollow">
          Tanjung Pinang
         </a>
         detention centre. Could I say in response to the honourable member’s question that I am advised that women and children will be housed in a separate facility adjacent to the Tanjung Pinang detention centre, and that is consistent with responses that we made to questions earlier in question time both this week and probably in previous weeks.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
          Can I
         </a>
         also note in that context that the Indonesian foreign minister has also said, ‘We would want to ensure that the best interests of the child and other vulnerable groups and individuals are properly looked after.’ Could I also refer to the fact that it has been the longstanding practice for Australian governments, past and present, to provide funds for international organisations, such as the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOM" rel="nofollow">
          IOM
         </a>
         , for the refurbishment of detention facilities in Indonesia. So, as far as these individuals are concerned—women and children—of course there are separate and special arrangements being made. But I make the overall point that the accommodation arrangements for asylum seekers are ultimately the responsibility of the Indonesian government.
