        I rise to congratulate and to commend the 10 local community members from Lindsay who were recognised with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        awards this year. 'Rossco' Hutchison is Penrith Citizen of the Year for his work supporting our local performing arts scene. Twenty-four-year-old Mitchell Beggs-Mowczan—apologies for the pronunciation—was named Penrith's Young Citizen of the Year for his important work in local Indigenous health and mentoring and the volunteering that he does outside of his actual job. Leonie Moore was awarded Sportsperson of the Year, following more than 30 years of incredible service to basketball in our community—proving that basketball is life! The Local Hero gong went to Ray Debono, who has donated blood more than 225 times to save the lives of others and has raised more than $100,000 for charity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Four people were also honoured with local appreciation awards, including

        I congratulate and commend each of these people. Each of these proud locals has had their important contributions to our community honoured in these awards. I congratulate them and thank them immensely for their tireless work for our community.
