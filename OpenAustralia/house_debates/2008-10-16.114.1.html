        I want to put on the record my strong opposition to Energex’s proposal to construct above-ground powerlines in my electorate from Mudgeeraba to Tugun. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Energy_Regulator" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Energy Regulator
        </a>
        is responsible for the economic regulation of the wholesale electricity market and electricity transmission networks. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AER" rel="nofollow">
         AER
        </a>
        advised me in writing that Energex is required to meet a regulatory test to assess the efficiency of proposed network investments. The AER letter stated plainly that the buck stops with the Queensland government when it wrote:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Energex is required under the Integrated Planning Act 1997 to seek planning approval for the proposed powerline from the Queensland Minister for Mines and Energy. It is understood that in making this decision the minister is required to consider a range of social, environmental and planning factors.
       </p>
       <p>
        The state government must follow best practice and put these high voltage powerlines underground. The state’s Minister for Mines and Energy has the power to consider social and environmental factors and I urge him to take this matter seriously. Minister Wilson suggested in his press release of 22 August 2008 that $120 million is too much money to spend on quality of life for residents of South-East Queensland. I strongly disagree. The health and safety of our residents and the amenity of our suburbs is priceless. The minister must refuse the application from Energex to put the powerlines overhead.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have very real concerns about the potential negative impacts any above-ground powerlines will have in an already-developed community—from the devaluation of homes to the health and safety of locals and the destruction of the environment. Developed cities around the world as well as public opinion recognise that above-ground cabling is third-world technology. No new developments have above-ground powerlines—so why should existing residences have redundant technology forced upon them? Above-ground powerlines are visually unattractive, unreliable, dangerous and costly. Significantly, above-ground powerlines are at the mercy of the elements. Tropical storms are common on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        and above-ground powerlines can be brought down in storms, causing widespread blackouts, potential dangers to public safety and disruption to local business.
       </p>
       <p>
        Residents are outraged that not only will the amenity of their suburb be ruined by unsightly above-ground powerlines but hundreds of trees will be cut down to make way for these powerlines. The destruction of so many trees must be stopped. Residents of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McPherson" rel="nofollow">
         McPherson
        </a>
        are passionate about their environment and the visual appearance of local streets. The significant environmental, physical, aesthetic, psychological and cultural value of street trees to local residents must not be underestimated. Trees alongside the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific Highway
        </a>
        have enormous aesthetic benefits, improving the streetscapes and adding natural colour, and they attract bird life.
       </p>
       <p>
        This serious issue was first brought to my attention by local residents, who felt they had been sidelined from the consultation process. There was confusion and concern when they realised the proposed route for these powerlines was directly behind their homes—right on their back doorsteps. I commend local residents for forming the community group Stop The Overhead Powerlines and for campaigning hard for an underground route, a comprehensive consultation process and a better deal for future generations. In particular, I want to pay tribute to Mr John Cooper who is chairman of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STOP" rel="nofollow">
         STOP
        </a>
        . He has worked tirelessly on this issue to bring it to the public’s attention and also to garner support from the local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently the shadow minister for the environment, climate change and water, the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Hunt" rel="nofollow">
         Greg Hunt
        </a>
        , visited my electorate of McPherson and together we met with members of STOP and other concerned residents who will be affected by these overhead powerlines. We met residents in a cul-de-sac which is adjacent to the proposed route of the powerlines, and it was extremely concerning to see firsthand just how close to these houses these powerlines are intended to be built. Not only that, we saw firsthand the beautiful and wide tracts of trees that will be destroyed in the construction process.
       </p>
       <p>
        I strongly oppose the delivery of power in a way that is detrimental to the community. The potential devaluation of people’s homes, their lifestyles, the destruction of local environments as well as the health and safety of our communities must be at the forefront of the decision-making process in the delivery of this infrastructure. I hope common sense will prevail in this instance.
