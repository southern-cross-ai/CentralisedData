       <p>
        Congratulations, Madam Deputy Speaker Claydon. I would like to raise an impressive initiative that I'm proud to have operating in my electorate of Warringah. I was delighted to meet with a group of incredible young adults from Head High Disability Service's skill share this week. Head High provides an opportunity for young people living with disability to meet, connect and collaborate as they develop new skills. Through regular meet-ups, this education initiative for 17- to 26-year-olds equips participants with important skills and experience that strengthen their employment and social opportunities. It was wonderful hearing of the work experience that they have individually undertaken in our local area. I wish to acknowledge the work and dedication of Julie Ross-Edwards and the Head High team for their incredible devotion to a cause so often overlooked. It's so important that every member of our local disability community is visible, included and valued, and Head High's skill share services have taken impressive steps to ensure everybody is equipped to live to their fullest potential. I very much look forward to meeting with further groups within Warringah that are doing that really important work of ensuring people and constituents living with disabilities have the opportunity to contribute to the fullest of their capacity. We need to make sure all Australians are visible and valued in our community.
