        Pieter Rudolph Zeeman, known to most as 'Rudy', has led a remarkable lifeâ€”one that is worth noting here today. Born in Holland on 10 November 1919, Rudy was just shy of 21 when Germany invaded the Netherlands in May 1940. At the time Rudy was undertaking his mandated national service, and when his country surrendered after just four days of conflict he was determined to get out. After acquiring German papers from the Underground, Mr Zeeman and a friend managed to make it to Paris through what was known as the Dutch-Paris escape line. He was apprehended by German officers, one who didn't believe his German papers were genuine. Fortunately those German officers got lost, and Rudy jumped out of the car and escaped. Walking through the Pyrenees in the middle of winter, he eventually found his way into Spain and then on to Portugal and Gibraltar, where he travelled with British troops back to the

        before heading to America on board the

        . Rudy's life took another unexpected turn when he came to Australia for the first time to help aid the

        . He trained as a navigator, touring in the wake of MacArthur's campaign, and eventually settled in Northern Tasmania with his wife, Berna. If Rudy's life sounds like it would make a good read, I would encourage you to find a copy of his newly released book,
