       <p>
        It's a privilege to speak on such an important issue that unites this parliament. It's one of the few issues where there is genuine bipartisan support, because people on both sides understand that it takes more than one government and more than one party to be able to put in the complex and far-reaching supports that are needed to ensure people live their lives with a sense of purpose and hope. For some people
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Suicide_Prevention_Day" rel="nofollow">
         World Suicide Prevention Day
        </a>
        is just another day, but for anyone who has lost someone to suicide it is a day of sadness and reflection. I also think it should be a day of hope, and we're working very hard to make that the case.
       </p>
       <p>
        Every year, around 3,000 Australians die by suicide. Nine people, of whom two-thirds are men, die by suicide each day. We know young people are most at risk, with suicide remaining the leading cause of death for Australians between the ages of 15 and 44.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        Australians are twice as likely to die by suicide as non-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous Australians
        </a>
        . That reality is absolutely front of mind for me when I think about why we need an Aboriginal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        Voice. Our best chances of changing that statistic, of keeping people alive, of overcoming the distress of intergenerational trauma and disadvantage faced by First Nations peoples, is through listening and real action.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm a co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Suicide Prevention, and I note that the member for Berowra, my co-chair, will also be speaking on this topic. I thank him for his support and commitment to seeing change. It's a very good example of true bipartisanship. The two of us came into this place in the same year. I think our class of 2016 brought with it a deep understanding of just how important mental wellbeing is. As co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Suicide Prevention, it was a privilege to be part of the Suicide Prevention Australia breakfast that we held last week. At that breakfast we heard from Justin, a Queenslander, one of the MATES in Construction advocates, who was able to move the room to tears with his extraordinary communication in rap form—slam poetry is probably the best definition, if I'm being accurate here. What it highlighted is how powerful it can be when you have someone speaking from lived experience and how they can reach out and connect with other people. That has been one of the focuses that we have as a government: looking at people who have lived experience and really valuing that experience and recognising the value that that brings in reaching out to others.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, there are many organisations like Suicide Prevention Australia that work tirelessly to spread the word so that there is conversation happening about this. It has helped lift much of the stigma that I think probably a decade ago we would have been talking about, and even in more recent years. But there are many, many organisations that do that. I'm not even going to try and name them all. I do want to talk about one at a very local level in my community, the Hope4U Foundation. Di established this foundation having lost a son to suicide. Tragically, she then lost a second son to suicide. Her mission is to provide support for people who have walked in those shoes.
       </p>
       <p>
        At Richmond Oval, last week, we were joined by many local community services to have conversations with people about their mental wellbeing. This isn't just about their mental health; it's about their connection to their community and their engagement. We heard from Simon Griffin, another young man who, bravely—for the first time in a very public forum—spoke about his own experience of suicide ideation and schizophrenia. I have known Simon for many years, and I'd like it to be on the record that it was a really big step in his journey to be able to do that, which I can say after having had many private conversations with him. He's the dad of two beautiful children, and I know he takes a huge amount of responsibility for shaping how he sees the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, some people are supported well to do that. We need to work with the people for whom that is difficult to do. The Hope4U Foundation is very focused on doing that, particularly with the families of people who have suicided. They have partnered with Glenbernie Family Farms, one of the beautiful flower-growing farms in my electorate, and so Hope4U now has a home within a sunflower farm. I should say, it's not always sunflowers; there are a huge array of flowers there, whatever the season.
       </p>
       <p>
        When we talk about how we translate the big policy stuff we do here, the key thing is how it translates on the ground and how people can access supports. Obviously, we're working hard to make sure that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        s are in a position to provide good supports, by increasing the payments that GPs receive and allowing for longer consultations because they are often the front line. We also know that headspace is a really key frontline preventive and early-intervention service. I am so proud that, by the end of the year, we will have a Hawkesbury headspace up and running. It is 10 years since the Penrith headspace opened, and I was very proud to be at that opening, along with the then mental health minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Butler" rel="nofollow">
         Mark Butler
        </a>
        . A decade ago, I said to him: 'You know what? We really need one of these in the Hawkesbury and one in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains" rel="nofollow">
         Blue Mountains
        </a>
        .'
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Mountains" rel="nofollow">
         The Blue Mountains
        </a>
        headspace, a small one, came online a few years ago, but the Hawkesbury one has been a very long time coming.
       </p>
       <p>
        By the end of the year, we will have a Head To Health service, which is the adult version of headspace. Whereas headspace is for young people up to 25, who can walk in with a 'no wrong door' policy, Head to Health will be the same for adults. Both of them are located in Richmond, and both of them are having works done in the lead-up to their openings. I'll be very proud to be part of those events.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another group I want to touch on is MATES in Construction. I mentioned Justin from MATES in Construction earlier. As we know, getting to the bottom of all these issues is not something that's going to happen only at this level of federal government; everyone has a role. MATES in Construction saw the role for men and women working in the construction industry. Very early on in my community, they were partnered with Woodford Homes and Blue Eco Homes, who started to spread the word and spark those conversations amongst their workers. They're here in the parliament today, asking MPs to sign their flag. Across the country, 100,000 construction and industry workers will fly the flag over the next couple of days. It's a real partnership between unions and employers, working together to tackle mental health and suicide in a way that allows for conversations.
       </p>
       <p>
        We talk a lot about mental health, but I do want to note that 40 per cent of people who suicide have not been diagnosed with a mental health condition. It's a complex thing and, often, a whole range of pressures like financial pressures or housing and security come into play. As a government, we recognise that. On 20 September, the base rates of working-age and student payments, such as youth allowance, parenting payments and JobSeeker, will increase. This, we know, will lift some of the mental burden and financial burden that people carry.
       </p>
       <p>
        This commitment to wanting to see a cross-portfolio approach to tackling suicide and preventing suicide is really key. Whether it's with veterans or victims of domestic violence, these are all the areas where we will continue to work, because, despite increasing expenditure on mental health services and suicide prevention, Australia has not seen a significant decrease in the numbers of lives lost to suicide in more than two decades. So we know we need to do this differently.

        <p>
         I'm pleased to follow my friend the member for Macquarie, who is the co-chair with me of the Parliamentary Friends of Suicide Prevention. I founded the Parliamentary Friends of Suicide Prevention with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Kelly" rel="nofollow">
          Mike Kelly
         </a>
         when I was first elected to this place, and it's had a very good effect on the parliament. It has been a bipartisan forum, as my friend the member for Macquarie said. It's been a place where we can talk, share stories and share lived experience.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to particularly honour the member for Macquarie, who has been very public about her daughter's experience with suicidal ideation and particularly her daughter's bravery in being involved in a series of videos by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SANE" rel="nofollow">
          SANE
         </a>
         Australia that we were able to get some funding for back in, I think, the last parliament or the parliament before, which were called Better off
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_You" rel="nofollow">
          With You
         </a>
         , where prominent Australians told their experiences of attempting suicide and how life is better with them. I want to acknowledge those people and particularly acknowledge my friend the member for Macquarie.
        </p>
        <p>
         The statistics are grim. In many respects, I feel we are failing and we are continuing to fail. When I came to this place, eight Australians every day were dying by suicide. Now the rate is nine. We know that three-quarters of the people who die by suicide are men, but we know that three-quarters of those people who try to harm themselves are women. We know that suicide is the leading cause of death of Australians under 44. We know that for Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         Australians the suicide rate is two to 2½ times higher than the rest of the population. We know that people from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTIQ" rel="nofollow">
          LGBTIQ
         </a>
         community are reported as having suicide attempts at a rate 10 times higher than the general population.
        </p>
        <p>
         Beyond the tragic loss of individuals is the effect on families. Every individual lost is said to affect over 135 people. Males aged over 85 and older experience the highest age-specific rate of suicide. An estimate of one in three Australians, despite living in what is the best country on earth and one of the most prosperous and successful countries, say that they have feelings of great loneliness.
        </p>
        <p>
         I started the Parliamentary Friends of Suicide Prevention and spoke about my father's death by suicide in my maiden speech because I didn't want other Australians to go through what our family went through and I wanted Australians who were contemplating suicide to know that there were people in this place that understood what it was to contemplate suicide and understood what it was to lose somebody to suicide. I think there are many in this parliament who sadly have been touched by suicide in their own lives.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to acknowledge the great work of Suicide Prevention Australia, and in particular the annual report that they present, not only talking about the sector but talking about the country more broadly. Again, the statistics are grim. Almost nine in 10 Australians believe that social and economic circumstances will pose a significant threat to the suicide rate in Australia over the next 12 months. In particular, three drivers are the focus of this: the cost of living and personal debt, housing access and affordability, and family and relationship breakdown. These are the things that pose the most significant risk. I think, while we've made—
        </p>
        <p>
         <i>
          A division havi
         </i>

         </i>
        </p>
        <p>
         Sitting suspended from 10 : 13 to 10 : 26
        </p>
        <p>
         In this speech on suicide prevention I want to record that, during our time in government, I think one of the most important things that we did was the progress on universal aftercare, because the people that we know are most likely to die by suicide are those people who have actually attempted it in the past. Too often, we've seen across the country people who have seen a doctor or have been discharged from hospital and are just discharged into the night. We wouldn't do it with people with physical injuries, and we shouldn't do it with people with mental health challenges, particularly people who have attempted to take their own lives. So I think the universal aftercare plan that was put forward by Minister Coleman, when he was a minister, was such a step in the right direction. I'm sorry that a number of the states just haven't taken it up, because I think there's no silver bullet here but this is one of the things that we can do where we can really be quite directed and focused on dealing with people who have suicide ideation and really try to address the suicide rate more broadly.
        </p>
        <p>
         The other thing that I think is important is ensuring that people who get mental health support are able to access it. I'm pleased that the Leader of the Opposition, in the budget reply speech earlier in the year, committed to the restoration of the Medicare funded mental health consultations, because that's so important. It wasn't just a COVID measure; I had many people coming up to me in the years before COVID saying that the ten sessions were just simply not adequate for many people. I think to cut people off at ten sessions is just a cruel thing to do. I think it's very important that those things be restored.
        </p>
        <p>
         One of the things that I think is missing across the economy is actually focused, workplace delivered, tailor-made programs that help people understand the signs and know want to do. I think one of the organisations that has done that so well and so effectively in their sector is MATES in Construction. MATES in Construction is a partnership between both the union and the employer groups to deliver specific trainings in the construction sector. They've trained over 300,000 people. These are useful skills that will last with people for their whole lifetime. Almost 30,000 trainers—I think that that's a really good contribution, and we need to see these sorts of workplace based trainings in other places.
        </p>
        <p>
         I've been quite grim so far about where we are in the suicide prevention space because I don't think we're succeeding, so what gives me hope? What gives me hope are the amazing organisations in my community and elsewhere that are doing wonderful work. First among those is Lifeline Harbour to Hawkesbury, run by the extraordinary Elizabeth Lovell. Some of their statistics are amazing. In the last 12 months, Lifeline Harbour to Hawkesbury—that's not national Lifeline, but it's the Lifeline in my community—has answered the telephone crisis line for over 36,000 hours with over 90,000 calls. That's 11 per cent of the total Lifeline load nationally. They've provided 15,000 hours of high-quality, affordable clinical and community support; they've reached over 800,000 people with social media posts and their website; 5,000 people have attended Lifeline Harbour to Hawkesbury training, fundraising and community events; 18,000 people, including myself, have attended the book fairs; and 145,000 people purchased something from their shops.
        </p>
        <p>
         And Lifeline is not resting on its laurels in my community. They are taking up new frontiers, like taking crisis supporters out from behind the phones and putting them in local libraries in places like Hornsby Library. Three weeks ago, Lifeline's national text service was launched at the Lifeline Harbour to Hawkesbury headquarters at Gordon, and they will be taking on an additional 300 paid and volunteer staff to deal with this. Demand for the service is growing at 26 per cent, and they are working with Lifeline Australia to meet that demand. They are partnering with councils and shopping centres to deal with major at-risk locations in car parks and public places, and working with Women's Shelters and Rotary to reduce the impacts of domestic violence on families.
        </p>
        <p>
         Importantly, particularly for our community, which is a multicultural community, they are launching a bilingual counselling service translating key mental health data and programs into Mandarin, which I think is so important. They are preparing a campaign, which I'm sure they are going to lobby me about, to partner with government for safe havens connected to major hospitals, with councils to increase means restriction at key locations around Sydney. I want to pay tribute to the great work of Lifeline Harbour to Hawkesbury.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another organisation I want to acknowledge is Parents Beyond Breakup. I have the privilege of being one of their ambassadors. Their wonderful
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
          CEO
         </a>
         is Gillian Hunt and their extraordinarily talented board is led by Brendan Blomely and includes: Ross Arriola; Campbell Lennox, who led the Parents Beyond Breakup training session I went to;
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Poole" rel="nofollow">
          Glen Poole
         </a>
         ; Alice Campbell-Jones; Kim Goodair; Rob Kennaugh, my friend; Brendan Root; and Gavin Hudson. What Parents Beyond Breakup does is provide a peer supported free counselling service with a series of counselling sessions—a support group—for people who are going through the family law system.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have been interested in family law policy for a long time, and what I think is particularly good about Parents Beyond Breakup, who provide sessions for mums, dads and grandparents, is that they are not about people getting angry or getting even; they are about helping people go through the system. They have a number of traditions. They have the empty chair at some of their sessions, to remind people of those who did not make it. They have the rock that people hold, so that people are listened to respectfully while they are doing their session. It is a very important organisation, which has been going since 1999 when it was founded by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Miller" rel="nofollow">

         is a great and important national goal for this country. It is unfinished work. We are not heading in the right direction, but the hope is in the great organisations like Parents Beyond Breakup and Lifeline, who are at the front line and making a difference every day in delivering services.

          Last Sunday marked an important day in our calendar, a day that may have passed by unnoticed for some but carried profound significance for others. It was
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Suicide_Prevention_Day" rel="nofollow">
           World Suicide Prevention Day
          </a>
          , a day for reflection and remembrance, particularly for the families and friends of the 3,000 Australians who tragically lose their lives to suicide each year. Nine people, of whom six are men, take their own lives every day in our nation. It is a sobering statistic that we cannot ignore. Young people are especially vulnerable, with suicide remaining the leading cause of death for Australians between the ages of 15 and 44.
         </p>
         <p>
          We must also confront the painful truth that
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
           First Nations
          </a>
          Australians are twice as likely to die by suicide as non-

           Indigenous Australians
          </a>
          . This stark reality underscores the pressing need for an Aboriginal and

           Torres Strait Islander
          </a>
          voice to parliament. If we are to address the intergenerational trauma faced by First Nations Australians, our best chance is through listening and taking concrete action.
         </p>
         <p>
          For all of us, this Sunday served as a stark reminder to better understand and address the factors that lead to suicide. It's impact is profound and far-reaching, affecting families, friends, first responders, schools and communities. In this chamber, and in the other place, suicide and suicide prevention are nonpartisan issues. Our actions and words matter deeply.
         </p>
         <p>
          While the reasons behind an individual's suicide are deeply personal and often complex, the overall trends in suicide rates correlate historically with social and economic events. Thus, we cannot isolate the distress faced by many, both in Australia and around the world. From the experiences of the global pandemic, we all know stories of distress, loneliness and isolation, and these stories touch the lives of family members, friends, colleagues, neighbours and even strangers. We must also acknowledge that, as with many catastrophic events, the trauma resulting from this pandemic will have a lasting impact, disproportionately affecting the most vulnerable among us.
         </p>
         <p>
          There are strong connections between mental ill-health and suicide. Therefore, I am proud that the Albanese Labor government is determined to provide compassionate, effective support and care for those in need. It is expanding support in communities with the rollout of new Head to Health clinics, providing free mental health information, support and care to adults. Simultaneously, the government is strengthening the network of more than 150 headspace centres across the country for young people. The government is also working closely with states and territories to establish kids hubs for mental health prevention and early intervention. Primary care is becoming more accessible and affordable, in recognition of the fact that a general practitioner is often the first point of contact for mental health care. Starting on 1 November, we are indexing the Medicare rebate and tripling the bulk-billing incentives.
         </p>
         <p>
          We also understand that the root causes of suicide are multifaceted, encompassing economic, cultural and social determinants which interact with individual risk factors over time. Those who die by suicide typically have three or four risk factors, such as underemployment, financial insecurities, domestic and family violence, and past or compound trauma. To address these drivers of distress, we need a comprehensive approach to suicide prevention that involves the whole of the government and society. This means not only providing mental health support but also alleviating the underlying issues in people's lives.
         </p>
         <p>
          At the top of that list is reducing financial pressure through cost-of-living relief. From 20 September, the base rates of working-age and student payments, including JobSeeker, will increase. I am proud that the government, in close partnership with state and territory governments, is also investing in addressing housing insecurity and homelessness, particularly through the Housing Australia Future Fund. Additionally, I am proud that the government remains committed to addressing domestic, family and sexual violence. We are implementing the National Plan to End Violence against
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_and_Children" rel="nofollow">
           Women and Children
          </a>
          , equipping our healthcare workers to identify and care for those at risk. Furthermore, it is important to ensure that communities are resilient in the face of increased natural disasters. The introduction of the National Disaster
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_Health" rel="nofollow">
           Mental Health
          </a>
          and Wellbeing Framework will be a great support to our first responders. Beyond the provision of health care, governmentwide collaboration is essential if we are to reduce suicide.
         </p>
         <p>
          Despite increasing expenditure on mental health services and suicide prevention, Australia has not seen a significant decrease in suicide rates in over two decades. We also know that approximately 40 per cent of people who die by suicide have no diagnosed mental or behavioural disorders. Suicide risk is directly linked to socioeconomic status, with those in the lowest socioeconomic areas having more than double the rate of suicide compared to those in the highest. To truly make a difference, we must improve not only our healthcare system but also our laws, structures and policies that perpetuate cycles of disadvantage.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Treasurer's recent release of the Measuring What Matters statement is a step in the right direction. It acknowledges that economic indicators alone cannot paint the full picture of our nation's wellbeing. However, it is important to remember that change can occur in every town, suburb and city. While suicide is an individual act, rates of suicide reflect the health of our communities. We all have a role to play.
         </p>
         <p>
          This year, the theme of World Suicide Prevention Day was creating hope through action. It serves as a reminder that each one of us can take compassionate action to support those experiencing distress. Tomorrow is R U Okay? Day. It is a day to check in on your mates and family and a day to remind us that no-one—again, no-one—should ever have to battle mental health issues alone. It is a day to show compassion towards each other, not only in our community but within the walls of parliament, to remind everyone that, no matter how heated things get here, we always want the best for each other.
         </p>
         <p>
          Mental health support is something I am passionate about because I know how important it is to our community. I commend the tireless efforts of the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Hon

          MP, and the Assistant Minister for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, the Hon Emma McBride MP. I would also like to convey my gratitude on behalf of my electorate to the assistant minister for taking the time to visit my electorate and engage with mental health stakeholders. Together, we can ensure that no-one has to face their darkest moments alone. Let us all commit to working together to make a difference on this critical issue.

          <p>
           On Sunday, we observed
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Suicide_Prevention_Day" rel="nofollow">
            World Suicide Prevention Day
           </a>
           . This is a day in which we, as a global community, should reflect on the tragedy that is suicide. Each year, around 3,000 Australians choose to take their own lives. This equals around eight Australians per day. These numbers are more than just statistics; they are a representation that we all need to do more.
          </p>
          <p>
           We are in particularly hard economic times in our country at the moment. As my friend the member for Lindsay pointed out during this debate, the release of the quarterly tracker by Suicide Prevention Australia highlighted that 56 per cent of Australian families are reporting unprecedented levels of cost-of-living distress.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_prevention" rel="nofollow">
            Suicide prevention
           </a>
           organisations have noted a 77 per cent increase in demand for services over the past 12 months. For the vast majority of Australians, the prospect of taking our own lives is unthinkable. However, for far too many in our society, sadly, they believe that is their only option. We need to change that, and this day serves as a great reminder of the importance of reaching out, checking in, reducing stigma and encourage help-seeking.
          </p>
          <p>
           Unfortunately, this issue affects my electorate more than most. People in rural Australia are twice as likely to take their own lives, as are
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
            Indigenous Australians

           . Living and working in the bush can be the most rewarding experience and amazing lifestyle; however, it also has its challenges. Our farmers are amongst the most hardworking people in our country, yet there is no guarantee that their hard work will translate into profits. Being presented with several failing harvests can take people down a dark path. Likewise, working

           can provide a better salary, but the additional time away from the family can strain relationships and decrease mental wellbeing. I can testify that my office has been confronted with some very difficult and confronting situations involving suicide during my 10 years as the member for Durack. Given this history and context, I was not surprised to read last month in the
           <i>
            Geraldton Guardian
           </i>
           that, according to a recent report by the Telethon Kids Institute, many of the nation's hotspots for youth suicide are sadly within my electorate.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kimberley" rel="nofollow">

           </a>
           all had areas listed as hotspots.
          </p>
          <p>
           Earlier this year, I spoke in the House about two new headspace centres in my electorate that are aimed at tackling high rates of youth suicide. I want to take the chance to shout-out to the wonderful staff at headspace Karratha and the wonderful staff at headspace Hedland. Suicide is the leading cause of death for young Australians aged between 15 and 44. I'd like to acknowledge the work of all headspace centres, and others, in assisting vulnerable gay, lesbian and trans people, who, as a collective, have a suicide rate that is 10 times the national average.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Telethon report also highlighted a correlation between high suicide rates per 100,000 and lower mental health support services. The development of local services in the regions, such as headspace centres, is one way that we can combat this reality. However, much more needs to be done. This finding further illustrates to me the benefit of restoring the 20 Medicare subsidised psychology sessions per year that were available under the coalition government's Better Access program. I am proud that reintroducing this scheme and lifting the number of sessions back up from 20 to 30 was one of the first promises we committed to taking to the next election.
          </p>
          <p>
           While government, of course, plays its part, I agree with the theme of this year. This year's theme is that 'We all have a role to play' in preventing suicide. All of us in our own communities, families, workplaces and social circles can have a positive impact by looking out for one another and starting important conversations, no matter how hard those conversations might be.
          </p>

           and to celebrate the work that groups like MATES are doing to improve mental health and prevent suicide. Last week I met with MATES national
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
            CEO
           </a>
           , Chris Lockwood, to discuss the role of their organisation in preventing suicide amongst the construction and the mining workforce. Suicide rates within the construction industry are above the national average. MATES is seeking to combat this through their role of raising awareness, building stronger and more resilient workers, connecting workers to best support services and partnering with researchers to inform industry around best mental health practice.
          </p>
          <p>
           Men account for 75 per cent of suicides in Australia. A large reason for this is the stigma that exists for blokes discussing how they are feeling. As the construction industry is a male-dominated field, I am pleased to hear that MATES is having a positive impact on blokes starting those important, but difficult, conversations. I also commend the work of the Regional Men's Health Initiative, which also does a lot of work in this space in my electorate through their Talk to a Mate!! campaign. I've been to many agricultural and community shows over the past couple of months, and the Regional Men's Health Initiative is there every single time. I just want to give a shout-out to them. They do amazing work.
          </p>
          <p>
           These are just some of the many groups across the country that are committed to suicide prevention. The impact organisations such as these have, many of them being faith based, is immeasurable. I have no doubt their actions have saved many people from taking their own lives and saved families from experiencing unimaginable pain. Many of these organisations are charities which rely on funding from state and federal governments. I believe supporting grassroots movements such as these is a great use of public funds. I acknowledge that committing to reaching zero suicides is the goal of everyone in this building, regardless of party stripes.
          </p>
          <p>
           Back to the message that we all have a role to play. All Australians can recognise that there are many vulnerable people out there who may, as we speak, be contemplating making that most tragic decision to take their own life. As a community and as a culture we need to do more to make sure that everybody feels welcome and supported enough to open up about how they are feeling before it is too late. We must take notice of the lessons learnt on days like World Suicide Prevention Day, the Fly the Flag days, and R U
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK" rel="nofollow">
            OK
           </a>
           ? Day, which we will observe tomorrow. It must be more than just marking the day and then moving on until it comes around the next year. All of us need to think about the necessary behaviours we should adopt all year round. As a community we need to wrap our arms around each other and our most vulnerable. Whether it be by starting a conversation or by letting someone know they are loved and they're worthy, we can all try to make a difference.
          </p>
          <p>
           An important point to make today is that there are 10 million Australians who have been affected by suicide. These are the parents, the siblings, the partners, the children and the wider group of family and friends of someone who has taken their own life. Affected family members and friends go through a period of incredible grief . That, in itself, can last a lifetime. On top of this grief, many affected will possess feelings of guilt. They will wrestle with questions like, 'Did I do enough?' or 'How did I not see this coming?' To those Australians in particular, I would like to send a very clear message today: I understand your pain and want you to know that it's not your fault.
          </p>
          <p>
           I want to end my contribution today by highlighting another service out there for those in need of help. If you'd like to have a chat with someone about how you're feeling today or tomorrow or the next day, please make use of the Lifeline number, 131114. They are a 24-hour crisis support service who can assist anyone through their darkest of times. Please don't feel ashamed to ask for help, as you are not alone in how you feel. In fact, someone calls Lifeline every 30 seconds.
          </p>
          <p>
           Thank you to all the other previous speakers and those who are still to speak, and to all those across this great country who are working in volunteering for an even better Australia—an Australia without suicide.

            </a>
            , which was held last Sunday. For most of us, Sunday was just like any other day. Many people in my electorate were either at Hunter Stadium or glued to the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
             TV
            </a>
            , watching the Knights get home in a nailbiter against the Raiders. But for the families and friends of the 3,000 Australians who die by suicide each year, it was a day of reflection and remembering. It is a day of global significance that reminds us of the profound importance of addressing one of the most pressing public health challenges of our time—suicide. Today we come together to raise awareness, promote understanding and take concrete steps towards preventing the tragedy of suicide that affects millions of lives worldwide.
           </p>
           <p>
            Suicide is a deeply complex and often misunderstood issue. It doesn't discriminate based on age, gender, race or socioeconomic status; it affects people from all walks of life and inflicts pain upon families, communities and society as a whole. However, today is not just about acknowledging the grim statistics or dwelling on the sorrow it brings; it's also about hope, resilience and the power of collective action.
           </p>
           <p>
            The theme of this year's World Suicide Prevention Day is 'creating hope through action'. It serves as a powerful reminder that each one of us in our own way has the capacity to make a positive impact on the lives of those who may be struggling. It's a call to action, urging us to step up, connect and reach out to those who need support. One of the key actions we can take is to break the silence surrounding mental health and suicide. Stigma and discrimination continue to be formidable barriers that prevent individuals from seeking help. We must challenge the societal norms that contribute to this stigma and encourage open conversation about mental health. By doing so, we create a culture where seeking help for mental health issues is seen as a sign of strength, not a sign of weakness.
           </p>
           <p>
            Education plays a vital role in suicide prevention. We must educate ourselves and others about the warning signs of suicide so we can recognise someone who is in distress. Common signs include social withdrawal, changes in behaviour or mood, talking about feeling hopeless or a burden, and giving away possessions. When we know what to look for, we are better equipped to intervene and offer support. But education should not stop at recognising signs; we must also be aware of the available resources and encourage people to seek professional help when needed. Mental health professionals, crisis hotlines and support groups can be lifelines for those struggling with suicidal thoughts. Let us ensure these resources are accessible and known to all, regardless of their background or location.
           </p>
           <p>
            Creating hope through action also means fostering a sense of belonging and connectedness. Loneliness and isolation can contribute to the feeling of despair. We must make an effort to reach out to family, friends and acquaintances, especially when we notice that they may be going through a difficult time. Sometimes, a simple conversation or a small act of kindness can make a really big difference in their lives. Often it can save a life. In addition to individual actions, governments and organisations have a critical role to play in suicide prevention. Adequate funding and resources should be allocated to mental health services and programs. These resources can help reduce waiting times for treatment, improve the quality of care, and ensure that mental health services are accessible to all, regardless of their financial situation.
           </p>
           <p>
            Furthermore, addressing the root cause of suicide is essential. Economic hardship, social inequality, discrimination and access to lethal means are factors that can contribute to suicide rates. As a society, we must work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive world, where everyone has the opportunity to thrive. Preventing suicide is a global endeavour, and it requires collaboration on an international scale. By sharing the best practices, conducting the best research and raising the best awareness, we can learn from each other and develop more effective strategies for suicide prevention. Organisations like the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization" rel="nofollow">
             World Health Organization
            </a>
            and the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Association" rel="nofollow">
             International Association
            </a>
            for Suicide Prevention are at the forefront of these efforts.
           </p>
           <p>
            Let's take a moment to remember those we have lost to suicide. Each life that has been cut short is a reminder of the urgency of our mission. We owe it to them to work tirelessly to prevent others from experiencing the same pain and despair. Nobody in this House would not have been affected by suicide. I myself have. My fantastic cousin Anne-Maree committed suicide years ago. I remember the great times Anne-Maree and I had growing up as kids. She was about 10 years older than me, and she was a beautiful, beautiful girl. Her birthday would have been 5 August, so, wherever you are, Anne-Maree, in this world, I hope you had a great day.
           </p>
           <p>
            World Suicide Prevention Day is a day to remember, reflect and take action. It's a day to create hope through our collective efforts. Together we can break the stigma surrounding mental health, educate ourselves and others, reach out to those in need, and advocate for better mental health services and policies. Let us leave here today with a renewed commitment to making a difference in the lives of those who may be struggling. Let us pledge to be compassionate, to be empathetic and to be there for one another. Together we can create a world where hope triumphs over despair and where every life is valued and protected.
           </p>
           <p>
            I want to give a big shout-out to Chris Lockwood and his team from MATES. I hate to imagine how many lives have been saved by MATES in Mining and MATES in Construction in the period of time since they've been going. I've been dealing with MATES since around 2012. They are a profoundly experienced group of people who are doing great things. In mining and in construction, suicide rates are extremely high—way higher than the average anywhere else or in any other industry. I'm from a fitting background, and, as an industry, fitters have the highest rate of suicide in construction. If you're out there and you're struggling, please make sure you reach out to your mates next to you, your work colleagues, your family and your friends. No-one wants to see you not be here tomorrow. We all want to make sure that you're here. We all want to make sure that we can all grow old together.
