       <p>
        Last Wednesday I farewelled James 'Jim' Cominos, a well-loved family and community man who arrived in Australia in 1951. Originating from the Greek island of Kythera, Jim was the second child in a family of six and, from an early age, showed compassion, persistence and an unwavering commitment to helping others. After several years in my electorate of Barton, Jim, like many Greek migrants who arrived post war in Australia, started a milk bar business with his two brothers. Soon Jim's prowess as a businessman in running a succession of highly successful milk bars attracted offers of a real estate career. Despite running a business full time, Jim always found the time to help others in need, especially migrants settling into life in Australia. Jim was always community minded and ready to lend a hand to others, not just Greek migrants. As a result of this, the Cominos reputation still stands today, with legions of people fondly recalling the way Jim helped them over the years.
       </p>
       <p>
        When Jim relocated from Blacktown to Brighton-Le-Sands, he became active in the local church—the Greek Orthodox Parish Community Church of Kogarah and District—for the next 20 years. I had the huge privilege of working alongside Jim from 1998, when we both sat on the board of the local aged-care provider and of the Kogarah Greek Orthodox parish. Jim's passion and exemplary work ethic have always stayed with me. Jim was a model migrant and an accomplished individual. His passion, commitment and compassion will always be remembered by his family and the community at large. Vale Jim Cominos.
