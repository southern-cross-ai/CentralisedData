        Bullying is never acceptable, and I am very proud of two local girls from the Alstonville Public School who have won awards in a state-wide antibullying competition. More than 5,000 year 5 and 6 students entered the Interrelate 2016 Say No to Bullying Primary School Poster Competition. Tia Dawes was the regional winner for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Rivers" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Rivers
        </a>
        , while Maddy Kelly received a 'highly commended' award. Both students are taught by Jen Roberts. The motto of Tia's poster was, 'Don't hide from the world, ask a friend for help'. Tia's explanation of her motto was:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It means if you're getting bullied or teased just ask someone you trust, maybe a parent or teacher or friend, and don't be afraid to speak up about your problems.
       </p>
       <p>
        The motto of Maddy's poster was, 'Taste your words before you spit them out'.
       </p>
       <p>
        Maddy, Tia and their families will attend an awards ceremony in Sydney on 18 March, on the

        of Action against Bullying and Violence. I congratulate Maddy and Tia for both their success in this competition and the very important message that their posters are stating. The community is very proud of them both.

        Deputy Speaker Scott, Lismore's Flynn Transport are going to provide two trucks—and I know this is an issue close to your heart—to transport about 150 hay bales with the Burrumbuttock Hay Runners. The Burrumbuttock Hay Runners are a convoy of trucks, as you would know that deliver bales of hay to some of Queensland's most drought stricken graziers. The hay run was founded by Farrell Freighters in the Riverina region. Since beginning, they have completed 10 trips so far, and two Lismore drivers will be part of the next convoy. The two drivers will be Flynn Transport's owner,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Flynn" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and operations manager, Josh Duncan. They will set off on 29 March and return the following Sunday. They will load their trucks in Lismore with hay that has been donated from across the Northern Rivers before travelling south to Burrumbuttock to join the convoy.
       </p>
       <p>
        While Tony and Josh are the people driving the trucks, it has been a local industry-wide commitment with a range of local businesses providing support. I acknowledge Brown &amp; Hurley Group, Southside Truck Centre Lismore, Iceman Transport Refrigeration Service Brisbane, the Alstonville Agricultural Society and the Beach &amp; Bush Distributors in Goonellabah.
