       <p>
        I rise this morning to draw the attention of this House to the concerns of a group located at Kariong in my electorate. Kariong is a relatively new suburb, first settled about the time I actually moved to the coast, which was in about 1986. Approximately 3,000 people reside there. It is essentially a dormitory suburb. The vast majority of people there are either young families—who commute to Sydney, which is about 1½ hours away—or people who are recently retired.
       </p>
       <p>
        A petition has been presented to me that has been signed by 268 people. It draws attention to their lack of after-hours medical services. In fact, the closest after-hours medical clinic for this group of people is approximately 40 minutes away, which is a major inconvenience, particularly bearing in mind the difficulty with public transport when travelling from Kariong to Erina. Of course, this group of people is very concerned. For really relatively minor ailments that need attention but not necessarily emergency attention, they should not be blocking up the facilities at the nearby emergency department of

        . They are very concerned and want to see that there are after-hours medical services provided.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have had the opportunity to speak with Minister Nicola Roxon’s office. It appears possible that, under the program provided by this far-sighted government, an after-hours clinic in Kariong or in the nearby Mangrove Mountains-Somersby area can be provided. Certainly I am working with her office in the hope that this can be achieved. For many people in what we might call the regional areas of Australia, access to medical services is quite difficult, and they really do require some assistance.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would now like to present that document.

         The document will be forward to the petitions committee for its consideration and will be accepted subject to confirmation by the committee that it conforms with standing orders.
