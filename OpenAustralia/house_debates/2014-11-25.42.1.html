        I would like to congratulate the community of Gundaroo on some recent village events which have been a great success. A couple of weeks ago, I was delighted to attend the 150th celebrations of the old Presbyterian church in the village. The church building was a ruin in the 1980s; however, over the past few decades it has been restored by the local church community. As part of the celebrations, there was a community picnic with old-style games and a brilliant speech delivered by Marion Meischke, Sasha Sheehan and Deborah Colliver which covered significant events in the history of the church.

        Last month I also attended the Gundaroo Music Festival, another great day, featuring a range of local and regional bands, and culminating in a performance by none other than

        â€”more my vintage than the next. The music festival is now in its second successful year, thanks to

        and a team of helpers. The origin of the event is very local. Resident

        is a keen musician and was diagnosed with motor neurone disease around 18 months ago, and Scott, with his family and friends, had the idea of creating the event to raise money for, and awareness of, the disease.

        I look forward to attending another significant anniversary for Gundaroo in March next year, joining principal Sue Kominek in the 150th celebrations of the Gundaroo Public School. Gundaroo is a great little community. Keep up the good work.
