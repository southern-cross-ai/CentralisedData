In light of discussions between Queensland's Premier and America on its green fleet—Pacific fleet biofuelling—would you not see UBRIS/Hell's Gate as the most immediate project for Minister Frydenberg's $5,000 million northern Australia fund?

         I thank the honourable member for his question. I understand he has been discussing this matter with the minister. I have also discussed this matter of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hell's_Gate" rel="nofollow">
          Hell's Gate
         </a>
         project with the member for Herbert, who is very enthusiastic about it, and he advises me that a dam there would not only provide gravity-fed water security to Townsville but would also enhance water storage right along the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burdekin_River" rel="nofollow">
          Burdekin River
         </a>
         and would open up agricultural possibilities in the north. I understand that Townsville Enterprise has a proposal submitted for $3.9 million of the $25 million fund, and the minister is acutely aware of the project and its importance for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
          North Queensland
         </a>
         . So I thank the honourable member for raising it.
        </p>
        <p>
         As the honourable member knows, the government has established a $500 million National Water Infrastructure Development Fund to support innovative water infrastructure projects, including new dams and irrigation schemes. Twenty-five million dollars, of which I spoke a moment ago, has been allocated to assess the feasibility of state and government proposals. I understand that over 50 applications have been received and this is one of them, and the largest number of them come from Queensland. They are being assessed by an expert independent technical committee and I understand that the successful applications are expected to be announced in April this year.
        </p>
        <p>
         As it is up to state and territory governments as to whether they wish to disclose further details of their applications, I would suggest that the honourable member continue his discussions with the Queensland government as well as with the minister in respect of this matter. There are also opportunities, as the honourable member knows, for support for water projects under the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility announced in the budget. I can assure the honourable member that there is great passion for the development of water in the north of Australia right through our side of politics. We understand that water is the source of life, we understand that the greatest potential of untapped water resources is in northern Australia, and of course the challenge is to find the locations and the means to tap that water efficiently and cost effectively. That is why this is being approached. All of these applications are being looked at in a very rigorous manner. I can just encourage the honourable member to continue his advocacy for the projects that he favours.
