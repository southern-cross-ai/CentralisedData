        <p>
         I thank the member for his question. While his state has been impacted by the flooding, obviously nowhere near the extent to which it has occurred in Queensland and in other states, it nevertheless has had an impact and I have been kept informed by not only the member for Lyons but also the member for Braddon, whose electorate also has been affected. My advice to them has been the same that I have been giving to local governments as I have visited many parts of the devastated sections of this country. I have seen the devastation firsthand and the reality is that we all know there is going to be a massive rebuild required. That rebuild has to be based upon a partnership with the states, which the Prime Minister has referred to. This has been the practice through governments of both persuasions over many years.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is clearly important for those states in this partnership to develop a statement, a strategic indication of the priority projects that need to be replaced. In doing that, they have to adhere to this principle that the Prime Minister has also referred to: value for money. The partnership is one that involves not just governments—and when I say ‘governments’ I do not just mean us and the states; I mean local government—but the private sector, the not-for-profit organisations and in particular the insurance industry. This is a framework that we as a government are developing. But that framework will be best served if there is local input. We are committed on this side to drive regional development and creative solutions which produce a more efficient outcome, and we want local input. It is important for us all in terms of the path forward to ensure that the strategic partnership I talk of is shaped by that local input.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have had the opportunity in many of the visits that I have made to engage in discussions with not just the mayors of the particular towns affected but the mayors of the surrounding towns and to involve in those discussions representatives of Regional Development Australia, Because we need to get the strategic links with these councils in terms of the infrastructure to be replaced.
        </p>
        <p>
         I said at the outset that the rebuild task is going to be massive; it is. It is going to require new resources as well as creative application of existing programs to see where the reprioritisation and reuse of existing programs does not just meet the task of the rebuild but also addresses the key issues which many areas have raised, and those include better flood-proofing and flood mitigation, the betterment concepts. That is why we do have to be creative.
        </p>
        <p>
         I mention the task of involving new resources. That is why the levy is important. Let’s not kid ourselves that this can be done simply through existing programs. I personally believe that existing programs can help, but this is a requirement for the nation to pull together. And that is why this parliament as a whole needs to show to the rebuild the same resolve and cohesion that has been there in the recovery and clean-up. Get behind the levy; support it in the interests of the nation.

             My question is to the Prime Minister. In view of the severe damage to transport and other infrastructure throughout Queensland as a result of the recent floods and cyclone and the Prime Minister’s commitment to helping the state rebuild, will the Prime Minister include within the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements the replacement of Brisbane’s cat and ferry terminals, the no longer floating river walk and its water and sewerage assets, and extend similar payments to other local authorities?

             <p>
              I thank the member for her question and advise her that the arrangements that we will use on recovery beyond that provided by the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements will be to work with the Queensland government and work through the Queensland recovery authority. I believe that is the right mechanism because that is the mechanism that is going to keep us in touch with local communities, including
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
               Brisbane City Council
              </a>
              . I have met with the lord mayor, and I am well aware that there was public transport infrastructure damage. Like every other Australia I saw the huge walkways floating down the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_River" rel="nofollow">
               Brisbane River
              </a>
              , and I am well aware of that damage too.
             </p>
             <p>
              Obviously the Brisbane City Council, as a big entity, has some capacity itself to deal with rebuilding and recovery, and the lord mayor in his discussions indicated that—that as a very sizeable council they do have capacity to work through a range of issues in a way that many smaller councils would not. But he also indicated to me that he would be in discussions with the Queensland recovery authority about additional assistance that Brisbane might need.

              say to the House: I do not believe that it is appropriate for me as Prime Minister in this place or indeed any other to walk around picking projects I like the look of and saying, without consultation and working through, ‘I will fund this,’ or, ‘I won’t fund that.’ That is not the approach I will be taking. That is not the approach that is fiscally responsible. That is not the approach that gets value for money. That is not the approach that best meets local community needs.
             </p>
             <p>
              What we have done instead is worked with the Queensland government. We have made Major General
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Slater" rel="nofollow">
               Mick Slater
              </a>
              available—he is a very good man, a good Queenslander, a man with a nice touch with communities. Mick Slater as well as the Queensland government will work with local councils and local communities to identify their priorities. Having identified their priorities, we will then work through in proper process with the Queensland government to look at needs, to set priorities and to see what needs to be done first.
             </p>
             <p>
              Can I indicate to members across the parliament—the government, the crossbenchers and the opposition—that will be my approach. That is the responsible approach. That is the best way to rebuild Queensland.

               <p>
                I thank the member for Blair for his question. I certainly note that sections of the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipswich_Motorway" rel="nofollow">
                 Ipswich Motorway
                </a>
                were underwater and the road was closed for some 2½ days at the height of the floods. Fortunately, there has been no major damage to the road and work is back underway on the $2.5 billion upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway.
               </p>
               <p>
                Around 70 per cent of Queensland’s road network was badly impacted during the floods. Some 150 major roads were cut. There have been some 2,000 workers out there around the clock making urgent repairs to ensure that Queensland can get moving again. All airports are now back up and running. All ports are back up and operational. All sections of the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Highway" rel="nofollow">
                 Bruce Highway
                </a>
                , with some speed restrictions, have been re-opened from Brisbane right up to Cairns. Passenger train services in South-East Queensland are back up and running. The majority of the freight rail network, with the notable exception of the Toowoomba line and some in the north, is up and running.
               </p>
               <p>
                This progress of course costs money, and you have to find the finances from somewhere. It also requires leadership, which requires putting the national interest first, above opportunistic political considerations. That is why this government has put together the $5.6 billion funding package to help with the recovery. It includes a $2 billion upfront payment to Queensland to help with the immediate clean-up and rebuilding efforts. We have taken action. We will rebuild infrastructure. We needed to prioritise those immediate needs.
               </p>
               <p>
                Only weeks ago the opposition agreed with this. The shadow minister said on 18 January, ‘We want to be able as a nation to commit to more infrastructure but some of them are still a long way from starting, so maybe something can be done in the interim with the funding earmarked.’ The Leader of the Opposition said on the same day, ‘Let’s face it: the government is going to have to focus on the urgent, unavoidable and necessary repair work.’ That is precisely what we are doing. Those opposite continue to put their political interest ahead of the national interest. This is a time when Australians need a hand up. But the Leader of the Opposition has had his hand out for political donations to the Liberal Party and could not even answer the question—

                 Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. We became very familiar with the ‘slag and bag’ from government ministers at the end of last year. I hope at the beginning of a new year you will call them to order and pull them into line.

                  I have indicated my desire that there be less debate in answers, but the standing orders still allow that. I say to the minister that he must relate his comments directly to the question.

                   Absolutely, Mr Speaker. Responses to the floods are a matter of one’s judgment as to whether one is prepared to put the national interest first. Those on this side of the House are doing just that. We will be doing that when we introduce the flood levy legislation tomorrow. I call upon those opposite to improve their judgment, which has been pretty poor of late, and get on with the business of assisting this government to help rebuild Queensland.
