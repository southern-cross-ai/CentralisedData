       <p>
        For a week now we had a government in complete disarray as they squabble among themselves over policy, over whether they should turn up for a division, over who is entitled to sit in this place and over who is going to be the next Prime Minister. I want to take this opportunity to remind Australians and the Prime Minister there are people out there who want us to focus on the real issuesâ€”like Adam Smart, who runs a small business called the Grey Army in Warilla in my electorate. He has been without an internet or phone line for over six months. For over six months he has had to rely on an overpriced mobile handset to get an internet service for a business that is heavily reliant on getting an internet connection with his customers.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm calling on the Prime Minister, because the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        was supposed to be his signal policy. His fingerprints are all over it. Take some responsibility! There are small businesses the length and breadth of this country, like the Grey Army, like Adam Smart's business, who want their phones and internet connected. To be told after six months that you will have no service for another month or maybe two is simply not good enough. Work out who the Prime Minister is, who the Deputy Prime Minister is and who is entitled to sit in this place. Stop struggling amongst yourselves and start focusing on the real issues that people in this country are focused on. Focus on the real issues and get your own house in order so you can sort out the other houses in this country.
