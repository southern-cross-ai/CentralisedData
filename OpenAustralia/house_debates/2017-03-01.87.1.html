            I know the honourable member and his friends opposite want to represent this decision by the independent umpire, whose independence the Labor Party has always, before very recently, championed and defended—I know they want to present this as a decision of the government; it is not. It is a decision of the Fair Work Commission. It is a decision of the independent umpire. It is a decision of the Fair Work Commission. They know that. Australian know that.
           </p>
           <p>
            What they do know, also, is that when the Leader of the Opposition had the opportunity to make decisions about penalty rates himself he was all too ready to trade them away. We have another good example here between a company called Cut &amp; Fill Pty Ltd—it would be quite an apt name for the Leader of the Opposition; 'Cut &amp; Fill'—and the

               I say to the Manager of Opposition Business: having listened carefully to the question on my second attempt, and in listening to the answer, I understand the point he is seeking to make, but I am still judging that the Prime Minister is in order. He is talking about the Fair Work decision and the policy matter related to it. While there have been many occasions where members have asked very specific questions, where I have asked ministers to make their answer relevant to the question, the question is when they move into a different policy area. There have been many questions that have been asked that have been quite specific in demanding 'yes' or 'no' answers. Whilst you are entitled to ask those questions, there is no requirement at all for those answering the questions to give 'yes' or 'no' answers. At this point, having listened to the question carefully, I am judging that the Prime Minister is on the policy topic and is still in order.

                Mr Speaker, on a point of order, I agree with your ruling, but if the Manager of Opposition Business is going to be pedantic about it the Prime Minister should be able to answer questions that are within his power and responsibilities. As he had nothing to do with the Fair Work Commission's decision, this question could easily have been ruled out of order.

                  To respond to the point of order, the Prime Minister is responsible for whether ministers disclose a conflict of interest. He is specifically responsible for that under his own statement of standards.

                   With respect to that last point by the Leader of the House, I agree with the Manager of Opposition Business. The question had a couple of elements. What is keeping the Prime Minister relevant is the reference to the fair work decision. There was another element to the question, for which the Prime Minister is responsible. The Prime Minister is relevant.

                    Returning to one of the Leader of the Opposition's practical demonstrations of how to cut penalty rates—he is an expert at this—indeed, he did not cut them; he totally eliminated them in this case. It was 100 per cent. It was very thorough. It was in 2003, signed for and on behalf of the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Workers_Union" rel="nofollow">
                     Australian Workers Union
                    </a>
                    . There is his signature—the signature of the Leader of the Opposition as he now is. In this agreement it sets out the objectives. The hypocrisy is just so typical of the Leader of the Opposition. One of the objectives is to transfer to the new skill level structure, which provides a defined career path for civil construction employees and recognises them for the skills they have obtained and used. The recognition did not extend to penalty rates—oh no! That was all traded away, to the degree that these are the only wages allowable during the period of the agreement, and any other increases to wages or allowances arising, whether by decision of the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Industrial_Relations_Commission" rel="nofollow">
                     Australian Industrial Relations Commission
                    </a>
                    or otherwise—so being represented by the Leader of the Opposition meant you would not even get a benefit from a decision of the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIRC" rel="nofollow">
                     AIRC
                    </a>
                    . It goes on to say that 'any other increases arising shall not apply to the wage rates of employees employed under this agreement'. Again, it is a comprehensive sweep—the Leader of the Opposition demonstrating his commitment to cutting penalty rates, in this case cutting them entirely.
