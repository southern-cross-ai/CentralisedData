        While members of the government have been busy this week slapping themselves on the back for the things they've never done, Labor members of parliament have been busy uncovering and exposing scandal after scandal after scandal. What an extraordinary week it's been.

        Last night, in Senate estimates, we heard about the helicopter for special forces that won't work—$3.7 billion for that little snafu. Tell us again about what great managers of money you are! Then we've got the COVIDSafe app. They spent $7 million in the last two months alone on an app that doesn't work. It discovers nothing. It was supposed to get us out from under the doona, but, instead, the COVIDSafe app has hit the snooze button and it's still under the doona. We've had the JobMaker program. It was supposed to create 450,000 jobs. It'll be lucky if it creates 10 per cent of those—again, a triumph of marketing over reality. There's $118,000 in unlawful payments to the top corporate regulator so that he could get advice on how to minimise his tax. Tell us again what great managers of money you are! And then you've got the one trillion dollars worth of debt, and nothing to show for it. Come on, stand up; tell us again what great managers of money you are!
