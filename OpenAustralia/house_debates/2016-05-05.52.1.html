        I wish to support and congratulate the members and supporters of Pagewood Botany Football Club, which celebrated its 40th anniversary on Saturday. Pagewood Botany is the largest sporting club in our area, with over 1,200 players, 172 coaches and managers and many, many volunteers. On the weekend, they celebrated this significant milestone with a gala day at their home ground of Jellicoe Park. The gala day included a game between the Pagewood All-Stars and Windgap Warriors, the team which I was fortunate to be a member of. I am proud to announce that the Windgap Warriors got up 6-2. It was also the 11th anniversary of the Dimos shield, a game against Waverley named in honour of Dimos Mastoris, who tragically passed away 11 years ago during a match against Waverley. There was also a 24-hour six-a-side game to raise money for local charities. I am pleased to say that the Pagewood Botany Football Club raised $13,000 for local charities. On the day, I was very proud to be able to present the club with a cheque for $18,000 from the Stronger Communities Program to upgrade lights at the oval to ensure that more soccer can be played around the community.
       </p>

        I wish to pay tribute to the founding members of the club for their vision and foresight. It is a club that has grown from strength to strength. I congratulate the thousands of members of our community who have volunteered their time over the last 40 years. Pagewood Botany Football Club is a great community organisation. Happy 40th anniversary!
