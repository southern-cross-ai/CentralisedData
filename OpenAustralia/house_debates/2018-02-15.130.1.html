        Today I come in here to congratulate the 2018 Penrith City Council Australia Day award recipients—the recognition of Lindsay residents and organisations who work tirelessly for our local community. I often come in here and talk about the fact that the greatest strength of my community is the people, so I would like to give a shout-out to Michele Ellery, the 2018 Penrith Citizen of the Year. Michele founded and is now the

        of the Queen of Hearts Community Foundation, which was established to support victims of child sexual abuse—not always the charity we think about when we think about those doing great work but they are tirelessly doing great work under exceptional circumstances.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also congratulate Nicole Bridges, who received the Penrith Local Appreciation Award. Nicole has been a tireless volunteer worker for the

         Australian Breastfeeding Association
        </a>
        , helping countless families and mums for 15 years. She is currently the

        and

        president. She's a breastfeeding counsellor on the 24-hour hotline mum 2 mum. I know Nicole from many years ago when I studied interior design under her. She's a wonderful woman and a great asset for our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Three of the local appreciation award recipients are from Nepean Food Services:

        , Myra Rodgers and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Riley" rel="nofollow">
         Jim Riley
        </a>
        . Nepean Food Services is an amazing success story. It's a place that I'm happy to visit. I'm very proud to see some of my Stronger Communities grants gifted to that charity to support them to keep going. It started with just three staff members and a very small band of volunteers. It is now 90 volunteers strong and under the great leadership of Ditte Kozak, who is the manager there. They deliver many meals across my electorate to seniors, people with disabilities and people who need that level of support. I'm so proud to be associated with this group.
       </p>
       <p>
        David Hancock is a dedicated volunteer who packs, distributes and delivers meals to seniors. Myra Rodgers, who volunteers, is on the hot run service that delivers, heats and assists the person to start eating safely. These are things we don't often think about when we don't need them. Jim Riley has volunteered more than 20 hours for every single week. He packs meals, makes deliveries and supports other volunteers.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate the 2018 Penrith Community Group Award recipients: #Northstmarysmatters project and Team Colyton, who are trying to revive an older established area in my electorate. They are trying to instil some confidence and good karma into that community and make it an even better place to live than it already is.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lastly, I'd like to congratulate the Penrith Community Organisation Award recipient winner: the Australian Women &amp; Children's Research Foundation, OZWAC, which is headed up by my daughter's paediatrician, Professor Nanan. It's a medical research foundation based in my electorate. It was founded in 1992 to provide grants for medical research for women and children's health. I'm proud of everyone in Lindsay but I am especially proud of those award recipients.
