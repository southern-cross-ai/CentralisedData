        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Agriculture and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Resources" rel="nofollow">
         Water Resources
        </a>
        . Will the Deputy Prime Minister explain to the House how the government's achievements support hardworking Australians in the agricultural sector? Is the minister aware of any threats to the sector's ongoing success?

        <p>
         I thank the honourable member for his question. We have had so much to celebrate in the agricultural sector since we have been the government. This sector, on the last
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
          GDP
         </a>
         figures, is the fastest-growing sector in our nation. This sector has grown since we have been in government, through its national gross value of agricultural production, by 29 per cent, taking it close to $63 billion. It is a sector that is also standing behind the $1 million on the table for Casino Beef Week. I know how important beef is, because of the record prices we are getting and the dignity that is coming back into people's lives with record beef prices. There are also record prices in sheepmeat and for wool. This is by reason of all the work that has been done through the free trade agreements with China, Korea and Japan. That hard work has been built on and is delivering back to people.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is not just that; it is the $8.4 billion that we put on the table for the Inland Rail, to create a corridor of commerce from Melbourne to Brisbane, through Seymour, Wodonga, Parkes, Narrabri, Moree, Goondiwindi and Toowoomba. It is also a corridor of prosperity. There is also the $4 billion Regional Investment Corporation. That is so important, with $2 billion worth of infrastructure loans. There is the decentralisation of the APVMA, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRDC" rel="nofollow">

         </a>

          RIRDC
         </a>
         . There is money on the table for Dungowan Dam, Rookwood Weir, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McAlister" rel="nofollow">

         irrigation district and the south-west Loddon pipeline. There is further access for chilled beef into China.
        </p>
        <p>
         You asked what the threats are. I can tell you what a threat sounds like. A threat sounds like this—and I quote John Setka:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Let me give a dire warning to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABCC" rel="nofollow">

         inspectors: be careful what you do.

         They will not be able to show their faces anywhere. Their kids will be ashamed of who their parents are …

         This Mr Setka from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
          CFMEU

         has been convicted of or charged with 40 separate crimes and five counts of assaulting police officers. I want to commend the member for Grayndler, who said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I find it extraordinary that any Australian would raise kids in particular.
        </p>
        <p>
         …   …   …
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I just think the idea that people should be targeted is completely reprehensible.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         …   …   …
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The comments are offensive.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">

        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I completely repudiate them…I don't know the bloke.
        </p>
        <p>
         He does not know the bloke, but the Leader of the Opposition does. He knows the bloke. He made him a guest of honour at his election night party. Why was Mr Setka there—after-dinner speaker, to entertain the kids, colour and movement with coffee and cream? This is a person who is not going to dignify the alternative Prime Minister of Australia, and you know you should come to the dispatch box and repudiate him.
