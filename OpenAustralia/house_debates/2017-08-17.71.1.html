        had their penalty rates cut on 1 July after this House voted with a majority of just one. Does this Prime Minister acknowledge that his decision to accept his deputy's vote, when it may have been unconstitutional for him to even be here, is having a real impact on every Australian?

         The honourable member's constituents should be very pleased that our party is in government and not hers. The honourable member's party has no plans for jobs or economic growth at all. The honourable member's party is led by a man who was asked on the ABC, 'What is your plan for economic growth?' He couldn't think of one! And then he thought. He said, 'We're in favour of public transport.' That was his response. He couldn't say, as he used to, in the 'old Bill' days, 'Oh, I'm in favour of cutting business taxes, because—

           Thank you, Mr Speaker, I will do so. He couldn't do that in his previous incarnation as a minister in the Gillard government, when he used to say: 'I know. Everyone knows!' He said, 'Every student of economic history in Australia'—a great student, he is; he's read all those books, he's very knowledgeable—'knows that the way to create investment is to lower business taxes, and that's why we're doing it.' He gave speech after speech, even speeches that were hitherto unknown—

               Mr Speaker, the honourable member has asked about pay at
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrith_Plaza" rel="nofollow">
                Penrith Plaza
               </a>
               . Let me tell the honourable member: the driver of economic growth in Penrith and everywhere else in the country is investment. That is what drives jobs—more investment, more jobs. More people have an income; more people go shopping at Penrith Plaza. The idea that a policy-free zone, the Labor Party, dripping with nothing more than envy and malice, is going to deliver jobs in Penrith Plaza or anywhere else is very naive. Envy, bitterness and malice are not going to get people hired in Penrith Plaza. What that needs is investment, confidence and employment. There were 240,000 new jobs over the last year. That's what's being delivered: strong investment—getting stronger—supported by the government and supported by policies that back in growth and will ensure that the constituents of the honourable member will have a greater opportunity under the leadership we're providing than under the envious bitterness of the Labor Party.

                 interjecting
                </a>
                continuously, particularly those who have been asked to leave under standing order 94(a) on a number of occasions. The member for Griffith is in that category, as is the member for Bruce. I am saying very calmly: even though it's loud, I'm not going to reciprocate with loud responses; I'm going to reciprocate with action to remove them from the chamber. Those who have been removed a number of times can expect more severe action. If that's what they want to happen during question time, I'll be left with no choice.
