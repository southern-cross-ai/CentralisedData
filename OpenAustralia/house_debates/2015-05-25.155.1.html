       <p>
        According to Volunteering Australia, 6.1 million Australians take part in voluntary work. That accounts for about 36 per cent of the population.
       </p>
       <p>
        As we know, volunteers are probably the happiest people in the country. They get a great deal of satisfaction from helping others. They enhance the quality of their life and their health. They live longer and they learn new skills. They connect with new people. In terms of the benefits of volunteering, the list goes on: volunteers are happier and healthier, contribute to our community and really feel as if they are making a difference to their nation in so many different ways.
       </p>
       <p>
        Aside from the many positive aspects volunteering can bring to someone's life, the value of volunteering to the Australian economy is just staggering. Volunteering in Australia is worth more than the mining industry. It is estimated to be worth more than $200 billion a year, which is why it is so important that we acknowledge and thank the volunteers who, each and every day—24/7—give to the community in so many different ways, be it at the sausage sizzle for the local school, be it helping out the soccer club—as friends of mine do—with refereeing, laying out boundaries and keeping score during soccer matches, be it helping out in the men's shed or be it helping out by selling raffle tickets at a sports function. Volunteers help out the community in so many different ways each and every day.
       </p>
       <p>
        I come from a background where volunteering is taken very seriously. My mother was very much of the view that we were fortunate—that my sisters and I were very blessed and that we had to give back to the community as much as possible. My school holidays were spent in an old building above an op shop. I would be either serving in the op shop for the autistic centre of Victoria, walking around a table collating newsletters for the community or running off roneo in the old Gestetner machine, and that would be the extent of my school holiday activity. It was serving the community in a range of ways, be it serving behind the counter at the op shop, folding up clothing, doing window displays at the op shop, walking around the table collating the newsletter, stuffing envelopes or printing off the newsletter. That was just one way my mother got us involved. We were also involved in Meals on Wheels and a range of other volunteering activities. My mother believed that we were blessed in life and that we should help out others who were not as fortunate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most people who volunteer do so without ever being publicly recognised, and Canberrans are truly altruistic.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        volunteers contribute over $1.5 billion to the ACT economy annually. Every retiree I know in the ACT is a volunteer. In fact, they have multiple volunteer roles. They have their grandchildren, and they are helping out with them by picking them up from school or dropping them off to activities, and then they are usually juggling about three or four voluntary roles throughout the week. In fact, they say to me that they are busier as retirees—as volunteers—than they were when they were working.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two weeks ago more than 350 Canberran volunteers gathered to celebrate the 2015 ACT Volunteer of the Year Awards, which recognise the important work that volunteers do in our community. This year a record 83 Canberrans nominated for the awards for community service. I would like to send my congratulations to the 2015 ACT Volunteer of the Year, 22-year-old Sophie Hope. Sophie volunteers with Lifeline and headspace, provides foster care for animals for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSPCA" rel="nofollow">
         RSPCA
        </a>
        , and is also on the ACT Refugee Action Committee. I would also like to congratulate long-time volunteer Mary-Anne Kitchen, who was recognised in the category of community health for her work with Palliative Care ACT, where she has volunteered for 15 years. I would like to congratulate the 2015 ACT volunteer team of the year, TADACT Skilled Project Volunteer Team. TADACT stands for Technical Aid to the Disabled ACT, and its team is made up of more than 60 skilled volunteers who donate their time, knowledge and expertise to enable people with disabilities to live independent lives. Thank you for your service to the community, congratulations on the award, and to all Canberrans: continue volunteering.

         I join with the member for Griffith in supporting this motion, and I acknowledge and thank the many volunteers who dedicate their time in my electorate of Dobell. The week from 11 to 17 May was National Volunteer Week. In the lead-up to this week my local community of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
          Central Coast
         </a>
         was reminded of the true value of volunteers when we were savaged by storms. Recently in parliament, I spoke of the impact that this natural disaster had on my community. Without the efforts and dedication of local volunteers, the impact on the community would have been far more severe. While we are reminded of the value of volunteers through testing times, we also encounter their outstanding work every day in our community.
        </p>
        <p>
         This year's theme, Give Happy Live Happy, speaks volumes about the roles that volunteers play within our community. Last week I had the pleasure of joining with the Wamberal Surf Lifesaving Club and The Entrance Surf Lifesaving Club, and they definitely 'give happy' and 'live happy' Across our nation over six million Australians give their time to enrich the lives of others, from mums and dads who cook the barbecue at footy on the weekend to the members of the rural fire brigade and state emergency services who help us during our most desperate times of need. Our everyday lives are enhanced by volunteers. Volunteers give up countless hours of their time to improve social, environmental and economic outcomes for our communities. Volunteering is a strong Australian tradition—so strong that it is estimated to be worth more than $200 billion a year.
        </p>
        <p>
         For me, the noblest aspect of a volunteer's work is their dedication and commitment towards a healthier and stronger community. Volunteers do not wake up in the morning and set about their day for personal gain; they do it to genuinely improve another person's quality of life. Each year in my local community, over 16,000 men and women give their time through volunteering. One of the great joys of being a member of parliament is the opportunity to meet and support these volunteers and the organisations to which they belong. Last week, I joined with The Entrance Rotary for their annual Pride of Workmanship Awards. Organisations such as Rotary and Lions give so much to our community. On the night, it was said that organisations such as Rotary need more volunteers. You do not need to become a member of a Rotary or a Lions group to contribute, and they would welcome you to assist them at any time.
        </p>
        <p>
         In a world where we are working more, commuting more and striving for that work-life balance, volunteering may not be at the forefront of our minds. When it comes to volunteering, it is true to say that you can give as little or as much time as you wish; it all makes a difference. I am immensely proud of the role volunteers play in our community—from surf-lifesaving, the iconic image of the Australian summer, to local Men's Sheds, which ensure senior Australians have a place to go, support one another and contribute to their community; from Landcare groups, ensuring that future generations enjoy our beautiful, natural environment, to local sports groups, providing the opportunity for our children to participate in a healthy and active lifestyle. These are the men and women who put so much passion into their work, often for little recognition or reward. Once you start to dig under the surface, you begin to see how much of our community is underpinned by volunteers.
        </p>
        <p>
         In my job, a day does not go by where I do not meet with or talk to someone volunteering in our community. I have had the privilege of sharing some of these remarkable stories with this parliament. Organisations such as Share the Love, which grew from two volunteers in a garage into a successful charitable organisation, ensure that young parents are able to provide their children with the best start in life. The Central Coast Cancer Council Relay for Life, which has been supporting individuals and families impacted by cancer for close to two decades, is organised by volunteers. Marine Rescue protect those using our beautiful beaches and lakes, the

          SES
         </a>
         assist during times of natural disaster.
        </p>
        <p>
         Volunteers also complement the financial side of an organisation. For some organisations, there is simply not enough money to undertake all that is needed. Volunteers who work pro bono, out of the goodness of their hearts, free up funds that can be allocated to other areas of the organisation, usually of benefit to the community. Most organisations would not have the financial means to pay for positions such as bookkeeper, social media person or groundsman. Volunteers who take on the many roles available ensure that organisations keep operating, and the community receives the benefits. Five minutes today in parliament simply is not enough time to convey our appreciation for our volunteers and the work they do to underpin our community.

         <p>
          A fortnight ago, my community in Hotham joined the nation to celebrate National Volunteer Week. This is such an important opportunity for so many reasons, but one of those reasons is that it gives people like me the chance to say thank you for the incredible work that volunteers do right across the country and in my electorate in particular. There are six million volunteers who undertake this critical work that affects all our areas of life, and this is a great opportunity for us to just say, 'Thank you.' It is also a great time for us to talk about some of the benefits of volunteering. The theme for National Volunteer Week this year was 'Give happy, live happy', and I think it is important for us in the chamber today to note that volunteering is great for volunteers too. We know that they are generally happier in their lives, and a big part of that is the fact that they do this important work of helping other Australians.
         </p>
         <p>
          I want to talk a little about some of the volunteers who do really important work in my community of Hotham. In Hotham, we are blessed by a very rich community of volunteers of all ages and all cultural backgrounds, who are doing work in things as varied as health organisations, childcare centres, community houses, animal shelters and environment groups. We have some of the same groups across many of our electorates, with Rotary, Lions clubs and the important work done in hospitals. I am lucky to have a
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_McDonald_House" rel="nofollow">
           Ronald McDonald House
          </a>
          very close to my electorate, and the work that volunteers do supporting that organisation is truly extraordinary. It is important too not to forget our volunteers who are out there protecting the natural environment. A lot of people would not know this about Hotham, but we have a lot of very rich nature reserves and, importantly, a green ridge that is protected by local volunteers. I want to salute the work they do in protecting that local environment for us.
         </p>
         <p>
          Like many of us in the chamber, the councils in my local area do a great job in recognising volunteers, year in and year out. I will speak about some of the important work that the people in my electorate who have been named Citizen of the Year have done in this last year. Glen Eira City Council gave their Citizen of the Year award to Marjorie Lochhead. Marjorie is an incredible woman, a
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bentleigh_East" rel="nofollow">
           Bentleigh East
          </a>
          resident and founding member of the Moorabbin Hospital Ladies Auxiliary. She is 86 years of age—I do not think she would mind me saying—but is still today an active part of the ladies auxiliary and is the current treasurer. She has been working for 39 years—longer than I have been alive—to help raise much needed funds for the hospital and has been weekly volunteering in the canteen and running the monthly trading tables. Thank you, on behalf of the people of Hotham, to Marjorie.
         </p>
         <p>
          I acknowledge Beverley Douglas, Citizen of the Year, this year, for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Dandenong" rel="nofollow">
           Greater Dandenong
          </a>
          . Beverley Douglas is one of my constituents of Springvale and has been volunteering in her local community for 30 years. Her involvement has been instrumental to the changing needs of her community, including driving new program development and service-delivery models. She has been a long-term volunteer at the Springvale Learning and Activity Centre. Living out in Springvale, I can tell you, over the last 30 years we have seen so much change in that local area. I know Beverley has been right on the money in trying to make sure the services that we provide locally are adapting to that local community. Beverly, thank you so much, on behalf of all the people of Hotham, for the work you do.
         </p>
         <p>
          Saving one of my favourite constituents till last, Charlie Mizzi is one of the most dedicated volunteers in my whole electorate. He was this year named Kingston Citizen of the Year. He has been a tireless volunteer for decades. Charlie is an active member of more community organisations than I have time to go through here, but they include Ronald McDonald House, the Oakleigh and Clarinda Village Committee, the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood_Watch" rel="nofollow">
           Neighbourhood Watch
          </a>
          , the Avicultural Society of Australia and many local senior citizens groups.
         </p>
         <p>
          I have the great privilege of benefiting directly from Charlie's incredible efforts from his years as a long-term volunteer in my office. He and his wife, Gail, are regularly popping in to see and helping us out. They are an incredible part of the work that we do in Hotham. Charlie, on behalf of the people of Hotham, congratulations. We are so proud of the work that you do.
         </p>
         <p>
          Active citizens are so important to us. As members of parliament we are in a unique position in getting to see so much of what goes on in our community. I think I speak for all the members in the House when I say that our work as members of parliament is so enriched by having networks of volunteers across our communities. National Volunteer Week is a wonderful opportunity for us to say, on behalf of the people of Australia, thank you to all of you who are doing this great work.

          <p>
           I am really pleased to support this motion from the member for Griffith and to support National Volunteer Week. Every week should be National Volunteer Week, because every single day thousands of people in my community give of themselves selflessly and tirelessly to help others in our community. I know they do not ask for much and they certainly do not ask for the limelight, but this motion is a really appropriate way to acknowledge the work of six million volunteers around Australia and the contribution they make, both socially and economically, as we have heard already in this debate, to assist others and to build a better future for our nation.
          </p>
          <p>
           They are the bedrock of our society—no more so than on the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
            Central Coast
           </a>
           , in my own community. According to the 2011 census 19,000 people do some kind of volunteering in my electorate of Robertson. They are people of all ages, from all walks of life. One in five volunteers in my community are aged over 15 years. Seventeen per cent in my community are aged between 15 and 19. They are young people having a go and making a difference. About 11 per cent are aged over 80.
          </p>
          <p>
           The executive officer of Volunteering Central Coast, Michelle Vanstone, told me that there are around 3,000 groups on the Central Coast, including schools, Rotary and other organisations, that organise voluntary work. Volunteering Central Coast helps volunteers in our community—around 1,000 a year, they place. They serve in so many ways and it is impossible, in the few short minutes we have, to name them all. But here is a snapshot.
          </p>
          <p>
           Surf-lifesaving is a very important movement here on the Central Coast. There are 15 clubs on the Central Coast, with eight of them in my electorate of Robertson. There is an army of red and yellow volunteers who make our beaches among the safest in the world, no more so than my own club, the Terrigal Surf Life Saving Club. I was pleased to attend their awards presentation on Saturday night. They have more than 1,100 members and around 350 active patrol members, who served for more than 10,000 hours, in fact, nearly 11,000 hours, with no lives lost over the last season. There were 32 rescues at Terrigal beach. It could have been higher except for nearly 1,500 preventative actions that stopped our swimmers getting into trouble in the first place. Today, I just want to acknowledge and place on record my appreciation to club president, Paul Quick, and to his entire committee, particularly Mardi Love, Beris Meldrum, Chris and Toni Jones, and my own patrol captain Peter Ives. They represent the committee members of so many other surf clubs right across the Central Coast.
          </p>
          <p>
           In signalling out a few, as I will do here today, I believe they are the examples of many people in our community who serve so tirelessly and so selflessly—for example, people in the

           and his committee members—who are campaigning and volunteering in their time for better and safer local roads in Copacabana, and for the prompt rollout of fast broadband to Copacabana, which I am pleased to say our government is delivering. There is the Gosford Business Improvement District, led by Deborah Warwick, who are working together to make sure that Gosford is a living, vibrant city. In fact, this Saturday, together with Liberty Family Church led by Kim and

           , led by Gosford controller Rolf Garda and his wife Sue, who did such an extraordinary job through the recent storms. I have made my tribute to them in another place. There are our football and sporting clubs around the Central Coast, led by outstanding people such as Ben Spackman, president of the Sharks, or the Terrigal Wamberal junior rugby league club, who in addition to running the club shaved his head on Saturday to help raise important awareness for brain cancer. And club president

           There are also our local churches and the army of volunteers who support the work of outstanding organisations such as Rotary, Coast Shelter in Gosford and Mary Macs in Woy Woy, led by the indefatigable Christine Burge. There are so many volunteer organisations that I could name, but as
