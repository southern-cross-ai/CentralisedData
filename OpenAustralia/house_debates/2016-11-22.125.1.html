        Recently the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        member for Hawkesbury discussed the importance of heritage. Here is what he said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our heritage buildings and places tell the story of New South Wales and that is something that we have a responsibility to safeguard and maintained for generations to come. The Lysicrates Monument represents the rich cultural history and heritage that has shaped our city, our state and our nation. There is also vital work to be done maintaining and preserving heritage assets like the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrmont_Bridge" rel="nofollow">
         Pyrmont Bridge
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Great, I thought, here is someone who might actually help protect and preserve the oldest public square in the country, which is in his own electorate. But, no: he is happy to wax lyrical about heritage in the New South Wales parliament and invest millions in the CBD, but not one mention of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson_Square" rel="nofollow">
         Thompson Square
        </a>
        on his Facebook page or in a media release.
       </p>
       <p>
        Instead, he claims as an achievement the planned construction of a replacement,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windsor_Bridge" rel="nofollow">
         Windsor Bridge
        </a>
        , which will run through Thompson Square and will irrevocably change it, wrecking its Georgian integrity. Mr Perrottet, who is the finance minister in New South Wales, had some choice words about me in parliament. But rather than respond to schoolboy insults, I think I would prefer to focus on content. Mr Perrottet claimed a number of achievements: Windsor Bridge, not built; a $3 million tourism investment, not delivered yet; the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rouse_Hill" rel="nofollow">

        , not in his electorate—I know he gets confused and he does not live in the Hawkesbury, but it is not built. What he did not mention was the $20 million of federal Labor funding that was committed to improve

       </p>
       <p>
        I know that the member for Hawkesbury is reported to have aspirations for the Senate, but until that happens, his energies might be better spent on the schools in his own electorate. Colo
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_School" rel="nofollow">

        has a $2 million backlog of repairs. Richmond and Windsor high schools each need repairs of more than $1 million. Twenty-two schools have a backlog of repairs of between $100,000 and $700,000. All up, $12½ million of repairs are needed in his own electorate. It is time he remembered his own electorate and that he has history on his doorstep. He actually has the power not just to save things in the CBD; he has the power to save things in Windsor for future generations.
