       <p>
        I had the pleasure of hosting the Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Hon. Ged Kearney, in my electorate of Holt last week. I was honoured to show the minister one of the several aged-care facilities in my electorate, Lynbrook Park, where we interacted with facility manager Kami, her staff and the residents. Assistant Minister Kearney and I heard directly from the staff as how the Albanese government's 15 per cent wage increase will impact their lives for the better. It will mean less stress over having enough money to put food on the table, more security in their lives and, most importantly, demonstrate a real recognition of how crucial their services are to our society. This wage increase will affect 56,700 workers in Victoria, over 800 of whom live in my electorate of Holt, according to the 2021 census. Not only are aged-care workers feeling happy and supported but so are the residents themselves.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also enjoyed hearing from the staff and residents about how glad they are that the Albanese government is investing in aged-care reforms initiated by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        into Aged Care Quality and Safety. For example, the introduction of star ratings for residential aged-care facilities serves to empower potential residents and their families in choosing a genuinely safe and enjoyable facility for their loved ones. That has been a welcome change. The simple measure provides transparency and a sense of certainty and security to aged-care residents and their families. At the same time, the measures reward facilities which provide great services and incentivise those near to the bottom of the ratings to up their game.
       </p>
       <p>
        This government is also committed to increasing the food and nutritional health in aged-care facilities. The $12.9 million in funding, part of a historic $36 billion aged-care budget, delivers a range of meaningful measures to enhance the quality of food for older people. A new hotline for food complaints and advice will be established and staffed by specialists. The support unit will also help providers build capability by linking them with support and education programs, including those delivered by accredited practising dietitians. I am so proud of the positive changes the Albanese government has made in aged care. Once again, I want to thank Assistant Minister Kearney for visiting my electorate and touring a local facility and talking to the residents and the staff members of that facility in understanding where they come from. Thank you once again.
