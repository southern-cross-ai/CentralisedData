       <p>
        I am pleased to announce that, with the help of the Turnbull federal government, Lynwood Park in my electorate of Macarthur now has a $1.4 million synthetic turf field, which will be used by many football teams across Macarthur. This project was one of my election commitments and I am very proud to have been able to deliver it for the people of Macarthur. The new synthetic turf fields mean more games and increased facilities for the Macarthur Football Association, with its ever-growing number of teams and players. This $1.4 million project—jointly funded by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbelltown_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Campbelltown City Council
        </a>
        , the federal government and the Macarthur Football Association—will create enormous opportunities for the clubs and for football in Macarthur. I am very proud to be able to deliver this first-class sporting facility for our great community to enjoy.
       </p>
       <p>
        This has been a great win for our community and one that I am personally very proud to have a played a small role in. I would like to thank Campbelltown City Council for supporting me on this project to make sure that the people of Macarthur have facilities of this high standard to call their own. I would also like to thank former chairman Rob Laws, general manager Glenn Armstrong and all the members of the Macarthur Football Association for playing an integral role in delivering this facility for the people of Macarthur. I would also like to acknowledge my two state colleagues
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Patterson" rel="nofollow">
         Chris Patterson
        </a>
        and Jai Rowell for their assistance with this project, as well as the former mayor,
