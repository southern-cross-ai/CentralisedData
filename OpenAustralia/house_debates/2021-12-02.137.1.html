        is part of every Australian's childhood. After five cartoonists and a hundred years, kids and grown-ups alike are still revelling in the adventures and comical capers of the redheaded larrikin kid who never gets old.
       </p>
       <p>
        In creating this comic strip,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Bancks" rel="nofollow">

        drew on his childhood experiences growing up in my electorate. Bancks's father, John, was a railway cleaner, and when Jimmy was three the family moved to a railway cottage at Hornsby.

        a hundred years ago, in November 1921. Names and places of the old neighbourhood were used in his books without alteration. Frank Buckle, who became the first captain of the

        cricket team, scored a mention. So did George Lumby, a childhood friend who went on to operate a hardware store in Hornsby. Ginger and his mates frequently stole fruit from Fosters Orchard or Higgins Orchard, which were local landmarks. Ginger Meggs's character was based on the antics of Bancks's old neighbourhood friend Charlie Somerville. By the time the comic strip was appearing, however, Charles Somerville was no longer the boisterous boy of Bancks's creation. He was a war veteran, a businessman and a long-serving mayor of

        With his vivid red hair; his larrikin, boyish charms; and his never-ending ability to get himself into and out of trouble, Ginger Meggs is a mischievous character whose everyday escapades echo the experiences of million of Australian children. Throughout his lifetime, readers have seen Ginger Meggs evolve from the 1930s world of billycarts, wireless radios and cricket games played in the street to the computer drawn images of today in which Ginger Meggs laments the loss of his internet connectionâ€”which is sadly still a common experience for people in my electorate.

        Bancks wrote in an annual compendium of the comic strip:

        I have tried to make Ginger a real boy, human, natural and for the most part worthy of sympathy and goodwill.

        Bancks died in 1952. He was 63. The

        While Hornsby has changed dramatically from the town of a century ago, the spirit of Ginger Meggs lives on in the hearts of many locals. In 1997, Hornsby council renamed the park in
