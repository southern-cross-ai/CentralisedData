       <p>
        I stand today to celebrate the remarkable life of Bass constituent the wonderful Patrick Joseph Bottle, who recently passed away at the age of 86. Pat was an absolute stalwart of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Town" rel="nofollow">
         George Town
        </a>
        community. He was a part of the fabric of the town, which he adored. Anyone who has lived in George Town would have come across Pat over the years, and so many of us were privileged to know this modest, hardworking and goodhearted person.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pat grew up in George Town and created and managed one of the town's oldest businesses, which is now operated by his son, Ben. Totally committed to the service of his community, Pat held a voluntary role with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        of George Town for over 35 years, and I know his legacy will continue to inspire Rotarians and others to do their utmost for our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Through Rotary and with his love of vintage cars he created and volunteered at the successful community event Wings and Things. He was heavily involved with the

         Star of the Sea
        </a>
        college and gave much time to volunteering at the college in a variety of roles. It was his dedication to the community which earned him the George Town Council's 2016 Citizen of the Year Award. But perhaps most importantly of all Pat was a loving husband to his dear wife, Judith, an adored father to his children, and an adored grandfather to his grandchildren. Vale Patrick Bottle; you will be very sorely missed.
