        I rise to join with my parliamentary colleagues on both sides of the chamber, and in the other place, to add to the record my absolute sadness, disbelief and anger at the recent and shocking death of Hannah Clarke and her three beautiful children.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was moved to tears yesterday by the words spoken by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition as they recounted the years of abuse that Hannah had suffered, and how she feared for her children's safety. The Instagram post read out by the Prime Minister yesterday was particularly powerful. Hannah wrote:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am a Strong Woman. I don't sit around feeling sorry for myself, nor will I ever let anyone mistreat me again … I am a survivor not a victim. I am in control of my life and there is nothing I can't achieve. My girls will grow up being strong women who understand their worth.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hannah expressed a hope, which I know that every mother in the world hopes for their daughter. This hope was crushed when Hannah and her children were murdered
       </p>

        We all have a collective responsibility to ensure this never happens again. It has never been acceptable, it's not acceptable now and will never be acceptable in the future. At times like this, after these devastating events. It is important to remember and reflect on those in our community who are making a difference to the lives of women and their children. Sacred Heart Mission in

        , just outside my electorate of Higgins, provides women and children experiencing homelessness and disadvantage in Victoria with crisis accommodation and other support. Sacred Heart Mission's Homefront Program is a state-wide accommodation service for women who are in a crisis situation, including family violence.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am proud of the fact that last year the Minister for Women and former member for Higgins, the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly_O'Dwyer" rel="nofollow">

        , announced a record investment of $340 million in services for domestic violence so that we can protect and support women and children. Most importantly, $75 million was provided for emergency accommodation. Too often we hear of women who are too scared to leave, or, with as much difficulty, don't have anywhere to go. It's so important that we try to prevent statistics such as those which have occurred recently. We must all work together to protect women and children from violence in their own homes, because everyone—every single one of us—deserves to be safe.
