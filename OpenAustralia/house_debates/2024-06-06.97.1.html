        My question is to the Prime Minister. Prior to the 7 October terrorist attacks, approximately 15,000 trucks a month delivered essential humanitarian aid, including food, fuel and water, to Gaza. I understand that approximately 2,020 trucks entered Gaza last month—only 13 per cent of previous levels. Many Australians have grave concerns of impending levels of catastrophic food-and-water insecurity and that a famine may soon be declared. What steps within its power is the government taking to ensure essential humanitarian aid, food and water gets to Gaza?

         I thank the member for Warringah for her question. Indeed, Australia does remain deeply concerned about the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza. We continue to call for safe, unimpeded and sustained access for humanitarian supplies to enable lifesaving support for civilians in Gaza. We've committed $62.5 million in humanitarian assistance to the region since 7 October—that includes: $41 million to support people affected by the conflict; $11.5 million to refugee programs in Lebanon and Jordan to address the ongoing regional refugee crisis; $4 million to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         ICEF to provide urgent services, including for women and children in Gaza; and $2 million to the UN Senior Humanitarian and Reconstruction Coordinator's new mechanism to facilitate expanded humanitarian access into Gaza. Our funding is being directed to conflict-affected people, with a focus on women and children, including to support food, water, medicines and shelter. We're also supporting efforts by Jordan and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAE" rel="nofollow">
          UAE
         </a>
         to assist with the delivery of vital humanitarian aid to civilians in Gaza. We've supplied 140

         aerial-delivery parachutes for use in humanitarian assistance airdrops by Jordan and the UAE.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have continued to reiterate our opposition to the ground offensive in Rafah. We called that out, including in advance with a joint statement by me, the Prime Minister of Canada and the Prime Minister of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealand
         </a>
         . We said this:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         There is growing international consensus. Israel must listen to its friends and it must listen to the international community. The protection of civilians is paramount and a requirement under international humanitarian law. Palestinian civilians cannot be made to pay the price of defeating Hamas.
        </p>
        <p>
         We are clear that a sustainable ceasefire is necessary to finding a path towards securing lasting peace for Israelis and Palestinians. Ultimately, a negotiated political solution is needed to achieve lasting peace and security. Australia, Canada and New Zealand remain steadfast in their commitment to a two-state solution. We also have supported the call by President Biden and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         proposition which would see an end to the conflict. We have consistently voted month after month in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations
         </a>
         for UN resolutions calling for a cessation of conflict. As President Biden has said, a deal would allow the United States and our partners to begin the work to rebuild homes, schools and hospitals in Gaza to help repair communities destroyed in the chaos of war.
