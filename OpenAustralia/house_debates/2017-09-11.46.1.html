        As people woke today to the news headlines and read the front page of the
        <i>
         Financial Review
        </i>
        there was a collective rolling of the eyes and a sigh that, yet again, the National Party had demonstrated how out of touch they are. On the weekend, they gathered in Canberra—the party of decentralisation, by the way—to rally against clean energy yet again. They passed a motion completely opposing the clean energy target and subsidies for clean energy. This demonstrates yet again how out of touch they are with their own constituency.
       </p>
       <p>
        The National Farmers' Federation and Farmers for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Action" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Action
        </a>
        are saying climate change is real and they want to see clean energy and a clean energy target. We know by talking to farmers that this is energy they want. They want the ability to reduce their energy costs on farm. Outside of Newbridge is a solar power plant that is helping to grow mushrooms and halve the energy bills of that farmer. Our farmers want clean wind technology on their properties.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yet again, the Nationals and the Liberal Party have demonstrated how out of touch they are with regional Australia. They refuse to meet with our farmers and listen to what they're saying. Whether it be coalminers in Capricornia or our farmers, these parties only care about what they do in Canberra. They don't stand up for the people of the bush; they don't even meet in the bush when they have their national conferences. This is disgraceful and shameful behaviour by both these parties, who claim to represent the regions.
