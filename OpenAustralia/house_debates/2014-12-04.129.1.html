       <p>
        It is with great pleasure that I rise today to recognise the wonderful sporting talent that we have in the electorate of Forde. I have previously recognised some of those in this parliament, and today I would like to mention a few more. As the 2014 sporting season draws to a close there are a number of wonderful success stories coming out of our local sporting clubs. Logan Cobras have spent the season consolidating their junior teams from the under 6s through to the under 10s. They were successful with the assistance of the 2014 president,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Ryan" rel="nofollow">
         Greg Ryan
        </a>
        , who said, 'The teams have improved significantly and shown a bright future in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
         AFL
        </a>
        for the area.' There have been significant club milestones which include Sammy Dagan and Matt Hartz both achieving 150 games for the club. Jack Honey and Ryan Wichmann have both played 100 games. Jeremy Griffin, Ethan Madden and Jordan Savage all achieved the 50-game milestone. Well done to all of those players for their significant service to the club.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to recognise the coaches for the wonderful work that they do. These include the under 6s coach

        ; under 9s, Trevor Bryant; and for the under 10s, Aaron Muncey and Clint Hargraves. I would also like to thank the managers:

        , and Mark and Kristy Williams. All of these people are what make our sporting clubs so successful. Without them the clubs and the players could not go out onto the park every week. I look forward to catching up with them all in the 2015 season.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to congratulate Waterford Demons for the work that they have done this year when they became the toast of this year's Gordon Tallis Cup, in recognition for their response to a cry for help from Townsville's Tully Tigers back in 2011.

        ' now under-10 side answered the Tigers' call for cyclone assistance by donating $700 and shirts and water bottles to the Cyclone Yasi affected club, which at the time lost almost everything. The Demons and Tigers recently reunited at the cup, and under-10s manager Chris Lafferty said the teams meeting again was a moment to cherish.
       </p>

        I would like to recognise some local sporting champions in the time I have remaining to speak, because we have had the privilege of announcing the latest round: Ivan Karaman, Brittany Zendler, Kieran Smith, Joel Anich, Natasha Jelacic, Hannah Le Sage, Jake Duffy, Shari Uwins,
