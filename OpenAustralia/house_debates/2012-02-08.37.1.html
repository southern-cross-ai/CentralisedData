        It is with great pleasure that I rise today to share with the House the outstanding contributions made by a wonderful woman in my community, Valerie Reid. Born in 1925, Valerie is the granddaughter of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hayles" rel="nofollow">
         Robert Hayles
        </a>
        , the founder of the pioneering Hayles Magnetic Island ferry company, which began in 1898 and over 80 years became a significant player in tourism in Queensland. After serving her country in World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        at 107 Australian General Hospital Darwin, Valerie returned to her life when in 1954 her uncle asked her to join the family business. However, Valerie found that her ambitions were never going to be accommodated in what was then a male domain. Her solution was to move to Canberra, and with the same pioneering spirit that had motivated her grandfather in 1898 Valerie decided to start a business. She submitted a tender for the first tourist launches on the newly formed

        </a>
        . Valerie said that in 1965 it was not easy being in private enterprise and trying to work with the government. In fact, it took her nine years to get a liquor licence.
       </p>
       <p>
        Valerie's tender was successful and her business brought new opportunities to Canberra and the lake, which was quickly becoming a focal point in Canberra. She pioneered a new business and a new industry in Canberra at a time when having women in business was not an everyday occurrence. She is an inspirational Canberran. I was amazed to hear that she is off to Singapore this year as part of the 70th anniversary of the war. It will be a special trip for Valerie, whose husband was a prisoner of war.
