        . What is the Albanese Labor government doing to support small business owners facing serious challenges across the country, including those who've been impacted by the ongoing flood disaster?

         I thank the member for Fraser. I also want to thank him for the work he's been doing in his community in light of the recent floods and also for his longstanding commitment to supporting small businesses in his community. We all know that small businesses are, indeed, the engine of our nation's economy. They're at the heart of our local communities right across the country, and they employ millions of Australians. Not only do small businesses help put pay cheques in people's pockets; they contribute more than $430 billion to the nation's economy every single year.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, the Albanese Labor government knows that the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing natural disasters have hit our small businesses hard. Right across Australia, including in the member for Fraser's home state, in my home state of Tasmania, and in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         and Queensland, the recent floods have been devastating. As we sit here, some people are still bracing themselves to see what can be salvaged. Our thoughts are with them, and, of course, our support is with them. We've already announced individual relief for states, but we've also announced just recently relief for small businesses in my home state of Tasmania, and we are working with the New South Wales and Victorian governments to provide additional support that may be required for small businesses in those states as they come into the recovery phase.
        </p>
        <p>
         But, even for small businesses that have escaped the wild weather, we know that rising inflation and ongoing staff shortages have added to their daily pressures.

           We're focused on helping them get through these challenges. We've already announced that we'll provide more than $15 million in the budget for small business owners to access free mental health and financial counselling support. That's more than $10.9 million that will go to the NewAccess for

             We've updated the Commonwealth Procurement Rules, which mean that small businesses will get a bigger slice of the $70 billion in contracts that the Australian government spends every year, with a 20 per cent target for small business procurement. We've introduced legislation to make unfair contract terms illegal so that small businesses can negotiate fairer agreements with large partners. And, of course, these measures sit alongside the Albanese government's wider agenda that will benefit small businesses, including our increase to the skilled migration program to address skill shortages and our cheaper child care that will mean more parents will be able to do more hours and work in small businesses. We'll provide a one-off income credit to older Australians to give them the option to work and keep more of their money, immediately helping to boost the labour market supply, and we're accelerating the delivery of 465,000 additional fee-free

             places, with 180,000 to be delivered in 2023. We know that small businesses are vital to Australia, and we'll continue to support them.
