        I rise today to recognise two significant events in our modern, multicultural Australian community. Over the last week, Hindu, Sikh and Jain communities in Australia and around the world have been celebrating Diwali. On behalf of Labor, I extend my warmest wishes to everyone on this occasion. Diwali, or the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festival_of_Lights" rel="nofollow">
         Festival of Lights
        </a>
        , is a celebration of the triumph of good over evil. The lighting of traditional earthen diyas or candles around the home symbolises the illumination of hope, wealth, peace and prosperity. Over four days, families and friends adorn their homes with colourful decorations, share sweet dishes and perfume their homes with incense in celebration of good health, knowledge and wealth as a triumph over darkness, ignorance and hate. Around Australia, lights have been shining brightly and skies have been filled with fireworks—from Canberra to Parramatta,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Place" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Adelaide—over the past week. It is an important time to reflect on those less fortunate and to be grateful for the rich traditions our modern, multicultural society has come to represent. As the steady light of the diya shines across Australia and in homes this week, may it serve as a guiding compass for all of us towards the path of unity and be the beacon with which we as a nation continue to celebrate our success as a modern, multicultural Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of Labor, I would also like to extend my best wishes to Baha'i communities in Australia and around the world as they mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of Baha'u'llah. Baha'u'llah, the prophet founder of the Baha'i faith, devoted his life to the service of God, spreading the message of peace and unity for all. Among his teachings was the recognition of earth as one country, with all humans as equal citizens, and to love the whole world as one would love their country. It is in the principles of equality and love that our modern, multicultural society thrives as a united nation of many backgrounds, cultures and faiths, and it is in celebration of our diverse communities that the Australian story is strengthened and enhanced.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over two days in October, Baha'i communities here in Australia will come together with family and friends to celebrate the life of a devoted man whose commitment to God and humanity was unwavering in the face of persecution, imprisonment and exile. We are grateful for the contribution of the Baha'i community to our nation and we are privileged to be recognising such an important milestone for the Baha'i community. To everyone across Australia who is coming together to celebrate with family and friends, we wish you prosperity and joy for the year ahead.
