        Salisbury is a suburb that sits in the middle of my electorate, a leafy suburb pocketed between four major roads, a quiet suburb that many only drive in and out of if they live there or if people are stocking up on Ballistic beer. Last Saturday, Salisbury State School was pumping. The day started with the sounds of disco music being blasted across the school oval at 8.30 am and things just got louder because Salisbury state school turned 100â€”actually last year, but delayed due to COVID.

        This year the school has experienced the highest enrolment in 35 years and there are more than 20 languages and cultural backgrounds represented there. A special part of the fete was the planting of the bicentennial tree, a blueberry ash planted with help from the magnificent Rotary club of Salisbury. It will grow into a dense green canopy with masses of pink flowers and a worthy replacement for the school's giant fig, lost last year. Congratulations to principal Darren Ball, the P&amp;C convenors and all of the volunteers and local sponsors who made the day possible, especially a big call out to Ballistic Beer, a local brewery and a sponsor that I'm always happy to personally support.
