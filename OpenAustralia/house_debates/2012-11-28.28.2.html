       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge Tracey Worner, of the Perth Lever Action Rifle Club. Earlier this year, Tracey won the lever action rifle ladies national championship. I am told that this title does not come easily, as the event is held over three days using three different rifles, with a separate event held on each day. At just 22 years of age, Tracey's hard work and dedication paid off at the 2012 championships, and this was reflected by her title as Ladies 2012 National Champion.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the past five years, Tracey has consistently been silver medallist at the club level and has taken away many ladies state championship individual event awards. Tracey is known at the Perth Lever Action Rifle Club as a pocket dynamo and is as far removed as anyone could imagine from the stereotype of a sporting shooter. I recently had the opportunity to meet and congratulate Tracey and hear more about her passion for her sport. Tracey owes much of her success to her dad and her brother, who have coached her and helped her develop her shooting talent while at the same time allowing her to retain her individual style. I congratulate Tracey on winning the Ladies 2012 National Champion title and wish her all the best with her future in sports shooting.
