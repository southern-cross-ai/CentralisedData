        On Monday I had the very great pleasure of attending Diamond Creek East Primary School in the Scullin electorate for their regular assembly. It is always a pleasure to be with Diamond Creek East—their principal Rob Rostolis does a fantastic job—but it was a particular privilege to be there on Monday, because my attendance was to present a couple of certificates to the school and a particular teacher. The school was awarded the Victorian Anzac Day schools award for this year, which was a tremendous achievement. It follows on from also winning in 2011, showing the real strength of the school community. I was thrilled that there was a recognition not only of the community at large but also of the contribution of teacher

        , who received an individual award. This was, I think, just recognition for the extraordinary work Shane put into organising quite a spectacular event that involved not only Diamond Creek East Primary school but a wide range of primary schools—and a high school as well—across that part of the Scullin electorate, bringing together more than 2,000 students for what was a very moving and entirely appropriate tribute to the Centenary of Anzac and its connection to the communities of Melbourne's north-east. The Diamond Creek East school community deserves to be congratulated and the leadership of Rob Rostolis and Shane Nelson acknowledged. It was a real privilege to be there to share in the journey they undertook through their Anzac heritage and the journey they will continue to undertake in connecting the past of their area to its bright future.
