       <p>
        I rise to discuss a wonderful and momentous celebration that occurred on the weekend in my electorate of Perth, within the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Perth" rel="nofollow">
         City of Perth
        </a>
        . It occurs every year, and on 19 November it was time for the annual
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_Parade" rel="nofollow">
         Pride Parade
        </a>
        to commence—there is a reason why my voice has been a bit hoarse in the course of this week! I am very proud to have marched alongside my comrades in Rainbow Labor in the parade. The parade was a wonderful occasion that started on Brisbane Street, went down the heart of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Street" rel="nofollow">
         William Street
        </a>
        in Northbridge and then finished on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Street" rel="nofollow">
         Lake Street
        </a>
        . There were thousands of people involved in the parade, and the overwhelming theme of the parade was 'Love wins'. Under the banner of 'Love wins,' I was very proud to march alongside other members of the Labor Party—my federal colleagues from this place, my state colleagues, and also local candidates in the upcoming state election, including our candidate from

        , Simon Millman—alongside a Rainbow Labor banner, proudly advocating for marriage equality.
       </p>
       <p>
        What resonated all the way through that march was the feedback from the community—mums and dads, kids, grandmas and grandpas—all of whom were only too happy to join in the chorus advocating for marriage equality. You see, Madam Deputy Speaker, it is overwhelmingly clear that, just because the legislation may have slipped off the radar in this place, the desire and sentiment in our community to make marriage equality a reality has not diminished one single bit. There was uniform endorsement for Labor's position, as we proudly marched along the streets on Saturday night advocating for marriage equality. The reason for the hoarseness of my voice is because I started the chant—perhaps not being the most seasoned campaigner!—right at the start of the march, before realising that I had to keep my tone and passion up for the entire 45 minutes or so. But I tell you what, it was fantastic. I am glad I went out so hard and so early, and maintained the rage, because every single step along the way was met with a glowing affirmation to my calls: 'What do we want?'—'Marriage equality!' And, 'When do we want it?'—'Right now!' And that was precisely what we said from start to finish. Well done, Rainbow Labor—well done, Sonia; well done, Oskar; well done, Andy; well done, Brock—maintain the rage.
