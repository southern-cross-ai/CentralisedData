        My question is the Prime Minister. Gay and Lesbian Health Victoria, in a submission to a Senate inquiry into a plebiscite on marriage equality, has said that putting the question of marriage equality to a plebiscite will allow extreme forms of homophobic abuse to be aired and treated as 'reasonable and just', which will have a major impact on—

          Thank you, Mr Speaker. My question is the Prime Minister.

           I thank the opposition leader for his question, but I have to say that I am very disappointed at his lack of faith in the Australian people. He thinks so little of the people of this country that he does not believe we are capable of having a civil debate on a matter of this importance. He is so frightened of public debate that he wants to shut the people out. I thought that he would be saying, 'Don't have a plebiscite; it costs a lot of money.' That is a good point; it does cost a lot of money. But, no, his opposition to a plebiscite is because he does not want people to be able to express their views. He is worried that, in a free debate, there may be some views expressed which he finds unpalatable. Let me tell you, I have great faith in the decency, in the common sense, in the humanity and in the wisdom of the Australian people, and, if there are unruly voices heard, they will be drowned out by the common sense, the respect and the general humanity of our people. We are capable of great things in this country.

           We have done great things, and one of the greatest things we do is we practise democracy. Every day, we should be able to conduct public discourse in a civil manner—in a respectful manner. I have great faith that the Australian people, in that plebiscite, as they have in one contentious issue after another for the whole time this Commonwealth has been one, will be able to debate this issue in a sensible, civil and intelligent manner so that the Australian people—and every single one of them, not just 226 members of parliament and senators—every single one of them will have their say. I know, the honourable member knows, everyone in this House knows and every Australian should know that when the Australian people make their decision, that decision will stick. It will be decisive. It will be respected by this government, by this parliament and by this nation.
