        The Woolgoolga Surf Life Saving Club will host the last round of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        boat series on 17 March. They're a great club, and it was great in 2016 to give them $1 million of federal government money to relocate the clubhouse, because they badly need a new clubhouse.
       </p>
       <p>
        The club competed at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_West_Rocks" rel="nofollow">
         South West Rocks
        </a>
        a fortnight ago and came away with six medals from six events. Gold medals were won in the open men's, the open ladies' and the men's 180 masters. Silver medals were picked up by the men's masters 120 and the ladies' masters, with the reserve grade men bringing home the bronze.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are 52 crews, across seven categories, competing in the championship, with Woolgoolga currently leading the open men's, open women's and women's masters, while men's masters and reserve men are in second place. As a club, Woolgoolga is holding second place, with the final round, which will be at home, worth double points.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to wish the three sweeps, Darren McSkimming,

        and Neil Baker, plus their crews, all the best on 17 March. Thank you also to President Les Pepper and Vice President Bob Wright. A special thanks to Woolgoolga's Director of Lifesaving, Brian Sedivy, who is responsible for making sure the beach patrols are in place, and the

        Congratulations also to the Yamba Surf Life Saving Club for an outstanding result at the

       </p>
       <p>
        I also congratulate the Minnie Water-Wooli Surf Life Saving Club, to whom I was happy to give, the other day, a small grant to get a new boat. Their under-23 women's boat crew won a silver medal and their under-19 male boat crew won a bronze at the recent New South Wales lifesaving country championships. Young nipper Eliza Berrick won two silvers and Tony Dougherty won a silver in his masters surf race. It was a great effort from the club. Well done to everyone!
