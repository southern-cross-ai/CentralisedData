       <p>
        I rise today to congratulate the St George Basketball Association on its great success in the 2014 season and on its recent presentation night. The presentation night, which was held at Penshurst
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        , was a great opportunity to congratulate the players on their successes during the year. This year I have commenced the Banks Outstanding Sporting Achievement Awards, and I was very pleased to present the first group of awards to players from the St George Basketball Association. Special congratulations go to Justin Beer, James Corben, Billy Da Silva Harisis, Dean Stojanovski, Lionel Liu and Ethan Hartzenberg, all of whom won awards on the evening. St George Basketball had a great year, with its under 12 men's team winning the

         Metro League
        </a>
        grand final. The under18 mens White team also won the grand final, while the under 16 mens Red team reached the finals of both the Metro League and the State Cup.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to congratulate Penshurst RSL on its sponsorship of the association. Penshurst RSL is one of the bedrocks of our community, and I thank its management and board for its generous support of groups across the St George region. I would also like to congratulate the St George Basketball Association's President Ray Barbi, who forcefully advocates on behalf of the basketball community in the Banks area. Congratulations are also due to the presentation night

        Byron Geddes, whose wit and style kept the crowd entertained throughout the evening. I look forward to continuing to work with this important community group.
