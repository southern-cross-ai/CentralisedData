       <p>
        On Saturday, 11 October I attended the Kingsway
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Athletics" rel="nofollow">
         Little Athletics
        </a>
        Centre for the opening of their season. I have the highest regard for the concept of Little Athletics. We in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        know that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kylie_Wheeler" rel="nofollow">
         Kylie Wheeler
        </a>
        of Girrawheen, that great Olympic heptathlete, started her athletic career in Little Athletics in our local area. While there I spoke with Brendon Palmer, the president of the Landsdale Little Athletics club, and his wife, Jennifer. The other senior officials are Paul Del Prete, Imraan Alexander and Samantha Trewin. While I thank them for their committed and long-term volunteering to the young athletes in the club, I also pay tribute to the many other volunteers who help run the training and competition days at Landsdale. From the well-presented uniforms and conduct, you can see that the Landsdale club is a well-run club and a credit to the parents, volunteers and athletes.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of those athletes is Terrell McKenzie, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TJ" rel="nofollow">
         TJ
        </a>
        , who represented Western Australia at the Australian Little Athletics Championships in April. Terrell won a bronze medal in the 80 metres hurdles and came eighth in the shot-put and 10th in the discus. He also won the Kingsway Centre Championships in the under-13s 100 metres, 80 metres hurdles, long jump, shot-put and javelin.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to mention two of the other up-and-coming Landsdale and I think future WA state athletes. Carly Trewin is now an under-12 who has been competing for seven years. At the state Little Athletics championships in March she won four silver medals for the hurdles and throwing events. I am also informed that Shakeel Alexander, now also an under-12, won three gold and two silver medals at those state championships. They are great talents for the future of Landsdale Little Athletics club and Western Australia.
