       <p>
        I rise to acknowledge the talented young individuals in my electorate who represent Darwin and Palmerston in sporting competitions all over the Territory, Australia and the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the recent round of the Solomon Local Sporting Champions grants, 19 passionate young sports men and women will receive $500 each to go towards travel costs when they travel away from home for their sporting competitions.
       </p>
       <p>
        The feedback I get from their parents is that these grants, however small they may seem, are a great help in alleviating some of the pressures experienced by Territory families in meeting the ongoing costs associated with participating in sporting competitions that require our young Territorians to travel away from home.
       </p>
       <p>
        My committee and I had extreme difficulty in choosing 19 recipients out of more than 60 athletes and officials who applied for these grants. I would like to thank my committee, who gave up their time to assist me in selecting the recipients. Thanks to Jarred Illett, Territory Thunder

        Congratulations to all of these talented sports stars. I encourage unsuccessful applicants to reapply for the grants in the future. It is always inspiring to learn of the talented local sports people we have in the Territory. It is also a great opportunity to promote those sports that are not always in the spotlight. From calisthenics to roller derby, it is great to hear about our lesser-known but equally important sports. I look forward to hearing how the recipients go at their upcoming competitions. I know that they will do well. I am looking forward to them representing the Territory and making us proud. I look forward to meeting them all at our afternoon tea in the coming weeks, so that they can share stories of their experiences. I look forward to meeting Abbey Holmes, another fantastic Australian sports star, who is going to be hosting the afternoon tea for me.
