        I would like to take this opportunity to celebrate some of the wonderful achievements of schools in Forde. I begin by recognising the efforts of Kimberley College. For the second year running they have claimed the title of the highest fundraising school in Australia for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Vision" rel="nofollow">
         World Vision
        </a>
        . Students involved in this year's fundraising efforts raised $44,000. This is a very impressive effort and a credit to the school principal, Mr Paul Thomson, the staff, the students and their parents.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last month, Mount Warren Park
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_School" rel="nofollow">
         State School
        </a>
        encouraged students to dress in colours representing special positive behaviours under the school-wide Positive Behaviour Support framework. This is a fantastic initiative aimed at creating a positive learning environment, and I commend the principal, Colin Torr, and the school community for their efforts. I know from talking to the children at their recent end-of-year celebrations that they had a great time undertaking this activity.
       </p>
       <p>
        All our schools recognise the importance of building positive cultures not only from within the schools but also within the wider community. Eagleby State School are another example of this positive attitude. For the past four years, they have been partnering with seniors nearby at Palm Lakes Resort on a volunteer program. From Anzac Day to volunteering for reading projects, the homework club and in many other classroom activities, the local seniors have been assisting students at Eagleby State School. One of the activities includes students working together with teachers and the senior volunteers, taking vegetables and herbs from the school's garden each week. The children are encouraged to eat fresh foods and prepare a weekly healthy lunch that they all sit down to enjoy together.
       </p>
       <p>
        Principal Suzanne Jolley also arranges for seniors to volunteer at the school's annual Grandparent Day, filling the gaps in children's lives where there is no grandparent around. In addition, the volunteers also fill the gap for some children where there are no parents around. This is a fantastic arrangement, and I congratulate the school and the volunteers from Palm Lakes Resort in Eagleby for their tremendous work with the school and the local community.
       </p>

        As I have mentioned previously in the House, we have some amazing young sports men and women in the electorate of Forde.

        had two of their students, Elise Downing and Monika Woodhouse, selected to represent Australia in shooting at the Oceanic Games which were held in Sydney at the end of November. I congratulate both students on their outstanding achievements.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have also had the opportunity recently to spend some time with a 10-year-old football star, Joshua Moreland. As many in this place would know, I am a fan of football, more commonly known as soccer. A couple of weeks ago, I spent some time with Joshua, a young football dynamo, who, at the age of 10, has already been asked to attend a training camp next year in England for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Ham_United" rel="nofollow">
         West Ham United
        </a>
        . Joshua is the youngest sportsperson I have met in Forde who has reached international level. He will represent Australia in London next year and has been selected in a futsal team to represent Australia in the United States in the middle of next year as well. When asked who he would like to play for if he makes the professional grade, Joshua patriotically answered: 'Australia, of course. You've got to support your country.' And who knows? This talented youngster, just 10 years old, might very well make it to that level. He may well be a Socceroo in the years to come; he is certainly one to watch and a credit to our community in Forde.
