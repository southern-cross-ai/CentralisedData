        I wish to raise the case of Truong Thi Lan Anh, better known as Annie. She is an eight-year-old Vietnamese girl. Her condition was brought to my attention by my great friend Eric Noel. She is a beautiful young girl from Vietnam—no Australian is at fault here. She has a very serious craniofacial cleft with encephaloceles. It is a terminal condition which is nevertheless treatable. She has approximately a year in which to get her treatment. Mr

        . I would urge any members of this House or the community to contribute. Approximately $60,000 has been raised, I am advised, and a further $40,000 has to be raised. I will be approaching the Minister for

        to seek her assistance. This girl is not an Australian citizen; the government has no duty here. I will also be approaching citizens and placing contact details for donations on the website. To any member of the public listening, $10, $15 or $20 will help reach the goal and help this beautiful young girl. It is an important thing that we can do and I commend Annie’s case to the House.
