        The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSTO" rel="nofollow">
         ANSTO
        </a>
        , is proposing to construct a new intermediate-level solid waste storage facility at its
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Heights" rel="nofollow">
         Lucas Heights
        </a>
        campus in Sydney. The new building will store radioactive waste on an interim basis until the proposed National Radioactive Waste Management Facility is operational. This waste is primarily the by-product of nuclear medicine production, which benefits approximately 12,000 Australians every week.
       </p>
       <p>
        ANSTO is responsible for the safe interim storage and predisposal management of its radioactive waste. The existing Lucas Heights storage facility is forecast to reach capacity from 2027. The National Radioactive Waste Management Facility is unlikely to commence receiving waste until after 2030. The interim solution will bridge the gap between the expiration of the existing storage capacity and the National Radioactive Waste Management Facility operations. The estimated cost of the works is $59.8 million, excluding

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The works must be referred to, considered by and reported on to both houses of parliament by The Public Works Committee before work may commence. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction activity is expected to commence on January 2024 with completion expected in August 2025. I commend the motion to the House.

        Research Station Modernisation Project.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment is proposing to redevelop the scientific research station and associated infrastructure on Macquarie Island. This includes the renewal of field huts, which are dispersed across Macquarie Island, and the decommissioning and removal of redundant assets. The project will address hazards to the use and operation of the research station associated with the poor condition of existing assets, address high-risk issues associated with the siting of facilities and reduce ongoing operating costs by rationalising and consolidating similar functions. The project will contribute to a key part of the Australian Antarctic strategy, which is to establish Australia's position of science leadership in Antarctica through the development of modern and flexible infrastructure, including more efficient and flexible use of existing research stations. The estimated cost of the works is $49.8 million, excluding GST.
