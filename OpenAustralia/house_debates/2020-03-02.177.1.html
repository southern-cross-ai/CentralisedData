        In early September 2015, my community was faced with a terrible shock. Splashed across the front page of the

        was: 'red zone'; 'contamination'. Commercial fisheries were closed down. Residents in Williamtown, Salt Ash and Fullerton Cove were told: 'Don't eat your eggs. Don't drink the water. Don't eat your fruit and vegetables.' It was the most awful time. They had been infiltrated by

        base had leached into their land, their water and their bodies.

        Fast-forward through 4½ long years of speeches, committees, two Senate inquiries, a joint standing committee inquiry, tears, long-drawn-out articles—it was just the most traumatic experience for these people. But they would not be held back by their own government. They launched a class action—the first one of its kind in Australia—and last Tuesday-Wednesday, after a cancelled trial and failed mediation, they had a victory. A presettlement agreement had been made by the lawyers from Defence and the lawyers from our class action.

        I just want to say a heartfelt thanks to my community. You have fought so hard. I am so proud to be your local member. I have used every tactic, strategy and tool at my disposal to walk this journey with you. And we have won. Well done, Williamtown! I wanted you to have options, and now you do.
