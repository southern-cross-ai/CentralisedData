       <p>
        in the first instance, I want to identify with the member for Scullin with regard to the death of Wendy Jenkinsâ€”Dr Harry's wife and Harry Jenkins' mother. They have made a great contribution to this parliament and to the nation. The loss of a mother would be a cause of great grief for their wonderful family.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to identify with the words of Bishop Philip Huggins from Melbourne, who has decided that he is prepared to stand up and say publicly that he does not want
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
         AFL
        </a>
        football played on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Good_Friday" rel="nofollow">
         Good Friday
        </a>
        . I want to join him in that call. As Bishop Huggins said, this is the observance of the death of the living God,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus_Christ" rel="nofollow">
         Jesus Christ
        </a>
        , who actually changed the world completely, and we as a nation have addressed that observance by not having football on Good Friday.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a child we were never allowed to play football on a Sunday. The world has changed and we have changed slowly with it. But I would put to you, Deputy Speaker, that Bishop Huggins is at least standing up for a group of people in Australia who are called Christians who want to observer that particular day. We may be, as called, a secular country now, but I put to you the importance of Good Friday and its observance by saying, 'We are not going to play AFL on Good Friday.' I support Philip Huggins and all who travel within him on his train of glory.
