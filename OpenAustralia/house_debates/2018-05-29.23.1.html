        Homelessness amongst Australian women is increasing. The number of older women couch surfing has nearly doubled in four years. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Salvation Army
        </a>
        is providing a vital service in supporting these women. ABS data shows that, on Census Night 2016, homelessness amongst women in Victoria was up 8.3 per cent in five years. According to the Council to Homeless Persons, women are more likely to be at risk of homelessness because of inherent financial disadvantage, the fact that they're more likely to be in casual and low-paid employment, the fact that they have lower super and savings due to time out of the workforce caring for children, and the compounding affect of family violence, which continues to be a major driver of homelessness.

        The past weekend saw the Salvation Army's Red Shield Appeal doorknock get underway across Australia, including across my electorate of

         The Salvation Army
        </a>
        has played an important role in our communities, including Leongatha, Moe, Warragul and Wonthaggi. Beginning in 1965, and each year since, the Salvation Army have appealed to the Australian community for donations towards their welfare and community service programs as part of the Red Shield Appeal. Funds raised through the Red Shield Appeal help the Salvation Army deliver a range of important services. Amongst these are family welfare assistance, refuges for women and children in crisis, youth drop-in centres and support programs, and rural and outback chaplains, as well as homeless shelters. They have provided for me and many others a welcome service to the communities we represent.
