        Mallee is a proud agricultural electorate. Recently, I travelled through the electorate and dropped into Longerenong Agricultural College. This is a fine institution training up tomorrow's top producers. This was my third visit to the historic college, and I had the pleasure of meeting their new general manager, Avril Hogan. I am very encouraged by the direction that Australia's agricultural industry is heading in. Longerenong Ag College, fondly known as 'Longy', hosts over 100 students on campus at any one time, many of whom will pave the way for the future of food and fibre productivity as we head towards a $100 billion ag industry by 2030. I am told that the majority of applicants for next year are female, which is truly encouraging.
       </p>
       <p>
        These students stream in from all regional corners of Australia, with Victorians, Tasmanians,

        and Queenslanders represented in their cohort. Even Australian universities in metropolitan areas are sending students there. Graduates are job-ready. I'm pleased to report that Longerenong boasts a 95 per cent employment rate for graduates on completion of their studies. That is truly astounding. Longerenong has an enviable reputation in training, mentoring and educating leaders in the ag industry. The college provides an excellent academic environment for students, embedded in research and practice, with plenty of hands-on training. Longerenong is on the front foot, looking for opportunities to partner in research. Vision and innovation in research and development provides students with hands-on experience and cutting-edge technology in farming. This ensures that future Australian farmers will continue to develop competitive advantages in the global market.

        As we venture into the next phase of our nation's history and look to reduce emissions and improve the stewardship of our land, innovation will drive our agriculture and horticultural industries. We are a government committed to doing what is necessary to manage emissions without destroying our economy, and it is encouraging that we have institutions like Longerenong which are investing in creative solutions to reduce emissions through adaptive technologies. It is encouraging to hear that Avril is looking to expand and develop partnerships in this space. One technology that I'm particularly interested in is the emergence of seaweed technologies in livestock feed. I spoke with Avril about the Australian Sustainable Seaweed Alliance. Fifty milligrams of seaweed in a bovine's gut can reduce methane emissions by 90 per cent while increasing productivity by 20 per cent. This is quite remarkable.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Morrison-Joyce government is backing innovative technologies for Australia's future industries. We are directing $30.7 million over six years towards these promising feed technologies. The Low Emissions Supplements to Grazing Animals at Scale program will provide $23 million in funding to help develop technologies that deliver low-emissions feed supplements to grazing animals. Our $6 million Methane Emissions Reduction in Livestock program supports research into the abatement potential and productivity benefits of livestock feed technology.
       </p>
       <p>
        The future is also looking bright in sustainable land management strategies. Longerenong college is investing in soil management strategies and training students in stewardship techniques to ensure sustainable productivity. These solutions include planting summer crops to break up and protect the soil. I am pleased to say that this side of the House is also working to reward farmers for good land management through the Agriculture Biodiversity Stewardship Package. This package demonstrates the potential for financial returns to farmers by piloting projects that deliver biodiversity outcomes and enhance remnant vegetation.

        -National government will also soon begin consultation to develop legislation that will support new income streams for farmers who improve biodiversity outcomes on their land, and so we should. Farmers are the most committed to soil health, as their livelihood depends on it. This proposed legislation will be designed to deliver a range of benefits, including opportunities for farmers to earn additional income by delivering sustainability outcomes. It will recognise that farmers already deliver environmental services and incentivise others in the sector to engage in these practices. The proposed legislation would build on the success of previous pilot programs and develop a long-term pathway to market for farmers.
