       <p>
        On Saturday, 12 March, I had the pleasure of opening the Proston show in the south of my electorate of Flynn. The Proston show is the first of the regional shows, and is a credit to their community. It is the first opportunity for exhibitors to prepare their stock for showing on the regional circuit and, of course, at the Brisbane Ekka.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Proston region has suffered from the recent constant rain, and I would like to congratulate all exhibitors for their mighty effort to present such magnificent animals. The cattle, horses and poultry were in great condition, and it was a pleasure to present the winning ribbons to the proud owners. And the contributions in the baking competition, cake decoration, needlework and floral arranging were outstanding. I was delighted to see so many children participating in the various events, the horse jumping being my favourite. The whip cracking and wood chopping also drew good crowds.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations to the President, Anthony Rosser, who actually manages a cattle property consisting of 20,000 head not so far away from Proston, and to the Secretary, Glenda McArdle, and their committee for a wonderful day. I also thank the Proston community for supporting such a wonderful event.
