       <p>
        I rise with great pleasure in this parliament today to table a petition of over 17,000 citizens of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        . The purpose of this petition is to draw the attention of this House and the government to the urgent need for the establishment of a radiotherapy unit on the Central Coast. At the moment there are many people who are suffering great hardship, who are obviously sick and who have to make an arduous journey either to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         North Sydney
        </a>
        or to the Hunter. This is a situation that must change. This petition rightly draws attention to this issue and to the fact that the people of the Central Coast are suffering because of the lack of this service.
       </p>
       <p>
        They do have other options. They can have radiotherapy at a private clinic and pay many thousands of dollars, but that is often out of their reach. Alternatively, they can not have the treatment at all. Unfortunately and distressingly, some people on the Central Coast have actually taken that option, bearing in mind that they did not feel that they could suffer that arduous journey nor could they afford the cost of the private treatment. It is extraordinarily heartbreaking to hear that sort of situation. Certainly, I have made very strong representations to the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
         Health and Ageing
        </a>
        ,

        </a>
        , raising this situation with her. I have made a commitment to the coast and the people there that I will not rest until this is achieved, and I will continue to raise this issue in the parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish to particularly thank those citizens of the Central Coast who took the time to sign this petition. Some 17,367 people signed this petition, and many businesses and the councils of Gosford and Wyong not only assisted but also allowed these petitions to be placed in public places such as their libraries. So I particularly thank those people who assisted in that way as well as, of course,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathy_Smith" rel="nofollow">
         Kathy Smith
        </a>
        from Cancer Voices, who also did a great deal of work in this regard, and the many other volunteers from Cancer Voices on the Central Coast who assisted. I thank the chamber for their indulgence, and I urge the parliament and the government to take every step necessary to resolve this problem.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The petition read as followsâ€”
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This petition of citizens of the Central Coast region of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        draws the attention of the House to the urgent need for a public radiotherapy unit to treat cancer patients and others on the Central Coast of New South Wales, who at present are experiencing considerable hardship, being forced to travel long distances or pay for treatment at a private clinic or, in some cases, give up treatment altogether.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We therefore ask the House to pursue all means to provide funding for the establishment of a public radiotherapy unit on the Central Coast.
