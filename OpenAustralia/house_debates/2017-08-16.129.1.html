        Colleagues, my conversation topic today, representing my constituency, is about what's happening on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manus_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Manus Island
        </a>
        in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . The planned closure of the regional processing centre and the withdrawal of medical care, trauma support and security services by the end of October are adding to a highly stressful situation for those asylum seekers remaining there. I find it personally extraordinarily distressing. But, much more importantly, as a member of parliament, my constituents find it distressing. My office is flooded with letters, with phone calls and with calls of the heart, 'Cathy, what are we as a nation doing?' So I say to my constituents: I'm bringing this case to this parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm talking on behalf of the members of Rural Australians for Refugees based in Wangaratta. Bernadette, Liz, Jackie, Margaret, Marie, Linda, Patrick, Vanida, Delphina and Ken, I hear your call. The large number of people in my electorate who have come together under the Northern Victoria Refugees Network, I hear your call. John and Heather Myer of Yackandandah tell me of the 'unbelievable inhumane and criminal treatment on Manus occurring right now'. They tell me that they are 'totally shocked and appalled' and they say that for 'anyone to be denied access to water, food, shelter and sanitation' is not right.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have sought and received a briefing from the relevant minister and his office, and his staff have explained to me the process and the logic of what's going on. While I totally get the logic of it, I don't get the heart of it. I don't get how we, as a nation, can be so legalistic in our approach. Of course it's important to follow the rulesâ€”but to lose our heart, to lose our care? So to my community, to Helen Morris, to Candi and to Elaine Mann I say: I don't know what else I can do. I bring your call of the heart here to the parliament and I have talked to my colleagues here in the parliament. I say, 'We as a nation are much better than this; we are so good at solving so many complex problems and we have a problem in Manus. We know we do, but it's not a reason not to apply our best selves. It's not a reason not to apply our Christian principles of love your neighbour as yourself.'
       </p>
       <p>
        I stood in the House this morning and said the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord's_Prayer" rel="nofollow">
         Lord's Prayer
        </a>
        with my colleagues. I'm proud to be part of a Christian nation, but I don't see that what we're doing in Manus is that. I think we're a legalistic nation and we're forgetting that, while the law is important, the heart is more important. As a nation, we need to hear the call of the heart of my constituents. I know every single member of parliament is hearing the same call.
