        My question is to the Prime Minister. In light of the Chinese foreign minister's visit to Australia, what progress has been made in stabilising the relationship between our two countries?

         I thank the member for Chisholm, who understands that it's not just a matter of our relationship with the world and our place in the world. It's also, because we're a multicultural nation, about our cohesiveness as a society here. The world is of course confronting serious challenges and economic headwinds, and what happens internationally does matter at home. We know that one in four jobs in Australia are trade dependent, and this government has made it a priority for Australia to take our seat at the table, to speak out for our interests and to shape decisions, not just respond to them. It's how we get results for Australiansâ€”for jobs, for trade, for our economy and also for our national security.

         Last year, I was pleased to be the first Australian PM to visit China since 2016. We know this is one of our most important relationships, and it was good to meet foreign minister

         . It has been a constructive visit to Australia, discussing the stabilisation of our relationship and following up from my visit to China. In particular, the removal of trade impediments has been a big plus for Australian agriculture, for Australian resources and for Australian jobs, and we look forward to the interim decision on wine carrying through to a decision which will mean substantial job creation in the

        </p>
        <p>
         Our approach has been patient. It's been calibrated and it's been deliberate. It's a mature and responsible approach that has stabilised the relationship without compromising any of our core interests. I've said that we'll cooperate where we can and we'll disagree where we must, but we'll engage in our national interest. And it is paying dividends. Minister Wang Yi's visit gave us an opportunity to reinforce our views as well about maritime security issues and other consular cases that are of concern.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm pleased that Premier Li has accepted my invitation for our leaders' meeting to occur in the coming months here in Australia. Consistent dialogue is crucial. We'll continue to engage in that patient, deliberate and calibrated matter that has defined and characterised the way that we've responded to these issues.
