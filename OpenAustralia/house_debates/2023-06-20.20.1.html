       <p>
        This morning I met with Rachel Bernardo, 38, and Jodie Elisara, 35, both from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Deception Bay
        </a>
        , and Sarah Chaundy, 33, from Rothwell. All of these women have been diagnosed with early-onset bowel cancer. They're here raising awareness of Bowel Cancer Australia's Never2Young campaign. They, alongside 49 others, are all here trying to spread the word. Bowel cancer is the deadliest cancer for Australians aged 25 to 44 and is the sixth-leading cause of death in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rachel, diagnosed at just 38, had stomach pains that were dismissed as constipation. Sarah was diagnosed at just 33. When her
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        tests revealed some abnormalities, it was suggested that she change her diet and monitor. Without her private health cover, she would not be here today. Jodie, diagnosed at 35 after her symptoms had been dismissed for five years, had a 15-month wait for a colonoscopy in a Queensland public hospital, when the recommended clinical time frame is 30 days.
       </p>
       <p>
        All of us here in this place have a chance to advocate. We encourage everyone in our electorates to get checked. If you're over 50, make sure you do the free bowel cancer screening test and return it. Get educated. If you're concerned, get a colonoscopy immediately. We're also advocating for a younger screening age.
