       <p>
        Improving access to quality and affordable child care for families in my electorate is one of my priorities. In government, the coalition lifted the $10,560 limit on the childcare subsidy, making it easier for parents to return to work or take up more hours. This benefited an estimated 18,000 families in Moore. This change predominantly supported women, who represent the majority of primary carers, by reducing childcare costs and giving parents more flexibility around their working arrangements.
       </p>
       <p>
        By securing federal grants, several early learning centres in my electorate have recently benefited from capital improvements, including new nature play areas at the Mullaloo Community Kindergarten, Davallia Primary School, Kallaroo Threes Playgroup and Padbury Primary School, delivered through the Stronger Communities Program. However, a number of childcare centres in my electorate still have unmet needs for maintenance and upgrades. I recently visited the Padbury Community Kindergarten and the Marmion Avenue Community Child Care Centre, at the invitation of members of their respective committees, to discuss applying for funding to help maintain and upgrade their current facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Padbury Community Kindergarten has been operating at its current premises for 40 years. The ageing building requires significant upgrades to ensure the children have access to a modern learning environment. This includes upgrades to the outdoor play area, classroom facilities, additional storage and essential building maintenance. I look forward to working with the committee, the City of Joondalup and the WA state government to secure the necessary funding to upgrade the kindergarten and provide modern facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Similarly, the Marmion Avenue Community Child Care Centre, in Carine, has a range of fantastic facilities that allow the children to thrive in their learning environment. As a not-for-profit organisation, the centre is seeking federal funding to establish a community garden, build a storage shed and upgrade the playground. I look forward to working with the committee to secure the necessary funding for the centre to service the childcare needs of the Carine community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Providing more affordable and accessible child care will assist working parents in my electorate to minimise the cost of living, return to work and be productive members of the workforce.
