        This week I rise to recognise Bendigo Foodshare. Bendigo Foodshare is essentially our wholesaler for food relief in our region. It takes donations from a number of producers in the region as well as having food arrive on a daily basis from Foodbank Victoria. It provides at least 30 schools and 20 agencies with donated food for food relief. Unfortunately, they are becoming busier and busier. Recently was Anti-Poverty Week, and I took the time to go out and meet with Bendigo Foodshare to hear the stories from the volunteers and to meet with some of the agencies who rely on Bendigo Foodshare.
       </p>
       <p>
        Anti-Poverty Week recognises that people within all of our communities need our help, and if we come together we can help make their lives a little bit better. It is the role of everybody to help play a role in reducing poverty. Bendigo Foodshare is an example of this in my electorate. Bendigo Foodshare is a community not-for-profit organisation with a local board and staffed by volunteers. They have only one, part-time paid staff member who ensures the organisation keeps going. The rest is up to the volunteers. They have created links with approximately 30 retailers and food producers in the region, including

        </a>
        Castlemaine, who produce bacon, and Hazeldene's and PepperGreen Farm. These are some of the many producers who donate excess product to the organisationâ€”individual organisations and businesses coming together to understand that poverty does exist locally and that we all need to play our part in ensuring that we meet this challenge.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently Bendigo Foodshare launched an appeal and on their first day raised $36,000. They, like many not-for-profit organisations, require funding to ensure that they continue to meet the needs of the most vulnerable in our community. Bendigo is rallying to ensure that Foodshare does continue to operate; however, they need to raise $100,000 by June next year or wind back operations. Many of the volunteers are concerned about what that would mean for our local agencies. Unfortunately, right now demand for their services continues to increase. But I am sure the board chair, Cathy Steele, and the board members will continue to do a fantastic job and meet this challenge.
