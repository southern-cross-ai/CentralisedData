       <p>
        There are three words to describe the Turnbull government: chaos, division and dysfunction. Time and again we're seeing this government ripping itself apart while ordinary working Australians are left behind in its wake. This includes more than 650,000 Australians who are being ripped off every day by payday loan sharks, whilst the Prime Minister fights for his survival against the hunger games that the member of Dickson has now unleashed in this parliamentâ€”and the member for Deakin as well, the only member of this parliament trying to escape from the ministry of the current Turnbull government.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is 1,111 days since those opposite acknowledged there was a problem with the out-of-control payday loans sector and initiated a review. What's happened in the meantime? The Minister for Revenue and Financial Services has been rolled by the hard Right. The Deputy Prime Minister has now been rolled by the hard Right of the National Party. And now we see the member for Deakin trying to roll the Prime Minister. They are only interested in themselves.
       </p>
       <p>
        To the Abbott-Turnbull-Dutton government: take a note. Stop fighting amongst yourselves and start fighting for Australians. Time and time again you've been shown that the people of Australia are sick and tired of this behaviour. As a result, there is no policy, no direction, no idea and no future for this country under a Turnbull-Dutton government.
