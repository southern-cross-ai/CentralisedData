        I rise today to acknowledge the work that people do in our community of Capricornia, specifically those who teach at university and the young people who carry out projects under the

        university's Rockhampton campus are being recognised with prestigious Australian government teaching awards.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate local academics and professional university staff who received citations for outstanding contributions to student learning through the Turnbull-Joyce government's 2016 Australian Awards for University Teaching. Academic Julie Fleming won an individual citation while Rockhampton's CQU educational technology team, featuring Colin Beer, Damien Clark and Rolley Tickner, received a team citation. These awards recognise the significant commitment and achievement of university teachers and professional staff in my electorate of Capricornia. Recently these teachers were among many community groups, such as Meals on Wheels,

        </a>
        , who were invited to lunch with the Prime Minister in Rockhampton to mark their contribution to our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Meanwhile, the Turnbull-Joyce government's Green Army Program continues to be successful in my electorate of Capricornia. Several Green Army teams of young people have completed work on important community projects in the Rockhampton and Livingstone shires. I was delighted to meet up with both groups. One group worked on projects at Yeppoon. This Green Army team included

         Conservation Volunteers Australia
        </a>
