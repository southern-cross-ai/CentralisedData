       <p>
        I am proud to inform the federal parliament of the work of the Petrie
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">
         SES
        </a>
        . In communities across Australia, when natural disasters strike
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Emergency_Service" rel="nofollow">
         State Emergency Service
        </a>
        volunteers are vital to our community's response. The SES provides search and rescue services in emergencies, protects people and property and helps communities prepare for, respond to and recover from disasters and similar events. As a former police officer, I am aware of how the SES operates not only independently but also in support of other emergency services. Many a police search or accident scene has benefited from the support of these fine volunteers.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my electorate of Dickson, I have often witnessed the dedication of our local SES in their response to community needs and emergencies. I am sure that members collectively have observed the huge range of events the SES prepares for and responds to, such as storms, cyclones, floods, crime scenes, accidents, missing person searches and cliff rescues. In October 2011, Dickson suffered through a severe hailstorm which caused significant damage. In response, the Petrie SES completed over 630 tasks. A lot of the damage was concentrated in Strathpine, in Dixon Street,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Street" rel="nofollow">
         Graham Street
        </a>
        , Mecklem Street and Bells Pocket Road. The SES responded within 30 minutes, working in the wet to erect temporary covers over more than 200 units. The hail and heavy rain not only damaged homes but left elderly residents very worried. Fortunately, the Petrie SES swung into action to prevent further damage and soothe worried residents.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 23 July this year, I attended the ceremony for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRMA" rel="nofollow">
         NRMA
        </a>
        Insurance storm heroes awards. I was proud to join with community members in celebrating the selfless actions of these fantastic volunteers, including the Petrie SES.
       </p>
       <p>
        The NRMA storm heroes awards recognise the excellent work of the SES and provide grants to support their work. I commend NRMA Insurance for their support of the SES. I also acknowledge the management and support functions that Emergency Management Queensland provides to the SES. The Petrie SES group won the 2012 NRMA Insurance storm heroes team award for their response to the severe hailstorm that hit Strathpine in October 2011. The unit has been awarded $2,000, which will go towards purchasing essential storm response equipment. I congratulate them again on that award.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to name some of these storm heroes, these volunteers who have trained weekly and then swung into action to serve our community: Deputy Local Controller South Peter Sims

        area. It is with pride in the Dickson electorate I name these men and women in this place to acknowledge their excellent community service.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge the hard work of other units of the Moreton Bay Region SES which also responded to the October 2011 storms, both at Strathpine and in their local areas. These units include Arana Hills SES, the Bribie Island SES outside my electorate, Deception Bay SES, Caboolture SES and Redcliffe SES. It is important to recognise the work done by all the individuals of the Moreton Bay Region SES at so many other events under the leadership of Local Controller Henk van den Ende. I know that the Dickson electorate appreciates the dedication of the SES and I am sure that communities around our great nation have similar stories to tell of the volunteers that care when it really counts.
       </p>
       <p>
        The final words I want to leave are by way of thanks to those family members and indeed those employers who support the SES workers, who in many cases have to spend days at a time on particular projects, often with very little or in some cases no notice. These are people who are able to support their loved ones, in many cases doing work that they love to do. It is a great impost on some small businesses, I understand, but the understanding of those small business employers, particularly in tough times, to see themselves clear to allow the SES workers of the Petrie SES to go to the aid of others in need in the local community is as much a credit to the SES workers as it is to the employers. Of course, the families who go without mum or dad on many a stormy night when their own families are suffering deserve equal praise.
