        In this place, it's great to recognise the great work of others, especially next generation trailblazers like Rohan Workman. Roh, who's been an ambassador and supporter of Australia's start-up scene, is moving onto new things from his post as a Director of the Melbourne Accelerator Program at the University of Melbourne. When he started
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAP" rel="nofollow">
         MAP
        </a>
        in 2012, it was the first university based accelerator program in the country providing support to new and emerging firms. In a short time, it did amazing things.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2015,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UBI" rel="nofollow">
         UBI
        </a>
        Global ranked MAP as the eighth best program of its kind in the world. Huge. By last year, it had already entered into a strategic partnership with Nasdaq Entrepreneurial Centre—a great reflection on them. Also, about 11,000 people are going through MAP programs and activities. A lot of promising new firms have gone through the program, and it will be exciting to see them grow. A few weeks ago, I went to their MAP entrepreneurs gala—800 people. I have been to every single one of these dinners. Every year it grows. Eight hundred people turning up is a huge reflection of their belief in MAP.

        While Rohan's beard game is not as strong as mine, his contribution to Australia's start-up scene is very, very strong. I might have been sad to hear he was leaving, but I am excited to see where he is going to turn up. I want to say: 'Congratulations. Well done. You are doing great things for the new firms and new jobs of the future.'
