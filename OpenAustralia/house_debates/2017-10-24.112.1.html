        sadly falling short this finals season, it is appropriate that we acknowledge another outstanding sporting club in the great state of Victoria, and that is the Tonners, the Old Brighton Grammarians, who have had a fantastic year this year. I would like to congratulate Old Brighton on an outstanding season and thank them so much for giving me the honour, with my fellow No. 1 ticketholder, Felicity Frederico, of being able to stand as their No. 1 ticketholder and in this place.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year the seniors confirmed their status as the top premier B team with a magnificent win against Old Scotch in the grand final only last month. For the fourth time in this season, they went to battle against Old Scotch and gave them a hotly contested game of footy. It was a well-fought game in front of an enthusiastic crowd at Trevor Barker Oval. The Tonners looked like winners for most of the match, but it was Pat Liston's goal to answer the Cardinals' late thrust which sealed the match with moments to spare. The final margin was 36 points. It was the club's fifth senior premiership and the first since 2013.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the Goldstein community, I'd like to congratulate the premiership players of Old Brighton and their seniors team:

        It was also a very important year because it was the first year that women's footy was part of Old Brighton. I particularly want to thank the committee, which included the coach,

        And, to cap off a highly successful season, I was lucky enough to attend the Old Brightons 2017
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_and_Fairest" rel="nofollow">
         Best and Fairest
        </a>
        competition at the convention centre. I'd like to further congratulate all the award winners and runners-up in the Best and Fairest awards, particularly, for the seniors, Harry Hill; for the women's, Indi Tait; for the reserves, Marty Ho—and this deserves a little dance: Marty Ho, Marty Ho!—and, for the under 19s, Tom Wallace. Congratulations to the reserves, to everybody who contributed to the victory against Old Scotch and to the Old Brighton Grammarians footy team, which is one of many footy teams that are part of the Goldstein electorate, who all do us proud through their activity on weekends to make sure that they bring together the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've got to say that one of my favourite things to do every weekend is to go and watch the Tonners play and be victorious against many of the teams across the great state of Victoria. So, to the Tonners on their dual premiership in 2017, congratulations, and we look forward to you going back and smashing it up in 2018.
