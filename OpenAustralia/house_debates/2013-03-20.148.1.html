        This Thursday is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Down_Syndrome_Day" rel="nofollow">
         World Down Syndrome Day
        </a>
        and I would like to take this opportunity to praise a group of parents in my electorate who are committed to supporting families touched by Down syndrome. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_Start" rel="nofollow">
         Right Start
        </a>
        Foundation will celebrate World Down Syndrome Day with two events in Macarthur this week. There will be a special World Down Syndrome Day high tea this Thursday at Rydges in Campbelltown, and there will be a Family Fun Day this Saturday at the Camden Civic Centre from 1pm to 4pm with clown performers, face painting, balloons, food and drink.
       </p>
       <p>
        Every child born with Down syndrome deserves the best start to life and the Right Start Foundation is committed to making this a reality by providing support, awareness and services for these families. The Right Start Foundation hopes to build a Down syndrome-specific centre in Macarthur to ensure that these children and their families receive all the therapies and support they need. The centre would be the first of its kind in Australia and it would give these children a great start in life. Families would be offered weekly support groups, information, therapy and individual counselling if required. This support would continue throughout the child's life, with help for their schooling, independent living and assistance with employment during their adult years.
       </p>
       <p>
        The group is working hard to achieve this goal with the support of my community through many fundraisers and events throughout the year. I have two beautiful daughters myself, Mr Deputy Speaker, so I can imagine how daunting it would be to learn that your newborn child has Down syndrome, simply through the fear of the unknown. This can be one of the most difficult times in a parent's life, and new parents often struggle to find answers and assistance to manage their child's condition. The Right Start Foundation has been able to connect these new parents with others who have already been through this experience and who know how the health system works and where they can find useful information.
       </p>
       <p>
        The foundation has also been critical in providing early intervention and therapies that help many people with Down syndrome in my electorate. The Right Start Foundation has joined with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KU" rel="nofollow">
         KU
        </a>
        Starting Points Macarthur to offer several Down syndrome therapies for competitive prices in one location each week. Physical therapy classes focus on motor development, speech therapy classes develop clear communication, and signing skills and occupational therapy classes give children the skills they need to lead full and independent lives. Medical treatment for Down syndrome children can only go so far, but early intervention and therapies help many people with Down syndrome live long, productive lives. During my work with these families I have been fortunate enough to see first-hand the passion that drives their commitment. This has resulted in an increased awareness and understanding of the condition in my community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I would like to praise the members of Right Start who work so hard to make this world a better place for their beautiful children. I would like to encourage others in my community to show their support for these families tooâ€”especially on World Down Syndrome Day later this week. This group sets a wonderful example for other parents across my electorate. Their love for their children comes second to none. I am so proud of this group and what they have achieved for their beautiful children. I would like to wish the Right Start foundation all the best as they continue to raise awareness of Down syndrome to the people of Macarthur.
