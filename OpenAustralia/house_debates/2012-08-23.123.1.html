         Well yes, but perhaps we need to get on with the positive things that are being done. Australians need that kind of leadership. In July, the seniors in my electorate had a great opportunity to be part of the discussions about how aged-care services will be delivered in the coming years. More than 45 locals turned out to speak with the Minister for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_Health" rel="nofollow">
          Mental Health
         </a>
         and Ageing,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Butler" rel="nofollow">
          Mark Butler
         </a>
         , during his visit to the coast, to tell him what the system should look like and how it should run to provide the best care possible for our older Australians. This was the second visit by the minister to my electorate to discuss matters for aged-care, and he had about 100 who attended on the very first occasion as well. It is a testament to our community that so many people have taken part in these important dialogues with the federal government, to ensure that future generations of older Australians are able to enjoy the best standard of living possible.

         During his visit, the minister also boosted Home and Community Care funding by nearly $1 million so that seniors in Robertson will receive more support to stay in their homes. What I hear from seniors on the coast is that they want to be able to stay at home for as long as possible, if not for the rest of their lives. It means so much to be able to stay independent and continue to look after ourselves as we age, and being able to stay somewhere familiar, such as the family home, is an important part of that. This funding means that more people on the peninsula and across Robertson will be able to access a range of domestic assistance, personal care, social support and respite to help them avoid a premature move to residential care. These are practical solutions from a Labor government committed to helping older Australians. I am proud to acknowledge the work of Coastlink, led by Lynne Rainford, as one of the eight local organisations that will benefit from this injection of funding, and I look forward to seeing the great results that will come from this much-needed investment. I thank the minister for spending time in our beautiful part of the world and for taking time to listen to the

         community and to provide real assistance where needed.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also want to take the time remaining to me to acknowledge the work of two amazing women on the Central Coast, Tamika Dwight-Scott and Melissa Crozier. About a year ago, they set up a health and wellness centre in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Gosford" rel="nofollow">
          East Gosford
         </a>
         . They were setting it up as a business, but they found that they had clients coming to them—women who were coming particularly out of terrible situations of domestic violence, who needed health and wellness, and needed some care, at that time when often they were at their least able to pay for that care. What they have done in one year is extraordinary. They have set up a charity and they have worked with local groups, including the Lionesses of East Gosford, to create a business with the support of the community that supports this wonderful, qualified place for people to go to seek assistance at a time when they are in incredible need. Collectively, Tamika and Melissa combine a range of therapies to offer an effective treatment for clients who experience distress or trauma, which could include recovering from cancer. They are amazing women doing fantastic things in Robertson.
