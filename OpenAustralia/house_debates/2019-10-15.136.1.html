       <p>
        I'd like to draw the House's attention to the wonderful achievements of our young sporting champions in Calare. These high achievers put in an extraordinary amount of hard work and, with their supportive families, travel vast distances to compete at elite levels. They are role models, and we're very proud of them. I was fortunate enough to meet with some of them recently over an afternoon tea and a cuppa to present some certificates. Today, I would like to acknowledge all of them, including Sam Flannery.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sam competed in the Australian junior nationals for tenpin bowling. He won gold as part of the New South Wales President's Shield team and achieved bronze as a member of the combined boys and girls team. He's also a member of the New South Wales Tenpin Bowling Association. Well done, Sam.
       </p>
       <p>
        Micaylah Downey also participated in the Australian junior nationals for tenpin bowling. She placed third overall and was named an all-star among just five other competitors nationally. Micaylah also represents the New South Wales Tenpin Bowling Association through Orange Tenpin Bowl. She's a fine bowler and she's done wonderful things in that sporting endeavour.
       </p>
       <p>
        Michael and Mark Selmes were also present in my office for our afternoon tea and presentation. They travelled recently to Africa to compete in the World Rimfire and Air Rifle Benchrest Federation's fourth world championship international. Michael won three silver medals, and both boys are already hoping to go again next year. Well done, Michael and Mark. You are also great achievers.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also need to mention some other great young achievers and athletes in our area. Cody Kelso and

       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to add my personal congratulations to all of those sporting high achievers but also to their supporting families, who move heaven and earth to get these young athletes to competitions and help them achieve the wonderful things they do.
