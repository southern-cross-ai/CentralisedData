        My question is to the Minister for Sport. I refer the minister to the Nottinghill Pinewood Tennis Club in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Waverley" rel="nofollow">
         Glen Waverley
        </a>
        in Melbourne, which currently spends over $9,000 a year on electricity costs. Is the minister aware that according to the government’s own Treasury modelling the tennis club faces a 57 per cent increase in electricity costs by 2015 and a 120 per cent increase in electricity costs by 2020 thanks to the government’s emissions trading scheme? What compensation will the minister provide to the Nottinghill Pinewood Tennis Club, and to the many thousands of sporting clubs throughout Australia that face a doubling of electricity prices because of the government’s great big new tax?

         I thank the shadow minister for youth and sport for his first question in his portfolio and say that it is very important to all of us on this side of the House that we ensure that sport is accessible and remains accessible to the Australian community. We know how important it is as part of our preventative health agenda. We want to see more Australians getting out there and active within the community. This is why we were delighted within the last 12 months to be able to inject over $300 million into community sporting facilities, which is a record injection from a federal government at this level.
        </p>
        <p>
         With regard to his question about the impact of climate change, I would remind the shadow minister opposite of the $200 million which we have put in a fund to ensure that we will be able to help the Australian community deal with this. In contrast to this, there is nothing offered by those on the other side. They are quite prepared to sit back and watch as Australian sporting facilities suffer the consequences they are currently suffering as a result of water shortages and temperature rises forcing changes to competition. Australian sport is already being hit by climate change. We on this side of the House are making sure that that is addressed, and addressed responsibly. I would urge those opposite to get on board.
