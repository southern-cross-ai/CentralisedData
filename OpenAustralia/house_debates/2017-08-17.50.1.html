        I rise today to talk about a wonderful event that was held in my electorate on Tuesday. It was the launch of the 2017 Writers' Festival held at Coolaroo South Primary School and Kindergarten. The theme for this year's festival was: memoirs and snapshots of life. As always, our local students didn't fail to deliver some glorious and creative stories of their favourite memories. Now in its ninth year, the Writers' Festival is an inspiring way to encourage our young students to use their imagination to create and to tell their story whilst exploring the craft of writing.
       </p>
       <p>
        The stories currently displayed on the corridor walls of the school are as varied as the students themselves. Coolaroo South Primary School and Kindergarten Principal, Karen Nicholls, and staff do an exemplary job in engaging students and their families to come together to share, learn and grow. They have created a place of social inclusion, supporting the school's families through their children's education.

        Author Caroline van de Pol, who launched her book
        <i>
         Back to Broady
        </i>
        last week, was the guest speaker at the Writers' Festival launch. She spoke to the children about growing up in Broadmeadows and the surrounding suburbs. At the launch, she encouraged the children to always follow their passions and their dreams.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to congratulate Coolaroo South Primary School and Kindergarten and all the award winners on that day. I also want to give my apologies for not being able to attend this year's Writers' Festival. I was in Canberra here in parliament, but I have attended in the past, and I am so hopeful when I read those stories.
