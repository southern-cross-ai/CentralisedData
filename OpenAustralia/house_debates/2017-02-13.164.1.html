        I recently had the great pleasure to attend the Sherbrooke

        Annual Royal Children's Relayathon. Amazingly, the club ran an incredible 92 kilometres that morning to raise money for the local hospital and in fact raised $450. It was very impressive. I got there at seven o'clock in the morning, and they were running 100-metre splits, so basically every minute or so you would be running again. The guys did an incredible job. I would like to make a special mention of

        The club has been going for 47 years. When I was younger, I was at that club. It is a great club. It runs on a grass track, which makes things a bit tough. We recently gave it some funding for a long jump, and the club greatly appreciated that. Credit definitely goes to Chris Crennan, the president of the club; Ed Thomson, the vice president;

        , the secretary; and Stewart Brock, the treasurer. These members have committed a lot of their time to helping young people getting involved in athletics in the area. In fact, there are over 160 members between the ages of five and 15. I again congratulate the club and thank it—especially the committee members—for all of its efforts, and encourage parents to get their kids involved in Little Athletics.
