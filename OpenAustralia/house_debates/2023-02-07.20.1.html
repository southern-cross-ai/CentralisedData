       <p>
        I rise to speak on the great life and legacy of John Bennett AM, co-founder of the world-famous Ashgrove Cheese. John was a passionate dairy farmer of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meander_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Meander Valley
        </a>
        , in the north of my electorate. He strove to take the dairy industry to the next level and ensure it was the best it could be, both in Tasmania and across Australia. He was the president of the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation from 1976 to 1985 and deputy chair of the Australian Dairy Corporation from 1981 to 1986. In that time, the dairy industry faced many challenges, but it was always guided safely to shore with John at the helm.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the 1990s, modern ideas such as paddock-to-plate experiences were unheard of and posed a big business risk for John and his brother, but the duo persevered. Their commitment to this cause led to a booming success, and the Ashgrove Cheese factory became a shining light for northern Tasmania. It's a must-visit place for the many tourists who come to Tasmania, and it has entertained hundreds of thousands of visitors across the decades, providing education on the cheese-making process and, importantly, tastings. Most people would be familiar with the very colourful cows painted on the outside of the paddock, visible as you come up to the factory.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the people of Lyons, I offer my sincere condolences to John's widow, Connie, and his children, Susan, Mary, Paul and Anne. Vale, John Bennett AM. There will never be another like you. May you rest in peace.
