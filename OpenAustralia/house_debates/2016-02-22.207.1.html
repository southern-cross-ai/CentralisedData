       <p>
        As I have mentioned in the House before, with the redistribution we have had occurring in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        , I am very pleased that the coastal town of Ballina will be moving into the Richmond electorate. Ballina is a very exciting, vibrant town. It has been experiencing growth, and part of the reason for that is the fact that it has a very busy airport which services the entire Ballina-Byron region. The future of Ballina's airport continues to look very promising, with much growth in tourism meaning record numbers of visitors and also an increase in capital to the local economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst we hear stories of many regional airports that are struggling financially, the Ballina airport pays for itself. In fact, it generates a small operating surplus of $1.3 million a year for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballina_Shire" rel="nofollow">
         Ballina Shire
        </a>
        Council. The Ballina airport has been growing at about 10 per cent year on year and indeed will challenge

        </a>
        as a domestic hub for southern
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byron_Shire" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Ballina Shire. It had a record summer which saw 46,000 passengers in January alone, which is quite a lot for a regional airport. In fact, the Commonwealth Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics data last year highlighted that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballina_Byron_Gateway_Airport" rel="nofollow">
         Ballina Byron Gateway Airport
        </a>
        is among the fastest growing airports in Australia, and the airport has many great hopes for the future. There are plans to triple the size of its terminal building, a project costing $7.2 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, the growth is driven by an ever-increasing number of holiday-makers to, of course, the best address in Australia, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         North Coast
        </a>
        of New South Wales. In fact, our local economy is sustained by our tourism growth, and the Ballina Byron Gateway Airport plays an important role in that.
