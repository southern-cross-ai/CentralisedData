        This year, the Men's Sheds Association celebrates an important milestone: 30 years of men's sheds. That's three decades of men's sheds building connections, community and inclusivity. With 1,300 men's sheds well established around the country, I want to congratulate the amazing sheds in my electorate of Canberra on their achievements including the Hawker Men's Shed, the Majura Men's Shed in Dickson, the Forrest Men's Shed, the Giralang Kaleen Men's Shed and the Hughes Community Shed. I want to particularly highlight today the Hawker Men's Shed and what they've been doing through their quarterly repair cafe, where the Canberra community can have their beloved items repaired and saved from the rubbish tip. The shed has saved 458 items from landfill since it started in 2020.

        Men's sheds are more than just a place to tinker with tools; they are community spaces for men to connect, converse and combat social isolation. Many men struggle with mental health issues in silence, and men's sheds provide an avenue for them to open up, share their stories and find solace in the company of their peers. I'm very proud to be part of a government that is supporting the valuable work of men's sheds with the recent announcement of $670,000 of grant funding for up to 131 men's sheds, through grants of $10,000 each, to help sheds improve their facilities, buy tools et cetera. Once again, congratulations to our men's sheds and their volunteers on 30 years of service to our community. Keep up the great work!
