        I want to report to the House that I conducted two community forums on the drug ice—crystal methamphetamine—in my electorate last week, involving 70 people in Mackay and Bowen who are concerned about the growing epidemic of the drug. The forums included representatives from the Queensland police,

        ; local schools, council representatives, church leaders and chaplains; Indigenous groups like Girudala in Bowen; youth groups like Kaylan house and the Youth Information and Referral Service in Mackay; and service organisations like Auscare, UnitingCare, Anglicare and Centacare.
       </p>
       <p>
        We also heard firsthand accounts of personal impacts that ice has had on local families. It was heartbreaking to listen to parents say that they would prefer to see their children go to jail, where they can get some help, because they cannot force them into rehab.
       </p>
       <p>
        Participants were very engaged and offered constructive input on tackling the ice problem. The overarching message is the need for a well-resourced, holistic approach to reduce demand, choke off supply and educate the community. It is clear that early intervention is required to prevent that first taking of the drug because it is so addictive and so destructive. It is also clear that, when a victim does reach out for help, that help must be made available immediately.

        forums has been submitted to the National Ice Taskforce, which will be reporting to the Prime Minister in the coming weeks. We look forward to the forthcoming National Ice Action Strategy, which will result.
