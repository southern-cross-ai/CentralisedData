        <p>
         The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) 'Contemporary fire regimes resulting in the loss of vegetation heterogeneity and biodiversity in Northern Australia' was nominated as a key threatening process (
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KTP" rel="nofollow">
          KTP
         </a>
         ) in 2007. As the issues raised in the original nomination were also relevant to other areas of Australia, the Threatened Species Scientific Committee broadened the nomination to encompass the whole of Australia and changed the title to 'Contemporary fire regimes resulting in the loss of vegetation heterogeneity and biodiversity throughout Australia'. The broadened nomination was included on the Finalised Priority Assessment List for the assessment period commencing 1 October 2008 and subsequently renamed 'Fire regimes that cause biodiversity decline'.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (2) Yes.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) Yes.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Committee" rel="nofollow">
          The Committee
         </a>
         sent a letter to the then Minister (Minister Burke) in May 2013.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) The assessment is particularly complex, requiring consideration of multiple aspects of fire and biodiversity management in Australia.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) I have asked the Threatened Species Scientific Committee to review its assessment of this threatening process and provide me with advice on next steps following its February meeting.
