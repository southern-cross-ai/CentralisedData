        I rise to commend
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Sharp" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Sharp
        </a>
        of Tascott, who has received an Australian Corrections Medal for his 32-year career with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corrective_Services_NSW" rel="nofollow">
         Corrective Services NSW
        </a>
        . Peter has led a distinguished career with Corrective Services NSW, being responsible for revolutionising its technology and videoconferencing capacity throughout its 300 facilities. This technology has ensured inmates can appear in court, receive legal and professional visits, and participate in rehabilitation programs, all remotely. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Peter and his team were pivotal in getting iPad tablets into facilities to ensure inmates could continue communication with the outside world and their rehabilitation programs. Peter has played an integral part in leading the charge to introduce new technologies into
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        prisons to help assist in the rehabilitation of inmates, benefit the wellbeing of offenders and their families, and facilitate positive behavioural change.
       </p>
       <p>
        I recently had the privilege of visiting Peter at his home on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        , where I congratulated him on this recognition and learned more about his career with Corrective Services NSW. Peter is an exemplary leader in our community on the Central Coast. His work has strengthened the state of New South Wales and it has strengthened Australia. My thanks and appreciation go to Mr Peter Sharp. I look forward to his continued work to improve Corrective Services in New South Wales.
