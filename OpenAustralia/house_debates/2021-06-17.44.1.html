        Two years ago on 12 June,

        residents rose against the Chinese Communist Party's deception and oppression. Hong Kong was a vibrant city, exposing the lie that a Chinese society couldn't embrace democracy. This is why the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCP" rel="nofollow">
         CCP
        </a>
        betrayed the 50-year agreement to protect 'one country, two systems', first, by seeking to impose an extradition treaty that would have left Hong Kong residents at the mercy of the mainland's politicised judicial system and, second, by imposing a national security law designed to outlaw dissent. Against threats, millions hit the streets, many knowing they had every part of their future to lose, so they fought knowing there was nothing to lose by standing up. Having stood side by side with protest leaders such as Joshua Wong, they understood that they were not fighting for a strip of land but for the freedom of people to choose their own destiny. Ferries powered from Kowloon to the island, filled with young residents singing anthems and chants of their liberation. Now many are in jail through unjust laws or are too intimidated into silence to have a future. Journalists were expelled and rule imposed from Beijing. At every turn, the CCP have shown they seek compliance. These daring souls had the courage to oppose an impressive pack that disempowered millions. Two years on, we commemorate their sacrifice and fighting on the front line. The fight against authoritarianism goes on. This is not a political contest; it is a moral one. We stand for free people everywhere.
