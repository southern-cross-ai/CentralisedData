       <p>
        On behalf of the Joint Select Committee on Cyber-Safety I present the committee's report entitled
        <i>
         Cybersafety for seniors: a worthwhile journey
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.
       </p>
       <p>
        As Deputy Chair of the Joint Select Committee on Cyber-Safety I want to speak to the report of the committee's inquiry into cybersafety and senior Australians. I should start by acknowledging students of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MET" rel="nofollow">
         MET
        </a>
        School from Kellyville who are here from my electorate. Welcome to the national parliament; great to see you.
       </p>
       <p>
        The speed of the information technology revolution has meant that many older Australians now find themselves on the wrong side of the digital divide. Indeed, we have all spoken in this chamber about the pace and speed of change, and I know students at the MET School at Kellyville understand the internet and technology revolution. Fear of cybercrime is one of the reasons many seniors are not active online. During the inquiry into cybersafety for seniors the committee was told that it is imperative that everything possible is done to help every senior Australian become active online because, in the near future, seniors who are not online will become a seriously disadvantaged group as government and businesses are increasingly using the internet as their sole means of interacting with people. Although there are many seniors who are active online and find it a comfortable transition, there are many seniors who did not have the benefit of working with computers before retirement and now they fear the internet because of cybersafety issues. This is, of course, a generational issue. This generation which has not grown up with the technology and computers available to them will be superseded by every single generation which has.
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was taken during the inquiry showing that education and training is the key to helping seniors move into the cyberworld with confidence and skill. This was similar to the committee's inquiries into cybersafety and the young, with education—from academics, from parents groups, from any sector and from the internet industry as well—being the key for all age groups. Every sector says to us that education and training are the best possible methods of improving the situation in relation to cybersafety, rather than heavy-handed government approaches. The committee found that, across the nation, public libraries and seniors' organisations have taken up the challenge to teach seniors about cybersafety. Several seniors groups and representatives from the public libraries addressed the committee at public hearings. Each told the committee that they cannot meet existing demand from seniors for cybersafety training due to lack of resources, but with increased funding they could do more training.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian Federal Police very seriously told the committee that cybercrime targets everyone, and even cybersavvy people can become victims, so it is up to each individual to take the same degree of responsibility for their own actions when online as they do in everyday life. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
         AFP
        </a>
        also said that keeping seniors cybersafe requires a multifaceted approach combining the right mix of law enforcement, policy and legislation, education and some level of user vigilance. There is no doubt that governments in jurisdictions across the world are still wrestling with the right formula for legislating the online space, for protecting people online and for providing them with the inherent legal rights that they have every day online, and that is still a work in progress.
       </p>
       <p>
        Access to the internet was found to be a barrier for some seniors, particularly those who are housebound or who live on low incomes in remote places. Those living in metropolitan areas and larger regional centres who do not have an internet connection in their home can generally find free access to the internet in public libraries and various seniors clubs. The Broadband for Seniors initiative, run by the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, provides free access to computers and broadband internet as well as free online training for seniors who are able to access one of the 2,000 Broadband for Seniors kiosks. These kiosks are in community centres, retirement villages, libraries and senior citizens clubs across Australia, but the committee has recommended that this worthwhile initiative could benefit from much wider publicity.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee found that when seniors experience cybercrime there is a lot of confusion about how to report the crime and therefore the committee recommended that a centralised user-friendly reporting and cybersafety awareness portal should be developed with links to relevant regulators. Indeed, access to the relevant regulation is a critical issue. If we are not getting the reports of crime then we are not able to deal with it effectively. The site should feature a dedicated seniors reporting tab backed up by a telephone service which links individuals to appropriate victim support, training and other advice. The committee notes that the government has recently launched a seniors helpline under its Broadband for Seniors initiative but believes that there would be merit in centralising reporting and support mechanisms for all cybercrime victims who need support or advice.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee also recommended that cyber awareness campaigns using clear and practical messages about cyber safety could feature on the cybersafety awareness portal. The committee recommended that it would be beneficial for everyone's cyber safety if the government were to establish a consultative working group with wide stakeholder representation to coordinate and promote government and industry partnerships and initiatives.

         I also rise to speak on the
         <i>
          Cybersafety for seniors: A worthwhile journe
         </i>
         y report following on from the deputy chair, the member for Mitchell. Throughout history there have been various revolutions—from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronze_Age" rel="nofollow">
          Bronze Age
         </a>
         to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Age" rel="nofollow">
          Iron Age
         </a>
         , from the age of Enlightenment to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Revolution" rel="nofollow">
          Industrial Revolution
         </a>
         —and we are now right in the middle of the digital age or information age. Information is doubling almost every six months, whereas earlier it took thousands of years for humanity's information to double.
        </p>
        <p>
         Like all new technologies, in the wrong hands—be it a bronze sword or a spear—new technologies in the wrong hands can be dangerous. We do recognise that. However, used skilfully, the digital age—the internet—can bring enormous benefits to all Australians, particularly seniors. We heard in our inquiry, from around the country, the great benefits that come from people being skilled up, trained and offered the benefits of the internet, whether it be banking, looking at families or grandchildren or sharing information about hobbies.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sadly, we also heard that Australians are targets for criminals. We are a wealthy country and we have a lot of superannuants who have money set aside for their retirements, and people around the world know this. Unfortunately, the internet means criminals can be right next door rather than come across the seas. This report is a timely reminder, but it indicates the great boon that comes with having a

          National Broadband Network
         </a>
         and making the internet available for all Australians, particularly senior Australians.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would like to commend the chair, Senator Bilyk, for her work, the deputy chair, the member for Mitchell, and all members of the committee, and commend the report to the chamber.

          Just before the member for Moreton sits down: If he could assist me, I seem to have lost the member for Mitchell. The time allocated for statements on this report has expired. Does the honourable member for Moreton wish to move a motion in connection with the report to enable it to be debated at a later hour?
