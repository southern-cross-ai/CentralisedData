        I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Bethania Cricket Club for their fantastic fundraising efforts during the 2017 Pink Stumps Day. No stranger to the cricket field, I was very pleased to be able to join the club's fundraising day by donning a pink shirt and participating in a cracking game against Greenbank, though it was rather warm that day. I was also joined by one of Logan City's councillors, Steve Swenson. There was competitive banter and plenty of fun. It was a hot day but it did not deter the great crowd. The batsmen and wicketkeepers were all dressed in pink pads and everyone wore pink caps and, most importantly, the stumps were pink.

        More than 44 women are diagnosed with breast cancer every day and Pink Stumps Day encourages local cricket clubs, businesses, families, friends and schools right across the country to bring the magic of the pink test to the local communities in support of the

        </a>
        . Over the past six years, more than $4.7 million has been raised by cricket clubs around the country hosting a Pink Stumps Day. It was fantastic to see my local cricket club of Bethania join together with other clubs around the country for a great cause and it was a great pleasure to participate and support their Pink Stumps Day event.
