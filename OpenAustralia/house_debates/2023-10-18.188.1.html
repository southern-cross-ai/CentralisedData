       <p>
        Last week, in my electorate of Richmond, I was so proud to announce more than $121 million in joint federal and state disaster funding for more than 50 projects to future-proof and rebuild our infrastructure across the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        north coast. Together, the Albanese and Minns Labor governments are building back better on the north coast to make our community more resilient to natural disasters.
       </p>
       <p>
        My electorate of Richmond is on the north coast of New South Wales, and many would be aware that our area was devastated by floods in early 2022. It was the largest recorded flooding event to have ever hit our area. Homes, livelihoods and businesses were destroyed, and we are still rebuilding, even today. These disasters take an enormous toll on individuals and families, and right throughout the entire community. Rebuilding is a long road back, and our government understands the importance of getting the specific funding to where it is needed most.
       </p>
       <p>
        This joint funding will deliver more than $121 million in those projects through the Infrastructure Betterment Fund and the Community Local Infrastructure Recovery Package. Those funding initiatives are focused on building back essential public assets, such as roads, bridges and drainage, that have been impacted by storm and flood events. It also, through the Community Assets Program, repairs a lot of community assets like parks, walkways and buildings, many of which were so badly damaged. This funding means assets are repaired to a more resilient standard that can better withstand future disasters. Some of the projects include: a new works depot for

        town centre to reduce flooding; flood-proofing the Mullumbimby ambulance station; remediation at

        ; access repairs at Ballina's Lighthouse Beach; and upgrades to many schools, roads, parks, pools, community halls, toilet blocks, and so much more right across the community.
       </p>

        I was joined in this announcement by the state member for Lismore,

        mayor Michael Lyon. This funding is a game-changer for the councils in my area—and, indeed, right across the north coast and northern rivers. By investing in better designs and better materials, we can make sure all of our resources are built to last and withstand future natural disasters.
