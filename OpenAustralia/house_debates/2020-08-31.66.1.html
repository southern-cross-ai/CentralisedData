       <p>
        Mental health is an incredibly important issue for many in our communities, and the health and wellbeing of young people in Forde is no different. That's why during the 2019 federal election campaign the Morrison government committed to establishing a new headspace on the northern
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        . On 21 August this year we delivered on that commitment with the official opening of headspace
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upper_Coomera" rel="nofollow">
         Upper Coomera
        </a>
        . Headspace Upper Coomera will deliver world-class mental health and wellbeing support for thousands of people on the growing northern Gold Coast corridor. There are family rooms, individual consultation rooms, fun spaces and large meeting rooms to accommodate group activities, and lots of technology to help the youth with other things they might need a hand with, such as getting a job and assisting with their education.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to thank young people in Forde and across Australia and let them know that they are not alone in their journey. I want them to know that we are there with them all the way. Headspace is here to help you overcome whatever challenges life may throw at you. In fact, since opening, headspace Upper Coomera has delivered 356 occasions of service and received 201 referrals, with 73 of those coming from the existing Southport service alone. We know how challenging the past couple of months have been. If you are a young person struggling with your mental health, hop onto your computer or phone and visit headspace.org.au and have a look at the fantastic resources and services that are on offer. Thank you to the whole team at headspace at Upper Coomera.
