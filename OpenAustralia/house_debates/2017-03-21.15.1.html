       <p>
        It is a real shame that on a day like today,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Harmony Day
        </a>
        , when we celebrate this nation's multicultural beliefs and acknowledge our citizens who have come from every corner of the world, that the government in their caucus room today and in their cabinet are discussing how to water down 18C of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_Discrimination_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Racial Discrimination Act
        </a>
        that has served our nation for many years. It has served the people of this nation who have made their home here in Australia having come from every corner of the world. We are one of the most harmonious nations in the world, we are an egalitarian nation, and this government is trying to water down those things that have been put in place to protect people's rights and to ensure that we treat everyone equally. The Prime Minister has been totally controlled by the extreme right wing of his political party, and all he is interested in is his own job. That is the reason he is looking at these laws.
       </p>
       <p>
        Like the electorates of everyone in this House, my electorate of Hindmarsh has people from over 200 different nations who are Australians through and through, who have made their home here in Australia. Those people are being absolutely dishonoured by these discussions at the moment. It is wrong, it is not right, in a nation like ours where we have done so much over past years to ensure that everyone is treated equally regardless of the colour of their skin, regardless of their religion, regardless of where they come from, because everybody is contributing to this nation. To see this government do what it is doing today is an absolute disgrace.
