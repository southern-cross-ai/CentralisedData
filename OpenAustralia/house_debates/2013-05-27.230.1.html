       <p>
        I rise tonight to provide the House with an update on the situation in Burma. I know that there is a feeling here in the parliament and particularly in the government that great progress has been made. The recognition of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thein_Sein" rel="nofollow">
         Thein Sein
        </a>
        regime's preferred nation name of Myanmar and the lifting of sanctions against that country demonstrate that the government has normalised relations. It is my view that everything is not okay and that the same problems that existed before the release from house arrest of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aung_San_Suu_Kyi" rel="nofollow">
         Aung San Suu Kyi
        </a>
        still exist today. I stress that if we delude ourselves and ignore the situation of the ethnic nationalities which make up as much as 70 per cent of the population in many of their own conflict-ridden states, we risk facing a situation similar to what happened in the Balkans or recently in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
         Middle East
        </a>
        . The ethnic nationalities of Burma must not be sidelined in the engagement process.
       </p>
       <p>
        This evening, together with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dean_Smith" rel="nofollow">
         Dean Smith
        </a>
        , I hosted a gathering of community leaders from some of the ethnic nationalities of Burma. We also had Colonel Nerdah of the Korean National Union and he is also a representative of the

        who frequently visits Burma and supports those ethnic nationalities that still struggle for freedom. The impression of those who attended this briefing was not anywhere near as positive or hopeful as is often made out. Tonight I will outline the reality of what does take place in Burma.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the positive side, as we know, Aung San Suu Kyi has been released, along with around 400 political prisoners. Media censorship has been relaxed a little and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NLB" rel="nofollow">
         NLB
        </a>
        party was allowed to resume 43 parliamentary seats in 2012—a positive step forward. However, these changes have taken place under the larger shadow of military abuses. There is a conflict in the northern Kachin state, there are severe problems in Arakan state and against that backdrop there has also been an interference in the delivery of aid to thousands of refugees. In Karen state there are over 300 Burmese military bases or outposts which have been reinforced with troops and armed at an alarming rate. To emphasise the reality, I quote the Human Rights Watch Deputy Director Asia who condemned Burma's human rights situation in the
        <i>

        </i>
        .
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Robertson" rel="nofollow">
         Phil Robertson
        </a>
        said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Burma’s reforms over the past year are hindered, not helped, by international oversell and hasty praise in the face of continued serious human rights abuses.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the time when the Australian government recognises the country as Myanmar and abandoned sanctions the ethnic Arakanese Buddhists have been facing almost daily attacks from an Islamist terrorism base from across the border in Bangladesh, while still be persecuted by the Burmese government. Clearly this is not a record that anyone can be proud of and instead casts doubt on any acclamation from the international community.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Washington two weeks ago Thein Sein met with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Obama" rel="nofollow">
         President Obama
        </a>
        and both spoke of the changes that have taken place. Last Monday however the reality was made abundantly clear when the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        State Department published its annual review of religious freedom around the world. The Buddhist majority country of Myanmar appeared on the State Department's list with eight other countries where discrimination against ethnic groups was amongst the worst. In Chin state, the poorest state of Burma, the people have long been subjected to religious persecution and denied the right to build churches on their own land.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately it gets no better when we hear of the escalating fighting by the army to, literally, a war in Kachin state against the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kachin_Independence_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
         Kachin Independence Organisation
        </a>
        and its military arm, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KIA" rel="nofollow">
         KIA
        </a>
        . This year has seen the regime employ helicopter gunships, jets and heavy artillery with bombardment in Kachin. Civilian deaths have occurred. The fighting has resulted in the displacement of more than 90,000 civilians, and within the KIA territory humanitarian aid has effectively been blockaded.
       </p>
       <p>
        We must also remember that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Human_Rights_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         National Human Rights Commission
        </a>
        reported, in mid 2012, claims of abuses against civilians in Kachin. The report documented the systematic use of rape by the army. Unfortunately the commission has generally failed to challenge the government on such sensitive issues, its lack of transparency in reporting and the lack of real action it has taken. The commission is also strongly criticised for its recent report on human rights violations by the military which stated:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The commission does not wish to make any comment on the interrogation of the suspects by security forces for security reasons and on their prosecution in accordance with the law.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is a weak response by them.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Rapporteur" rel="nofollow">
         Special Rapporteur
        </a>
        for the UN, Tomas Quintana, has also weighed in on what is actually going on. Just two months ago he noted the seriousness of the situation in ethnic areas. He highlighted what are ongoing abuses such as attacks against civilians, extrajudicial killings, arbitrary arrest, torture and sexual and gender based violence. The report also noted the large gap between the form at the top and the implementation on the ground.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the Karen people, with 140,000 living in nine refugee camps on the Thailand side of the border, a war continues. The war began in 1949 and continues to this day. What started out as something like an autonomous movement now continues because of human rights abuses and atrocities. As I found out when I visited the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_National_Union" rel="nofollow">
         Karen National Union
        </a>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mae_Sot" rel="nofollow">
         Mae Sot
        </a>
        in Thailand a few years ago, they want democracy in Burma but in a federalist framework.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_April" rel="nofollow">
         In April
        </a>
        , in Shan state, Burma's military stands accused of massive human rights abuses as President Thein Sein was awarded a peace prize. While peace talks take place with the Shan state army, Burma's military has launched a new wave of attacks on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_Yan" rel="nofollow">
         Tang Yan
        </a>
        leading to civilian casualties. The latest attacks apparently began on 15 April during the New Year Water Festival when Burmese troops launched new offensives in civilian areas. Mortar shells aimed at two villages injured two children and damaged a school and several houses. Army patrols are accused of detaining and beating civilians in at least nine villages and causing serious injury. This included children who were allegedly beaten with rifle butts. It is understood by media sources that a group of about 50 young men and women travelled to celebrate their water festival. They were taken by the Burmese army and forced to walk in front of them as human shields.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Shan leadership says that the Burma army attacks are in direct contravention of the ceasefire and calls into question the viability of the ongoing peace process between the government and the ethnic armed groups. If accurate, the report clearly undermines the decision by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
         EU
        </a>
        to lift a raft of economic sanctions on the country. Many believe that the lifting of sanctions has the potential to line the pockets of cronies aligned to the military.
       </p>
       <p>
        I mentioned before that some 400 political prisoners have been released from prison yet, at the same time, laws still exist and are being used that allow the imprisonment of peaceful activists, lawyers and journalists. Ominous sounding names such as the unlawful associations act, the electronics act, the state protection act and the emergency provisions continue to allow the abuse of human rights by the regime that is being lauded by too many governments, including this one. We should also not forget the extensive use of landmines by the regime inside Burma.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have spoken of the reality and the clear differences between what is happening and the views of many Western governments. No-one should forget that Burma is made up of ethnic Burmese and a number of people of other ethnicities that amount to almost 70 per cent of the total population. This cannot be ignored and should not be ignored. Australia should not side with President Thein Sein when he says that his government does not need to support non-Burmese who are 'not of our ethnicity'. The 2008 change to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Burma" rel="nofollow">
         Constitution of Burma
        </a>
        saw a quarter of all seats in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Assembly" rel="nofollow">
         People's Assembly
        </a>
        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Assembly" rel="nofollow">
         National Assembly
        </a>
        reserved for the military. This meant that 110 military men sit in the 410-member People's Assembly while 56 military men sit in the 224-member National Assembly. Providing such a voting bloc to an unelected group shows that democracy remains nothing but a sham in Burma.
       </p>
       <p>
        I had also cast doubt on the bizarre reason why the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Crisis_Group" rel="nofollow">
         International Crisis Group
        </a>
        last month granted Burmese President Thein Sein its annual chairman's award and its mention of 'transformational leadership to bring democracy and peace to the people of Myanmar'. I would say there is no peace and there is no democracy. While it may seem appropriate and somewhat pragmatic to try to counter China's influence in the country by embracing the Thein Sein regime, democracy and peace remain illusions.
       </p>
       <p>
        In conclusion, what I have spoken about tonight is a reality. We must be on guard against romantic delusional or politically opportunistic notions that are not good for Burma. The problems are deep, they are long-held and they remain. Oppression and persecution of ethnic groups continue in Burma. The news reports demonstrate that the problems remain and that Aung San Suu Kyi's election in 2012 has not achieved any great improvements for the situation of the ethnic nationalities in the country. Given the undemocratic sham that is the 2008 Constitution, the abuses and persecutions against the Arakanese, Chin, Shan, Karen, Mon, Lahu, Palaung and Kachin ethnic nationalities continues. It is my view that the sanctions against Burma should be reinstated and that aid should be linked to human rights benchmarks.

        <p>
         I rise tonight to speak about the important work done by the public servants in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Health and Ageing
         </a>
         . The Leader of the Opposition would have Australians believe that we do not need a Department of Health and Ageing. That Leader of the Opposition has questioned repeatedly whether the Department of Health and Ageing needs all of its staff considering—in his words—they do not run a single hospital or nursing home, dispense a single prescription or provide a single medical service.
        </p>
        <p>
         I believe that the work of the Department of Health and Ageing is vital to the health and wellbeing of our nation. Tonight I would like to talk about the range of services that the department provides. I will start by talking about the National Human Papillomavirus Vaccination Program. As we know, our own
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Fraser" rel="nofollow">

         and 2006 Australian of the Year was a pioneer in the development of this globally significant vaccine.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since 2007 this vaccine has been rolled out via a school based vaccination program administered by the Immunise Australia Program—an initiative of the Department of Health and Ageing. The vaccine protects young women against
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HPV" rel="nofollow">
          HPV
         </a>
         infections that can lead to cancer and disease later in life. Widespread vaccination has the potential to reduce cervical cancer deaths around the world by as much as two-thirds if all women were to be vaccinated and if the protection turns out to be long-term.
        </p>
        <p>
         The vaccine can also reduce the need for medical care, biopsies and invasive procedures associated with the follow-up from abnormal Pap tests thus helping to reduce healthcare costs and anxieties related to abnormal Pap smears, Pap tests and follow-up procedures. Studies have shown a substantial drop in HPV related infection among the vaccinated group in Australia since 2007.
        </p>
        <p>
         Earlier this year the Minister for Health announced that from 2013 the current school based program for females aged between 12 and 13 years will be extended to offer HPV vaccination free to males aged 12 to 13 years with the catch up program in 2013 and 2014 for males aged 14 to 15 years. In addition from to protecting males from HPV related cancers and disease, vaccinating males will also help protect females from cervical cancer and from HPV related disease by reducing the spread of the virus. The HPV vaccine is just one of 16 vaccination programs administered by the Immunise Australia Program, and the Immunise Australia Program is just one example of how the important work of the Department of Health and Ageing improves our lives every day.

         Today is the start of Kidney Health Week and, along with many of my parliamentary colleagues, I attended the launch of Kidney Health Week in

         </a>
         this morning. Deputy Speaker, I am not sure whether you have, but I have been to dialysis units; I know many people on dialysis and so I know the importance of kidney health. I particularly know the importance of kidney health through all of the volunteer work I have done in raising awareness on organ and tissue donation. At the launch today, the Minister for Health and the Parliamentary Secretary for Health and Ageing announced that a kidney function test will be added to the minimum requirements of the annual cycle of care under the Medicare Practice Incentives Program, a program to encourage
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         s to identify chronic kidney disease in patients with diabetes. People with type
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
          II
         </a>
         diabetes are at a particularly high risk of chronic kidney disease. Through the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PIP" rel="nofollow">
          PIP
         </a>
         diabetes incentive, payments are given to general practitioners who complete an annual cycle of care to support patients with diabetes. This includes eye examinations, body mass and blood glucose monitoring, self-care, education, and reviews of diet, smoking and physical activity. The PIP is another initiative of the Department of Health and Ageing.
        </p>
        <p>
         According to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Diabetes Australia
         </a>
         , an estimated 280 Australians develop diabetes every day. The 2005 Australian AusDiab Follow-up Study showed that 1.7 million Australians have diabetes, but that up to half of those cases of type II diabetes remain undiagnosed. It is estimated that by 2031, 3.3 million Australians will have type II diabetes. Diabetes Australia estimates that the total financial cost of type II diabetes is about $10 billion. Of this, carer costs are estimated at $4.4 billion, productivity losses at $4.1 billion, health system costs at $1.1 billion, and an estimated cost of $1.1 billion was due to obesity. A reduction in the prevalence of type II diabetes will not only result in cost savings in the health budget but also result in increased participation and productivity in the workforce, which is so important and, most importantly, in better health outcomes and quality of life for Australians. There is no doubt diabetes is a serious health issue facing our nation but it is not all bad news. Up to 60 per cent of cases of type II diabetes can be prevented by healthy living and informed lifestyle choices. We also know that good blood glucose control and maintaining healthy lifestyle can significant improve the complications associated with diabetes.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Department of Health and Ageing—the department that the Leader of the Opposition wants to dismantle—runs important awareness campaigns relating to the lifestyle factors that can cause type II diabetes and other chronic diseases. Campaigns such as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_Up" rel="nofollow">

         I have spoken tonight about just a couple of the areas in which Department of Health and Ageing does incredibly important work. The department also manages mental health policy and primary mental health care, Aboriginal and

         health programs and policies, and health promotion and disease prevention, to name but a few. Should the coalition be elected in September, the Leader of the Opposition wants to cut 20,000 public service jobs, 5,000 of them from the Department of Health and Ageing.. The coalition's proposed cuts will undo so much of the important work that is currently being done by the department. It will undo the considerable good that is being done in terms of changing attitudes to lifestyle risk factors for chronic disease, and it will without a doubt be detrimental to the future health of our nation. These cuts will also hurt my electorate of Canberra. In 1996, following the election of the Howard government, 30,000 public service jobs were cut across the nation, and 15,000 of those were here in the

         —and one of those jobs was mine. So I know firsthand the implications of mass public service sackings. Not only did I lose my job but I witnessed the economic downturn in Canberra that followed. I witnessed the shops that closed down. I witnessed the businesses that went bankrupt. I witnessed the fact that people left town and our population slumped. I witnessed the fact that house prices plummeted. I witnessed a great deal of tragedy that flowed to not only the people who lost their jobs but also their families—I experienced it firsthand as a result of being sacked myself.

         Just as I believe we must protect the economy of Canberra, I also believe we must protect the future health of our nation. While the coalition may not value the work of the Department of Health and Ageing, I do. While the coalition may not value the jobs of its public servants, these servants of democracy, I do. The coalition is promising nothing but pain and suffering for Canberra and, through it, for our nation. Remember 1996, Canberra.
