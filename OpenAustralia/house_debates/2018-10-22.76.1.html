         Barry Thomas Cunningham
        </a>
        was a Labor member for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMillan" rel="nofollow">
         McMillan
        </a>
        from 1980 through to 1990 and then 1993 to 1996. He was a friend of mine, a friend of the family and a friend of the community. In his younger days he was a beautiful, beautiful footballer. He should have played for Collingwood, but, coming from a dairy farm family, Dad said, 'Come home. You haven't got time to play with Collingwood. You will play with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nar_Nar_Goon" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        ,' which he did from the age of 14 until he was 38 years of age. And he was also a contractor a farmer himself.
       </p>
       <p>
        He was more than just a member of parliament. He was one of the new breed of local members who were able to be contacted by their constituency. He was a great fighter for the dairy farmers of his district because he came from a dairy farm. He was a fighter for all that was good about Gippsland. He was the right man for the right time. Of course, I sadly defeated Barry, and it was my role to defeat him in the whirlwind victory of the Howard government in 1996.
       </p>
       <p>
        We were friends; we remained friends till his death. However, one of the best eulogies I have heard in my life was delivered about Barry by his brother, Jerry. Jerry, I say to you: you honoured your brother, you honoured your family, you honoured the community. Vale Barry Thomas Cunningham.
