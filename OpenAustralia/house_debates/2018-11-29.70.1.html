        My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that the Queensland government intends to abolish the Family Responsibilities Commission? Can the Prime Minister tell the House the impact this will have on the communities of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_York" rel="nofollow">
         Cape York
        </a>
        , where this commission has done so much to improve school attendance and improve family cohesion? What is the government going to do to ensure that these communities once more have their right to take responsibility restored?

         I thank the member for Warringah for his question, his career-long commitment to ensuring that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">

         The Queensland government's unilateral decision to close down the Family Responsibilities Commission is deeply troubling. It is deeply, deeply troubling.

           have been at the cutting edge of addressing welfare dependency and school attendance in this country. I commend all of those who have been part of that community-led approach.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Family Responsibilities Commission is a model centred on the community that supported the restoration of the local Indigenous authority. The
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FRC" rel="nofollow">
            FRC
           </a>
           is acknowledged as the most critical component of the CYWR, and the FRC conferences encourage individuals and families to engage in positive behaviours whilst promoting the interests, rights and wellbeing of children and vulnerable community members. The positive impact on communities has been driven by the excellent work of the local commissioners. Taking such a strong stance against antisocial behaviour has been a very challenging and demanding commitment for these leaders; however, they have stuck fast to their vision of strong communities that are free from the welfare trap. We should all commend them for the amazing work and their resilience.
          </p>
          <p>
           The profound damage arising from the Queensland Labor government's decision not to reappoint commissioners or continue to fund and support the Family Responsibilities Commission will end more than 10 years of critical work that has been improving the lives of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
            Indigenous Australians
           </a>
           in these communities. Minister Scullion has written to the Treasurer of Queensland, urging her to reconsider what I would describe as a foolhardy decision to abandon the Family Responsibilities Commission. He has repeatedly indicated the Commonwealth government's support for the FRC. It is the most critical component underpinning the Cape York Welfare Reform agenda. We've been unable to commit further funding to the FRC while the Queensland government, whose legislation the FRC is established under, has not been clear whether the FRC would continue. We wanted to invest more in these communities. We wanted to support more of these kids to get into school. We wanted to support local Indigenous community leaders to continue to get into their communities and to set the standards so that they could lift their own people and take them forward. That's how we believe social welfare policy should be implemented on the ground: in partnership with communities and not making excuses when it comes to the things that have to be done in these communities. I have strongly supported, and do strongly support, the Family Responsibilities Commissionâ€”
