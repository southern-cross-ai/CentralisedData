        My question is addressed to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. Would the minister update the House on what action is being taken against those who assisted in recent attempts by 83

         I thank the member for Kalgoorlie for his question and his interest in this matter. I can report to him and to the House that the two Indonesian crew members of the boat that had 83
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan" rel="nofollow">
          Sri Lankan
         </a>
         passengers who were arrested by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         have been charged with facilitating the unlawful entry into Australia of persons contrary to the Migration Act. They have been remanded in custody in Perth and are due to face a court hearing in Perth on 5 April this year.
        </p>
        <p>
         In 2000-01, there were over 4,000 attempted illegal arrivals by boat into Australia and, in response to this, this government introduced new measures to deter people-smuggling and the people smugglers involved. As a result of that, last year there were just 263 attempts—so from 4,000 attempts down to 263. It is obvious to anyone who looks at the evidence about this that illegal boat arrivals have virtually stopped because of this government’s very strong border protection policies. Indeed, that is quite obvious to everybody on this side of the House. The only people who are oblivious to this and the link between a strong border protection policy and the good results are once again those in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         In a recent interview with Sky News the opposition shadow minister was asked this question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         But,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Burke" rel="nofollow">
          Tony Burke
         </a>
         , aren’t we sending an important message to people who try to come into this country illegally by processing them in Nehru? Aren’t we saying to them, ‘Don’t even try to get into Australia unless you want to use the proper means’?
        </p>
        <p>
         The reply from Mr Burke was:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I just don’t believe this is part of the equation. I just don’t believe that Nehru is part of the equation.
        </p>
        <p>
         The danger of this is that a weak response from the Australian Labor Party once again may be just enough to encourage more people-smuggling activities and more attempted boat arrivals in Australia. One thing we can say for sure is that if the Labor Party’s policies were ever implemented by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
          ALP
         </a>
         in government then we might as well open up the wharves to boats coming from Indonesia. We might as well put a green light up and say, ‘Come on into Australia,’ because that is the policy of the Australian Labor Party.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Leader of the Opposition needs to stand up on this issue and declare whether he is going to continue to pursue these weak border protection policies of the Australian Labor Party or whether he is going to take border protection seriously. The threat of illegal arrivals by boat is very real and, instead of dodging the issue, it is about time that

          Kevin Rudd

         stood up to be counted.
