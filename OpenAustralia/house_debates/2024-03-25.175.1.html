        My electorate of Corangamite in Victoria is a beautiful place. It's home to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Ocean_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Great Ocean Road
        </a>
        , the stunning Surf Coast and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellarine_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
         Bellarine Peninsula
        </a>
        . Our hospitality and excellence in tourism are well known. Our message to visitors is: come and experience our unique natural beauty; taste the flavours and quality of our food and wine; and of course meet our people.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a message that's reflected in the extraordinary achievement of three local businesses, who won gold, silver and bronze at the recent Australian Tourism Awards in Darwin. As chair of the

        joint standing committee, I was thrilled to congratulate the silver medal winner,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_Williams" rel="nofollow">
         Kerry Williams
        </a>
        , who took out the accessible tourism category. This result reflects Kerry's hard work, determination and excellence, not only in enhancing our region's tourism industry but also in leading the way in creating tourism accommodation that is inclusive and accessible for all. Her award is well deserved, and I'm confident her success will inspire others to create innovative, accessible accommodation that supports people with disability. It's a great business opportunity that addresses growing demand.
       </p>

        Australia's tourism and travel industry delivers more than $60 billion to the economy and supports more than 650,000 jobs and 350,000 businesses across the country. The Australian Tourism Awards is an opportunity to recognise the significance of this sector, and, importantly, it shows the work of business owners and staff who work hard each and every day. I'd also like to congratulate Stephanie King, who won gold in the self-contained accommodation category for her stunning cabins set in the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        , Matt McDonald, said that the prestigious national award was a credit to his team, who continue to show great resilience, innovation and dedication.
       </p>
       <p>
        Only last Thursday, these values were put to the test when Searoad Ferries rescued a group of students from a smoking charter boat in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Phillip_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Port Phillip Bay
        </a>
        . I'm pleased to say that no-one was harmed in the incident and all 22 passengers were evacuated from the boat to the ferry within minutes. I dropped by Searoad Ferries on Friday to congratulate Matt and his team for their swift response in the face of dangerâ€”a response which serves as an inspiring example to others of bravery, kindness and a willingness to step up and help others in a time of crisis.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to give a particular shout-out to the captain, Percy, who is always calm in a crisis. Thank you so much for your 37 years of service to the people of my region.
