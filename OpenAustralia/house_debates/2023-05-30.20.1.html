        I rise to table a petition with almost 7,000 signatures which has been considered by the petitions committee and found to be an order. It was initiated by one of my constituents Alissa Booth to draw attention to eating disorders, poor treatment pathways and the need for finding to support families, trained clinicians and fund the national strategy for the adoption of an integrated model of care.

        Eating disorders have spiked since the start of the pandemic.

        , which caters to my electorate of Goldstein, has seen inpatient numbers increase by 85 per cent. There are children in my electorate as young as 11 who have had dozens of trauma-inducing hospital admissions. Some with eating disorders do not survive this most deadly of mental illnesses, including 15-year-old Olivia, whose story reflecting the failure of the system has been made public this week. I acknowledge the health minister and the minister for mental health and suicide prevention for their listening and action so far, with grants for prevention and education. There is much more to do, especially on appropriate treatment.

        Next, I'm proposing a bill to amend the Online Safety Act to prevent the social media

        where people are competing for thinness. I tabled this petition for Olivia and all of those who have contacted me over the last year.
