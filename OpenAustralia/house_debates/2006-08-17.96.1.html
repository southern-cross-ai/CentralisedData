        I rise today to congratulate all those involved in the 14th annual Diggers and Dealers Mining Forum, which was held last week in Kalgoorlie-Boulder. This event was started in its current format in 2003 by Geoffrey Stokes, the then owner of the famous
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_Hotel" rel="nofollow">
         Palace Hotel
        </a>
        . The event continues to be organised by the Stokes family today, ably led by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Stokes" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . The initial attendance was 350, but the event has developed into the most important mining forum in the world, with 1,620 delegates this year and more than 280 mining and investment leaders from all over the world. There were 41 presentations from mining companies across the spectrum—from large multinationals to small local explorers—on everything from gold, nickel and diamonds to iron ore, base metals and rare earths. There was a press contingent of 36, including all the leading mining magazines and major international newspapers.

        Corporation employee. Western Mining was a company developed under the leadership of Sir Arvi Parbo. Diggers is known for its balance of ‘work hard, play hard’. This year there were three hard days and three long nights, including a cocktail party, the traditional Diggers and Dealers bash, and the WesTrac Gala Dinner, featuring entertainment from comedian

        and the finest food and wine available.
       </p>
       <p>
        The direct value of the forum to the local economy has been estimated at $3.5 million. The indirect value to the state of

        </a>
        and the nation via investment is immeasurable, but it would certainly exceed several billion dollars. This year’s awards went to Oxiana Ltd for Digger of the Year and to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hancock_Prospecting" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        for Dealer of the Year. The Geoffrey Stokes Memorial Award went to the team of four who set up Eltin Contracting, which changed the face of the industry, introducing major contract mining. The Media Award went to Ian Howarth.
       </p>
       <p>
        The dates for next year have been set for 6 to 8 August. I encourage everyone in the resources industry to start planning their trip to Kalgoorlie-Boulder now. Kalgoorlie-Boulder has been the centre of goldmining in Australia for more than 100 years. It has been recognised certainly as the goldmining capital of Australia. It remains the powerhouse for the promotion and the development of the resources industry, and it is certainly now recognised internationally. There is a fantastic array of modern facilities in Kalgoorlie today. It also, of course, features the ever increasingly famous Prospectors and Miners Hall of Fame, a mecca for all those involved in the history of mining.
