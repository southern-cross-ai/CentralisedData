        Today I rise to pay my respects to Major Tom James
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFD" rel="nofollow">
         RFD
        </a>
        following his very sad passing on 8 April 2015. Tom was a very valued member of our Hotham community and he was a great servant of his country. Tom was the president of Cheltenham Moorabbin
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        in Hotham, a proud member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        , a good friend to me and a good friend to my office.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tom had a lifelong interest in the military. He was born in Ballarat in 1941 and joined the Ballarat high school cadet brigade at the tender age of 16. From his early interest in the military, Tom went on to give 30 years in service, both to the infantry and armed corps. During this time, Tom was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Medal
        </a>
        in recognition of his truly remarkable service to his nation. It was a service that he was very proud of, and rightly so. Tom retired from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Army_Reserve" rel="nofollow">
         Army Reserve
        </a>
        in 1988, having reached the rank of major, and was second in charge of the Prince of Wales's Light Horse armoured regiment.
       </p>
       <p>
        As president of the Cheltenham Moorabbin RSL, Tom regularly conducted Anzac services and services on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Remembrance Day
        </a>
        . I am very honoured to have attended many of those over the time that I have been the member for Hotham. Tom was a proud and dedicated member of the RSL. My office had the great privilege of working very closely with him to secure the Anzac Centenary grant of $100,000 to restore the contemplative gardens to the RSL.
       </p>
       <p>
        In March this year, just weeks before Tom passed away, I had the opportunity to visit the RSL and to have a look at the works that he and so many other members had worked for. He was very excited about the prospect of renovating and restoring this much loved garden. Sadly, Tom was not able to be present at this year's Anzac Centenary service. I know he would have been as proud as punch to have had so many men and women gathered at the Cheltenham Moorabbin RSL to commemorate that incredibly important occasion. I look forward to attending the unveiling of the gardens later this month. I know many of us will be fondly reflecting on our memories of Tom when we are there to unveil that work.
       </p>
       <p>
        During his life, Tom was a really proud member of the Australian Labor Party. He was a member of the party for more than 40 years and he was a true believer in every sense of the word. He had a passion for social justice that was reflected both in his politics but also in the way he lived his life. Tom's remarkable contribution to the community of Hotham and his contribution to this nation will never be forgotten. To the RSL, I stand in solidarity with you in your grief. We miss Tom terribly. To Tom's family, in particular his wife Sandra, his children and grandchildren, I offer my deep and genuine condolences. May he rest in peace.
