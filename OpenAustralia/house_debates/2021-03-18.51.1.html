        The pitter-patter of little feet in the Sauve-De Rose household will not be coming only from the pug called Chuck for much longer. I was recently overjoyed to learn that my long-serving electorate officer Rose and her husband, Rick, are soon to welcome their first child into the world—and it's a girl.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the years, I have watched Rose grow into a confident, talented and impressive young woman and one that backs her own ability. I also had the absolute pleasure of being invited to their engagement party with my beautiful wife, Yolonde, shortly after Rick got down one knee and popped the question at

        . I also felt very privileged to be one of only a few select people that were invited to their wedding at

        In my office, my staff and their loved ones are like family. We're always there for each other. We share the highs and we certainly also support each other during the lows, whether that's inside or outside working hours. Both Rose and Rick will make excellent parents, and I sincerely look forward to seeing little 'Warren-ette' grow up to be an amazing young woman like her mother—but somehow I don't think Rick will let Rosie call their firstborn after me! But who knows? Stranger things have actually happened.
