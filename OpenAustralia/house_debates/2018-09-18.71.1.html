        My question is to the Prime Minister.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull" rel="nofollow">
         Malcolm Turnbull
        </a>
        enthusiastically supported the signature policies of the now Prime Minister and Treasurer. The now Prime Minister was the architect of Malcolm Turnbull's $80 billion big business tax cut and the now Treasurer was the architect of Malcolm Turnbull's National Energy Guarantee. So, Prime Minister, why isn't Malcolm Turnbull still the Prime Minister of Australia?

         I refer the member to my earlier answers on this matter. Our government was elected in 2013. It has been in government for the last five years, and that is a period of time in which more than a million Australians have got a job. During that time the unemployment rate has gone down. During that time participation in the workforce has gone up. During that time the number of Australians of working age who have been dependent on welfare has gone down. During that time the amount we've invested in health and education and hospitals and schools has all gone up. During that time what we've invested in science and technology has increased. During that time the deficit has come down. During that time the economy has grown stronger.

           It is on direct relevance. The Prime Minister is explaining why

            Malcolm Turnbull

               Let's play that game again. How many of you were union officials before you came into the parliament? Tell me. There's one. How many are there on this side of the House? Economic growth has gone back to 3.4 per cent. How many on this side of the House like that the unemployment rate is coming down? How many of those on this side of the House like that 95,500 young people have got a job under this government? How many on this side of the House like that small business taxes have come down and hundreds of thousands of small businesses have been started under this government?
              </p>
              <p>
               This government is creating jobs. It's growing the economy. It's ensuring that we can guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on. Importantly, as we've been demonstrating in question time today, we understand aspiration. It may be a mystery to the Labor Party, but we understand that aspiration has no age limit. We understand that senior Australians have great aspirations for their futures and they have great aspirations for our country. The policies and plans of this government, from September 2013 to now and beyond, will be about ensuring we keep our economy strong to guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on. We will keep Australians safe and we will keep Australians together.
