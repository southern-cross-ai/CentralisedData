       <p>
        Today, I would like to discuss the important contribution volunteers make in Bonner. I would also like to talk about the first annual Bonner volunteer awards, which are starting soon. I have met many exceptional volunteers over the years. These men and women freely give up their time and energy to make their community a better place. They improve our schools, clean up our environment, provide a boost to emergency and health services, and help keep vital community organisations running. They give a helping hand to people in need. They are amazing role models. And they all do it without asking for anything in return except for the knowledge that they are making a difference.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have nothing but respect for the many thousands of volunteers all across Australia. This year I wanted to do my part to thank the outstanding volunteers and volunteer groups in my electorate. I am now pleased to announce the Bonner Volunteer Awards. These awards will give thanks to individuals and teams that have demonstrated outstanding volunteer qualities. They will recognise volunteers who have made a significant and lasting contribution to the community, who have set a great example to fellow volunteers and who have inspired others to volunteer.
       </p>
       <p>
        My office will be taking nominations from 27 February to 17 March. I have selected a panel of three community representatives to select the winners, who will be presented their awards on 31 March. I cannot wait to hear the stories of Bonner's exceptional volunteers and thank them for their service.
