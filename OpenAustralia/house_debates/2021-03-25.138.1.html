        Goldstein continues to lead our state and our great nation. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Wallace, the Heads of the River rowing regatta is one of the greatest events on the annual

        is Sam Wyss, leading his crew Hamish Roberts, James Capp, Ethan Calcatjicos, Dougal Bland, Jack Puise, Zac Bowen, Lucas Connell and coxswain Malachi Bakker. They rowed their way to victory, edging out St Kevins and Scotch. Of course, they couldn't have done it by themselves, so a shout out to Oliver Dutton, the First VIII coach, and to Dick Bartlett, Director of Rowing. And all I can say is that we know it came down to the leadership of the headmaster, Ross Featherstone. Congratulations go, of course, not just to them but to their parents, siblings, friends and classmates who are all part of it. And congrats to

        A strong society is not built overnight, but through the development over time of citizens who take responsibility. We have many proud

        s in the Bayside and Goldstein community and we have had a significant changeover at Hampton RSL, with Peter Lanigan, who has been president for the past 10 years, handing over to Lieutenant Commander Helen Ward. Peter helped to save the club in 2013 by selling some of the land of the club to pay off its debt. He advocated for funding for their Anzac Memorial Garden, which will be opened in April this year and he secured almost $10,000 in funding under the Saluting Their Service grants program in 2020 for the restoration of their cenotaph. And he has seen a massive growth in membership to over 300. I'd like to thank Peter and his wife, Ann, for all their service to our community and our country. And I congratulate Lieutenant Commander Helen Ward, who is the first female president of Hampton RSL and the only current female naval president in the state of Victoria elevated to this high office. I also thank all our servicemen and women and their families and all veterans for their devoted service to our nation.

        Finally, I want to congratulate Senior Constable Adam McKenzie. He has become a recipient of an Australian bravery decoration for his bravery, selflessly putting himself in jeopardy to protect the lives of others. He found himself in a car interception in

He fled the scene, pursued by two officers. He fired upon the police in the Kings Way car park, shooting one. As a consequence, he was eventually apprehended and, tragically, died. But it was a consequence of the great bravery of both officers that the person was apprehended.
