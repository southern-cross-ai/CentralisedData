        In every community there are certain milestones that are worthy of recognition. Recently, in Rockhampton in my electorate of Capricornia, there have been several key milestones marked by some of our important community institutions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rockhampton's Mater hospital recently celebrated 100 years of medical service in the city. The occasion was marked with a gala centenary dinner at the Rockhampton Showgrounds. In November 1915, the Rockhampton congregation of the Sisters of Mercy extended their work to help the sick by opening a Mater hospital after purchasing Rockhampton's historic

         Kenmore House
        </a>
        in Ward Street. This was followed by the opening of Mater hospitals in Mackay in 1927, in Bundaberg in 1945, in Yeppoon in 1998 and in Gladstone in 1999. I congratulate

        Ian Mill, Mercy health board chair Leesa Jeffcoat and all of the team on the 100-year milestone.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also this year, Mercy aged care in Rockhampton celebrated 75 years of service in providing aged care and nursing home facilities to our seniors. The celebrations included a mass at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bethany_Chapel" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        at the Bethany Residential Aged Care Facility in Ward Street, along with the opening of a 25-year time capsule. I offer my congratulations to all of the medical and nursing staff, the orderlies and kitchen staff who take care of our city's elderly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another celebration that has taken place is the 75th anniversary of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Brendan's" rel="nofollow">
         St Brendan's
        </a>
        College at Yeppoon. The Catholic boarding school was opened in 1940 by Bishop Hayes, on a property called Coplands, with 42 boarders. Today it is home to a mix of boarders and day students and is a renowned training nursery for up-and-coming young professional rugby league players. This year, 17-year-old student
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_White" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        made history by being the first Aboriginal student to be appointed school captain at St Brendan's in its 75-year history. I congratulate Principal Nick Scully, the staff and all of the students on this year's anniversary milestone.
       </p>
       <p>
        A further important occasion to occur in my electorate of Capricornia was the official dedication of a new Anglican church at Yeppoon on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capricorn_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Robinson" rel="nofollow">
         David Robinson
        </a>
        presided over the service at which the building in Housden Place, Taranganba, was dedicated as the church of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_James" rel="nofollow">
         St James
        </a>
        the Fisherman. Following the dedication, I was fortunate enough to join the congregation at a special lunch to mark the occasion.
       </p>
       <p>
        All of these services I have mentioned today play an important role in making up the fabric of our local community.
