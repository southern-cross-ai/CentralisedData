       <p>
        I rise to talk about the wonderful community groups in my electorate of Calare that are benefiting from the coalition's Stronger Communities Program. The program was an election commitment by us and it is a fantastic way for all 150 members of the House of Representatives to look after their communities and ensure that all these community groups have an opportunity to progress in what they do for the community. In my experience, local people are certainly best placed to know their own needs and the most successful projects are always driven by local communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under round 1 of the Stronger Communities Program I received more than 50 expressions of interest for over $650,000 worth of projects around the electorate. Some of the successful recipients include the Millthorpe and District Historical Society, Yeoval and District Men's Shed, Parkes and District Netball Association, Oberon Show Society, the Cabonne Food, Wine and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Centre" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Canowindra Tennis Club and the Cumnock Village Preschool, and I will be announcing more local projects shortly.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have had the opportunity of visiting several of these groups already and will be getting around to more over the coming weeks. Men's sheds are such a strong community support for people who are retired and looking for an opportunity of company and to make use of their hands. And we have no problem with women's sheds; it is just that I have not had one apply yet.
       </p>
       <p>
        On that note I want to talk about the importance of community generally. Communities only continue to grow and prosper because some people within them have the desire and ability to encompass every man, woman and child in their small town or community. I think we have all been guilty of not getting to know a neighbour or being caught up in our own lives instead of getting involved in a local event or organisation, so we all owe a huge debt of gratitude to those people who take the lead and do it for is—and hopefully we all get involved once someone else starts it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last year in Calare, for example, we celebrated 100 wonderful years of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CWA" rel="nofollow">

        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Women's_Association" rel="nofollow">
         Country Women's Association
        </a>
        . I heard over 20 women speak about their time in the association. Our government—and I am sure the whole parliament—wants to see these groups continue to grow. That is what the Stronger Communities Program does by supporting community organisations, and we will continue to support them.
