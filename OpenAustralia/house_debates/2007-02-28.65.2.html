        Mr Speaker, I have a question to you. It relates to where offensive or unparliamentary words are used in the House. I seek your guidance in what circumstances it will be necessary for the person who was the target of those words to seek their withdrawal, as was the case during the last sitting week when the Manager of Opposition Business sought to have words withdrawn that were targeted at the Leader of the Opposition. The ruling at that time was that, unless the Leader of the Opposition personally sought to have the words removed as offensive, they would stand, but, on the other hand, that is compared with situations where you as Speaker intervene before any member in the House sought the withdrawal of the words, as occurred today when words were targeted at the Prime Minister.

         I thank the member for Brisbane, and I say to him the following: it is not the role of the Speaker to give guidance. I refer him to the statement that I made at the beginning of the week, and in particular I refer him to the
         <i>
          House of Representatives Practice
         </i>
         , page 499, where it says quite clearly it is the words used and the context in which they are used.

           <p>
            Mr Speaker, you referred me to a statement in answer to my question. Regrettably, the statement does not relate to the matters raised in my question. That is not reflecting on the chair; I think it is a fair observation. I therefore again ask: in what circumstances are members to be given some guidance—because the chair does in fact give guidance on these matters, as indeed your statement on Monday was intended to do—and in which circumstances are we to take it that the member who is the target is required to ask for matters to be withdrawn, as opposed to circumstances in which you will intervene as you did today?

            <p class="italic">
             The determination as to whether words used in the House are offensive or disorderly rests with the chair, and the chair’s judgment depends on the nature of the word and the context in which it is used.

             <p>
              Further to that issue, I have a question to you and I refer to page 499 of
              <i>
               House of Representatives Practice
              </i>
              . It states quite clearly:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              A Member is not allowed to use unparliamentary words by the device of putting them in somebody else’s mouth or in the course of a quotation.
             </p>
             <p>
              I believe that is what the Leader of the House has attempted to do, and I seek leave to table the article from the
              <i>
               Courier-Mail
              </i>
              of 1 September 2004 in which Senator Brandis is alleged to have called the Prime Minister ‘a lying rodent’ and an article from

               ABC Online

On Monday, I made a statement where I referred specifically to all of the issues that the member for Grayndler just raised. I refer him back to that statement because I think it covers everything that he has just raised.

                          Mr Speaker, I also have a question with respect to your implementation of standing order 89 and your statement which refers to your decision as to whether or not a particular expression is unparliamentary. I have no quarrel with your statement. The question I have, Mr Speaker, is whether there is one mechanism or approach for dealing with unparliamentary language or two? Do we have a situation where particular expressions require immediate withdrawal without any member being required to raise the matter and where other expressions are slightly offensive, but not that offensive, and therefore are only expected to be withdrawn if the target of the expression raises the question?
