         I thank the member for Nicholls for his question. As the floods continue, we stand with those communities affected as a government, as a parliament, as people. Our priority as a government is to support emergency measures, ensuring people remain safe and secure. In times such as these, our country relies on those first responders, those magnificent
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">
          SES
         </a>
         , police, ambulance, fire—all of those people. They are magnificent. That is not to mention our ADF, who are already supporting the efforts to deal with these floods. Around 18,000 people have already been evacuated from their homes. Many of them are now in evacuation centres or relying upon family and friends. At the worst of times, you see the best in Australians. People need to be vigilant. They need to be patient. They need to listen to the advice of local emergency services and they absolutely need to act accordingly.

         It's not just the east coast; the Kimberley region in

         has seen more than 700 millimetres of rain between

          Fitzroy Crossing
         </a>
         and Derby. To put this in further context, Derby's annual rainfall last year was 703.6 millimetres, so it's actually received its annual rainfall in just a matter of days. Some parts of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         will see between 100 and 300 millimetres of rainfall over the next 24 hours, which is not isolated to coastal areas. Moree and surrounding areas of the member for Parkes' electorate received 200 millimetres of rain yesterday and overnight, and there's more on the way. I know the member has told me that he's never seen

         </a>
         as high as it is at the moment. The Gwydir is rising. Local schools and supermarkets in some parts of his electorate are closing to ensure the safety of students and staff.

        <p>
         Peter Prosser is a stock and station agent based in Mungindi, in New South Wales. He's currently in Tamworth and is unable to travel home because of the flood impact on roads between Narrabri and Moree and through to Mungindi. He's unable to cart stock to market and he's unable to reach his property in Tenterfield to assess damage or to recover any assets. This is just one individual example of what's happening right across the east coast, right across our inland areas.
        </p>
        <p>
         There are road closures of major transport arteries across New South Wales. I've heard the Prime Minister say—I know the opposition leader joins in this—that, if there are flood waters across roads, don't enter them. Do not think that you can get across, because you don't know the depth and you don't know how tragic the consequences could be for yourself and, indeed, for those people who may have to come and rescue you. So please follow the advice given by emergency management and personnel.
        </p>
        <p>
         We will rebuild. We will get through this. We will be better for it, as we always are. These are times of crisis, and we're here to help.
