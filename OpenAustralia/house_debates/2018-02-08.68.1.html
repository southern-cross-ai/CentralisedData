       <p>
        Two hundred and fifty-seven days ago, a federal government representative came to Darwin and signed an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOU" rel="nofollow">
         MOU
        </a>
        with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        for a city deal. That's nine months ago—since then, young Territorians have been conceived and born—and we're still waiting in the capital in the north. When a city deal was established for the city of Townsville, that was finalised and signed in one month. When a city deal was established for Launceston, that was done in seven months. But we are still waiting.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Prime Minister promised this city deal. It's a city deal that is going to bring great prosperity and jobs to the Northern Territory—to Darwin in particular. We are still waiting. We have a new minister now, Minister Fletcher, and I extend an invitation for him to come up to Darwin and sign the deal. As I said, the Prime Minister has committed to the people of Darwin that this city deal will be signed. We take him at his word. But, as I said, we've been waiting for nine months. We need more than words, Prime Minister. Please, make this a priority for the northern capital and let's get this city deal signed.
