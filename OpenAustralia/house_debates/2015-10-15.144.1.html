        This petition draws to the attention of the House the lack of Lymphodema services, which is impacting hundreds of patients.

        Lymphodema is recognised as a serious disease, which i s a side-effect of having lymph glands surgically removed during cancer surgery. It affects both men and women of all ages.

        On the Central Coast, this is resulting in wait times of around seven weeks for an established patient at Gosford Hospital, and three months for a new patient to start treatment.

        We therefore ask the House to act on this shortage of qualified therapists who are able to

       <p>
        Petition received
       </p>
       <p>
        The principal petitioner is Marlene Klintworth from Kincumber in my electorate of Robertson, who has received supporting signatures from members of my community on the need for more lymphoedema services. The petition is signed by concerned members of the public and their families, many of whom are based in my electorate of Robertson on the Central Coast of New South Wales. Specifically, people who have signed this petition are calling on the House to act on a shortage of qualified therapists who are able to treat lymphoedema. There are also more than 500 others who have signed their names in a related petition organised by the Roving Rubies Red Hat Society of the Central Coast.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to start by commending Marlene and the Red Rubies who have been tireless in their efforts to have this matter not only formally recognised but they are also very strong advocates in my community to raise awareness of lymphoedema, its very serious impact and the need for more qualified therapists. They have met with me and explained why this disease and the need to have more qualified therapists is such an important issue in my community.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the petitioners' letter to the House indicates, lymphoedema is recognised as a serious disease and it is a side-effect of having your lymph glands surgically removed during cancer surgery. It impacts men and women of all ages. There is a particular concern in my community about the availability of local services to help treat people with this condition. I understand that currently there is only one part-time therapist employed at our local public hospital and I have been advised that this therapist is also required to assist people with hand and feet therapy needs. On the Central Coast, those people who have signed this petition have told me that this can result in wait times of around seven weeks for an established patient to be able to start treatment. This would have significant impact on our local families as well as on the people who suffer lymphoedema.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a desire to see more awareness of this disease, a desire I support. I would like to spend a short time describing what lymphoedema is. According to information from the federal government's Cancer Australia body:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Lymphoedema is the regional accumulation of excessive amounts of protein-rich fluid in body tissue.
       </p>
       <p>
        This causes swelling and:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … usually affects the limb/s, although it can also affect the trunk, breast, head and neck or genital area. It … can be acquired following surgery, radiotherapy, trauma or other damage to the lymphatic system following treatment for cancer … Conservative estimates suggest that at least 20% of survivors from breast, gynaecological and prostate cancer, or melanoma will experience … lymphoedema.
       </p>
       <p>
        That statistic of one in five is quite concerning.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Key risk factors include extent of surgery, lymph node dissection and radiation treatment. Other factors include trauma, infection, body mass index … and immobility.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cancer Australia says that intervention at an early stage can significantly reduce the risk of developing lymphoedema or reduce the severity if it develops.
       </p>
       <p>
        I acknowledge that this matter was raised in June by the Senate Select Committee on Health during a discussion on health policy administration and expenditure. The member for Brisbane has also spoken up about this issue, and I thank her for doing so. She has said that for many sufferers ordinary, everyday activities can be difficult and that their quality of life is really affected. The member for Brisbane pointed out that this can particularly be the case for lymphoedema sufferers when the effects of hot and humid conditions increase swelling. As we approach the warmer months of this year, particularly on a hot day like today, what better time than now to raise this issue in the House. I thank Marlene Klintworth and all the members of my local community who have raised this matter with me with passion, sincerity and determination. As the petition states:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We … ask the House to act on this shortage of qualified therapists who are able to treat Lymphodema. In particular, this is impacting residents in the Federal electorate of Robertson.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is considered a Commonwealth matter under the purview of the Department of Health, who would also be well positioned to raise awareness of this issue on a national level.
       </p>
       <p>
        I present the petition to the House.

         I thank the member for Robertson and commend her on her work. My mother was one of many sufferers of lymphoedema and I know how important it is to obtain better treatment.
