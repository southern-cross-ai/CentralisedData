       <p>
        I rise today to celebrate in the House the awarding of the Endeavour Research Fellowship 2014 to a member of our community, Dr Ferry Jie. Dr Ferry is a graduate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_University" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney University
        </a>
        and lived in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        while he studied and completed his PhD. He built his home in Tarneit, a growing suburb in my community, in 2010. He is married with four children and is the deputy program director of the master of supply chain and logistics management program at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMIT" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . It was an absolute pleasure to meet with him in my mobile office in Tarneit last week, where I heard about his life and the life of his family and had the opportunity to congratulate him in person.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I said, his wife and four children live in our fast-growing suburb of Tarneit, and Dr Ferry takes his community very seriously. He is a member of the school council for the Tarneit Senior College his children attend. In that school he has taken on the responsibility of introducing the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier's_Reading_Challenge" rel="nofollow">
         Premier's Reading Challenge
        </a>
        , as well as maths competitions. This is a man who takes his commitments very seriously, and what an asset he is to his community. I wish him and his fellow school councillors well in supporting students, staff and parents across the year to deliver a fabulous educational year for Tarneit Senior College.
