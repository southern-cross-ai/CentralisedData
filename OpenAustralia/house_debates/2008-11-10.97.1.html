       <p>
        The 22nd of October 2008 will be remembered by all musicians in Australia, and certainly by all musicians in the Ryan electorate, as a black day in the history of classical music in our country. Why is that? It is because the Rudd government, and Minister Garrett in particular, have decided to axe some $2.5 million of funding for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_National_Academy_of_Music" rel="nofollow">
         Australian National Academy of Music
        </a>
        . This is an absolute disgrace, and I want to highlight it here in the parliament because in the Ryan electorate I have been contacted by many musicians and, indeed, by other constituents who have found this decision completely unwarranted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to remind the people of Ryan about the National Academy of Music. It holds a unique place in our country. The Australian National Academy of Music is a very special institution for training Australia’s finest classical musicians. With an emphasis on the individual growth through tailored programs, the academy is committed to supporting talented musicians in refining and strengthening their individual musical voice, thereby empowering them to address the exciting challenges and possibilities of a life in music in the 21st century.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would say that, of all members of parliament, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts in particular, with his background, ought to be batting for the musicians of Australia, especially those young musicians who have an opportunity to develop their talents. Yet his role in this parliament and his role in this saga is a very sad one indeed. The statement by the Australian National Academy of Music sets out its version—and I think it sets the record straight—of the regrettable saga of a lack of communication, exchange and consultation and of what is very much an imposition of a unilateral decision by the minister in cutting this funding.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to remind anyone who might have a love for and an appreciation of music to go to the website of the Australian National Academy of Music and see its record and its version of how the exchange has taken place. Let us pause for the moment and note the significant eight board members of the academy, because these members are no fools. They are very distinguished Australians with business records, with community service and with expertise in the industry. They are people who give their time to make a contribution to a very important institution, yet this axing of some $2.5 million is going to end the rich history of the National Academy of Music.
       </p>
       <p>
        If the government took some time to go to the site and to go to the Facebook site, they would see that there are several thousands of Australians, just today, who have expressed their absolute contempt for the decision of Minister Garrett. I have a sneaking suspicion that if the Labor government and Mr Garrett in particular had any support from them, they will now not be receiving a Christmas card from those thousands of people—in fact, it is almost approaching tens of thousands. I know that the wiser heads in the Rudd government will realise that tens of thousands of very angry musicians might not come out in the streets, take their clothes off and protest in contempt of a government decision. But, rest assured, they will express their views in a very significant and profound way come the next election. Several hundred people alone who have contacted me in the last couple of days with their very deep concern and deep anxiety over this decision will make it very well known in the Ryan electorate how they feel about Minister Garrett.
       </p>
       <p>
        In response to the letter of 27 October 2008 advising the academy that it would no longer be in receipt of the $2.5 million of taxpayers’ money supporting a great institution, the academy said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As widely reported, this letter came as a shock to the Academy ...
       </p>
       <p>
        I am no star musician, but I appreciate music. And, as someone who tries to give opportunities to young Australians to develop their talents, I want to express on the record on behalf of the Ryan electorate how terribly disappointed I am. In less than one year, the true colours of the Rudd government really are coming to the fore.
       </p>
       <p>
        These young Australians deserve support. It is not a lot of money. The government can find money for the

        . I have no qualms about Essendon Football Club receiving, I think, some $1½ million. I know a lot of people like football, but why can the $2.5 million not be continued? I am dismayed—
