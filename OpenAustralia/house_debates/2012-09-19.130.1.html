       <p>
        I rise to speak about the Petrie Future Leaders Essay and Public Speaking Competition for 2012. This year marks the third round of the competition, held annually in my electorate of Petrie. I would like to welcome here today to the chamber the two winners for this year's competition, Melvin Chen and Therese Camus, along with Melvin's father, David, and Therese's mother, Clarissa. Welcome to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Therese won the primary school category. Therese has just turned 12 years old and is in grade 6 at

        </a>
        in Scarborough. Therese's essay and speech was about how we can save our environment from pollution, and she covered links between pollution and acid rain, smog, algal bloom and ozone depletion.
       </p>
       <p>
        The secondary school winner was Melvin Chen. Melvin is 15, from grade 10 at

        </a>
        . Melvin's essay and speech strongly argued for higher investment from governments in school education, particularly in senior schooling. Melvin outlined the pressures faced by senior students approaching year 12 and the need for students to complete their education. This is Melvin's second year in the competition and I should note that last year he received a special commendation for his efforts, because Melvin has only been in Australia for three years. English is not his first language, and before he arrived he did not know any English. So to come along one year after last year's competition and win is a significant achievement. We congratulate Melvin for his great essay and speech. We also congratulate Therese for her fantastic essay and speech.

       <p>
        The 2012 competition was launched in March this year at the Petrie schools summit and culminated in a gala speech night on 9 August. The entrants must write an essay and state what they would want to speak to the Prime Minister about, what issue is important to them and why, and what they think we need to do about it. Primary school students must write no more than 1,000 words and secondary students up to 1,500 words. They are judged not just on their essay but also on their public speaking skills, as they must stand up at a gala night and present their speech in front of an audience that includes many people they do not know. This year we had more than 60 people thereâ€”parents, teachers, principals and many of our local business leaders, some of whom were our judges this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to acknowledge our judges: Mr Bob Steele from the Brisbane North Chamber of Commerce, Ms Melanie Pope, and Mr Ken Leonard

I hope both students take away from today's visit an enthusiasm to participate in public debate and ensure that the youth of today have a strong voice.
