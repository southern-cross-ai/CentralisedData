        My question is to the Prime Minister. On Thursday, the

        </i>
        reported that the cabinet had decided it would not be spooked into releasing its tax plan before budget day. But today, the same paper reports the Prime Minister has decided to do the exact opposite by releasing his tax plans before budget day. Prime Minister, which is it? Is it the cabinet decision from last week or the Prime Minister's captain's call from the weekend?

         I thank the member for Sydney for her question. I note that she is a diligent reader of the

         The member for Sydney speaks a lot about equality. She speaks a lot about fairness, and fairness is an absolutely critical element in any tax policy. We are considering carefully every aspect of tax because we do not want to make the same type of ill-considered mistakes the Labor Party has made in opposition and, of course, previously made in government.

          whether it was the pink batts—I am reminded—the school halls or the ban on live cattle exports, which trashed that industry. Indeed, we could think about the

          Eleven weeks is all it took to come up with a catastrophic project, which it has been the job of our government to remedy, to fix and to move forward. The job of the coalition all too often is to clean up Labor's mess.

          The honourable member for Sydney knows full well that the tax policy that she supports is one that will undermine home values in her electorate and right around the country. It will undermine investment. It will discourage investment. It will discourage jobs. It stands in the way of economic growth. It stands in the way of our progress to the prosperity that awaits us if we are able to seize the opportunities of the 21st century—opportunities that Labor's policies would deny us.

           incessantly through that answer. I am not going to detain the House every time there is an interjection, but if this continues it will be followed by a warning and ejection, at the least.
