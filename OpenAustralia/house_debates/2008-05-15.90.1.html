       <p>
        I have an enormous respect for the contribution made by carers in my community. In my electorate of Bass we have a tremendous number of carers, each and every one of whom deserves our thanks and our deepest appreciation for the tireless work that they do. Chief among my priorities when I was elected was providing support and respite for people with disabilities and for those who care for them. During my campaign, I was fortunate enough to meet two people, Jo Ryan and her son Ben. Ben has fragile X syndrome. He is a vibrant, unique and utterly charming young man. His mum, Jo, is unstinting in her love, affection and care for him. I met Jo when she was concerned about the end of a pilot program run through
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Michaels" rel="nofollow">
         St Michaels
        </a>
        Association Inc. in Launceston. The previous government funded it in its pilot stage and then callously chose not to renew it, despite a clear need in northern Tasmania. This program provided weekend respite for Jo and an opportunity for Ben to learn life skills away from home. He learnt how to cook and he learnt how to cleanâ€”practical life skills which would help him to break away from the family home. The difference which this program makes to both Jo and Ben cannot be overstated. That is why, when Jo came to me, I promised her I would fight for funding to see that this program was continued.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week I was able to tell both Jo and Alex Huntir, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of St Michaels, that the Rudd Labor government is committing an extra $423,979 to the program to see it continued until at least June 2010. I understand, and clearly the Rudd Labor government understands, that without respite carers burn out. The demands placed on them at times are just unimaginable. That is why, in my capacity on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family, Community, Housing and Youth, I moved a motion in support of an inquiry into better support for carers. I am passionate in the belief that we as a community must do all that we can to support those who in turn support the most vulnerable in our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let me say also that I am proud to be part of a federal government which is committed to extending 555 funding agreements for respite and carer support services through until June 2011. Eight such services are in my electorate of Bass and I look forward to them sharing in almost $440 million. I look forward also to drafting the terms of reference for the parliamentary inquiry into better support for carers. I look forward to hearing from those on the front line what we as a Commonwealth government can do to assist them to make the lives of people like Jo and

        as positive as they can be.
