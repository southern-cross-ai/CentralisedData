        Trove is our nation's finest resource for national history, records and events, and as a result is envied around the world for its unparalleled access and unparalleled capabilities. Among journalists, historians, researchers and keen members of the public, Trove is considered much more than a national treasure that must be protectedâ€”it's a core element in their ability to do their jobs. I recently spoke with renowned local historian Jeff McGill about this matter, and he told me how Trove has greatly aided him in his historical research of the Macarthur region. His most recent book,
        <i>
         Rachel
        </i>
        , which is about his forebear Rachel Kennedy, was completed through extensive and much-appreciated research through Trove. I know too that the Campbelltown and Airds Historical Society also relies on Trove to assist them in compiling information about our region and is greatly appreciated by their members and the wider community.
       </p>

        On a personal note, I've found Trove to be incredibly useful, as has my wife, Sharon, who's a librarian. On a light-hearted note, I found through Trove that my grandfather was arrested for speeding in one of his tourist buses for the third time in one day in the 1920s! I believe Trove should be preserved at all costs, and that requires ongoing funding to ensure it remains free of charge and available to all Australians. I implore the Leader of the House and the minister for the arts to make sure the government funds Trove so that it remains available to everyone who needs it.
