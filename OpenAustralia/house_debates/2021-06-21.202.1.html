        I rise this afternoon to reflect on the surf lifesaving season this year in a year when our members extended their services and expertise to assist emergency services in flood response. In doing so, they have demonstrated their high level of professionalism and commitment to helping others in a time of need.

        But yesterday, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_West_Rocks" rel="nofollow">
         South West Rocks
        </a>
        Surf Life Saving Club, my club, held their club presentations and I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate a couple of people. The first is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stu_Cole" rel="nofollow">
         Stu Cole
        </a>
        , recipient of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volunteer_of_the_Year" rel="nofollow">
         Volunteer of the Year
        </a>
        award. Stu is the patrol captain and the club board and ski captain, and he completed over 80 patrol hours and also assisted in the water safety for the nippers. He also took part in a five-day search and rescue effort for a missing spear fisherman in South West Rocks.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to acknowledge Erin Cook, Club Person of the Year, who gained her
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRB" rel="nofollow">
         IRB
        </a>
        driver award and is the first female in many years to gain that award. She also regularly patrols and helps with water safety at carnivals and is an incredible asset and a very good role model to younger people.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I would like to thank Sawtell Surf Life Saving Club, who hosted the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        awards of excellence on Saturday night. Congratulations to all the recipients. It was a pleasure to be there and to share the evening with you, and I congratulate everyone.
