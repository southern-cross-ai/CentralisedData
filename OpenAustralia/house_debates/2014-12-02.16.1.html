        I rise today to speak of the passing of Wayne
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McIntosh" rel="nofollow">
         McIntosh
        </a>
        , who was a loyal supporter of the Hasluck division of the Liberal Party of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Wayne played a key role in my election to this place, and he will be greatly missed by his friends and colleagues.
       </p>
       <p>
        Wayne passed away after a brave battle with cancer on 26 November of this year. I extend sympathy and condolences to Linda, Christopher and Allysha and their extended family, on behalf of my wife, Anna, other division members and those who worked closely with Wayne on both of our successful campaigns. The funeral service for Wayne will take place tomorrow in Perth, and I am sorry that I cannot be there myself.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have always admired Wayne for his integrity and honesty. He was my confidant and a close friend, offering frank advice without fear.
       </p>
       <p>
        All who knew Wayne revered his courage and commitment. In the past two years as he underwent treatment for cancer, we never once heard him complain. Wayne remained focused on his family and friends. Wayne remained committed to a busy, social and active life through social, sporting, business and political activities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Wayne was a successful businessman and a pillar of our local community. His friends at

        Gyprock spoke of the industry respect that Wayne enjoyed, reflecting that Wayne was a great bloke and a pleasure to do business with.
       </p>
       <p>
        Wayne, you will be remembered for constantly going above and beyond the call of duty.

        and the Division of Hasluck have lost a staunch supporter and an effective campaigner. Your years of service in various roles at branch and division level have strengthened the fabric of our community, and will not be forgotten.
