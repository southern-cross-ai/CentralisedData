        Since my election in 2010, I have had the privilege to meet a variety of community groups and their members. There are hundreds of community groups throughout my electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McPherson" rel="nofollow">
         McPherson
        </a>
        , and each does a wonderful job in representing the community and fostering the community spirit that is alive and well on the southern
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        . It is what makes the southern Gold Coast such a wonderful place to live.
       </p>

        Arguably, one of the most prominent groups in any community is the local bowls club. Lawn bowls is, most certainly, a popular sport throughout Australia with over 830,000 bowlers in 2010 of all ages and from all backgrounds. In my electorate alone, we have five bowls clubs: the Coolangatta Bowls Club, Tugun Bowls Club,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burleigh_Heads" rel="nofollow">
         Burleigh Heads
        </a>
        Bowls Club, Mudgeeraba Bowls Club and Robina Bowls Club. Each of these clubs has a very special place in the local community. Today I would like to speak about two in particular—firstly, the Tugun Bowls Club and, secondly, then the Burleigh Heads Bowls Club.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Tugun Bowls Club was founded in 1967 and this year it celebrates its 55th anniversary. To date, the Tugun Bowls Club has over 1,100 playing and social members. I recently had the privilege of joining the club to celebrate the birthdays of a few very special members. Any member who reaches the age of 80 is given the title 'super veteran'. Those over the age of 90 become 'patriarchs' of the club. Last week, it was certainly my privilege to present Don Oake, Herbert 'Herbie' Wood and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Stewart" rel="nofollow">
         Brian Stewart
        </a>
        with their super veteran's badges to commemorate their 80th birthdays. I was also there to congratulate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vic_Groves" rel="nofollow">
         Vic Groves
        </a>
        on his 90th birthday and on becoming a club patriarch. Vic joins Ollie Hackel, Boyd Richards,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Harrison" rel="nofollow">
         Jack Harrison
        </a>
        and Les Commino as active patriarchs of the club. I would like to congratulate each of these people on reaching that fantastic milestone and I wish them many more happy years of bowling to come.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second club I wish to speak about today is the Burleigh Heads Bowls Club, which is located in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Street" rel="nofollow">
         James Street
        </a>
        in Burleigh Heads. Many on the southern Gold Coast—and many visitors to the Gold Coast—would be very familiar with the club, which has a prime position opposite the beautiful Burleigh Beach. This club recently celebrated its 75th anniversary. It was founded in 1937 and it is certainly an iconic landmark in the area. I wish the club, and all of its members, all the very best. I look forward to being there to celebrate their 100th anniversary. Both of the clubs certainly have the support of the community, they regularly contribute, and I commend them for their work.
