        Men's Sheds are terrific. Today I want to congratulate Salamander Men's Shed, the 2322 Men's Shed at Beresfield and the Raymond Terrace Men's Shed for receiving funding under the National Shed Development Program.
       </p>
       <p>
        Salamander shed has a great spot at the Recycling Centre, so members can salvage items and materials that have been thrown out and bring them back to life, and then sell themâ€”it is the ultimate in upcycling. In the community, they have built computer desks for the

        centre at Tomaree high, and an outside kitchen for Bobs Farm school.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2322 Men's Shed at Beresfield is in the old Beresfield tennis clubhouse, but I know they would dearly love their own shed. Shed members fashion wood-turned toys for sale, mentor boys from

        high, and help locals with odd jobs such as building ramps into their homes for walkers and wheelchairs. They have built a chicken coop for Woodberry primary, a display stand for Beresfield primary and cupboards for the bowlers at Beresfield Bowling Club.
       </p>
       <p>
        At Raymond Terrace Men's Shed, they do fantastic work. They are celebrating the opening of their flash, new, purpose-built Men's Shed in Boomerang Park shortly. I am looking forward to it. As well as a big workshop, it is also going to have a computer room to help members learn new technology, a function room for hire and a kitchen and amenities. The shed is also working on a kitchen garden. And I want to personally thank them for fixing the flag stand at my electorate office. Good on you, fellas!
