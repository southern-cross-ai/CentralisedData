       <p>
        In August this year children from across the country gathered in Canberra, at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        , for a diabetes event called Kids in the House. This speech was intended to be given that day. However, for the first time ever parliament was actually shut down, during Liberal coup 2, and I was prevented from making this speech. As co-chair, with the member for Grey, of the Parliamentary Friends of Diabetes, I've been fortunate to gain a much greater insight into the work of organisations like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JDRF" rel="nofollow">
         JDRF
        </a>
        that support diabetes families. JDRF is Australia's leading organisation funding type 1 diabetes research. I'd like to particularly thank them for bringing over 100 passionate type 1 diabetes advocates to Parliament House. These passionate advocates came from electorates all over Australia. They were united in their determination to rid the world of type 1 diabetes and resolute in their belief that research holds the key.
       </p>
       <p>
        Around 2,400 people are diagnosed with type 1 diabetes every year. The peak age range for diagnosis is between 10 and 14. For the children who receive a positive diagnosis, their lives will be centred around multiple daily insulin injections or a continuous infusion from an insulin pump every day. There is currently no cure for type 1 diabetes. I commend JDRF and the children and families who are committed to finding a cure to improve the lives of those with type 1 diabetes, especially the students from Graceville. While those students had an exciting day watching a coup unfold live—and they even managed to get into a press conference—it would have been nice for parliament to sit and for them to hear this speech on that day.

         My speech follows on from the contribution from the member for Moreton. I was reflecting on that visit by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JDRF" rel="nofollow">
          JDRF
         </a>
         . On that day, I met with Maggie, a young girl from Enoggera in Brisbane who has type 1 diabetes. It was wonderful to meet with her and her mother, Leah, and her brother, Max, to discuss the work of JDRF and to hear more about how type 1 diabetes impacts so many aspects of Maggie's everyday life. She drew me a beautiful picture with coloured pencils, which is still displayed in my office today. I was looking at it just last week, thinking about Maggie and reflecting on the recent announcement that our government is expanding funding for free glucose-monitoring devices. The additional $100 million in funding from the government will help more kids like Maggie, as well as pregnant women and more adults with type 1 diabetes. Given people with type 1 diabetes have to be able to monitor their glucose levels day and night, this new funding reduces their stress, it improves the quality of life for both them and their families and, of course, it reduces emergency visits to hospital. In concluding, I want to make the very strong point that investments in new medicines and new devices are only able to be afforded if there is strong economic management of the budget, which is why it's so vital that this government's strong economic management continues.
