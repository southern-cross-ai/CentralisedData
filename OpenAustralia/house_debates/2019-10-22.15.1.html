        I rise to speak about Antonino (Tony) Randazzo,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        , who sadly passed away in Darwin last week. Tony was an extremely well regarded and respected member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        community, and a valued and loved member of the Italian community in Darwin and of the Catholic church. Tony arrived in Perth from Italy at the beginning of the 1950s. He picked tomatoes and worked in sawmills in WA and sent some dollars back to his family in Italy, who were struggling after the war. But he then headed for opportunity in Darwin in 1953 and, arriving alone with little English, rolled up his sleeves and got to work in the Territory construction industry and had been hard at it ever since. A beloved husband of Giovanna, father of Carlo and Paolo, father-in-law of Kirstin and Maria, grandfather to Connor, Allegra, Imogen, Jacob and Chiara, he was a Territory pioneer who made his mark on Darwin. Tony's son Carlo said about him, 'He had a wonderful sense of humour and was always looking to poke fun at life.' Paolo said he was always looking after the ones he loved. Tony: thank you for everything that you've done for the Territory and for helping to develop Australia's northern capital. Rest in peace.
