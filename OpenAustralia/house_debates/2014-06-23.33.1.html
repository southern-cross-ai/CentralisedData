       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Clean Energy (Income Tax Rates and Other Amendments) Bill 2013 is part of a package of bills to remove the carbon tax.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill amends elements of the
        <i>
         Clean Energy (Income Tax Rates Amendments) Act 2011
        </i>
        to repeal the second round of personal income tax cuts due to start on 1 July 2015.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government understands households will continue to face cost-of-living pressures.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is why the government is keeping the current carbon tax related personal income tax thresholds and the fortnightly pension and benefit increases.
       </p>
       <p>
        In its final budget handed down on 14 May 2013, the former government deferred a second round of personal income tax cuts and booked a $1.5 billion saving over the forward estimates.
       </p>
       <p>
        But the former government never followed through by legislating this change.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill repeals legislated amendments to the
        <i>
         Income Tax Rates Act 1986
        </i>
        so that the statutory personal income tax rates and thresholds do not change on 1 July 2015.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill also amends the Clean Energy (Tax Laws Amendments) Act 2011 to repeal related amendments to the low-income tax offset.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill also repeals legislated amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 so that the related amendments to the low-income tax offset do not take effect on 1 July 2015.
       </p>
       <p>
        Overall, the repeal of these amendments means that the tax-free threshold will remain at $18,200.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second personal marginal tax rate will remain at 32.5 per cent. And the maximum value of the low-income tax offset will remain at $445.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill legislates the $1.5 billion saving that the former government announced during the 2013-14 budget but never legislated.
       </p>
       <p>
        A first round of tax cuts to compensate for the introduction of the carbon tax has already been delivered. We will deliver further savings to Australian households of $550 next financial year on average with the removal of the carbon tax. In short this is our saving for the Australian people. I commend the bill to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
