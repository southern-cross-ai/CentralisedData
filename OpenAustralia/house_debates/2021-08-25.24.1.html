        by leave—I move my amendments (1) to (6) together:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (line 6), omit "1,500", substitute "1,000".
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) Schedule 1, item 2, page 3 (line 10), omit "1,500", substitute "1,000".
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) Schedule 1, item 2, page 3 (line 12), omit "1,500", substitute "1,000".
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) Schedule 1, item 3, page 3 (line 24), omit "1,500", substitute "1,000".
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) Schedule 1, item 18, page 7 (line 9), omit "1,500", substitute "1,000".
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (6) Schedule 1, item 19, page 7 (line 12), omit "1,500", substitute "1,000".
       </p>
       <p>
        What the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Party Registration Integrity) Bill seeks to do is to move the threshold slightly back, to move the dial back, to give more Australians the opportunity to participate in our democracy. This bill lifts the threshold for party registration from 500 members to 1,500. That risks concentrating the power in the hands of the Liberal Party and the Labor Party. That is contrary to a good democracy. I've experienced it myself here. Since coming to the crossbench, I've had the opportunity to discuss issues with the members for Indi and Warringah, with whom I have many differing views. I believe that being able to sit down and discuss things strengthens our democracy. We should not be doing anything in this parliament that limits alternative views or limits what may be minority views; therefore, the amendments that I propose are to move that dial from 1,500 to only 1,000. I believe that if a group of a thousand Australian citizens are prepared to form a political party they should be allowed to do so and they should be allowed to stand at an election under that party. This is what these amendments will do, and I hope they have the support of other members of the House.

         I'd like to put on the
         <i>
          Hansard
         </i>
         my agreement with the member for Hughes. There are many, many things that we disagree on, but on this occasion I agree with him. The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters recommended that the party membership threshold should be raised to 1,000, not to 1,500. I'm a great champion of participating in our democracy, and I agree with the member for Hughes: we need greater diversity in our parliament, not less. I've been a vocal spokeswoman for gender equality in this parliament and for greater diversity—for people of colour and people from different backgrounds—and I think that these amendments from the member for Hughes are, indeed, reasonable and moderate and in line with the committee's findings. I'm pleased to support these amendments. I think they are sensible and good. As I said, democracy is what we're trying to improve. There is nothing as important to this parliament as a solid and diverse representation in the House, and I support these amendments.

          The question is that the amendments be disagreed to.

           A division having been called and the bells having been rung—

          As there are fewer than five members on the side for the noes, I declare the question resolved in the affirmative in accordance with
