        Today I rise to pay tribute to community sector workers in my electorate who are working with individuals who have a disability. I attended two community events recently that really brought home to me the valuable work that this sector is doing. On 2 August I attended a DisabiliTEA event in Holt hosted by the Sharing Places organisation. I acknowledge the participants in the program: Carl Blakers, Veronica Sadkowski, Mirella Sadkowski,

        The next day, on 3 August—by coincidence my birthday—I attended the opening ceremony of Ross Walker Lodge in the St Margaret's Church Hall. The Ross Walker Lodge will support six people in the

        Ross Walker, after whom the lodge is named, was born at about the same time as my paternal grandfather, Keith Leigh. They both entered the Methodist ministry in the post-war era and both were committed to a service in the community that involved focusing on the most disadvantaged, bringing the gospel but also bringing social change to the community. The Ross Walker Lodge fits proudly in that tradition, which is of great pride to many of us on this side of the House. The Ross Walker Lodge will be an important part of the work in the community that the

        does, and I am sure that many volunteers will continue to assist with that. I pay tribute to all of those involved in these two important disability events.
