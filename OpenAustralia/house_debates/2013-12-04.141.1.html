        How many of the 150 members in this place can boast that they have a location in their electorate that has actually made the list of 1,001 places to visit before you die? It is actually on the bucket list. We have the extraordinarily exquisite location known as Secrets on the Lake. It is the most magical, enchanting place that has been carved out by a loving family. They have created a special, serene place. I encourage everyone to look at their website and take the time to visit the village of Montville in the wonderful

        It is one of the many attributes that the Sunshine Coast has that attracts day trippers and people from Sydney, Melbourne and even overseas. You can go to Maleny and Montville and look at the historical

You can walk through riparian rainforests, take delightful walks or sit at some of the best small wineries and eateries in the country. There are art galleries aplenty. There is also the Landsborough Historical Society—and that is before we hit the beaches. Alexandra Headland, Mooloolaba,

When you come to the Sunshine Coast you can enjoy the hinterland, enjoy the pristine air and enjoy the friendliness of our society. When you are there you know you can be safe.

        I want to finish by recounting a quick story. I was at the beach at Alexandra Headland the other day and I saw a scene unfold that most did not see. There was a man in trouble in the water. The volunteer surf-lifesavers went out and rescued the man. I saw him get his towel and wander back to his wife somewhat exhausted and somewhat relieved but knowing that this was going to be a memorable holiday for all the right reasons, because of the special people of the surf-lifesaving club. Members of parliament, there is no better place for your relaxation time as you lead in to Christmas. Come and join us on the Sunshine Coast.
