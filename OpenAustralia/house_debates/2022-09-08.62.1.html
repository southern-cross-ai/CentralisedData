       <p>
        I'd like to take this opportunity to commemorate the life of Mr Jed William Danahay from the town of Nanango in my electorate of Maranoa. Nanango is a small town of over 3,000 people, a place where just about everyone knows everyone. Jed Danahay was known as being a kind-hearted man who was always giving to others. He would try to spend six months of the year overseas volunteering, and, when he was home, he volunteered locally, serving the south Burnett branch of the

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Tragically, this year Jed was providing medical assistance to Ukrainian forces while on the front line in eastern Ukraine. Jed was a medic, and he was saving lives in the town of Izyum, on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donets_River" rel="nofollow">

        , which has been under Russian military occupation since 3 May. Earlier this week,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        advised that Jed had lost his life while driving a medical vehicle on 24 August.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jed gave his life providing care to his fellow man, and this serves as an inspiration to us all. I'd like to acknowledge the comments made by the Ukrainian ambassador to Australia, to whom I spoke yesterday. He's called Mr Danahay a hero for his service to the people of Ukraine.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I wish to express my sympathy to Jed's loved ones. Mr Danahay's family have said:
