        have lost a remarkable community leader with the passing of Jagamara Nelson, who died at Yuendumu last Sunday afternoon surrounded by his family. He was a very close friend of mine for over 35 years. He was a consistent source of advice and support to me over that time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Born in 1940 at Mount Doreen cattle station, he moved with his parents to Yuendumu around 1946. In 1959 Jagamara finished his primary education at Yuendumu, did an apprenticeship as a mechanic and later became a teacher, starting at Darwin and working at Yuendumu, before becoming a worker with the outstation movement as an assistant community adviser. He played footy and was a mainstay of Yuendumu Sports Weekend. However, it is for his skills as a Warlpiri interpreter from his earliest days with the land rights movement that he is most well known.
       </p>
       <p>
        He was a true leader of enormous stature, great intellect and knowledge; a strong voice; and an absolute believer and advocate for truth telling and the recognition of Aboriginal rights, and land rights in particular. He was a fighter to the end. I met him just before Christmas, and he said he hoped that those following in his footsteps would continue to protect knowledge, country and culture. He'll be sadly missed. He was a leader of outstanding significance to the whole of the Northern Territory community.
