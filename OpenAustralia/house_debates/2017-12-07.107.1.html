        : Will the minister update the House on the government's success in moving people from welfare to work, especially in my home state of

        <p>
         I thank the member for his question. As the Treasurer noted this week, Australia now has the lowest proportion of working-age people dependent on welfare of any time in the last 25 years. Over the six years of the previous Labor government, they increased by 250,000 the number of people under 65 who are dependent on income support. Since we were first elected, our government has decreased by 140,000 the number of people of working age who are dependent on welfare.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm asked about alternatives. Bennelong provides a marvellous example of alternatives. Under the Rudd-Gillard Labor governments the number of people in Bennelong on the major unemployment benefits increased by 21 per cent. That is, under members opposite, an extra 1,189 people went on to unemployment benefits. Under Labor, the number of people in Bennelong on Newstart or youth allowance nearly doubled—a 98 per cent increase. Under the coalition, the number of people in Bennelong on the main, working-age welfare payments, has decreased by 12 per cent. That is, hundreds of Australians in Bennelong are now no longer dependent on welfare. There has been an 11 per cent decrease in Newstart and youth allowance and a 27 per cent decrease in the number of parents on parenting payment.
        </p>
        <p>
         And how have we achieved these astonishing results across Australia and in Bennelong? We cannot find a better endorsement of how we have done it, how to create more opportunities for more Australians, than how the Leader of the Opposition described it. He said: 'Reducing the corporate tax rate is an investment in the Australian people, including people who might be on welfare. We need to create employment, not greater welfare dependency.' Well done, Leader of the Opposition! While it's hard to find a better description of the marvellous success of the coalition in Australia and Bennelong, it's not impossible. We found this gem from the member for Jagajaga: 'The best way to keep people out of poverty is to keep them in jobs. Joblessness is the fastest way into poverty, and getting a decent job is the fastest way out of poverty.' And do you know who has proved that to be true? This government has proved that to be true. I will finish with the member for Jagajaga again. She said, 'Hopefully, future Labor governments will need to better target spending, to eliminate waste, to fund necessary social investment.' Well, don't bother, member for Jagajaga—we have already done it!
