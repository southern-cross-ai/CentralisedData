        It is our great privilege in this place to represent a broad cross-section of people in our community. The voice of youth is often not heard as clearly as it should be. I invited student leaders from local schools to a youth forum hosted by St Columba Anglican School in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Macquarie" rel="nofollow">
         Port Macquarie
        </a>
        on Wednesday, 11 April. At the outset, I want to place on the record my thanks to St Columba Anglican School for agreeing to host the forum. In particular, I'd like to thank Principal Terry Muldoon, Peta Watters and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Cooper" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        for all of the hard work they put in, preparing the venue, organising catering and ensuring the forum ran smoothly.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to thank those student leaders who took time out from their study to attend the forum to discuss issues that are important to them and their peers. These students were: from St Columba Anglican School,

         St Paul's College
        </a>
        , Harley Thackray, Eloise MacDonald and Mariah Allen. The students were all very enthusiastic and weren't shy in raising what's important to them as young people, and I want to share with the House what these student leaders think are the most significant issues facing their peers.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is unsurprising that issues relating to education are at the top of their list. Students raised the pressure they felt to perform in standardised testing, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAPLAN" rel="nofollow">
         NAPLAN
        </a>
        and their final
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSC" rel="nofollow">
         HSC
        </a>
        exams. They also raised the pressure they felt from peers and parents to attend university rather than pursue a trade career. There was a keen appreciation of the importance of vocational education and the value of the vocational education pathway. Whilst acknowledging the presence of universities on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_North_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Mid North Coast
        </a>
        , the students raised the fact that many North Coast students had to study away due to the limitations of course offerings available. The students also raised the high cost of obtaining a tertiary education when moving to a metropolitan uni was required. The forum also expressed its support for a gap year before starting university, and the value of getting relevant work experience during that time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The students were incredibly passionate about the environment. Wilisoni and Emma from Melville High School raised their desire to build up a comprehensive recycling program at their school, citing the large volume of paper used as part of their education. The challenges of recycling have certainly been in the news since the forum was held.
       </p>
       <p>
        Students also raised Australia's energy mix, the debate about coal-fired power versus renewables, and the importance of compliance with the Paris Agreement. The students were concerned about the sustainability of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef" rel="nofollow">
         Great Barrier Reef
        </a>
        . I would note the coalition government's recently announced $500 million package to protect the reef and secure its viability and the 64,000 jobs that rely on the reef.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those present also discussed Australia's geopolitical environment, raising concerns about the need to balance tensions in our region while maintaining our trade relationships with the United States and China. There was also concern in the room about the requirement in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        for 120 driver experience hours, and the burden that placed on young drivers and their families. There was concern also about the need for more financial support with regard to challenges faced by regional athletes in order to compete at elite competitions.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to commend the student leaders for what was an informed and free-flowing discussion. The issues important to young people are very diverse, and it has been my honour to raise them in the House this evening.
