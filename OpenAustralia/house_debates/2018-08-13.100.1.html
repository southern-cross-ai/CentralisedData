        My question is to the environment minister. In his previous answer, the minister claimed there was extensive due diligence and that that examined the fundraising history of the foundation. On 6 August, the environment minister said the foundation had raised $80 million. On 10 August, he said it had raised $60 million, and, a few moments later in the same interview, the figure had gone to $65 million. When the minister can't even give a straight answer on how much they've raised yet says this was part of the due diligence, how can the government claim there was any due diligence on a foundation they didn't even contact?

         That from a member who gave them $12.5 million himself! And in a press release from the member for Watson in 2012, this is what he said about the foundation: 'It protects and preserves the reef. It will ensure that the reef's unique values are protected.' They were the words from the member for Watson. And when we announced our half a billion dollars for the reef, what do you think the member for Sydney said? She's always good for a quote. She said she welcomed the additional funding. When it comes to the amount of money that the foundation has raised, we do know that it is Australia's largest reef charity, and we do know that Anna Marsden said to
         <i>
          7.30
         </i>
         in her interview:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I can absolutely confirm that we have raised over $90 million. These are audited figures.
        </p>
        <p>
         Her website says:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We are the lead fundraisers for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GBR" rel="nofollow">

         &amp; over 18 years have raised over $90mâ€¦
        </p>
        <p>
         When it comes to the breakdown of their funding, we know that about two-thirds has come from private and philanthropic sources. We also know that the state government of Queensland has contributed quite significantly. So the fact is the foundation has raised tens of millions of dollars from the private sector and from the philanthropic sector and has had money from both the federal government when Labor was in power, from the federal government when we're in power and from the state Labor government.

          I ask the minister to table the Google search that constituted due diligence that he was just referring to.
