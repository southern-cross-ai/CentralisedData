       <p>
        Regional Australians are good, honest, hardworking people. They do their best to grow the food to ensure the nation and our near neighbours get fed. They pay their taxes and expect a fair share for country health, rural roads and infrastructure. They are worried about the economy. They are concerned about the high Australian dollar hurting our export markets and are fearful of a carbon tax which will do nothing for the environment but which will hit their hip pockets hard.

        Deliberate leaks from the Murray-Darling Basin Authority two months out from the delayed release of its draft contained more drastic cuts to water entitlements, especially in the Murrumbidgee Valley. The government will use the excuse that the MDBA is an independent body. Drip-feeding any figures is like a soft crash landing. They are easing the numbers into the public, seeing the reaction and going from there. It is unfair. It is unacceptable. It will not be tolerated.

        What we need now is transparency. The whole water issue has been mishandled by the federal Labor government. It is a bad process from a bad government and it is getting worse by the day. A triple bottom line is needed, as is some decency, honesty and openness with any figures.

        member for New England has brought down an inquiry report. It has not been followed by the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. It needs to be, particularly recommendation (7), which says that there should be a cessation of non-strategic water buybacks. The Independent member for New England keeps this flimsy government in office. They need to follow his lead, follow the water inquiry and have some decency about the water debate.
