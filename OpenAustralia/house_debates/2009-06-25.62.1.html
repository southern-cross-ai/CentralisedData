        I refer the Treasurer to an interview on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_National" rel="nofollow">
         Radio National
        </a>
        this morning with Longreach car dealer Jane Colvin. Jane Colvin says that when she contacted her local MP, the member for Flynn, to inquire about
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OzCar" rel="nofollow">
         OzCar
        </a>
        financing she was initially just sent a press release. Jane Colvin says she then tried to get more information but:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        â€¦ we never received anything back from the politicians after that basically. We contacted others as well as our local member but we really did not get any information.
       </p>
       <p>
        Does the Treasurer stand by his claim that all car dealers have been treated the same or does he only look after friends of the Prime Minister?

         First of all, that car dealer never contacted my office. That car dealer did contact the member for Flynn, who did assist that car dealer. As I said to the member the other day, if he has any further information, I am more than happy to follow it up with the Treasury. I have no evidence that that car dealer did speak to Treasury but if that exists, I will be happy to follow it up. These matters are being dealt with by the Treasury secretary. You would appreciate that in these circumstances it is somewhat more difficult at the moment, given the circumstances of one of the officers in the department.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is also the case that many car dealers may not have been eligible for assistance. It depends on the circumstances. If the member is serious, I am happy to look at all of those details, and I will follow them up, as I have done whenever I have been approached by anybody.
