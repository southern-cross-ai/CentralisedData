        My question is to the Minister for Jobs and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Relations" rel="nofollow">
         Industrial Relations
        </a>
        and Minister for Women. Will the minister update the House on how the government's plan to keep our economy strong is guaranteeing the financial security of Australian women and their families without having to increase taxes? What would be the consequences for women's financial security were an alternate course of action followed?

         I thank the very hardworking member for Boothby for her question. She, like so many on this side of the House, understands how crucial it is for women to be able to build their financial security to ensure they fulfil their full potential. We know that when Australian women do well their families do well and our economy and our nation prospers. We know that financial security allows women choices and opportunities to live the life they want. They should not be forced to settle for anything less.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government has already delivered a strong and growing economy that has seen more women in work than ever before. In fact, of the almost 1. 2 million new jobs created in this country, the majority have been taken up by women. There are more women participating in the workforce than ever before. We have a record level of workforce participation. Under our economic stewardship, we have seen the gender pay gap come down, having been so high under those opposite.

            But we're not standing still. Despite the talk from all of those opposite, we are the only party, the only government, to have actually delivered the first dedicated economic security statement for Australian women. As usual, it has taken a coalition government to talk about the practical policies that Australian women demand and expect, like the Career Revive initiative that will help regional businesses to remedy barriers to women accessing and returning to work, and to support those who are returning to work, and the Curious Minds program that will encourage young girls in the

            field so that they have the skills and education for the jobs of the future.
           </p>
           <p>
            But what have we heard from those opposite? Last night we heard the Leader of the Opposition announce a plan to have a plan about a plan. The very fact is that those opposite are very, very good at virtue signalling, but they have not got a clue when it comes to delivery. In fact, the only thing those opposite will be able to deliver, and that they promise to deliver, is higher taxes—$200 billion worth of higher taxes. Let us not forget the mega retiree tax, a tax that will hurt 30 per cent more women—vulnerable women, older women. It is shameful that they would do such a thing. The coalition can be relied upon to deliver the economic security that Australian women demand and expect, not like those opposite.
