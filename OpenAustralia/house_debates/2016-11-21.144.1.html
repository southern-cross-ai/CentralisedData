        Today I rise to talk about a federal government election commitment that has recently been approved for a great local Dunkley organisation, the Peninsula Home Hospice.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week I was thrilled to announce that the Minister for Regional Development, Senator the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiona_Nash" rel="nofollow">
         Fiona Nash
        </a>
        , approved funding of $535,790 for Peninsula Home Hospice under the Community Development Grants Program. This funding approval delivers on an election commitment I made to the people of Dunkley.
       </p>
       <p>
        This much needed funding will cover a large portion of the cost of the new fit out of Peninsula Home Hospice's building in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Street" rel="nofollow">

        , Mornington, which has now been completed. I was pleased to have made this announcement at Peninsula Home Hospice's annual general meeting last week, alongside

        Rachael Bovenizer, Helen Fairlie, the chair of the board, and Tom Pickford, the treasurer. During the meeting, I was able to see firsthand the new refurbishment that has been built with these fundsâ€”and the building looks great! This funding will have terrific flow-on effects for the entire communities of the

        , up to Mordialloc Creek.
       </p>
       <p>
        Established on the Mornington Peninsula in 1984, Peninsula Home Hospice is an accredited, not-for-profit, community palliative care organisation providing home-based specialist health care and support to people living at home with a terminal illness. Its services are also extended to the families and friends of its clients, as it recognises that family and friends too need support during these times.
       </p>
       <p>
        Specialist palliative care aims to relieve symptoms, improve quality of life and support families through the illness and into bereavement. The hospice assists people with illness to maintain their independence and to live life as fully as they can. There are a variety of services that the hospice provides, including nursing, medical consultancy, counselling, art therapy, music therapy, spiritual support, client-care volunteer support and bereavement services.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am very proud to have been able to advocate on behalf of Peninsula Home Hospice and to secure this much-needed funding as one of my election commitments to Dunkley. I was very pleased to have prioritised this as one of my election commitments to be rolled out as soon as possible, given the enormous need within our electorate. This is terrific news for this not-for-profit organisation, which provides this much-needed home-based palliative-care support in our community. I congratulate Peninsula Home Hospice for its efforts and advocacy for this funding, and I look forward to working with Peninsula Home Hospice as well as the community as we continue to help those in need in palliative care and through the bereavement phase.
