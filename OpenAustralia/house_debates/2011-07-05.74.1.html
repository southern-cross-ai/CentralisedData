        by leave—I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the first item of business after 3 minute constituency statements in the Main Committee on Wednesday, 17 August 2011, being constituency statements of up to 5 minutes by Members to report on their consultations pursuant to the resolution passed by the House on 18 November 2010, which called on Members to gauge their constituents' views on ways to achieve equal treatment for same sex couples including marriage, followed by government business and/or committee and delegation business.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have consulted with the opposition on this motion. This arises from the motion moved by the member for Melbourne and carried by the House with regard to consultation with constituents regarding equal treatment for same-sex couples. This will allow a process whereby members, if they choose, will be able to report on their consultations to the Main Committee, which is appropriate given the resolution carried by the House of Representatives. That is certainly my under­standing from the respective whips. Crossbenchers may also choose to take the opportunity to present the views from their consultations, whatever they may be, to the Main Committee. It is appropriate that it be done in a consolidated fashion. This arises after correspondence which was sent to me by the member for Melbourne and after a discussion we had about the appropriate procedure. I commend the resolution to the House and I thank the opposition for their cooperation and support for this process.
