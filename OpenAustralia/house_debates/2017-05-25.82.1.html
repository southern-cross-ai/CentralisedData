          Counting to two can be difficult sometimes! My question is to the Minister for Urban Infrastructure. Will the minister update the House on the government's investment in rail, including the $10 billion National Rail Program announced in the budget? How will this transformational investment improve liveability and productivity in our cities and regions? I am sure that the member for Grayndler would love to hear the answer.

          <p>
           I do thank the member for Swan for this question. He is a very strong advocate for his electorate and a very strong advocate for rail and public transport. I have enjoyed visiting with him the Perth to Forrestfield Airport project, which of course benefits from $490 million of Turnbull government funding. And of course we have seen very significant funding for rail projects in the 2017 budget.
          </p>
          <p>
           There was $792 million for additional projects in Perth, including the Thornlie to Cockburn Line and the extension to Yanchep. There was $500 million committed for Victorian regional rail and of course there was $30 million committed for a business case for a rail line from Melbourne city to Tullamarine airport. There is rail from the city to the airport in Sydney, there is rail from the airport to the city in Brisbane and there is rail from the airport to the city under construction in Perth; it is time we had rail from the airport to the city in Melbourne, and the Turnbull government is taking the lead.
          </p>
          <p>
           This government has a clear and structured approach to rail. We have committed $10 billion to the National Rail Program, and this will support major rail projects around the country. We have a structured program, with urban rail plans being developed, working with the state governments so that we have a systematic approach to delivering rail and to supporting city-shaping rail projects.
          </p>
          <p>
           Of course, by contrast we have the approach from Labor. We saw the shadow minister in April, announcing yet again and reprising the failed announcement of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
            New South Wales
           </a>
           election campaign in 2015, when he said, mysteriously, that $400 million was apparently going to be sufficient for a rail line to Western Sydney Airport. What did the New South Wales transport minister say about that in 2015? She made the point that it was more likely to be $4 billion if you looked at an extrapolation from the most recently completed South West Rail Link.
          </p>
          <p>
           It is a reminder of Labor's rank incompetence when it comes to delivering rail in New South Wales. Let's just remember the record. With the Parramatta to Chatswood Rail Link they promised, they delivered half of it. The
