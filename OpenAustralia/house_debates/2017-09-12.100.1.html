        Following the League Tag grand final was the gripping game between Orange CYMS and Bathurst St Pats in the under-18s division. At half time it was 12-all, and, with just 15 minutes to go, Bathurst were leading 18-12. But in the last quarter of the game, CYMS scored four tries to secure their first grand final win in 10 years. I would like to recognise the team, including Captain Craig Tarr and players Nathan Swain; Lincoln Monk; Ethan Kennedy; Lindsay Thurgate; Mitch Collins; Josh Board; Hudson Spicer;

        The day ended with a nailbiting performance from Orange CYMS and the Oberon Tigers in the premier league division. The Oberon Tigers hadn't won a grand final since '75 and were very determined to break the 42-year drought. They led from the very first two minutes of the game. At half time it was 18-8, and, with just 20 minutes left on the clock, the score was set at 22-8 to Oberon. The crowd was convinced Oberon would secure the 2017 title, but four quick tries by CYMS put the score at 22-all, and, with just three minutes to go, CYMS Captain Mick Sullivan lined up and kicked the winning field goal from 20 metres out. This led Orange CYMS to claim their fifth premiership title in eight years. Our commiserations to the Tigers. They will be back. But it was a terrific comeback.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to mention the Orange CYMS players, including five-time premiership-winning Captain Michael Sullivan; Ben McAlpine; Tom Satterthwaite, who was awarded Man of the Match; Joe Lasagavibau, who goes by the nickname 'Joe Lamborghini' because of his blinding speed; Lachlan Munroe; Semisi Katoa; Luke Petrie; Cameron Jones; Ryan Griffin; Chris Bamford, who was named the Group 10 Player of the Year for the premier division;
