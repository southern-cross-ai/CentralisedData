        Today is a very proud day for members of the

        . 'Turning the city blue' is indeed a fitting tribute to the police officers, including my late father, who have been part of a police force serving the community since 1862. On many occasions I have spoken in this place about the pivotal role that the police play in our communities and to recognise the difficult and often dangerous jobs that they perform on our behalf.
       </p>
       <p>
        On many occasions in this House I have referred to the fact that I am a son of a police officer, and also with my close association with the police and police associations, I have come to understand that it takes a special kind of person with a special kind of courage and commitment to wear the police uniform, and that we are truly indebted to the men and women who choose to do so. We must also recognise that over this period 250 police officers have lost their lives while serving the community of New South Wales. Policing certainly comes with a degree of risk that, thankfully, many of us will never have to face. It is therefore appropriate to acknowledge their contributions during today's anniversary. I congratulate the

        , and the men and women of the New South Wales Police Force on this fine achievement. On behalf of a grateful community, I thank them for their commitment and dedication. We remain always in their debt.
