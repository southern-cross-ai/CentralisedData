        My question is to the Minister for Urban Infrastructure and Cities. Will the minister update the House on how the government is delivering on its record $75 billion investment in transport infrastructure? How will this infrastructure pipeline support economic growth, including in my electorate of Brisbane? Is the minister aware of any dangers to this growth or the creation of jobs?

         I thank the member for Brisbane, who is delivering for his constituents. He has been instrumental in the Turnbull government making a commitment to invest $300 million in the Brisbane Metro, along with a commitment of over $600 million from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Brisbane City Council

          LNP

         , with a very capable track record of delivery. What the member for Brisbane is going to deliver to his constituents is a high frequency metro network, some 21 kilometres of existing busway, links between

        <p>
         I'm asked by the member for Brisbane, presciently, if there are any dangers to the implementation of the government's $75 billion infrastructure program. The principal danger I need to inform the member for Brisbane of would be if this hopeless rabble on the other side of the House were ever to form government! We need to be clear. Their record of rank incompetence is by no means limited to transport and infrastructure. You can look at the

             Thank you, Mr Speaker. I was going through a brief list of some of Labor's most comprehensive and egregious implementation stuff-ups. There was the chaos of the pink batts and, my personal favourite, the member for Adelaide's contribution with the double drop off. Who remembers the double drop off? A 2007 promise, they were going to build 260 early childcare centres in schools all around the country. How many had they delivered when they finally slunk away from that program in 2010? The historical record shows that it was 38. So Labor cannot deliver; their implementation is hopeless. What about the 12 rail lines that state Labor promised in
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
              New South Wales
             </a>
             ? They delivered not one of them. What about the Gawler line electrification? That was a comprehensive stuff-up by the Weatherill Labor government that has taken the coalition to fix. We're committing funding for the Gawler line electrification. Labor's track record of implementation in transport and in every other portfolio is egregious and hopeless, and that is a huge danger to the Australian people.
