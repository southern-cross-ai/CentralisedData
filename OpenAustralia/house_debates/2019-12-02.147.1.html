        Every time that I meet with these outstanding junior sports men and women, I am amazed at the level of dedication and the number of hours that they put into their chosen sport as well as the sacrifices that their families make to take their child to sporting events across the state, across the country and, in one instance this time, on the other side of the world. I would like to take some time to congratulate each of the students who received a grant and recognise the many hours they have put in to compete at the level they do today.
