       <p>
        Before we move to the MPI, I've got a short statement to make. As members would be aware, there was some very serious and concerning behaviour in the public galleries during question time yesterday. Groups of visitors disrupted proceedings early in question time, which concerned me enough to issue a warning at the time. Just before three o'clock, those same visitors again disrupted proceedings as they left the galleries, shouting, jeering and gesturing to members. They continued disruptive behaviour as they moved through the public areas of this building. As presiding officer of the Australian parliament, I take my role very seriously, ensuring parliament is a safe and respectful working environment for parliamentary staff and an open and welcoming place for members of the public to visit.
       </p>
       <p>
        The behaviour in the public galleries yesterday presented significant risk to the working environment for parliamentary staff, other visitors in the galleries and members of this House. It is unacceptable for people to enter the public galleries in an attempt to protest or express their views or disrupt proceedings. Members have been elected to this place by their own communities, and those communities should have a fair expectation that their representatives can carry out their work unimpeded. The behaviour we saw in the public galleries yesterday was unacceptable.
       </p>
       <p>
        Creating a safe and respectful environment is everyone's responsibility, and it's up to each and every one of us in this House to uphold the high standards expected of this parliament, which is the heart of our democracy. I want to remind members that the guest seating in the galleries is a privilege. If you invite a guest to the gallery, I consider their conduct to be a reflection on you. I want to be clear that, if this behaviour continues, that privilege may be revoked. Visitors of the public galleries here are observers not participants. This is the final warning. There will be no tolerance for any attempts to disrupt or interfere with proceedings of the House again.
