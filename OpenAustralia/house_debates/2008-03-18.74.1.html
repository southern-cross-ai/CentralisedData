       <p>
        I want to continue with some unfinished business from 22 February—unfinished because the member for Herbert interrupted my contribution to the debate on his private member’s motion on health services. I say to the member for Herbert: that puerile activity stopped me from making a contribution to support your good motion, sir. So I would like to finish what I started to say on that day,  but I have to say first that the attitude of the member for Herbert, with the hand-wringing that has gone on over many years in this place and the unctuous self-righteousness, is shared by other members of the opposition from Tasmania such as Senator Abetz and Senator Colbeck in relation to health in my local area of Braddon. They talk health down when people need support in their health services. What we need to do is cooperate with the state government, local government, local communities and health providers to provide the very best of services. So I will continue now in the same vein as that motion that was put forward on 22 February.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to reiterate what the Rudd Labor government has promised and is working towards delivering in Braddon and particularly on the north-west coast of Tasmania. There will be $7.7 million for a new cancer treatment unit, with preference for it to be located on the north-west coast. That is very much needed. There will be $10 million for better patient transport, with a focus on the north-west coast. That is also very much needed. There will be up to $2.5 million for a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        after-hours clinic in Burnie and up to $5 million for a GP superclinic in Devonport, which are much needed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The member for Herbert said in his motion that services are needed throughout Australia. It is also so in my area. We all share that view. There is a PET scanner to be located in southern Tasmania. It is very much needed, as the member indicated in his motion that I was unable to support because he would not let me finish my contribution. There is a Medicare licence for an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRI" rel="nofollow">
         MRI
        </a>
        machine on the north-west coast. Hopefully that will be tendered for fairly soon. There is a specialised childcare and early intervention centre for north-west children with autism. That is so needed. There is $64,000 to augment the Penguin Medical Centre, and we have just delivered on $1.25 million in four-year funding for the Sisters of Charity in Devonport.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will honour our commitments as to the Mersey hospital and the people of the Mersey region. We have to do this sensibly. We have to provide these services in a sustained and safe way. We did not promise to provide an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICU" rel="nofollow">
         ICU
        </a>
        , but if we can we will. Senator Colbeck said that was a promise of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
         Tony Abbott
        </a>
        and the last government. Well, even I know it was not, so he should not tell lies about that. We want to get this hospital to the best standard possible with the best services possible, and we will honour that commitment. I am glad that at least I could begin to finish what I started as to your motion, given your puerile activity on that day.
