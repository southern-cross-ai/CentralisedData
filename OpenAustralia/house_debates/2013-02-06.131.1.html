        Every year, over six million Australians contribute their time, energy and expertise to our communities through volunteering. In all, our country benefits from more than 730 million hours of volunteers' time.
       </p>
       <p>
        In November, to mark
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Volunteer_Day" rel="nofollow">
         International Volunteer Day
        </a>
        , my community celebrated the achievements and the commitment of local volunteers. As a community representative, I have the great privilege of witnessing firsthand some of the fantastic work of volunteers in my region.
       </p>
       <p>
        Without volunteers in my community, many local organisations would not be able to provide the outstanding services and support that they do. We live in a stronger community because of local volunteers. Unfortunately, all too often these dedicated individuals go unrecognised and unacknowledged for the ways in which they build up our communities. International Volunteer Day was a perfect opportunity recognise just a few of the individuals who make the Hasluck community such a great place to live.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I particularly want to share the stories of three of the volunteers whom I was able to recognise on International Volunteer Day. Kiara Hicks is a 21-year-old with a great deal of passion for helping others. Kiara works with the Shire of Kalamunda Home and Community Care Meals on Wheels team as well as several animal shelters in my electorate. She was nominated to receive the Hasluck Youth Volunteer Award for her efforts with the home and community care program. Each and every Friday, Kiara makes meal deliveries to the

         High Wycombe
        </a>
        area, but with her visits Kiara brings much more than food. She brings friendship and happiness with her as she makes her visits. Everyone loves her bubbly and friendly personality and looks forward to their conversations with her. Her dedication and commitment help the Meals on Wheels team assist many senior Australians in my community to live independent lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another great volunteer from my community who has been recognised with the Long-term Commitment to Community Service Award is Jim Ridgwell. Jim was nominated for this award for his many years of work with the Gosnells State Emergency Service Unit. Our state emergency services deploy critical assistance during times of emergencies, and Jim has been a cornerstone member of the Gosnells team since its creation in 1980. Jim has led many fundraising efforts for the Gosnells

        to allow the team to build a new emergency headquarters and purchase new vehicles.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bill Dewhurst has dedicated his life to the black cockatoo and has helped establish a sanctuary for the preservation of the Kaarakin Black Cockatoo. He is a founding member and has been successful in breeding young birds for release back into the wild.
       </p>
       <p>
        The contributions of volunteers give back to our communities an invaluable service and a commitment that could never be matched by the type of funding that would be required.
