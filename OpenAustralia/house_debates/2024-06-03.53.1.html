        Like all Australians right now, families across the electorate of Hume are feeling the pain from dramatic increases in their cost of living. As we head into the winter months, I want to praise a partnership that is lending a hand to those most in need in the northern part of my electorate. Wests Group Macarthur has joined forces with Big Yellow Umbrella for the Yellow Hampers food relief program this winter. Together, they will aim to fill plates, ensuring that no-one in the Macarthur region goes hungry during this cold and challenging winter months.

        The cost-of-living crisis looms large over our community. Higher interest rates, increased rental payments and soaring grocery bills have pushed many to seek support from organisations like Big Yellow Umbrella. Just the other day I spoke with the chief operations officer, Kim Landouw, who aptly described the current struggle of so many when she said: 'The cost of living has meant local families cannot afford fresh fruit and vegetables. We are inundated with requests for support.' In response to that pressing need, the Yellow Hampers food relief program are doing what they can to provide support, but they're struggling to meet the needs growing in the community. Only last week, they cancelled 37 family hampers due to a lack of funds for food. Staff at charities and food banks like Big Yellow Umbrella are seeing many people visit for support services, and they need every bit of support they can get.
