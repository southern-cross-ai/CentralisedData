        Apprentices and trainees are the future of small businesses and industries in Mallee. My favourite days as an MP are spent travelling around the electorate and meeting up with small and family businesses and their tradies and apprentices. I recently put on a

        breakfast for local tradies, at dawn at Interlink in Mildura, with my colleague and former tradie turned federal minister Keith Pitt. We enjoyed a frank discussion with some local tradies from Qualia Wines about issues that are important to them and learned more about local industries that employ so many people. Last week, I also stopped by Casey's Truck and Tractor in

        , but it was a pleasure to meet his son Dale and his grandson Dylan. Dylan is the fourth-generation Casey working in the business and is one of several apprentices on their way to become diesel mechanics. Lachie, Ryan and Dylan are all showing the dedication needed to excel at their trade and Casey's is supporting them to be the best that they can be.

        The Morrison-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCormack" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        government's Boosting Apprenticeship Commencements is making a difference to businesses like Casey's, with a 50 per cent wage subsidy for all new or recommencing apprentices and trainees. In October 2020, the Morrison-McCormack government announced that it would invest $1.2 billion to support 100,000 new apprentices or trainees through the subsidy. In a stunning show of confidence in the Australian economy, all 100,000 new apprenticeships were taken up by businesses in fewer than five months. In Mallee alone, there have been 627 new apprentices registered. Due to the overwhelming success of the subsidy, the Morrison-McCormack government is now lifting the cap on places under the program, extending the subsidy to a full 12-month period for new apprentices and trainees who begin before 30 September 2021. Robin Kuhne from Workforce Partners Australia is taking full advantage of this program. Robin works with industry to link them to new apprentices. They also employ their own apprentices who are contracted out to other employers to provide agile support. The business has supported the commencement of 65 new apprentices that will be eligible for the wage subsidy. That is 65 young people getting a start in their career and numerous businesses growing as a result. The government and Australian businesses are backing opportunities for Australians, particularly our young people. I thank every single business in Mallee that has taken on a new apprentice and trainee and encourage the rest to make the most of this opportunity while it lasts.
