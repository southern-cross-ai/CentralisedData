       <p>
        Recently I met with a young couple from Coombabah who have two young school-age children and a mortgage. These are aspiring middle-class Australians who want to give back to their community wherever possible. They told me just how hard things are under this incompetent Labor government. Just 18 months after the change in federal government, they've seen their mortgage climb by more than $20,000. Their electricity bill continues to climb out of control. Shopping for groceries at the Runaway Bay Woolies is getting harder and harder as inflation bites. They don't want to cancel the kids' soccer or dancing lessons, but the cost-of-living crisis means that something has to give.

        While the government assure the public that they have a plan and it's working, the reality is that they have the wrong priorities and continue to make poor decisions that are making things worse for families in my electorate. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">

        governor has confirmed that Australia's world-leading inflation is being driven by domestic factors, but the Prime Minister and the Treasurer continue to sell the fanciful story that it's driven by overseas. Under the leadership of those on the other side of this chamber, I don't blame the young Coombabah family for being pessimistic. This Labor government has formed a habit of breaking promises and, sadly, Australians are paying the price. The only hope for Australian families is the hope of the return of a coalition government.
