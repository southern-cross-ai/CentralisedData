        (2) recognises the success of Labor's $5,638 billion investment to build 20,000 new social housing dwellings and renovate a further 80,000, as a key economic stimulus measure during the global financial crisis; and

       <p class="italic">
        (c) Australia's domestic tourism industry, with Australians taking 12.3 million arts day trips and 13.4 million arts overnight trips within Australia that include arts activities—this travel will play a role in helping communities rebuild and recover from disasters by supporting local jobs and economies; and
       </p>

        1 Dr Haines: To move—That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) recognises that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) in the 19th century it was regional Australia that led the transition from gas to electricity and that in the 21st century it is again regional Australia that is leading Australia's transition to renewable energy; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) according to the Australian Energy Market Operator's Integrated System Plan, around 15 gigawatts of coal-fired power will retire over the next 20 years;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) recalls the analysis from the leaked report of the National COVID-19 Coordination Commission Manufacturing Taskforce indicated that renewables plus storage are the lowest cost form of new electricity generation, and therefore a lowest-cost energy transition will be based on significant investment in renewables;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) welcomes the recent comments from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Energy_Agency" rel="nofollow">
         International Energy Agency
        </a>
        that 'governments have the opportunity to accelerate renewables deployment by making investment in renewables a key part of stimulus packages designed to reinvigorate their economies. This offers the prospect of harnessing the structural benefits that increasingly affordable renewables can bring, including opportunities for creating jobs and economic development, while reducing emissions and fostering innovation';
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) notes analysis by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Scientific_and_Industrial_Research_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
         Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation
        </a>
        that projects that up to $1,000 billion will be spent on Australia's electricity system until 2050 and that local communities should benefit from this investment boom;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) acknowledges that 'community energy', which is where a renewable energy project is developed by, owned by or delivers benefit to local communities, offers a compelling model for capturing the immense benefits of renewable energy, including jobs and investment, for local communities in regional Australia;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (6) welcomes the findings of Sustainability Victoria into the Victorian Community Power Hub pilot program which found that Government investment into community energy of $1.16 million created 15 projects delivering economic benefits worth $25.6 million; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (7) calls on the Government to support the development of community-owned renewable energy projects across regional Australia through:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) direct financial support for regional communities in the form of grants and concessional loans;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) technical support for local communities to develop renewable energy projects based on the Community Power Hub model successfully deployed in Victoria; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) a dedicated national community energy agency to enable capacity-building across the regional community energy network and to administer financial and technical support over the medium-term.

        (1) the purpose of superannuation is to enable Australians to save for a dignified retirement;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) superannuation has made an enormous contribution to converting Australia from a nation that borrows to a nation that lends, creating a pool of funds to invest locally and abroad;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) Australia is the 16th largest economy in the world, but because of universal superannuation has a pool of savings owned by Australian workers worth $2.8 trillion, which is the fourth largest pool of retirement savings in the world;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) before universal superannuation, 68 per cent of Australians and 85 per cent of all women had no retirement savings;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) the average superannuation balance at retirement is now approximately $160,000 for women and $280,000 for men;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (6) under current policy settings, the median balance on retirement for full-time workers will be $310,819 for women and $628,634 for men;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (7) over the past decade the average rate of return has been between 6 and 8 per cent—last year it grew by 9.2 per cent and Australia was among only a handful of countries that saw pension fund growth; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (8) superannuation is critical to Australia's economic growth and resilience and must be strengthened so it can play a pivotal role in Australia's economic recovery from COVID-19.
