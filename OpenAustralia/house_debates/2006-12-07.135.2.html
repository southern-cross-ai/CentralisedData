       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That the House, at its rising, adjourn until Tuesday, 6 February, at 2.00 pm, unless the Speaker or, in the event of the Speaker being unavailable, the Deputy Speaker fixes an alternative day or hour for the meeting.
       </p>
       <p>
        The House is coming to the end of this session and will rise this evening for the Christmas break. As is traditional in this place at this moment, we pause to engage in what are called the valedictories—they are sometimes given a less reverent title outside of this place. But it is an occasion to look back on the year. It is an opportunity for me and, I know, an opportunity for the Leader of the Opposition to express our gratitude to those people who have made such a contribution to the working of this parliament and made our political and public lives possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        First and foremost, I want to say a couple of things about the state of our country and what has happened to Australia over the last year. Leaving politics aside, I think it cannot be gainsaid that we go to Christmas as a remarkably fortunate group of 20 million people. This remains an incredibly blest and lucky country, a lot of it due to our own effort, a lot of it due to the blessing of providence. It is a year that has seen Australia continue to prosper; and whilst there remains legitimate debate about whether it could be more or might be less if anything else had been done, that is not really my purpose in this speech.
       </p>
       <p>
        But it has been a year of particular adversity for one section of the Australian community, and I commence my assessment of the year by acknowledging the enormous strain, difficulty and pain of the severe drought on rural Australia. When you think of our country you automatically think of the bush. It is something that is a very special part of our nation and it is something that has helped to define Australia for generations. The suffering of people in rural Australia due to the drought has been absolutely incalculable. I want all Australians who live in country areas to know that the thoughts of their fellow Australians are with them as they grapple with the adversity that the drought has brought them and, despite that adversity, they endeavour to celebrate Christmas as much as possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        It has been a year in which, as well as drought, other natural disasters have hit different parts of the country: cyclones Larry and Monica; the Victorian bushfires, which rage as we speak; and the flooding in Katherine in April. The cooperation of the Commonwealth and Queensland governments in responding to the cyclone in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         Far North Queensland
        </a>
        was remarkable and I pay tribute to the leadership of General Peter Cosgrove, who was put in charge of the relief operation by the Queensland government. He has once again demonstrated his remarkable leadership skills and his remarkable capacity to connect with the ordinary Australian.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am sure, as an inspirational story of human survival, the survival of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grant_Webb" rel="nofollow">
         Grant Webb
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Russell" rel="nofollow">
         Todd Russell

        in the Beaconsfield mine disaster was undoubtedly the highlight of the year. It was a survival against every conceivable odd. The remarkable story went around the world. It gripped all of us. It saw the very best of the Australian spirit. It saw everybody cooperating—the company, the union, the workers, the local community, the local churches and the local mayor. Everybody did their job. It was an inspirational example of the capacity of this country when it is required to put aside differences and work together. I think all of us were touched in a profound way by what occurred. I guess the final demonstration of Australian mateship in that great drama was the decision of the family of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Knight" rel="nofollow">
         Larry Knight
        </a>
        to postpone the funeral of their loved one so that the rescued miners could attend that funeral. It was tinged, of course, with sadness but, all in all, it was a remarkable event.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games" rel="nofollow">

        were an extraordinary tribute to the capacity of the city of Melbourne, which worked together in a cohesive way that I think no other city of Australia could have done.

          Yes, I say that very generously. I even took a bit of stick from a couple of people in Sydney for having the audacity to say it. But my experience has been that, as an exercise in social, community and civic cohesion, the city of Melbourne is quite remarkable. It is a different city from other cities in that respect—and, if you want to get something done in an organised fashion, they do it very well indeed. The spirit in Melbourne over the

          </a>

            He speaks Chinese, does he? That is very good—touche! The event was quite remarkable and a great tribute to the capacity of Australia to organise those events. I look forward to the day when Australia will host a soccer world cup. I continue to use the expression ‘soccer’ because we Australians know it by that name. Calling it football is thoroughly confusing, certainly for most of us.
           </p>
           <p>
            Turning to this place, it has been a year when sadly we have lost some giants of the Australian political scene:

             Don Chipp
            </a>
            , the founder of the

             Australian Democrats
            </a>
            ; two members who were perhaps not so well known except to some of the Liberals who have served in this place for a long period of time—namely, Sir Allen Fairhall, who was the last of the Liberal forty-niners, and Sir Reginald Swartz. who was also a Liberal forty-niner. I think, when he served here, he held the distinction of being the most senior in rank amongst those members from both sides of the House who had been prisoners of war of the Japanese in Thailand and had worked on the infamous Burma-Thailand railway. More recently we mourned the death of Sir Harold Young of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             South Australia

            .
           </p>
           <p>
            It has also been, in this place, a year of significant change for the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Labor Party
            </a>
            . In a spirit of proper respect to the nature of parliamentary politics, let me again welcome the Leader of the Opposition to the dispatch box for these valedictories and wish him and his wife, Therese, and their three children a very happy and peaceful Christmas. All of us continue to feel very much for
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Beazley" rel="nofollow">
             Kim Beazley
            </a>
            and his wife, Susie. The loss of Kim’s brother was a terrible blow on the day of the leadership change. All of us also think of Kim’s parents, Kim and Betty. To them, we send our good wishes at this time of particular travail.
           </p>
           <p>
            On my side, I pay a very particular tribute to two people. I want to thank
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Vaile" rel="nofollow">
             Mark Vaile
            </a>
            , the Deputy Prime Minister and the Leader of the National Party. I think we all recognise that, in a coalition government, inevitably there are some strains and differences. That is natural and there is no point in denying it. But this coalition has been remarkably free of those. I have served in a couple of coalition governments and I can say that the equanimity, the calm, the peace and the sense of tranquillity of this coalition has been quite remarkable. That has been due in no small measure to the contribution of three wonderful National Party leaders:
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Fischer" rel="nofollow">
             Tim Fischer
            </a>

             John Anderson
            </a>
            and the current Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Party, Mark Vaile. I wish Mark and Wendy every good health and happiness and a good rest over Christmas.
           </p>
           <p>
            I pay tribute to Peter and Tanya Costello. Peter, of course, is the other great mainstay at the very top of the government and he has carried a great load in the last 10½ years. He has been the best Treasurer this country has ever had and he has made a remarkable contribution of economic stewardship. I thank
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Minchin" rel="nofollow">
             Nick Minchin
            </a>
            and

             Helen Coonan

             Kerry Bartlett
            </a>
            . I think everybody would say, no matter what their politics, that the Chief Government Whip’s nature is gentle and he is a person who looks after everybody. He is very solicitous towards his colleagues and he represents their concerns, periodic though they may be, to the leadership of the government. And his good friend the member for Corangamite, my good friend and longstanding colleague, and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanna_Gash" rel="nofollow">
             Joanna Gash

              She is the darling from Riverina, yes. Finally, I turn to in-house matters. The shy, retiring Leader of the House who constantly hides his light under a bushel—I do want to pay tribute to him. My personal staff have once again been indefatigable. I particularly mention the death during the year of a wonderful adviser,
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Perrin" rel="nofollow">
               John Perrin
              </a>
              , who was my adviser on health and social security matters. John contracted bowel cancer; it was discovered during the currency of the election campaign in 2004 and he fought a long and courageous battle. He was a person of immense charity and strong faith. His death at the very early age of his late 40s really affected us all a great deal and he left a wonderful legacy. I acknowledge the contribution John made in advising me in relation to such things as the Medicare safety net and the family relationship centres—two very significant policies that I regard as profoundly positive in their effect. He was one of those advisers that you come across infrequently and he made a great contribution to the quality of advice in my office. I honour his memory on this occasion.

                  <p>
                   There is one other group that I want to thank most fervently of all: my wife, Janette; my three children, Melanie, Tim and Richard; and Melanie’s husband, Rowan, who is wonderfully a part of our family. I have been very lucky. I have three wonderful adult children. The greatest thing you can do in life is to have three children and for them to grow up, and you are still the very best of affectionate friends when they grow to adulthood. Gee, I am very, very lucky in that respect and I thank them, and I thank God for the opportunity I have had to share that relationship with them. Janette has been the pillar of my life and her counsel, love and support have been fundamental to any success I have achieved in public life, and I want to record that gratitude. We all think of our families particularly at Christmas but we are close to them all of the time. I hope I speak for everybody in this chamber in saying how important our children are to us. I know family is important to every member who sits opposite, as it is to every person who sits behind me. But, in my case, I take this opportunity of publicly expressing the immense gratitude I feel to them for their love, support and counsel through the year.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The last thing I want to say is on the nature of the event we go to. We go to Christmas to celebrate the birth of Jesus of Nazareth and to acknowledge the extraordinary contribution of Christianity to the moulding of this country. It remains the case that the Judeo-Christian ethic has been the greatest moral influence and the greatest shaper of the behaviour of human endeavour in Australia. It has been and remains the greatest force for good in our community. The organised Christian church, like any other organisation, has made many mistakes and, like any other organisation, it contains its share of hypocrites, but overall the influence of the Christian religion in this country remains a remarkable force for good.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   I acknowledge the fact that many Australians, whilst they join in celebrating Christmas and enjoy the festive and family part of it, do not see any particular religious significance in it. In a secular country, that is as it should be. I believe in a secular society in Australia in the sense that we do not have any organised religious adherence. We do not have a state ordained religion, but I think we are, nonetheless and despite that, stronger for it: we are a country where the influence and the deposit of Christianity remains very strong. To me and to millions of other Australians, the central importance of Christmas is to mark the birth of a man who has had a greater influence on the world than any other single human being. It is a very important thing to acknowledge that.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   It is the time, flowing from that, to recognise that, despite our extraordinary bounty, we are nonetheless a country that has within its midst people who have not shared that bounty. One of the obligations all of us have in different ways is to try to make sure that next year there are still fewer of them. I suppose we will never get to a situation where there are none of them, but we ought to retain a sense of hope because, despite everything that is said about the direction of the world, by any measure there are fewer people in poverty, there is less disease and people are living longer and healthier lives—not only in countries like Australia but also around the world—than ever before. I sometimes think that we allow ourselves to be overwhelmed by a negative view of the state of the world. If we look at what has happened over the last 50 years, if we look at the extraordinary liberation of hundreds of millions of people from poverty and the remarkable contribution that different global economic forces have made to that, it is a cause for hope and a cause for optimism.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Very finally, I spare more than a thought for the men and women of the

                   </a>
                   who are serving their country loyally and magnificently in different parts of the world. It is a lonely time for them. It is a time of separation. It is a time when the thought of family and loved ones is very acute. We should never forget the sacrifice they make, and we in this country should always, whoever is in government, have a special place in our affections and a special place in our hearts for those people who put their lives on the line in the name of this country to do what they are asked to do by the elected government of this country.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   To all of my colleagues who sit behind me: thank you very much for your great help and support through the year. It has been a great year for the coalition. I hope next year is an equally great or even greater year for the coalition. That is in our hands and in the hands of the Australian people.

I congratulate those who have been elected to the frontbench.

                   <p>
                    I thank the Prime Minister for his gracious remarks as we begin to think about celebrating the Christmas season. As I look around the chamber and see the looks of fatigue written on the faces of those from the government benches—I assume they are equally written on the faces of those who sit behind me—I know we all in our heads and our hearts have in mind, first of all, escape from this place and, soon, being placed back in the bosom of our families. This is a demanding life. Everyone who is in this place knows that and knows that acutely. It is particularly demanding on our families. So it is good that the Christmas season has come so that we can be with them and return refreshed.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    For my new deputy,

                    </a>
                    , the member for Lalor, Christmas has not quite come yet. The member for Lalor and I will be embarking on a 10-day whiz around the country. As we visit various electorates of members over there, we will be kind and Christian in our remarks about some of you opposite, if not all! Once that is concluded, we will be returning home for much-needed rest as well.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The Prime Minister reflected on the significance of the Christmas message for those who come from the Christian tradition.
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_and_I" rel="nofollow">
                     He and I
                    </a>
                    both come from that tradition, and Christmas does have a particular spiritual significance, which I share with him. For those who do not come from that tradition, it is an enormous opportunity and time still for festive celebration and to spend time together as families. That is good for our entire Australian family, be they from a faith community or from a non-faith community.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    For the nation at large—and the Prime Minister spoke of this as well—as we reflect on the year it is the message of the ages in Australia that this is indeed an uncertain land. The impact of natural calamity, the impact of uncertain events in the form of flood, of cyclone, of drought and of fires—including those raging right now as we speak in this chamber—reminds us of those who are most exposed to these natural calamities. In particular, there is the impact, as the Prime Minister also referred to, on those who are suffering from drought. As I—as all of us in this chamber do—travel across the country in aircraft and look down, what causes me greatest despair is that wherever you are flying these days the dams are so low, the reservoirs are so low and the land is so parched.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    When I was a kid growing up on a farm in south-east Queensland we never used to have water problems in that part of Queensland. We do now. Something is happening out there. It is not the time for a debate about climate change, but, as we look at what is happening across our country and think of those whose livelihoods are so much on the line when it comes to this extraordinary drought that the nation is now experiencing, our hearts go out to them and our policy minds need to go out to them as well for the long term.

                    Beyond rural Australia, and beyond those affected by these extraordinary natural events, there are those other Australians who are also doing it tough at this time of year. Christmas for many people is a time of great celebration, of gathering together as families and sometimes as communities. For other Australians it can be a very painful time. For people who have suffered loss, for people who are experiencing loneliness, Christmas can have a different significance. So at times like this it is important—and I am sure all members here will be doing the same—to reflect on those who are finding their lives difficult and for whom Christmas may not be a time of great celebration.

                    When we turn our thoughts to the parliament, I thank the Prime Minister for his generous remarks in relation to the former Leader of the Opposition,
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Beazley" rel="nofollow">
                     Kim Beazley
                    </a>
                    . I thank him also for making available to the former Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, a government aircraft to return quickly to Perth the other day following the tragic death of his brother. That was a kind gesture on the Prime Minister’s behalf, and we in the Labor Party thank him for it.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    Kim’s contribution in this parliament has been reflected on a lot. He was an extraordinary contributor to the life of our nation, he continues to be an extraordinary contributor to the life of our nation, and, for our party, he has been a person whose significance goes beyond the years. Tomorrow, in Perth, Kim will farewell his brother David, who died so tragically earlier this week, and we in the Labor Party, and many others, will be thinking of Kim, Susie and his family at that time. The member for Jagajaga will be travelling to Perth and representing our thoughts; wishes and prayers at this difficult time for Kim and his family.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    The member for Jagajaga has served for a long time as Deputy Leader of the Opposition. I would like to use this opportunity in my valedictory to pay particular tribute to the work that she has done on behalf of the opposition, on behalf of the parliamentary Labor Party. Jenny is a terrific person. Jenny’s work behind the scenes on policy for Labor has been tireless, has been selfless and is unknown to many of those who sit opposite—in fact, unknown to many of those who sit on the opposition benches. But I would like to use this opportunity in my valedictory to place on the

                    record my appreciation for the self-effacing work which she has done, work which has been critical to the entire operation of the parliamentary Labor Party. I wish Jenny and her family all the best for the Christmas season, and I am sure she will appreciate the opportunity for rest which now presents itself.

                   <p>
                    To the Prime Minister, his wife, Janette, and their family, I wish a very restful Christmas as well. I know, from having observed the Prime Minister in public with his wife Janette on so many occasions, that they are indeed very close. It is plainly a time when they will be able to spend time together and recover from the rigours of the year and prepare for the next—don’t recover too much, Prime Minister.

                      It is not a question about manufacturing. I have a confession to make. I have a particular affection for the Deputy Prime Minister and the former Minister for Trade. As his sparring partner of some time in our respective occupancy of the trade portfolio—one in government and the other in opposition—I have a view that the Deputy Prime Minister is a decent bloke. I have enjoyed working with him, although you could not necessarily tell that from some of the questions I have asked him during the year. I wish Mark and his family great rest and recuperation time over Christmas.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      To my caucus colleagues, this has been a very challenging year for all of us. It has had a difficult conclusion; we all know that and we feel that intensely on our side. I pay tribute to the sensitivity with which members of the parliamentary Labor Party have handled the events of the last week in particular. I say to my colleagues in the parliamentary party: rest well, return to the embrace of your families and your loved ones. It is time to experience the nurture of that and to be strengthened by it, because 2007 will return us to the event whose date the member for Lowe was speculating on—with some accuracy I fear.

Thank you, Mr Speaker, for your support. On a private and personal note, I would like to note the way in which you interact with members of our side of politics at a personal level. We appreciate that and thank you for your work in that respect.

                           , who in recent times has also been the Manager of Opposition Business. I would like to thank Julia for her excellent work as Manager of Opposition Business, given the depths of the provocation by the Leader of the House, which she has always responded to with good humour and, I think, acute rebuttal. Behind the scenes, I am sure that Julia and Tony in fact have a very good personal working relationship.

                               To the staff of the parliamentary Labor Party—all those who assist us in this place and make our lives possible given the impossible demands we often place on them—through these remarks I would also pass on our particular thanks for their work during what has been a difficult and challenging year for us all. I send thanks to our electorate staff, who keep the home fires burning while we are here in Canberra. Increasingly, in my experience during my time in parliament, our electorate staff shoulder a greater and greater burden in terms of the people who fall between the cracks out there in the community.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               This is not a debate about the blame game, Prime Minister, but people fall between the cracks of those responsible, whether it is a Commonwealth agency, a state agency or local government. Often there is simply nowhere for them to go. Our electorate staff are increasingly becoming undersalaried counsellors for the community at large. There is a great social fracturing out there in Australia at the moment which we need to be mindful of. I think our electorate offices often become the point at which that is made manifest to us. I find in my experience as a member the complexity, depth and number of cases of people in acute need increasing and increasing greatly year by year. So we thank our electorate staff one and all.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               Finally on the subject of staff, I particularly acknowledge the role played by David Fredericks, the former chief of staff of the former Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley. ‘Freddo’, as he is known to everyone in this building, was a very good and very loyal chief of staff and someone who managed the Leader of the Opposition’s office with great professionalism and distinction. I know he had a good professional relationship with the Prime Minister’s private office, and he was held and continues to be held in high regard by all of us in the parliamentary Labor Party. In the deputy leader’s office and the office of the Manager of Opposition Business, I would also pay particular tribute to the role played by Silvana Anthony and the work that she has done.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                               The Prime Minister also rightly referred to our troops abroad. The Prime Minister is right. This always goes and should go beyond politics. It goes beyond whether we support a particular military engagement or not. I have visited and met with our troops in the field in Iraq. I have seen their operations in
                               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
                                East Timor

                               . When I was in Afghanistan they were not there, but they are back there now, so I know something of the terrain in which are they operating. These are very difficult and dangerous operating environments. You know that intellectually and then you go there. I know many members of the parliament have gone there and have seen what they are doing in the field. At times like this, at Christmas, when they are separated from their families, the acuteness of the sense of separation knows no easy description. So I would ask all members to bear our men and women in uniform in mind and in their prayers at this difficult time. I am particularly concerned about the operating environment in Afghanistan. I think it is going to become increasingly difficult and dangerous. I worry greatly about the safety of our troops there; I know the Prime Minister would as well. But at this time we send them our best greetings. It is a good thing that in this parliament and this country we have got to a stage where sentiments of this nature have absolutely no divide anymore.

                               Finally, on my personal staff, I thank my own chief of staff, Alister Jordan, who has been with me for the last five years. He needs a rest as well, and I am giving him this weekend off—then it is back to work! Then there are my policy advisers, Kate Callaghan and—I can confirm publicly the name of my other policy adviser—
                               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bond" rel="nofollow">

                               . I thank them for their work as well. I assure those on the government benches that they will be engaging in no James Bond-like activities.

                               I thank my own electorate staff, Gina Tilley, Mary Mawhinney, Louise Bell, Fleur Foster and Joel Lyneham, who have assisted me enormously in dealing with my community in Brisbane. Volunteers also have assisted both in my parliamentary office and back home in Brisbane: Marcus Bartley Johns, Roseanne Toohey,

                               , Joan Dunn and Lorna Clarke—I thank them all. Without them, handling the correspondence load into my office would simply be impossible. To the people of my electorate of Griffith in Brisbane, I thank them very much.

                              <p>
                               On family, I thank my wife of 25 years, Therese, and my kids, Jessica, Nicholas and Marcus. The Prime Minister has said this and Kim has said this: family is everything. It is true. Nothing more needs to be said. That is where it begins; that is where it ends.
                              </p>

                               In conclusion, we all have a really big year ahead of us. We are all human beings in this place. We are full of human foibles and failings. We get things right; we get things wrong. But there is a decency about Australian political life which I think we always need to remind ourselves of. We listened in the

                               yesterday to remarks by the Korean President on the nature of the Australian democracy—that we have these things called smooth political transitions, as we hope to have at the end of next year. But the point he was making was actually much more profound than that. It was actually about the nature of our Australian democracy—the fact that, despite the real political and ideas divide which exists within Australian politics and the robustness with which it is fought, there is a humanity about this place in the fact that we have friendships across this chamber which will endure well beyond our time in this chamber. So, Mr Speaker, with those concluding remarks, I wish you, all members of parliament and those who are listening to this broadcast all the best for the Christmas season. May we return refreshed and ready for what lies ahead for us in 2007.

                                It is that time of the parliamentary year when we make these valedictory speeches and reflect on what has taken place both in this place and across the nation for which we work during the preceding year. Of course, this past year has been a year of triumphs and disasters. That is the Australian way, both in a natural sense and in a political sense.

                                In March this year
                                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Larry" rel="nofollow">
                                 Cyclone Larry
                                </a>
                                caused more than $1 billion worth of damage in North Queensland, and our whole country reached out and poured out its heart to the people who were affected up there. The Prime Minister and I visited the area straight after the effect of the cyclone. Of course, one of the enduring features of Australia and Australianness is the ability of Australians to be able to reach out and help their mates and their fellow countrymen, as was the case then. Now, as the country is ravaged by arguably the worst drought that we have ever had in this nation, we are doing the same thing as a nation—holding out our hands to help the farming community to get through this difficult time that it is confronting.

                                This week, and it was recognised in comments in the House today, there are 37 fires blazing across the north-east and Gippsland regions of Victoria. These natural disasters are a common part of the landscape in Australia, and they are something that we need to deal with on a daily basis. Despite these disasters and the headlines of a troubled world, we have much to be thankful for, living in this country at a time when we approach Christmas, where we celebrate the birth of Christ and recognise the sacrifices he made for us.
                               </p>

                                Interestingly, this year both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition mentioned families. This year about 265,000 children were born, and they will grow up in a country that is free and prosperous, which is one of the greatest democracies on the face of this planet. Both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition mentioned the importance of family and the great joys of having children. This year, Wendy and I discovered another one—and that is having grandchildren. One of those 265,000 children born this year was our first grandchild, Jackson James Rapley. He was born in August and his parents were recipients of support from the federal government, for which they were very grateful at the time, as I am sure the parents of the other 265,000 children that were born were. It is appropriate that at this time we recognise those things that we value in this country, along with family, Australianness and how we treat each other.

                                This place, being the great clearing house of ideas in this country, is a place where we do engage in very tough debating battle on the ideas of the time. Of course, that is the pivotal point of our democracy in this country. We get to this stage of the year and it is appropriate that we recognise the fact that, whether we agree with each other on individual issues or not, we should all acknowledge that each individual in this place is doing what he or she believes is in the best interests of the nation. And we do do that. We do believe in that. That is one of the things that we absolutely love about our political process, our parliamentary process, and we should recognise that.

                                recognise the great contribution that the Prime Minister has made as the head of the government and the leader of the nation, both nationally in the interests of over 20 million Australians and on the international stage as a well-recognised international political leader across the world. The contribution that the Prime Minister has made will be to the enduring benefit of future generations in this nation. Prime Minister, I wish you and Janette a very peaceful and restful break over the Christmas period and new year. I just hope for your sake that the fifth test in Sydney is not one that is for an academic result and that there is interest in that test. I am sure that, one way or another, you will enjoy that. I also extend all the best for the Christmas and festive season and the new year to the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party—our coalition partners—the Treasurer and good friend,

                                Because of the changes in recent months my deputy leader,

                                , and his wife, Lynn, have had to freshen up their passports and start travelling the world. I know that the Leader of the Opposition is well aware of the impact of this on your personal life and physical wellbeing, and I am at this stage still not missing the fact that I took a decision a couple of months ago to change portfolios, return permanently to Australia and reacquaint myself with my Australian habits. But I wish Warren and Lynn all the best. I know that next year is going to be a very busy year for him with the portfolio and as the deputy leader of our party, playing a critical role in the leadership team of government as we move into what will be a very important election year for the nation.

                                I thank the whips that have looked after us in our party, particularly

                                . During he last year they have done a fantastic job in looking after the interests of the party. It is not easy being from time to time the junior coalition partner, where the interests of the nation must always come first—and that includes the interests of regional Australia. The whips do a great job in working with our colleagues in managing the processes. While I am on whips, I mention the member for Macquarie, the member for Gilmore and the member for Corangamite, our colleagues in the Liberal Party, whom we work so very closely with.

                                It would not be appropriate for me to let the moment pass without commenting on a couple of my colleagues who the next time that we have an opportunity of participating in this debate in this place may not be with us. I speak of the current member for Gwydir,

                                , the Deputy Speaker, who have both announced that they will not be contesting the next election. The member for Gwydir has been a very good friend and colleague of mine for all of the years that I have been in this place. He preceded me in entering the parliament by a number of years, and we shared an interest in portfolios in agriculture and in transport and regional services and, of course, ultimately in the leadership of our party in government.

                                For the six years that John Anderson was the Deputy Prime Minister and led our party, I was his deputy and thoroughly enjoyed working with him. I learned an enormous amount from John. A lot has been said following John’s announcement of his retirement, but it goes without saying and needs to be put on the record again that, above everything else, John Anderson is a thoroughly decent human being and a decent Australian who loves this country and particularly loves the regional parts of our nation that we lovingly refer to as the bush.

                                I know that John will be sadly missed in this place and in our party and that the contribution that he has made will be recorded in the political history of this country as being one of great significance both in policy for agriculture—the

                                program and beginning to remove those demarcation lines of responsibility in the hierarchy of the road structure and the rail structure in Australia. They were things that John Anderson achieved and put into place in a policy sense that he will be well and truly remembered for.

I know that we will be working with both of you, John and Ian, during next year, but in the circumstances I might not get another opportunity. We thank you for your contribution. Ian Causley had a very distinguished career in the state parliament in

                                as a very senior minister in the Greiner and Fahey governments. He served with distinction and came to this place with a great deal of experience in and knowledge of so many areas of public policy, which we have been able to draw upon very often. We appreciate the work that Ian has done. In latter years, he has been a very capable Deputy Speaker in this place, one who has occupied the chair for many hours, helping in the smooth running of this chamber and the rest of the parliament.

                                Mr Speaker, I take this opportunity to wish you and your good wife, Penny, all the very best for Christmas. I know that it has been just as challenging a year for you as the key occupant of the chair as it has been for the rest of us in this place. This place does not work as effectively and as well as it does as the clearinghouse of political ideas in this country without firm guidance from the occupant of the chair. To that end, we thank you and wish you all the very best.

                                Ian Harris and his team, the clerks, do a fantastic job in their totally impartial advice to both sides of the chamber in matters of procedure, the orderly running of the chamber and the assistance they give to both the government and the opposition. I recognise the comment that the Leader of the Opposition made in that regard. We can still remember the years that we spent in opposition in the early nineties—or I can. We probably relied more heavily in those days on the advice from the clerks and we continue to remind ourselves that that is a fundamental reason why we fight so hard to stay on this side.
                               </p>

                                I also recognise the great work that Dalma Dixon and those in the office of the Serjeant-at-Arms do in helping all members of parliament. I understand that Dalma may be retiring soon. She has been in that office since I have been in this place. I have always relied very heavily on their advice and guidance and wish them very well. Thank you, Dalma, and those in the office of the Serjeant-at-Arms.

                                who have served us so well are also going to retire. I want to single out Diane Hawke, who retired from the Parliamentary Library this year after 32 years of service. She worked at the front counter in the library in both the old and new parliament houses. We often lose sight of the level of dedication of many of the officers of the parliament who work for us. They are just as dedicated to our parliamentary system and our processes of democracy in this country as we are, and we should recognise the great contribution that they make. That is critically important.

                                , and all my other staff who manage the business of our party within government and in interacting with other senior ministers’ officers and our party membership across Australia. They are dedicated to the cause, just as we are. I certainly thank them and wish them all the best for Christmas. During the upcoming weeks, my chief of staff is going to commit to the sacrament of marriage, and I wish Brad and Meredith all the very best for their wedding and for their life together. I am sure they will be extremely happy together, particularly with their shared passion for politics and good policy.

                                Before concluding, I wish the Leader of the Opposition, his wife, Therese, and their children all the best over the upcoming period. As he indicated, we have had a healthy professional relationship across the chamber in the trade portfolio over the last 12 months, when it has been quite intense. I know that on major occasions of significant policy for the nation we have shared some views. During the

                                last year, the Leader of the Opposition, then the shadow minister for foreign affairs and trade, was present as part of the Australian delegation, just as his predecessors in that portfolio have had responsibility for WTO meetings.

                                on that occasion. We look forward to the announcement of the new Labor Party frontbench. We wish them all the best in their new roles and look forward to the work we are going to do in this place next year. It will be more of the same, as we debate the great issues of import to the nation.

                                To the newly elected Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Lalor: I wish her all the very best. I will continue to wear my Australian-made suits and the ties that my wife and daughters select for me! I know that she will bring to whatever role she is appointed to by the Leader of the Opposition her usual level of commitment and diligence.

                                The member for Brand had a particularly difficult week, and that has been reflected upon. I do not know that any of us can really appreciate the shock of losing a brother in such circumstances—having just lost the leadership of the Labor Party. I know we all felt, as human beings, for the member for Brand. Our thoughts and prayers are with him this week as he and his family confront the very difficult circumstance of the loss of a loved one. He has always been a committed Australian.

                                When we were having a major debate on the eve of passing the legislation that put in place the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement, the member for Brand made a significant speech from the back bench, before he returned to the front bench, in support of the importance of what we had done in cementing that commercial bilateral relationship with the United States. I thanked him on that occasion because it was above politics, at a time when the then Leader of the Opposition was not as constructive towards the policy position the government had taken. I wish the member for Brand and his wife, Susie, all the best for Christmas, as I do the member for Jagajaga. As she has served as the Deputy Leader of the

                                for a number of years in this place, I know this will be a time for reflection. Leadership of political parties is one of the most difficult challenges of any aspect of one’s political career, as I have been finding out over the last 18 months since taking on the mantle of leadership of the National Party. I certainly convey my congratulations to the member for Jagajaga and to the member for Brand for the work they have done leading their party over recent years.

                                In conclusion, I extend best wishes for Christmas to all members on both sides of the parliament, to all those engaged in serving us in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. I trust they will have a wonderful time with their families and loved ones as we celebrate the birth of Christ and this great event of Christmas when we focus so much on family. I thank very deeply my wife, Wendy, for her support during the last 12 months. Political spouses often end up wearing some of the ignominy that we bring upon ourselves as members of parliament, whether warranted or not. It is certainly not warranted by our families. I know sometimes it is tough for them, but we should acknowledge the great support we get. Certainly Wendy has always been a great support to me and I thank her. To my daughters, Terri, Prue and Sarah, to my sons-in-law, Jason and Nigel, and to our new addition, our grandson Jackson James: I am certainly looking forward to having a wonderful Christmas with you.

She has been a wonderful occupant of her position and has always done her job efficiently and with unfailing politeness and grace. I thank her and wish her well.

My mother and father, in particular, managed to become television personalities this year, including in recent days on the media in Adelaide, but we are looking forward to a quieter Christmas than perhaps the year has been.

                                  over a long period of time as a Labor leader and a member of this parliament. I echo the sentiments of the Leader of the Opposition and, indeed, the Deputy Prime Minister, who has just spoken, and the Prime Minister. Obviously this has been a very difficult week for Mr Beazley and our thoughts are with him. Of course Kim was a Labor legend when I came to this parliament in 1998. He was already a man of huge reputation in the Labor Party and beyond, having served so successfully as a long-term minister in the Hawke and Keating governments and having led Labor so ably in the 1996 to 1998 period. It was only when I came here in 1998 that I got to know Kim personally. It has been terrific to be able to work with him. He is a man of huge generosity of spirit. I am sure that we are all looking forward to seeing him back here next year, having got through these very difficult times and very difficult circumstances particularly for his family.

It has to be at least 20 years and possibly a little longer than that.

Rogie and I work closely together, day in, day out, during sitting days. A great whip requires some tact and, I would have to say, from time to time some occasional flashes of temper, and Roger manages to display both at precisely the right time. We do need a bit of discipline in temper from time to time, and Rogie manages to display it.

Twelve months later I still absolutely believe that. If they did not know what was going on, there would be no hope for the rest of us. I thank you very much for your counsel, advice and support. If you could convey my thanks to the staff in the Clerk’s office as well, I would be very grateful.

Between one thing and another—he as Leader of the House and I as Manager of Opposition Business, as well as the health portfolio—we have spent a fair bit of time together. I would say of the Leader of the House that he is always far easier to deal with outside this chamber than he is to deal with within it. I am sure that we will continue to see each other outside the chamber, irrespective of changes of roles. And I am sure that we will continue to hurl abuse at each other inside this chamber, irrespective of changes of roles as well. But we do have to work cooperatively together in terms of the logistics of the House, and we have managed to do that without too much consternation during the year. So I convey my thanks to the Leader of the House and to his staff and, most notably, to Paris, who is very important to us in terms of liaison.

                                        I thank Judy Middlebrook and her staff. We are very reliant on chamber research on this side of the table. They do us proud every time we ask them for information very quickly. I convey my thanks to Rod Carn and the staff in the Serjeant-at-Arms Office for all the work that they do. My thanks to

It is a very delicate job liaising between the government and the opposition, but Tony, of course, does it well. To Dalma, with her imminent retirement: thank you very much for everything you have done. I am sure you are going to enjoy some different experiences outside of here and will get to wear some different clothes for a change from what we always see you in. Our thoughts are with you as you move into the next stage of your life. You never know where we might see you around the building in some sort of continuing capacity.

                                        We are very reliant on the staff of the Parliamentary Library. We put upon them unreasonable deadlines for huge amounts of information, and they very often come up with the goods. They do not often disappoint. They are under special strain, given the limitations of their resources, but they do manage to work magic for the opposition, and I thank them very much.

That is because we have had a parliamentary intern, Mette Hansen, working with us. Mette is Danish and has been completing a parliamentary research project in our office. I thank Mette for everything she has done, completely unpaid. I would have to say that in the recent period she has learnt some amazing things about Australian political life. Whether they will be the sorts of stories we want told overseas, I am not sure; but I thank Mette for all the work that she has done.

My thanks also go to Silvana Anthony, who has terrified the tactics committee into submission but has done a tremendous job each and every day. To Lesley Russell, who has been with me for a considerable period—I have always said that if I had to choose between Lesley and the whole health department, I would pick Lesley—my thanks go to her for all her hard work. My thanks to Rondah Rietveld, who travels extensively with me and who works on some very important parts of the portfolio and important parts of the work that I do travelling around the country. I would also like to thank my electorate office staff who do such a great job for me in the electorate of Lalor and who are well respected by the people there. My thanks to the Fitzgerald sisters—Michelle and Vicki—both of whom work in my office and who are referred to by me as ‘bad Fitzy’ and ‘good Fitzy’. I will let people work out which one is which. My thanks also go to Carlos Baldovino, who has been with me since the start, to John Ballestrino, and to our newest addition, Rachael Purcell. They all do a tremendous job.

To Bruce, Brian and Lupco: thank you very much for everything you do. I do not know how you manage to keep even the most vaguely interested look on your face, hour after hour—but, remarkably, you do. I have never seen an attendant sleeping in a chair, and you would forgive them for sleeping through most of it. Thank you very much.

They have been mentioned individually by a number of speakers previously, and I want to add my thanks to theirs. In particular at this end-of-year time I want to thank the parliamentary leadership team of the Liberal Party. I thank the Prime Minister, who has given outstanding leadership, not only to the Liberal Party but to the country, over the last 10 years. I think history will judge this period of Australia’s experience very well indeed. When it does, people will realise the leadership that the country has had. I thank

This is a very brutal place.

I do not know how you get to vote at election time. In fact, you probably vote informal, just to make sure that you show no bias towards either side of this chamber! It has never occurred to me that the advice you give would be other than scrupulously honest, and I thank you for that. A great credit to you too, Mr Speaker, for all of the work that you have done through the year, for which I thank you. I hope on occasion I have even entertained you in the chamber with some of my dance routines!

It came home to me when we put on the G20 summit in Melbourne just how admired the Treasury is. Martin Parkinson and his team put together the best G20 summit there has been, by general acclaim. All of the staff that work for the Treasury are fine people whom I want to thank very deeply.

                                           Christmas is the celebration of the birth of Christ, which I believe to be probably the great turning point of history. I think this event changed history for the better. I think Christ and his teachings have changed the world in a way no other person has. Not only do we commemorate the birth of Christ but we use that great event to remember our own families. Our community draws its strength from relationships—within families, between neighbours, through voluntary organisations—and countless people who build relationships in countless ways. Volunteers serve the community and make it stronger; they make the community and the society. The relationships of families, neighbourhoods, streets, suburbs, towns, cities, regions and the nation give strength to our society.

You come into this place and you spend a lot of time here and you do not realise how much strain it places on the family. You are away doing things that interest you, and they are at home without the support of one of the parents. Those of us who are in public life do not really realise the strain it puts on those who are close to us. In all of their dealings and relationships, they are subject to your reputation and to your exposure.

                                            I think it is a very important time for us all to reflect on the great things about Australia. At this time, I feel particularly for those people who are going to volunteer in so many different capacities over the summer period. Most importantly right now, they are the firefighters. I want to say to them that we know that this will be a very tough summer for them. For many of them, it may be the case that they will not get the opportunity to spend it with their families. I want to send a particular message to them. They are fighting fires in a part of Victoria where I grew up. I know it very well. It is a very beautiful part of Australia that is being ravaged by fire yet again. You would all know that I am also a bit of a maniac when it comes to bodysurfing, so the other volunteers who always come to my mind at this time of the year are those who make sure we do not get into too much trouble in the surf. I think these two groups of people often come to mind as encapsulating what it means to be Australian. These people are prepared to put their own lives at risk, often in very dangerous circumstances, in the sea or in a fire, and I do think it is wonderful that we have so many people who are prepared to do so much for other people.

                                            It has been a tough week; there is no question about that. The Treasurer summarised it pretty well. Unfortunately, that is the nature of politics, but one of the things I think we can be very proud of in Australia is that, even though it is tough, we do it in a way that leaves all of us able to continue as decent human beings. First of all, let me particularly congratulate Kevin and Julia. I know that they have taken on the leadership of the Labor Party in a most energetic way. They intend to take the fight right up to the government over the next 12 months, and we in the Labor Party will be there with them to make sure we are on the other side of the chamber come next Christmas.

Let me say also that I will continue to be there for them. The most difficult thing that has happened this week has been with
                                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Beazley" rel="nofollow">

                                            and also his staff. I will say a few things about Kim’s staff first. I think many people never see the enormous amount of work that is done, particularly in the leader’s office, and I am sure it is the same in the Prime Minister’s office. Kim Beazley had the most extraordinary group of people working for him. I want to place on the public record my personal thanks for their enormous dedication to this great party of ours and to the broader labour movement. Over the last few years, Kim’s office has been second to none. There are so many of them I cannot name them all, but I do particularly want to pay tribute to David Fredericks. He is really a most outstanding human being.

                                           <p>
                                            Their efforts and their extraordinary decency were certainly every day evident to me. I will certainly convey tomorrow everybody’s fond wishes and thoughts to Kim Beazley and his family. Probably, as much as thinking about Kim at this time, we think about his parents. David lived with Kim’s mum and dad, so this must be an extraordinarily difficult time for them. I just know that they will get some strength from the great kindness that everybody is showing to them through these comments that have been made tonight.

                                            The thing about Kim Beazley that I want to remark upon is that, in the time that I have been here, which is the last 10 years, we have turned to Kim Beazley in our most dark hours for the Labor Party. In 1996, of course, we were badly defeated, and we turned to Kim Beazley. He demonstrated his extraordinary capacity to campaign against the government. At the next election we won 20 seats, and we won the popular vote. That result was a demonstration of Kim’s leadership capacity.
                                           </p>
                                           <p>
                                            I suppose the time that I remember as much as any other is that period after September 11 in 2001. It was a terrifying time for the world because none of us knew what else might happen. We went into an election with bombs dropping on Afghanistan and at a time when the Australian people were frightened. Kim Beazley brought the Labor Party back from the brink. We were facing a very significant defeat, in large part because of the community’s desire to stick with people whom they knew. They obviously felt that very deeply. At this important time for Kim, we have to remember what he did for us, and that was to bring us very close to victory in that most extraordinarily frightening time. We recognise his great leadership in achieving everything he did in that period. He achieved that because the Australian people saw him—and continue to see him—as one of the most decent politicians that this country has ever had. At those frightening times, they want to know that there is somebody at the top who they are going to be able to trust when things go really bad, as they certainly had in the United States in 2001.

                                            had to retire due to illness. Once again, we turned to Kim to lead us after a very difficult period and to bring us together. He has managed to bring our party together, which needed to be done. We are all—and this goes for everybody in the party, those who voted for him and those who voted against him in the leadership ballot earlier this week—terribly sad at his departure because of the enormous contribution to Australia, to the Labor Party and to so many of us individually.

                                            I join with both Kevin and Julia to wish the Prime Minister and all members of the government all the best for Christmas. I will not go through all of the parliamentary staff, because there are so many of you. I do not need to repeat it—you know how much we rely on you and how much we appreciate what you do. There is one group that has not been mentioned so far, which might indicate a lack of attention by the leader and the deputy leader. Some of you would know that I spend a lot of time in the swimming pool early in the morning. The people in the gym help us keep some measure of fitness in this ridiculous job that we have.
                                           </p>
                                           <p>
                                            Mr Speaker, we know that we give you a tough time. Unfortunately, I have to say that that will continue. Be that as it may, we respect both you personally and your office, and that is the most important thing—and we will continue to do so. I am sure that you will be able to have a break over Christmas and I hope that you will come back refreshed like the rest of us.
                                           </p>

                                            I want to make a quick mention of another group that has not had any attention yet. All of the portfolios that I have held have required me to work very closely with state ministers. It is the case at the moment that they are all Labor. Particularly the state ministers for education and training—and I could single out a number of others—have been extraordinarily helpful. When you are in opposition that can be very useful. In the schools sector, there are so many different organisations that I could not possibly seek to mention them all, but I want to highlight the great role that teachers play in our community. They get pilloried by so many different people. I know that all of us who are parents rely on teachers to help us develop our children. They are up there with some of the best people in Australia. They are not just hardworking men and women; they are dedicated to the future of the next generation.
                                           </p>
                                           <p>
                                            I have done some pretty significant policy work this year. I want to single out the vice-chancellors of our universities, who have been enormously helpful to me personally in the development of that work. We have not had that sort of thought go into higher education reform for the last 20 years, and I know that we would not have been able to put this policy work together without the enormous input of those vice-chancellors.

                                            I want to thank all the members of the education unions. Julia just mentioned the attention that both

                                            As I said before in talking about Kim Beazley’s personal staff, our staff really do provide the most dedicated service to us. Given what is happening to me personally, everybody has been very nice to me. Of course, in these changeovers, if I can put it that way, our staff are also very deeply affected because of the dedication that they show. I want to say how much I appreciate everything that all of my staff have done. I will talk about my staff here in Canberra first of all. David, my chief of staff, Jim McMorrow, Nick Talbot, Ryan Batchelor and Moksha Watts are an extraordinary group of people who are totally dedicated to the Labor Party but who have been an absolute rock of support for me, particularly this week.
                                           </p>
                                           <p>
                                            Others have mentioned their electorate office staff. Not only have I been the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party for five years, with three leaders, which has taken some stamina, but I have a marginal seat. It requires fabulous staff in your electorate when you are carrying the load of the deputy leader. To Vicky, Irene, Jessica, James and Ann—all of you are able to do the job in the electorate that makes sure that all of the people of Jagajaga know that we are there for them. Of course, we cannot do it without the support of large numbers of volunteers and branch members.

                                            Finally, to my family, it is extraordinary when your children basically grow up during the time that you are in the parliament, and that is what has happened to me. I guess that is the thing that I feel the most about—you are not there to see them grow up. I have been quite good so far emotionally. I probably should not talk too much about them.

                                                . I certainly am looking forward to a break. It is going to be a time to reflect and to think about the service that I intend to give to this great party of ours and this great country of ours. I think on our side of the parliament we take very much to heart our responsibility for the fight that we think needs to be taken up to protect the dignity of working people. It is in our minds a very deep responsibility and we intend to pursue that with great vigour.

                                                Finally, the thing I would say about Christmas time, just to return to my theme at the start, is that it is a time to think about those people who are doing it very tough. We had a barbecue today for St Vincent de Paul. I thank everybody who made generous donations. It is a time to think, to give and to do what we can for those in difficulty, but it is also a time to think about how we can live more peacefully together, whether it is within our own homes, in our local communities or, more broadly, in the world. For me that is what Christmas is all about.

                                                <p>
                                                 I acknowledge the passionate and heartfelt contribution from the member for Jagajaga. I accept that she and others on the opposition benches have had a traumatic week. I do acknowledge how hard it must have been for them, particularly for the member for Brand and the member for Jagajaga, and I sympathise with them. This is a rugged, brutal business and people go through a lot of personal pain. It is a pity that it has to be that way but so far no-one has come up with a better alternative.

                                                 Could I say in response that we all take our duties very seriously here. I would not like there to be the slightest hint that one side is more concerned about the underprivileged than the other. We express our concerns differently and certainly we have different views about the sorts of policies which will best help those who are doing it tough, but I would not like, even at this time of goodwill, any suggestion to be made unchallenged that one side of the parliament is more concerned about those who are doing it tough than the other.

                                                 It is impossible to adequately thank all who have contributed to us in this place. Suffice to say that we are all the product of the hard work, the commitment and the love of so many other human beings. I would like to acknowledge that in my own case and apologise for the fact that very few of them ever get the thanks that they really deserve.

                                                 I wish simply in these few remarks to thank those who I ought to thank in my capacity as Leader of the House. May I begin by saying that I suppose one of the nice things about this time of the year is that all of us do for a few moments accept that members opposite are human beings with strengths as well as weaknesses, and I do hope that that spirit survives well into the new year, although I rather doubt that it will.

                                                 Mr Speaker, you have an incredibly difficult job. Members on this side of the House want you to be our supporter. Members on the other side of the House are convinced that you are our supporter. In fact, your job is to be fair and impartial. I think you discharge that difficult responsibility pretty well and I thank you for your efforts.
                                                </p>
                                                <p>
                                                 I think that the real pillars of this parliament are the clerks, who love our traditions and honour them in ways that we do not always. I really appreciate their hard work, their insights and their commitment, and I state that this place would be infinitely the less but for their work. They are the guardians of our traditions and they discharge that role extremely well.

Thanks for everything you do to keep the large egos of this place in check and constructively contributing; and I thank their staff, who have to do a lot of very hard work.

                                                 I pay tribute to the member for Lalor, who has been promoted. I think she has been justifiably promoted. She is a significant political talent. I have always got on with her extremely well in her capacity as Manager of Opposition Business. She, like others here, has the public image of a very steely politician. She is a tough politician but she is also a constructive and cooperative colleague where that is necessary; and on those few occasions when we have interacted socially I have found her to be a genial companion.

                                                 We come to the end of a long and hard political year. May God bless us all, may God bless our country and may the holiday season refresh and renew our energies so that we can all be our best selves in 2007. Finally, none of us could be here but for the forbearance of our families. Families are the unseen, unacknowledged victims of political life. I thank my wife and my kids for putting up with an absent father and husband, and for the fact that the burdens of politics make me far less a family man than I should be.

                                                  I am going to make some brief remarks. I am going to omit so many people whom I should readily acknowledge, so I apologise for that. I particularly wanted to start with the contribution that Dalma Dixon has made to this place. Whips work with the Serjeant in many aspects, but I would never have been able to organise offices and seating arrangements without her unstinting advice and experience. She made something that is quite difficult a very easy exercise. She has a great personality and takes her job very seriously but does it with great flair. I sincerely thank her for her contribution to this parliament. I am still in shock about the fact that she is resigning.

                                                  and the member for Shortland, and the staff in my office. Without a doubt, it is really Anna George who is the Chief Opposition Whip. She makes all the critical decisions and smooths out all the rough edges. I thank Joy Brogan, Matthew Tredwell and, in my electorate,

The only thing that we have to trade is our word, and I must say that has been sufficient. I thank him for his cooperation. Unfortunately, I disagree with the Prime Minister. I think he drives a very hard bargain. My reputation is not quite what it would be, I feel, if he had a more generous spirit towards the opposition.

I wish to thank them for their assistance and cooperation, but I do wish all the very best to all members of this House and to all the people who work in this House. Whilst we, the members of parliament, have the focus on us, it is the people behind the scenes who really do all the hard yards. I also mention that Nathan, in the Parliamentary Liaison Office, is temporarily leaving us. Thank you, Nathan, for your contribution.

                                                   <p>
                                                    On behalf of the crossbenches—my colleagues the member for Calare and the member for Kennedy—I would like to wish everybody a very happy Christmas and urge everyone to remember what the Christmas period actually recognises. I would like to say a few words for the benefit of those listening. I have sat here since the Prime Minister started the debate this afternoon and I think people get a different view of politicians if they listen to a debate like this. A lot of speakers before me reflected on the contribution made by their families, others within the community and within the building, their own personal staff, their electoral staff et cetera. It gives a little snapshot of the humanity that is in this place. People in here are decent people; they are here for a reason. I think the Westminster system does have some problems structurally in that it is built on conflict, in a sense, and your job, Mr Speaker, is to referee the two sides of the conflict. Most people are here with genuine views on the way they see the country going forward.
                                                   </p>
                                                   <p>
                                                    I have a saying that I use from time to time, particularly with young people in schools, and that is: the world is run by those who turn up. What we see in the parliament are people who have taken the time to turn up, get involved and try to make our world a better world. Too often we reflect on the negatives, but we are very lucky in this country to have a democratic system where people can, from all walks of life, turn up and be involved in the political process and influence the outcomes and at least have a say. In many other parts of the world we do not have a structure that can do that.

                                                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Price" rel="nofollow">

Anna has been very good to us, so I ask you to pass on my regards and those of my chief of staff, Graham, as well. I am sure I speak for Mr Andren and Mr Katter at the same time.

                                                    , Ian and Bernard, and the staff have been complimented here today and I think they recognise how important they are to the operation of this building. On a personal basis I do thank you for the help you have given through the year. I extend my thanks to all the people who work within the building. You do a tremendous job. I have been in two parliaments now. I was in the state parliament for 10 years, and one of the lasting memories that I do have—the member for Cook was in the same building and I am sure he shares similar feelings—is that the people who work within these buildings are very special people. They have a professional commitment to the operation of the democratic process, and I do thank them.

                                                    I would particularly like to thank the Parliamentary Library for the work they do. They are invaluable to me as an Independent member of parliament. I look back on my days in the state parliament and I look at the resource that is here, and the library is probably the most valuable resource that a member of parliament can have. The people in that library are absolutely excellent.
                                                   </p>
                                                   <p>
                                                    To my own staff and to my family I say thank you. I am sure that Mr Andren and Mr Katter would reinforce that to their loved ones and staff as well. As I speak, my wife is at a school function—as the spouses of many members of parliament would be, representing not only them but also the structure of the parliamentary process. I thank all the people who assist us and wish you all, particularly you, Mr Speaker, a restful Christmas season. May we come back with a little change in our hearts, particularly reflecting the addresses in the last hour and a half of this debate. May it reflect in the political debate next year and going into the next election.

First of all, it is a very great honour to be able to serve the House as the Speaker and to be able to work with so many wonderful people. People on both sides have so much to contribute not only to this place but also to our nation. It is something that we should never sell ourselves short on. Everyone in this building—and we know some 3,000 people work in this building—makes a very special contribution. That is why our parliament is highly respected, not only within the nation but indeed internationally. We should remind ourselves of that even though on so many occasions we do tend, as has been said, to have some robust debates.

I would also like to add my remarks to those of others to say a very big thankyou to Dalma Dixon as she retires in a week’s time and to say what a wonderful job she has done and how much we have appreciated the warmth of her support. She has always been willing to assist all members in their work.

All the attendants look after us very well, but Luch has been very special in the way he has assisted me as the Speaker and I would like to acknowledge that.

As we are approaching Christmas I would like to wish everyone and their families a very merry Christmas. We all know how important Christmas is to the family, but we also recognise the importance of Christmas. I know everyone is looking forward to a well-deserved break. I hope everyone makes the most of that and will be able to come back next year refreshed.
