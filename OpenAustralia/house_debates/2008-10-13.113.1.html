        I rise today to call on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Premier of South Australia
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Rann" rel="nofollow">
         Mike Rann
        </a>
        , to apologise to the Berghofer family in my electorate of Maranoa. I should provide the House with a brief explanation as to why I am calling on the Premier to apologise.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2001, the Queensland government imposed a moratorium to prohibit the construction of any infrastructure which diverted water from floodplains and river systems. This prohibition was further strengthened in 2003, when the Queensland and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        premiers signed the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paroo_River" rel="nofollow">
         Paroo River
        </a>
        intergovernmental agreement, further preventing any new developments on the Paroo River, which flows from south-western Queensland to northern New South Wales.
       </p>
       <p>
        In August this year, a scientist from the University of New South Wales, Richard Kingsford, wrongly claimed satellite imagery showed illegal water diversion structures on a particular property located on the Paroo River near Eulo, in my electorate of Maranoa. How could a scientist—any scientist for that matter—who prides themselves on the accuracy of their research allow such a misrepresentation to continue without correction or clarification? Once Mr Kingsford’s claim was broken to the media, mini hysteria ensued, leading to the Premier of South Australia’s rather sensationalist comment that anyone illegally taking water from the Murray-Darling system was ‘engaging in an act of terrorism against the people of Australia’.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just after Premier Rann’s comment about terrorism, which I admit may have been misconstrued by the media, I met with Jake Berghofer and other members of the community when I was visited Eulo in mid-August. Jake had been targeted by the media and was understandably quite distressed. He maintained that he had done nothing wrong and had simply been repairing his structures. Jake claimed he was working well within his rights and he was. I believed him because I have confidence in the integrity of farmers in Maranoa. Indeed, I have confidence in farmers across Australia because they are often our most responsible managers of the environment. Australian farmers will continually adapt to changes in climate, they will always be looking for more efficient practices and they are always looking to reduce their environmental impact.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jake Berghofer is one such farmer. In fact, his farming practices are so efficient that when a team from the Queensland
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Natural_Resources_and_Water" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Natural Resources and Water
        </a>
        went out to inspect his property a week or so ago, not only did they clear him of any wrongdoing but they actually commended him on the efficiency of his farming practices. I have the proof right here in an excerpt from the media release by the Queensland Minister for Natural Resources and Water on Thursday of last week. It said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Indeed, investigators found that the property owner had taken steps and made investments to make more efficient use of his available water.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a very important statement. The minister then says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is something I would encourage every irrigator across the Nation to do.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is an overwhelming endorsement of Jake Berghofer’s commitment to sound environmental management.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity to thank a few people who managed to stay rational during this time of media hype and accusations—wrong accusations—from scientists and none other than the Premier of a state of Australia. Firstly, I thank accused farmer Jake Berghofer, who, despite being vilified by the national media, remained composed and dignified throughout what would have been a very upsetting time for him and his young family. I thank the community of Eulo, who supported Jake through this tough time and were rightly quick to proclaim his innocence. Finally, I thank the Queensland government, the Department of Natural Resources and Water and the minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Wallace" rel="nofollow">
         Craig Wallace
        </a>
        , who, despite also being accused of breaching the moratorium, did not engage in finger pointing. Instead, they got on with the job of inspecting the property—doing a visual inspection with a team of government officials on the property—and making sure nothing illegal was going on.
       </p>
       <p>
        The current crisis of the lower Murray has only been exacerbated by petty politics, exaggerated media reports, unfounded science and Armageddon-like predictions. This is a real crisis in the lower Murray and the Premier of South Australia, Premier Rann, is doing nothing to help solve it by making inflammatory claims. The people of South Australia and the Murray-Darling Basin deserve calm, rational discussion, debate and solutions, not absurd comparisons with terrorism.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Premier" rel="nofollow">
         The Premier
        </a>
        has a role to play. He should apologise unreservedly to this wonderful farming family, the Berghofer family on the Paroo River at Eulo.
