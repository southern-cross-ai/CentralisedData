       <p>
        I have two 'golden girls' in my electorate of Lindsay: Jess and Noemie Fox, who are proudly gold medallists and champions. I've known them both since they were little girls, and they've grown up to become inspiring women. Jess won two gold medals, one in the K1 women's and one in the C1, and Noemie beat her big sister in the kayak cross to take out the gold medal. Not only are they wonderful Olympic champions; they are inspiring the next generation of young sportspeople coming through the ranks of

        </a>
        . Jess and Noemie Fox have two proud parents: their dad, Richard, who was the Australian coach; and their very own coach, their mum, Myriam. They've been right behind them, as have our whole community; they have been behind these two young women from the very day they started their great careers.

         Penrith Whitewater Stadium

        is an Olympic legacy; it was built for the Sydney 2000

        . That's where these two women as well as all our Olympians have trained, and that's where our future Olympians are training now. We're so fortunate to have that stadium. I'm glad that in 2019, as an election commitment, I made further investment into futureproofing that stadium for future generations.

        Congratulations, girls. All of Penrith is behind you 100 per cent.

         I just remind the member for Hunter not to stand until the time has expired, rather than 10 seconds before.
