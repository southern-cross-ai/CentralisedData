        The COVID-19 pandemic has certainly brought its challenges, and it is so important to note when it also presents opportunity and to pay homage to those who seize it. Producer and songwriter Tristen Bird, son of

        n music icon Dean Bird, returned home to South Australia after 15 years on the Melbourne music scene and is now based on the

        . Tristen's productions are regularly aired on Australian radio through the ABC and on community radio. Tristen has respected Australia, showcasing in Nashville at the AMERICANAFEST music conference and the Sounds Australia live music export program.

        I recently visited Tristen's new recording studio, Palomino Sound Recorders, thoughtfully located in the old Myponga Market building, and it's co-located with so many other cool businesses, including Valley of Yore cafe. It is a truly exciting place. Tristen shared with me that it wouldn't have been possible to establish a studio of this standard anywhere else. His coming home has represented and presented so many opportunities, and I look forward to seeing his plans for expansion and for live music events to come to fruition. Many talented sons and daughters of Mayo have returned home where they have seized opportunities, and I welcome them with open arms and thank them for their investment in our community.
