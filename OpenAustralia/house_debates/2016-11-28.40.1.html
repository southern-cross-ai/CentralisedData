        Today we remember the all-too-short life of Brisbane teenager Tyrone Unsworth. As members may be aware, last week it was reported in

I hope all members will agree that there is no place for bullying and harassment of people in schools, workplaces and the community. For all young LGBTI children who are experiencing bullying and harassment, we should work to stop it and encourage resilience, because your life will be incredible and filled with incredible experiences and people who love you and care about you. You will realise your ambitions and dreams, because every day of your life you will—
