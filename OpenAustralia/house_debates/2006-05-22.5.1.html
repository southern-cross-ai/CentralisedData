       <p>
        The visit to ADF units in the Middle East area of operations formed part of the committee’s wider program of inspections to Defence Force units and Defence Force industry sites. Where it is practical, the committee has also sought to visit
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADP" rel="nofollow">
         ADP
        </a>
        personnel while they conduct operations. In recent years the committee has visited Australian forces in Afghanistan,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
         East Timor
        </a>
        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Islands" rel="nofollow">
         Solomon Islands
        </a>
        . The delegation had three specific aims in undertaking the visit to the Middle East. Its primary purpose was to demonstrate the parliament’s strong bipartisan support, and the support of the Australian community, for Defence Force personnel deployed on this demanding operation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Secondly, the visit allowed the members of the delegation to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the situation in Iraq and the tasks being undertaken by Australian personnel and the suitability of the training and equipment they receive. Finally, the delegation, in meeting with the Speaker of the Iraqi Transitional National Assembly, became the first delegation from the Australian parliament to the Transitional National Assembly of Iraq, supporting Australia’s engagement with the newly democratic nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The comprehensive delegation itinerary allowed the members to achieve each of these aims. Exposure to this range of issues and experiences could only be achieved as a result of a very well orchestrated program. The delegation thanks the Australian Defence Force for developing and coordinating a visit program that ensured the safety of delegates while giving them exposure to a wide range of personnel and locations. In particular, the delegation thanks the Australian National Commander in the Middle East, then Commodore Geoff Ledger, for his hosting of the delegation throughout the visit. Commodore Ledger provided the delegation the benefit of his considerable experience throughout the visit, leaving the members confident in the leadership and organisation of the Australian Joint Task Force in Iraq.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee would also like to thank Australian Embassy staff in the Middle East for supporting the program. In particular, the delegation thanks Dr Ralph King in Kuwait and Mr Howard Brown in Iraq. Both of these experienced officials operate under some of the most demanding conditions experienced by Australian government personnel anywhere in the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee returned from the visit extremely impressed by the dedication and professionalism of the Australian Defence Force personnel conducting operations in this demanding, often hostile, environment. Australian personnel are working closely with the emerging Iraqi institutions and personnel, showing compassion in their daily dealings with the local people and considerable restraint when called upon to apply force. They are performing with distinction and have earned the respect and admiration of both the coalition and Iraqi forces with whom they are working. All Australians should be proud of the achievements of the ADF on operations in the Middle East and the contribution they are making to the reconstruction of Iraq. I also thank the staff of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade who helped with the organisation and the preparation of the report.

         The visit of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to our troops in Iraq continues a long tradition of members of this House supporting our troops on the ground and follows a similar trip to Afghanistan a couple of years ago. I have a strong view, shared by others on this side, that regardless of the deployment or its political support we should show support for our troops on deployment and for their families back here in Australia. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
          ALP
         </a>
         ’s support for our troops on the ground in Iraq is without question, and I believe our recent trip to Iraq demonstrated that support. Indeed, I know our troops on the ground appreciated the parliament’s bipartisan support for them.
        </p>
        <p>
         It was a delight for me to visit all of our troops on deployment. Navy,

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
          Middle East
         </a>
         are doing a splendid job, and they are worthy of our praise, recognition and support. It was a particular delight for me to visit our troops at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Muthanna" rel="nofollow">
          Al Muthanna
         </a>
         and Camp Smithy and to spend a night with our troops there.
        </p>
        <p>
         I particularly want to express my appreciation to Colonel Roger Nobel,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commanding_Officer" rel="nofollow">
          Commanding Officer
         </a>
         of the

          AMTG
         </a>
         , for his leadership and for the manner in which he led his troops—for the very high value he placed on their safety, while at the same time doing the job. I also want to recognise Major Mick Garraway
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OC" rel="nofollow">
          OC
         </a>
         of the 5/7 blokes who were deployed to Al Muthanna and compliment him on his leadership and professional ability. I wish both of these soldiers long and distinguished careers in the ADF, because Australia needs men of their calibre in our armed forces.
        </p>
        <p>
         Make no mistake: these blokes have done a great job. Certainly leadership and management of the troops and the task in Iraq has been difficult. Difficult terrain, difficult climatic conditions and man management challenges have made this a hard task. But these blokes have been up to the job—a job made more difficult because of the fact that an undermanned force was deployed initially. The Defence Subcommittee was made aware of this fact in Australia and it was confirmed to us by senior officers in Iraq.
        </p>
        <p>
         The situation has now been addressed, but it astounded me to learn that the force that was sent to Al Muthanna was undermanned and, because it was undermanned, needlessly exposed our troops to greater danger than should have been the case. For instance, when troops were sent on leave or were otherwise unavailable for duties, the burden placed on those left to do the job became more onerous and more dangerous. As I said, our troops did the job, but in so doing they were exposed to unnecessary hardship, which could have led to greater exposure to danger and mistakes. The fact is that it is a credit to the blokes in the way that they did the job that they made up for these gaps.
        </p>
        <p>
         It was also interesting to visit Baghdad and a great privilege to visit our close protection and other troops there. Indeed, the close protection support we received during the whole of our stay was magnificent. At no stage did I feel in danger or at risk. Our close protection troops in Baghdad are doing an absolutely magnificent job, and there is no doubt that as long as we have ambassadorial staff in Baghdad our troops will be needed to protect them. All of our troops in Iraq work in a dangerous and exposed environment, but we draw comfort for their safety because of their true professionalism, their courage, their dedication and their leadership and because they hold the highest traditions of the Anzacs close to their hearts.
        </p>
        <p>
         Having said that, I want to see our troops brought home. It was clearly explained to us by senior Australian Defence members that the job at Al Muthanna is done. Senior officers have that view, and it is a view I share. I say: bring our troops home. I say that because it is evident to me that if our troops are not returned home then they will be redeployed to some other hot spot in Iraq. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM" rel="nofollow">
          PM
         </a>
         said he would bring them home when the job was done. They have done the job and the PM should live up to his word and bring them home. I thank all of those members of the ADF who hosted us, made us safe and who represent Australia in such a way as to enhance our reputation as a nation in the strongest and bravest possible way.
