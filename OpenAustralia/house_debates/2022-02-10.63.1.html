        she received a threatening phone call from a government funded agency. Can the Prime Minister guarantee the results of his so-called investigation into this threatening call will be released or will he sweep it under the carpet, hide from the truth—as he has done before—and fail to take any real action?

          The imputation in the back end of that question is against the standing orders. It's a reflection on the Prime Minister. It was an unsubstantiated flourish, which might've sounded okay in the tactics meeting this morning but it's against the standing orders and it should be ruled out of order.

            Thanks, Mr Speaker. On the point of order: the question asks will the Prime Minister release or will he, in the alternative, follow a different path. It's for the Prime Minister in his answer to make clear which he will do. If the Leader of the House is wanting to argue, as I think he just did, that there's no occasion where the Prime Minister has ever swept something under the carpet then I think we are pretty much in the land of irony.

             Standing order 90 prevents members from reflecting on other members. I am going to allow the question. Whilst it's sailing close to the wind, I think it is in order. I will give the call to the Prime Minister.

             <p>
              Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am happy to affirm, once again, as I did in issuing a statement this week, that I have not and would not authorise any such actions, and at all times have sought to treat Ms Tame with dignity and respect. The first I became aware of that allegation was during the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Press_Club" rel="nofollow">
               Press Club
              </a>
              address when it was delivered. Ms Tame should always be free to speak her mind in my view and conduct herself as she chooses. I have made no criticisms of Ms Tame, her statements or her actions.
             </p>
             <p>
              While Ms Tame has declined to name the individual, I would advise her to at least advise the government which government funded agency she is referring to. The Australia Day Council has issued a statement saying they had no knowledge of any such interaction and would be pleased to pursue the matter if we had some knowledge of even the agency that is being referred to. Those comments were not made. I can't establish them. They were not made on my behalf, nor would they ever be. They were not made with my knowledge in any way, shape or form, or by my office. I and my government consider the actions and statements of the individual, as it was explained, as absolutely unacceptable. Inquiries can only be made where we can be directed. Those inquiries should be seeking to get answers to the matters that have been raised and if anyone has any information on that then I would encourage them to bring it forward so the matter can be properly addressed.
             </p>
