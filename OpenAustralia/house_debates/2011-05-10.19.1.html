        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. Will the minister confirm that during the 11 days that detainees were on the roof of the

        they were free to come down from the roof, including to charge their mobile phones, and then allowed to return without interference from Serco staff, Immigration staff or the

         I thank the honourable member for his question. In fairness, the honourable member has criticised me in recent weeks about this event, which I acknowledge. It appears that the honourable member for Cook, if he were to hold the office that I hold, would ignore the advice of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         that it would have been unsafe for the Australian Federal Police to get on the roof to remove the detainees who were protesting.

          Mr Speaker, on a point of order: it was a very specific question. Were they allowed to come down from the roof and then go back without interference?

           I would suggest that this is an occasion when, if people would stop

            interjecting

           and actually listen, they might actually receive a response to their question.

           All the interjections upon my utterances are well and truly appreciated, but it would help from time to time if ministers were heard in silence when responding.

            As I was saying, the government took the advice of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Federal Police
            </a>
            about how to best manage what was a difficult situation, as I think the member for Cook would do if he were to hold the office I hold. If he were not to do that, if he ignored the advice of the Australian Federal Police, he would not be fit to hold the office that I hold. It was clearly the case, as I have previously said publicly, that the three detainees who were on the roof also accessed the roof cavity. I have said that publicly before. I am sure the member for Cook reads transcripts of my radio interviews. I have also made it clear that I authorised the appropriate use of force if the safety of the officers using the force could be guaranteed and could be justified. I made it very clear that the use of force was authorised by me if appropriate and if regarded by the Australian Federal Police as being safe.
