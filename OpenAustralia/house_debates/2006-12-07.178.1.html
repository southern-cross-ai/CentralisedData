       <p>
        In the past year, I have had the great pleasure of, once again, working closely with many schools and their P&amp;Cs in Bonner. I have come to meet a variety of hardworking teachers, parents and community members who are dedicated to offering our children and young adults the best possible education and learning environment. I am proud to be part of a government that supports the local effort towards this goal.
       </p>
       <p>
        Through the Investing in Our Schools program, I have been able to announce funding for 33 schools in Bonner in the past year alone, and this funding has totalled over $3 million. It is this support that has helped local schools to undertake projects and upgrades that they could not otherwise have achieved on their own. The Investing in Our Schools program focuses on projects that are specific to the special needs of each school community and, as a result, it often helps to bring long-awaited projects to life.

        Just recently I visited Mount Petrie State School in Mackenzie to officially open their new library, which underwent a complete refurbishment thanks to a grant of $120,969 under round 2 of the Investing in Our Schools program. When I first visited the school in early 2005, Principal Michael Cini pleaded with me to find a way to fix the students’ makeshift library, and I am delighted to say that we finally did. Students now have access to a brightly coloured and well-resourced library which not only inspires reading but also has created a new and fresh environment in which the children can actually enjoy learning. Having worked tirelessly with the P&amp;C association for years to try to raise funds for the refurbishment project, the school librarian, Karen Murphy, describes the new library as ‘a dream come true’. Outcomes such as this are delivered through the Investing in Our Schools program. It is a rewarding experience to see the positive change that can be brought to a school environment.

        Last week I announced funding for 21 state schools under round 3 of the program, and I congratulate each of those school communities on their hard work and their successful applications that followed. As a result of this funding, Belmont State School will construct new walkways for students, Carina State School will build much-needed assembly areas, Manly State School will install new playground equipment for students, Marshall Road State School will finally be able to install air conditioning in their hottest classrooms for summer, and Wynnum West State School will upgrade their

        and computer equipment. They are but a few of the examples of the many worthwhile projects that can now be made possible. They will be delivering practical benefits to students and staff.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is nothing more important than a child’s education, and it is important to have the best possible facilities for their support. I am committed to helping the school communities in Bonner and I will continue to promote the Investing in Our Schools program.
