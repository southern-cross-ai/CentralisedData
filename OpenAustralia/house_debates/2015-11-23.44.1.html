        I can feel it in the air tonight! It is called Cyrus Villanueva. Cyrus is a young man who grew up in Dapto in my electorate surrounded by music and a loving family, and tonight Cyrus is going to be singing for his passion and his music as a grand finalist in

        . On stage, Cyrus has captivated his fans not only with his vocal and performing success but with his attitude. James Dinardo, a teacher from Kanahooka, has known Cyrus for many years. He was also his manager at

        It is time for Australia to catch the Cyrus virus and back him when he appears on television tonight.
