        On Sunday, 9 March, the Para Hills Tennis Club celebrated its 50th birthday with an open day at the club's facilities on Liberman Road, Para Hills. The day included children's amusements, a birthday cake, club memorabilia dating back to 1963, friendly tennis games and the reuniting of past and present club members. Amongst those present was Cath Burden who with her late husband Stan, who was the club's first president, were founding club members.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Para Hills Tennis Club has a clubroom and six well-maintained floodlit tennis courts. Over the years it has served as both a local community recreational facility and a successful competitive tennis club with a string of pennants and shields to its name. The club was completely relocated in 1974 when it moved from its original location adjacent to the Para Hills Primary School to its present location and has since then undergone continuous facility upgrades.
       </p>
       <p>
        As with all community groups, the club's existence and the wonderful service it has provided to the local community over the past 50 years are only possible because of the tireless work of the committee members, past and present. I particularly acknowledge and commend current club president Marija Lentic, secretary Cynthia Henderson, and the committee members for organising and hosting the Para Hills Tennis Club's 50th birthday celebrations. It was an important milestone in the club's history and worthy of the terrific effort that went into organising the day.
