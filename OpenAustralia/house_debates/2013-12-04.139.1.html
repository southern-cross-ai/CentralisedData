        Let me take this opportunity, the first one available to me, to congratulate you, Mr Deputy Speaker, on your appointment to the high office that you now hold.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to speak this morning about the significance of the centenary of Anzac and particularly about the work we have underway in Bradfield to centenary of Anzac. This centenary in 2015 is an extremely important national milestone, marking as it does the 100th anniversary of an event of enormous significance to Australia's national identityâ€”the battle on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallipoli_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
         Gallipoli Peninsula
        </a>
        , where the Australian and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        forces came ashore in April 1915. This event is marked on our most important national day of commemoration, Anzac Day and, accordingly, it is of the first importance that we recognise this milestone nationally and also locally.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bradfield has a long military history. There are two battalions associated with the Bradfield area: the 17th Battalion and the 2/18th Battalion, later called the Ku-ring-gai Regiment. The 17th Battalion landed at Anzac Cove in Turkey on 20 August 1915, and for most of its time on the peninsula was responsible for the defence of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quinn's_Post" rel="nofollow">
         Quinn's Post
        </a>
        . The 17th Battalion then proceeded to France and took part in the battle at Pozieres.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our local history, of course, is about more than just these military units; it is also about the contribution made on the home front, including particularly by the Ku-ring-gai Women War Workers, who supplied knitted goods to soldiers fighting abroad, and the Ku-ring-gai
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_Aid_Detachments" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased to note that the Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program introduced by the previous government has been materially increased by the coalition government, with the funding available to each federal electorate increased from $100,000 to $125,000, meaning that there are greater resources available to commemorate appropriately the centenary of Anzac locally.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my electorate of Bradfield we have established the Bradfield Centenary of Anzac Working Party, chaired by Major Rod White AM
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFD" rel="nofollow">
         RFD
        </a>
        , which has been formed to aid local preparations and commemorations, as well as to oversee the allocation of the Anzac Centenary Local grants. Other organisations involved are the Hornsby and Roseville
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        sub-branches, the Ku-ring-gai
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_Society" rel="nofollow">
         Historical Society
        </a>
        , Ku-ring-gai Council and the Ku-ring-gai Creative Arts High School. The working party is doing excellent work in developing plans for the many kinds of commemoratives projects that could be envisaged to recognise the significance of this very important milestone.
       </p>
       <p>
        I conclude by once again calling on community groups in my electorate to apply for funding under the Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program.
