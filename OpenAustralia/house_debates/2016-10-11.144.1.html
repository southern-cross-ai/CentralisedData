       <p>
        Today I would like to speak on one of the most serious health issues this country faces—type 1 diabetes. I would like to share the personal stories of some of my constituents who have type 1 diabetes, to highlight the importance of this issue and to show what this government is doing to support diabetics and their families.
       </p>
       <p>
        Type 1 diabetes is not preventable or curable. It is a chronic, lifelong and life-threatening condition. Type 1 diabetics face a constant struggle to keep their blood sugar levels stable. Without around-the-clock checks, the consequences can be dire. They range from minor complications to something as terrible as passing away in one's sleep from dead in bed syndrome.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many parents have shared with me the stress and anxiety of life with a child with type 1 diabetes. Imagine living with the fear that, every time they go to sleep, your little one might not wake up. One mother wrote to me about the constant battle to keep her two-year-old boy's sugar levels within a safe range. This little boy has to be woken up by his parents several times in the night so they can monitor his blood sugar levels. Another father shared with me how he has to check his six-year-old son three times a night, every night, and spend hours getting his blood sugar back to normal. He gets just 20 minutes of sleep between checks. Just imagine the toll that this would take.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is why I was thrilled when the coalition government announced in May this year that it will invest $54 million to subsidise continuous glucose monitoring technology for children and young adults under 21, to help them manage their type 1 diabetes. Our commitment to subsidise
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGM" rel="nofollow">
         CGM
        </a>
        devices on the National Diabetes Services Scheme will benefit an estimated 4,000 young diabetics. CGM devices help children and their parents monitor blood sugar levels around the clock through a small wearable device that will instantly warn them if glucose levels are getting too low. This removes the need to draw blood through a finger prick multiple times a day.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have received overwhelming support for this initiative from my constituents. One young woman, who has already trialled the technology, told me that it had saved her many, many times. She is able to sleep right through the night for the first time in five years. The peace of mind that CGM devices give to type 1 diabetics is priceless, and I am proud to be part of a government supporting the use of this amazing technology.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am also proud to support initiatives working towards a cure for type 1 diabetics. Recently, I met with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheryl_Burton" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and her 18-year-old son, Joshua. Josh has been living with type 1 diabetes since he was four years old. He is passionate about a cure that would help him, and thousands of others, live a normal life free of finger pricks and the lingering fear that comes with this autoimmune disease. Right now, Josh is fundraising for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JDRF" rel="nofollow">
         JDRF
        </a>
        One Walk. JDRF's mission is to raise funds for scientific research to better treat, prevent and ultimately cure type 1 diabetes. The JDRF One Walk is the world's biggest type 1 diabetes fundraising event, raising over $85 million each year for life-changing research. Well done to Josh for supporting this vital cause, and I wish him all the best in the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        Type 1 diabetes is a chronic, life-threatening disease that, sadly, is too often confused with type 2 diabetes, which is caused by lifestyle factors. I will continue to raise awareness of this condition and I will continue to support this government's effort to support Australians living with type 1 diabetes.
