        there are some innovative people who are achieving remarkable goals in their business operations. Jennie Franceschi, from the Fresh Produce Alliance in Manjimup, is one such person. Jennie recently won the Corporate and Private Award at the 2017 Telstra Australian Business Women's Awards. This accolade followed on from her winning two honours at the state awards earlier in the year—Western Australian Business Woman of the Year and the Corporate and Private Award. Jennie has been in the avocado industry since 1974 when she took her first summer job working in her family's commercial orchard. After opening her own orchard in Pemberton, and becoming active in the WA Avocado Growers Association and Avocado Australia, Jennie and her husband, Wayne, launched their own packing facility—Advance Packing &amp; Marketing Services—with two other growers. In 2011 Jennie began managing the Avocado Export Company, with the objective of increasing Australian avocado exports to help stabilize the Australian domestic market, keeping it a profitable industry for all stakeholders.

        Jennie and Wayne launched the Fresh Produce Alliance in 2016, a processing facility that champions a sustainable agriculture ecosystem.

        started with the vision of reducing the amount of unmarketable fruit and vegetables being wasted, much of it being used for animal feed or discarded. Using innovative technologies such as high-pressure processing and individual quick freeze, they now produce healthy, delicious, real food that is in high demand. Their high-pressure machine was the first to be brought into WA and only the fifth in the nation. Jennie and her team have developed an avocado and baby food range and will soon bring a low-

        range to the market. Their products are available for both the domestic and export markets, and they supply bulk fresh, frozen and pre-packed fruit and vegetables to food service wholesalers. The operation has also been made available to outside entities under a contract service to help them grow their business. Jennie aspires to help growers become more profitable and sustainable and in doing so retain and improve services in Manjimup and the Southern Forests region.

        Jennie's career in the avocado industry over the past 40 years has really made an impact on the agriculture and processing industry. I've visited Jennie's Manjimup operation many times, and she is quite a remarkable woman—not only is she down to earth and hardworking; it is clear she has a wonderful vision and drive for her business. She strives to create a sustainable future through intergenerational farming, sustainable operations, the creation of long-term job opportunities and reduced agricultural wastage. Earlier this year, Jennie took on the role of deputy chair of the South West Development Commission. She also breeds warmblood show jumpers with her youngest daughter. Frankly, I don't know how she manages it all!
       </p>
       <p>
        The Telstra Australian Business Women's Awards highlight women's achievements as business leaders and celebrate the positive results of inclusive leadership. I see Jennie's win as a stellar example of the innovative industry leaders that can be cultivated in our regions. Jennie's achievement has shone the spotlight on regional WA and, in particular, the Southern Forests agriculture sector.
