        It's my favourite time of year again—it's showtime! Ag showtime, that is! Over the last few weeks I have had the absolute pressure of attending some of the wonderful agricultural shows that the New South Wales
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         South Coast
        </a>
        has to offer. As well as being a fun day out, which they absolutely are, these shows instil a sense of pride and cohesion in our region. Sadly, over the last few years many of our local have had to be cancelled due to COVID—necessary, but a real shame because these shows are so important.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2023 I am delighted to say that our shows have come back in force, and if you haven't been to a show on the South Coast—well, you're missing out. So far this year I have been to the Eurobodalla Agricultural Show, the Kiama Show, the Berry Show and the Nowra Show. Each individual show has its own unique character. There are veteran livestock exhibitors with generations of experience, hobby farmers showcasing their skills, and essential service workers like the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFS" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , police and paramedics showing the community what they do best. Bakers of all levels proudly display cakes and treats in the pavilion. Flowers of every colour, shape and size are arranged by careful hands. Next that you'll find any number of magnificent woven, crocheted and knitted items. The technique and patience you need to make some of these things are an absolute feat. That's not even half of it. I could speak all day about the displays.
       </p>
       <p>
        But it isn't just what is on display; it's the faces behind the displays. The stalls at these shows are generally run by volunteer organisations such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_Fire_Service" rel="nofollow">
         Rural Fire Service
        </a>
        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">

        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CWA" rel="nofollow">

        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Lions Club
        </a>
        . And without the mammoth effort of the show society members and volunteers, and local organisations, these shows would not be able to operate. This in itself is a testament to the South Coast community. These shows are so important for families and students in our region. This is plain to see as soon as you walk through the gates. I grew up on a dairy farm just outside of Nowra, and I can tell you right now that the importance of being able to proudly display what you produce cannot be underestimated. Local farmers, students and individuals can spend all year putting their exhibits and entries together. It takes time and it's a real sense of pride and achievement.

        Local people have been doing this for over a century. This year was the 135th year of the Berry Show. There was horse riding, woodchopping, dairy and beef cattle, poultry, and goats—you name it and they had it. It may have been their 135th year, but it was spectacular.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Kiama Show is held on a cliff overlooking the ocean, a true showcase of Kiama's beauty. Every year I proudly sponsor the farmyard nursery, and what a joy it is to see children's faces light up as they get to pat a little goat, cradle a bunny rabbit or hold a tiny piglet. I spent several hours on the show gates on a Saturday morning, and boy, was it busy! It was so great to see so many local people getting involved and helping me to up my wrist-banding skills.
       </p>

        The Eurobodalla Agricultural Show operates from the Moruya Showground. This year I was particularly proud to open their brand-new kitchen, thanks to a $40,000 bushfire recovery grant. As many already know, the Moruya Showground was used as an evacuation centre during the bushfires. I was absolutely delighted to help them get fit-for-purpose kitchen facilities to make sure local people are better prepared for the next disaster.

        Just this weekend was the Nowra Show, where young people and people of all ages show dairy cattle. I met with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nowra_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Nowra High School
        </a>
        senior support class and they were proudly checking out all their prized entries in the pavilion.
       </p>
       <p>
        I sincerely thank all of our show societies and their members, volunteers, organisations, and local farmers for all of their work making our local shows the amazing community celebrations they are. If you didn't get to make it to any of these shows, never fear, because we have two more yet to come. I simply cannot wait for the Kangaroo Valley Show this Friday and Saturday, and Milton on 3 and 4 March. Why not plan a trip to a show on the South Coast over the next few weeks? I guarantee you will not regret it.
