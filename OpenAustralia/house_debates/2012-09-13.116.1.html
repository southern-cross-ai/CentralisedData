        I rise this morning to talk about the wonderful work of the Young Adults Disabled Association, better known as YADA. YADA is a charitable organisation that provides a range of recreational and social support services for people living with disabilities in my local community. Their work is of vital importance, given the fact that my electorate is, unfortunately, overrepresented with families and people who live with disabilities. YADA was started 25 years ago by Jennifer McAlees,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Eastwood" rel="nofollow">
         John Eastwood
        </a>
        and a number of local residents who teamed up to enhance the quality of life for young people with disabilities in a social and friendly environment. Jennifer, who has hydrocephalus and Dandy-Walker syndrome, has taken herself and others living with disabilities on a journey to enhance the quality of their lives, living without isolation. John was a community transport driver at the time and he made it his mission in life to transport members to and from YADA social support activities.
       </p>
       <p>
        This small group, with humble beginnings, has now grown into a large, extended family type organisation. YADA is now a registered charity and driven by the generosity of its many volunteers, who have worked tirelessly to support and assist the disabled in our community. YADA runs a day centre group two days a week for the local community at the local community hall, where people can come to participate in the various activities, including arts, crafts, singing and dancing. It enhances their confidence, living skills and social interaction. It also alleviates and provides some respite to carers of people with disabilities and their families. YADA also provides assistance to many newly arrived migrants in my area. This is very fortunate considering the fact that more than 55 per cent of my electorate was born overseas.
       </p>
       <p>
        Remarkably, the charity is one of the most self-sufficient. Its operational costs are met by offsetting a comprehensive re-use and recycling program. Second-hand goods ranging from clothes and toys to scrap metal and soft drink bottles are carefully sorted, deconstructed and sold at a reasonable price on the second-hand goods market. Although YADA has received federal funding through the New South Wales Department of Ageing, Disability and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Care" rel="nofollow">
         Home Care
        </a>
        in the past, it largely stands on its own two feet. As someone who has long held passionate views about disabilities, I feel very fortunate that, as an organisation, YADA is based in Liverpool and Fairfield local government areas. On behalf of the community, I would like to take the opportunity to thank Jennifer and John for the initiation of this wonderful organisation.
