       <p>
        Two weeks ago, the health minister came to Mandurah to announce a $25 million investment in the Peel Health Campus. The Peel Health Campus was built in 1997, when the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Mandurah" rel="nofollow">
         City of Mandurah
        </a>
        was half the population of today. We are now WA's second-largest city and we continue to grow.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mandurah and the Peel region need more investment in roads, rail and infrastructure, and I've been fighting for and delivering that investment. There was $21.75 million for the Peel Business Park, a big job creator; $5 million for aged care in Pinjarra and Waroona; and now $25 million for the Peel Health Campus, which will deliver a new emergency department, new facilities for radiology and residential care for the treatment of eating disorders. This is the single-biggest investment in the Peel Health Campus since 1997.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's true that the Barnett government overlooked the Peel Health Campus, but the WA Labor government promised to deliver more investment into the Peel region and they've now been in government for two years. The member for Mandurah,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Templeman" rel="nofollow">
         David Templeman
        </a>
        , a state cabinet minister, and therefore close to power, can sing in parliament but he's failed to bring the money into the Peel region. We're still waiting for the $20 million for the Mandurah station car park upgrade.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under McGowan and Templeman, we've only received $5 million for the Peel Health Campusâ€”1.5 per cent of the total WA state health budget. This is a welcome investment, but the Morrison government has delivered five times the amount of investment into health in the Peel health region. So where is WA Labor in the Peel region?
