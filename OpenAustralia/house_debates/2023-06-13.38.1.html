       <p>
        I've been in this place for a little time now, and since I've been here I've always been passionate in raising the issue of primary health care; in particular, Medicare and making sure that people in our communities have access to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        services when they need them. Probably one of the hardest visits I've ever done as a local MP is to go to a local clinic in my electorate. It has a patient load of about 20,000. It's the largest clinic we have. They had the tough decision last year of moving to a private billing model. It meant that a concession card holder would have to pay $69 and get a Medicare rebate but be out of pocket by about $30 to $39, depending. That's tough. Probably the hardest thing I saw was somebody who was there on a disability pension to whom they said, 'Sorry, we can't book your next appointment until you pay that gap fee.' They were like: 'How am I going to pay that? I need to book to see my GP.'
       </p>
       <p>
        So I can tell you how excited I was to meet with them on Friday to discuss our changes that are in the budgetâ€”the tripling of the bulk-billing incentive and what it would mean for their clinic. What's really exciting is that what the GPs at this clinic will get is about $72 per visit. It knocks out the need for charging a gap fee at this centre. I really want to thank the Treasurer. I want to thank the minister for health. I want to thank the government for doing this.
