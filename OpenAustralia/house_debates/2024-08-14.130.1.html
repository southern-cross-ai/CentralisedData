        We are watching a humanitarian crisis in Bangladesh. The degradation of law and order has led to the violent persecution of religious and ethnic minorities. This includes Bangladeshi Hindus, which is the largest religious minority group and make up almost eight per cent of the population.
       </p>
       <p>
        I spoke to members of my local Bangladeshi community in the aftermath of this crisis. Their stories have been deeply moving and their suffering is heart-wrenching. They've spent days praying that sleep is the only thing they will lose, and not their loved ones back home. Australia continues to call for peace in Bangladesh. We will continue to support a democratic and inclusive future for all Bangladeshis and we offer our deepest condolences to the family and friends of all those impacted by this terrible tragedy. I want to acknowledge the work and contributions of the Bangladeshi community in my electorate, in particular Prabir Maitra, Rizwan Chowdhury and Suman Saha.

        The Albanese Labor government has delivered major benefits for our Chinese-Australian community. From 1 July 2024 Australian citizens can travel to China without a visa for up to 15 days. With the mid-autumn festival fast approaching, this policy will help many in our community to reunite with their loved ones in China. Last year, Prime Minister Albanese marked the 50th anniversary of China-Australia relations with an historic visit to China. In June, the Prime Minister also welcomed Premier Li to

         Parliament House
        </a>
        , marking the first visit by a Chinese premier in seven years. Under the Albanese Labor government, we have finally seen positive progress in the Australia-China relationship, delivering new benefits to our local Chinese community.

        Last Friday I attended the Team Simon Foundation for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cystic_Fibrosis" rel="nofollow">
         Cystic Fibrosis
        </a>
        gala. Cystic fibrosis is often called 'the invisible battle'. Every four days a baby is born with cystic fibrosis. The average lifespan of someone who has it is less than half the average lifespan, at just 34 years, and there is currently no cure. No parent wants to hear the words, 'Your child's results have come back. They have cystic fibrosis.' At just 17 months that was exactly what happened to Simon Bazouni's parents. Inspired by his battle, his parents founded the Team Simon Foundation for Cystic Fibrosis in 2018. Since then they have raised more than $570,000 and received more than 790 donations. I want to acknowledge the hard work of Harry, Teresa and Simon Bazouni for their efforts to find a cure for this terrible disease.

        I want to recognise the incredible heritage of Parramatta. On the edge of Parramatta's shining CBD lies three of Australia's oldest and most significant buildingsâ€”
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Farm" rel="nofollow">
         Elizabeth Farm
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiment_Farm" rel="nofollow">
         Experiment Farm
        </a>
        and Hambledon Cottage. These sites, which are within walking distance of each other, tell the story of Australia. Elizabeth Farm was where our Merino wool industry was born. Elizabeth Farm and Experiment Farm are the two oldest standing buildings in Australia. While this area has long been recognised for its historical importance, it's never been added to the National Heritage list. Last month, local heritage groups came together to submit a National Heritage application for this Parramatta heritage precinct. I want to thank all those who have supported this campaign, and look forward to working with you to continue our fight to recognise Parramatta's heritage and preserve these important sites.
