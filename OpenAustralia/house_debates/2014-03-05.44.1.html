        This Tuesday in my electorate of Bendigo the Zonta Club of Bendigo held their annual
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Women's_Day" rel="nofollow">
         International Women's Day
        </a>
        dinner. This year it was attended by over 250 people. Guest speaker Doreen Akkerman AM was inducted into the Victorian Women's Roll of Honour in 2010. In her speech she traced the stages of a woman's life in a humorous presentation called 'We've come a long way, baby'. From all accounts, the inspiring night was full of laughs and good fun, but there was also a serious and important message behind the fun. Ms Akkerman said that it was an important to celebrate the achievements of women but at the same time get the message right to our young girls. She said that we need to teach our young girls that if the prince on a white horse does not come along, you need to be self-sustaining and believe in yourself.

        In my electorate of Bendigo the work on this issue is being done. It is one of the reasons why I am proud to be a member of the Zonta Club of Bendigo. The club's members work tirelessly all year round to advance the status of women, both locally and globally. The money raised from this particular event will go towards the Zonta scholarships program in the region. The yearly scholarships offer financial support for young women in business, public affairs, nursing and years 11 and 12. This group should be commended for the hard work they do all year round, and this International Women's Day I wish to recognise their work in our community.
