       <p>
        I often say in this place that the Labor Party are all about politics over people, and today they have proven this point yet again. Earlier in the House I stood to speak about the importance of supporting Australian families and about how we on this side of the chamber reward their hard work by allowing them to keep more of what they earn. Now, you would think that this would be an issue important to all of our elected representatives. Surely, ensuring families to get ahead is a priority for all of us. Well, not the Labor members opposite. While I was speaking about how the Morrison government is supporting families with tax cuts, childcare subsidies, flexible paid parental leave and infrastructure, the member for Moreton stood up and moved that I no longer be heard. Why? Because Labor are about politics over people. Labor are pranksters, not policymakers. Labor are about jibes, not jobs. Labor are about road-blocking, not road-building. Labor can't be trusted to manage our economy. Labor can't be trusted to come into this place and respect the Australian people.
       </p>
       <p>
        We will continue to respect the Australian people, their hard work, their taxes, their priorities, and no amount of parliamentary gains by Labor today or any other day will distract this government from focusing on the Australian people and what we need to deliver for them.
