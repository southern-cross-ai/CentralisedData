       <p>
        I would like to reflect today on a family that has contributed significantly to the electorate of Brand, to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        and to this nation, Australia. After giving so much and serving this nation for many years, this family faces their greatest challenge. I speak of the family of my predecessor and former member for Brand,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Gray" rel="nofollow">
         Gary Gray
        </a>
        ; his wife, Deborah Walsh; their three sons, Riley, Darcy and Toby; and the entire extended Walsh and Gray families.
       </p>
       <p>
        We members of parliament do not get to this place alone and we are not able to remain in this place alone, although we usually travel here on our own. Those of us from WA and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NT" rel="nofollow">
         NT
        </a>
        have a four-hour flight across the continent, after perhaps a one-hour drive to the airport. That, with the two- or three-hour time difference, keeps us away from our families and friends for that much longer. Our families don't get to hear about our challenging work days over a quiet dinner in private with some reflection. Instead, they get to read about our work day in the newspapers or see it on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
         TV
        </a>
        or social media. Some nasty things are said about politicians and these rough words wound our families and friends, but they withstand them. They put up with a lot for us to be here.
       </p>
       <p>
        We leave our families and friends to be here, but they are always with us. We depend on them for so many things: encouragement, support, a kind word, a hug and especially love. Some families sacrifice more than others to ensure good people represent Australians in this parliament, and Deb Walsh has served this nation and sacrificed more than most for the important cause of a democratic and prosperous Australia. Deb Walsh is the tower of strength behind Gary Gray and his career serving the Labor Party, the community of Brand, the state of Western Australia, and this parliament and this nation as a minister of state. Deb Walsh is a warrior for our Labor cause in the tradition of her father: the great
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Walsh" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Walsh
        </a>
        , the Doodlakine wheat and sheep farmer who became Australia's stellar finance minister in the Hawke government. Deb; her mother, Rosalie Walsh; and her sisters, Karen Whittock, Shelley Birch and Anne Walsh; loaned us Peter Walsh for some years and enabled him to make such a significant contribution to this country. And Deb and her sons loaned us Gary Gray. Her support, inspiration and fight were behind Gary. It enabled him to serve Labor for 42 years as a member, a long-serving Labor official, a national secretary and a successful MP and minister.
       </p>
       <p>
        Gary and Deb continue to contribute, and this wonderful couple are always welcomed warmly in the electorate they have served. Gary and Deb took part recently in the Rockingham Kwinana Chamber of Commerce regional business awards and just last Saturday they rallied with their family and community on Rockingham foreshore in support of marriage equality—a cause Deb has thrown herself into, having covered the front yard of her house with rainbow flags, encouraging her street to vote yes. My husband, Jamie, earlier this week dropped off to Deb campaign T-shirts that the Grays and Walshes will be wearing to campaign for the yes vote in the upcoming survey. This is a survey that we didn't want to have, but, as this government has put it on this country, we on this side will fight for equality, as we always do—just as Deb Walsh and Gary Gray always have and always will.
       </p>
       <p>
        Personally, Jamie and I have received an enormous amount of encouragement and support from Deb and Gary, and I thank them for it. At the election which brought me here, they and their family ran the polling booth at Hillman Primary School. We won that booth—we won many booths on 2 July last year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Gary, Deb and their sons could reasonably have expected to enjoy many more happy years together, following a busy political life that has kept them separated so often but, sadly, that is not to be. Deb is battling cancer. It is now certain that for Deb Walsh there are fewer days ahead than behind. These days are inevitably tinged with sadness, but Deb faces these days with a determination to make the most of her days with family and friends, soaking up the love they can provide. She's an inspiring woman, a strong woman and an amazing woman that has cared for so many of us. She always welcomed Gary's staff, made us feel at home in their home and made us feel part of their wonderful family. We stand here today with Deb Walsh and Gary Gray. My colleagues the member for Perth, the member for Burt, all of us on the Labor side and, I'm sure, all of us in this House, stand with Deb Walsh and Gary Gray. Our thoughts and prayers are with you, Deb, and with your family. Gary is an old grump, that much is true, but we love him almost as much as we love you, and we will watch out for him always. Thank you, Deb.
