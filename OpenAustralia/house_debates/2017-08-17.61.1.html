        When I went to see then Prime Minister Tony Abbott in 2015, I had a pile of petitions under my arm, my cap in hand and one thing on my mind—'Get this stadium across the line.' I was suitably stroppy that just a few weeks earlier the budget had failed to make available funding to build

        . Sure, we were after a fair bit of coin—$6 million, in fact—but this was an important project that would deliver in spades for the extended Dolphins family, from under-7s to rep players, the board's administrative team, families, supporters and volunteers. But it would also create jobs and fuel community regeneration.
