        Today we are acknowledging the significance of women on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Women's_Day" rel="nofollow">
         International Women's Day
        </a>
        , which is celebrated or acknowledged on 8 March annually. This morning with many of my colleagues I had the pleasure of attending an International Women's Day event hosted by the Australian National Committee for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        Women, an organisation that coordinates the national celebration of International Women's Day activities particularly in this nation, Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have come a long way as women in our society, which has developed and grown and become increasingly aware of the challenges that face women and girls. However, as many of us in this place know, there is much to do. In a developed nation like Australia, where it is against the law to discriminate based on gender, we still see the manifestation of gender inequality. This is no more evident than in the 17 per cent pay gap between men and women. As governments, parents, teachers, politicians, brothers, sisters and colleagues across this nation, we all have a role to play in working towards eradicating inequality.
       </p>
       <p>
        The experience of violence in our nation is indeed a scourge, where one in three Australian women and girls experience or view violence. In our region, among our neighbours, whether it be
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG" rel="nofollow">
         PNG
        </a>
        , Fiji or across the Pacific, this is doubled if not tripled. Last week the Minister for Foreign Affairs announced the launch of the Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment Strategy. This strategy brings all of the work we are doing in our neighbouring nations together under one umbrella, not just in the aid section of the department but in our diplomatic and international engagement, in our trade. Wherever Australia is engaged, we want to ensure that our gender equality and women's empowerment strategy is at the heart of what Australia is doing. We have put unrelenting focus on gender equality and women's empowerment. The minister has mandated that a minimum of 80 per cent of aid program would target and respond to the issues of gender equality, and women's issues and their empowerment. This will be our central focus.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the coming weeks many of us will be attending International Women's Day events across our electorates, and I particularly want to acknowledge those organisations that serve our community and help to particularly rescue women and girls from violence. I conclude that, having a very strong connection to the Pacific, education of our women is key to them accessing a free and equal future.
