        I rise today to talk about the loss of a great community member of ours. Sadly, Darryl McLindin, a community member in my electorate, passed away on Sunday, 13 June. I, along with many members of our community, attended his funeral service last Thursday. I am fortunate enough to have the privilege of being the patron of the

        and also the

         Sydney Swans
        </a>
        Canberra support group. I mention that because Darryl McLindin and his wife of 47 years, Pat, have both been very strong and wonderful supporters of the Tuggeranong Hawks footy club, in the first instance, and they have both been convenors and organisers of the Canberra support group for the Sydney Swans. That is despite the fact that Darryl actually supported Collingwood. I mention this in the chamber this evening to say how much I my colleagues are able to see and value the leadership role that people in our communities take. The support that Darryl gave his community, through both the Tuggeranong Hawks and the Sydney Swans support group, is immeasurable. Many people are indebted to him for his support, for the work he did and for the gentlemanly fashion in which he carried it out. He did sorts of tasks, particularly for the Tuggeranong Hawks footy club, and made sure that everybody connected with the Sydney Swans club was well looked after. He will be sadly missed.
