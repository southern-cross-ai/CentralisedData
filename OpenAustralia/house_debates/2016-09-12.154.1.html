       <p>
        I am privileged to be able to conduct my first statement to the Federation Chamber as the new member for Goldstein. Goldstein is an electorate that embodies community spirit. To that end, over the past few weeks I have been very happy to be able to open the seasons of both the Brighton Croquet Club and the Sandringham Bowls Club.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Brighton Croquet Club kindly invited me down to the opening of their season to showcase their immaculate grounds and their members' friendly nature. The club have a fascinating history. Back in 1911, after many years of paying a fee to play on private property which included croquet pitches, Councillor Edmanson announced plans to purchase two acres of land for a croquet club to be officially formed. The first vice-president in 1911-12 was one Mr T Wilson. That name appears regularly across the Goldstein electorate on honour boards, but I can assure members that he is no relation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The land was purchased for 170 pounds in May of 1911 and was considered a very good deal at the time. Using the old cabmen's shelter from the Middle Brighton station as the pavilion, the club was formed. Despite mishaps with the original pavilion burning down in 1912, the club are still strong to this day. I would like to thank them for their hospitality but, more importantly, wish them well for the 2016-17 season.
       </p>
       <p>
        Similarly, I also had the great opportunity to visit the Sandringham Bowls Club and get their 2016-17 season off to a cracking start. Like the croquet club, the bowls club has an interesting past, having had a few locations over its 107-year history. The club began in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbott_Street" rel="nofollow">
         Abbott Street
        </a>
        in 1909 and then moved to the Beach Reserve from 1922 to 1975, with its final shift to its current location in Tulip Street after 1975. The move was unexpected due to the council only giving year-by-year assurances that the club could stay. The main issue with the move was a lack of funds. After repeated attempts to sell the old building on Beach Reserve, it was physically moved to the current site in Tulip Street.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, it also plays an important part in Sandringham's social fabric for people of all ages. They deserve commendation for their contribution to the community, particularly for the committees which also serve with distinction. Following on from the previous speaker, I have not tried one of their egg and bacon sandwiches but I can say that they serve a mean cup of tea. The community spirit that lives within these clubs, combined with their rich history, is why the Goldstein community is a thriving area. These clubs respect the past while they help take the community forward together.
