       <p>
        On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties I present the committee's report incorporating dissenting reports entitled
        <i>
         Report 171:
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Trade" rel="nofollow">
          International Trade
         </a>
         in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endangered_Species" rel="nofollow">
          Endangered Species
         </a>
         —Amendments; Women in Combat Duties—Reservation Withdrawal; Generation

        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).
       </p>
       <p>
        by leave—The convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora is a multilateral convention that regulates international trade in endangered species. Endangered species are listed in three appendices to the convention according to the need for protection. In 2016 the 17th conference of the parties agreed to 51 listing proposals of which only 11 species were relevant to Australia. These include six terrestrial species and five marine species.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments appear to have received broad support within industry and the community. The majority of the amendments automatically entered into force 90 days following the convention of the parties, on 2 January this year. The amendments, therefore, became binding on Australia prior to their presentation to the parliament and before the committee was able to conduct its review of the proposed amendments. The committee reiterates previous concerns about the time frames for the committee's consideration of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CITES" rel="nofollow">
         CITES
        </a>
        amendments. We cannot perform a proper oversight role if treaties come into force before being tabled in this House. On previous occasions the committee has been notified of amendment proposals prior to the conference of the parties. This lessens the risk associated with the automatic entry-into-force clause of the agreement.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this report the committee asks the department to notify it of future proposed amendments prior to the conference of the party. I am cognisant that the election may well have interfered with such processes. If the department is not able to do so the committee recommends that the government lodge reservations to the amendments adopted at future conferences of the parties so that the parliamentary review of such treaty actions can be conducted before Australia is legally bound. The report notes that this approach is conducted by a number of other parliamentary democracies, including Canada.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee's report also considers a withdrawal of Australia's reservation to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. In 1983 Australia became a cosignatory to the convention, with two reservations. The first reservation relates to maternity leave. The second reservation relates to women in combat roles and is the subject of the proposed treaty action. In 2011 the government of the day removed restrictions on women serving in combat roles within the ADF. The reservation to the convention is therefore inconsistent with the current policy and is unnecessary. The committee strongly supports the commitment of successful governments to gender equality.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee heard evidence of the current steps the ADF is taking to recruit and retain women, including the introduction of more flexibility during each period of working life. However, there is still a significant road ahead before complete gender balance is achieved. The ADF must make the most of the many talented women currently serving in the ADF and those who may join in the future. While not every woman will be capable of serving in combat roles nor is every man. Access to such roles should be solely based on merit and capability not gender. Therefore, the committee strongly supports the proposed treaty action to withdraw the reservation with respect to women serving in combat roles and recommends that binding treaty action be taken.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, the committee's report considers Australia's accession to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framework_Agreement" rel="nofollow">
         Framework Agreement
        </a>
        for International Collaboration on Research and Development of Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems. The framework agreement establishes the basis for international cooperation to develop gen IV reactors. These reactors will use fuel more efficiently, reduce waste production, be economically competitive and meet stringent safety requirements. Australia possesses a technological lead in the development of materials that are expected to be used in gen IV reactors. The framework agreement appears to offer significant opportunities for Australian research and development for many years in the future. On that basis, the committee supports Australia's accession to the framework agreement and recommends that binding treaty action be taken.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the committee, I commend the report to the House. I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the House take note of the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
