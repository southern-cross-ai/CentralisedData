        Yesterday, the Tasmanian finalists for Tasmanian Australian of the Year were announced. I want to talk about some of the finalists who are nominated from the electorate of Franklin. The first is Professor Gretta Pecl, who is a Tasmanian Australian of the Year finalist for her important work in marine ecology, assisting in the fight against climate change. Gretta is ranked on the Reuters hot list of climate scientists for her work and is ranked in the top 20 scientists on this list. She is passionate about women's participation in science and has received national and international awards for her science communication and research.

        Joanne Cook is a nominee for Tasmanian Australian of the Year for her advocacy work in eating disorder recovery. She's the founder of the Tasmania Recovery from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_Disorders" rel="nofollow">

        foundation, which merged with the Butterfly Foundation back in 2017. She spent a long time advocating for more services in Tasmania, recognising that, in our state, the lack of support for people living with an eating disorder is particularly bad.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jay Chipman is a nominee for the Tasmanian Local Hero of the Year for her role in supporting cancer sufferers and their families with her charity, Homely Retreats. Mrs Chipman was a young mother when she was diagnosed with cancer back in 2014. After experiencing six months of chemotherapy and more than two years in recovery, she was determined to help other families in her situation. She now has Homely Retreats, a respite service for Tasmanians affected by cancer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, my electorate did very well in the Tasmanian Australian of the Year Awards last year. We also have Grace Tame from our area who went on to become Australian of the Year. These awards show what great people we have in our local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to end by talking about one of them today, who's retiring tomorrow: Anne Harrison from the Risdon Vale Neighbourhood Centre. Anne has worked at the Risdon Vale Neighbourhood Centre for decadesâ€”I won't say how many or she'll get cross with me. She has been a real champion for her local community, being involved in local organisations, such as the breakfast club at the local Risdon Vale Primary School, the community garden and the bike collective. She has been involved in organising community lunches and big Christmas lunches. During COVID, she was not just instrumental in ensuring that people in the local community had food supplies but personally delivering hot lunches to people. She has been involved in programs with young mums. She has been involved in programs for disengaged young people from the local school, Work for the Dole programs and youth justice programs. She has people from local aged-care facilities coming into the centre. She is working with the community at all levels and has been involved in them for many years. To Anne, I say thank you. Your community will miss you, but you've earned a rest, and we say thanks.
