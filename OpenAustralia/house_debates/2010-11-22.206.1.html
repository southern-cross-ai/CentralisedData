        I rise to give recognition in this place to the work done by two community organisations in the electorate of Wright. One organisation is Beaucare community care. I attended their
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM" rel="nofollow">
         AGM
        </a>
        recently and congratulated their new incoming committee for stepping up to be part of Beaudesert’s future. The work of the past also should not be forgotten, and therefore I also congratulate the outgoing committee for its great work over the last year, including the final phase of construction of a magnificent new building at the Beaudesert Hospital precinct. The foresight and professionalism shown by the whole project management group of volunteers will be an investment in the community that will receive a dividend for many years to come.

        Beaucare has been operating since 1987 and has provided a valuable contribution to our community. Beaucare provides a broad range of services, including child care, family support, youth development, community development and support services for the frail and aged and people with disabilities. Under the guidance of President Marg Moss and Treasurer Geoff Ryan, Beaucare runs a family support program called KinKare, which has a relative carer support group in Beaudesert. KinKare provides mutual support information and advocacy to grandparents in relative care and those who do not have access to their grandchildren. The group allows grandparents and kin carers to share their stories of triumph and heartache, obtain access to relevant and up-to-date resources and information, and gain valuable support with understanding. The delivery of the services of Beaucare is overseen by the general manager, Nola Petersen.

        The second organisation is called Rural Lifestyle Options. It provides opportunities for people less fortunate than us in this place to maximise their quality of life. I had the privilege of visiting Rural Lifestyle Options a few weeks ago and sharing a meal with them. It was just a short walk through the back of the block of my Beaudesert office, but it took me to another place. This is a place where people who would struggle to engage in mainstream settings are given the love, care, skills and confidence to find a better quality of life. In my brief visit I shared a meal and was welcomed by some of the residents.

        One address in particular will stay with me for the rest of my life. It was an address of welcome delivered by a young man by the name of Martin Caswell. We in this place are used to public speaking; there are many members here who can rise without a moment’s notice and produce an eloquent address without preparation. However, there are also times when the eloquence is not matched by commitment, so we find ourselves watching speeches going through the motions. What a difference Martin Caswell’s speech made to my day. I struggled to understand many of the words that Martin was using, but the passion and engagement which were projected there were truly impressive.
