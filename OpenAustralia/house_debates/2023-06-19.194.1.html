        It's often said that how a society treats its most vulnerable is a true measure of its humanity. This Refugee Week, these words have never been more true as we celebrate the contributions of the nearly one million Australians who have settled here since World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

        as refugees. These are people who fled unimaginable lives of war and persecution to become part of our Australian community and contribute and give back to our diverse social fabric. One of the things that drives me most nuts is that stereotype that people come here just to get on Centrelink. In the year 2000, six of our country's eight billionaires at the time had arrived as refugees. The fact is that refugees are far more likely than other Australians to start a business; they're incredibly entrepreneurial.

        Over 2,000 people seeking asylum and refugees live in my community—well over 2,000; I've lost count. We're the most multicultural part of Australia in

        , with people from 157 countries, two thirds of our population born overseas and most people not speaking English at home. It's a microcosm of modern multicultural Australia—harmonious, inclusive, welcoming and generous. The people with the least are always the people who give the most.
       </p>
       <p>
        This government is committed to creating a new national conversation, one with generosity and inclusivity about refugees and asylum seekers, not stoking division; one anchored in compassion rather than fear. The stories of refugees must be heard, and I'm incredibly pleased that, for the first time in years, the government will meet and fill the annual refugee quota this year.
