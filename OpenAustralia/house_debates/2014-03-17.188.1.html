       <p>
        Just recently I had the pleasure of attending the 16th birthday celebrations for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_City" rel="nofollow">
         Logan City
        </a>
        community cadets. They were first started in 1998 by a group of parents from the local community which included serving and ex-serving members of the ADF. The Logan cadet unit has an ethos of 'serve, learn and remember'.
       </p>
       <p>
        In particular, I would like to congratulate the cadets who received awards on this particular day. They were no other than Daniel Ramsay,

        , Corey Judge, Jackson Keene, Jarred Griffin, Ryan Tew, Alysa Chase-Currier, Bradley Kent, Jye Connoly, Joshua Underhill, Lindsay McCreadie,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Smith" rel="nofollow">

        and Jack Derges. On the day, Pam McCreadie was also promoted to staff sergeant; Tracy Derges was promoted to lieutenant; and Aaron Chase-Currier was farewelled after no less than 12 years of service with the cadets.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations to the Logan City community cadets, led by the commanding officer, Trevor Schulze. There is still a job in what they are doing in offering a well-structured and well-organised cadet unit for their local children to be part of. I would also like to congratulate the parents and support group, led by no other than Raelene Griffin and vice-president Mrs Lyn Bell, because they represent the backbone of the organisation responsible for most of the funding and the day-to-day activities. Congratulations to the individual company commanders, officers
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Griffin" rel="nofollow">

        and Brett McCreadie, who volunteer their time and expertise in their roles as mentors to teach the young cadets as they train. I commend the whole of the unit for their outstanding performance.
