        I had the pleasure of representing the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        at the official opening of a wonderful crime prevention project in my electorate of Bass. Youth on Paterson is an initiative of Northern Tasmania Development, in conjunction with the Northern Safe Communities Partnership. Its primary objective is to maximise the opportunities for young people aged between 10 and 18 to reach their full potential and to participate positively in our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        It has long been acknowledged across Northern Tasmania that community driven prevention activities offer some of the best solutions to crime. Community activities like those provided by Youth on Paterson provide a range of direct and indirect benefits. Early intervention youth and perpetrator programs address specific causes of crime and can reduce crime rates and provide tangible, long-lasting benefits for the community. It is well documented that early intervention strategies are some of the best ways to divert people from harmful pathways and a run-in with the criminal justice system. Increased grassroots community interaction and awareness of crime have the effect of making people less fearful.

        Northern Tasmania Development was a successful applicant in round 3 of the National Community

        Program grants. The project is being provided with $499,937 over three years. As you may not be aware, Madam Deputy Speaker, the Youth on Paterson program was established as a holistic support centre for young people in Northern Tasmania.
