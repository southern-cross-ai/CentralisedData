        Volunteers are the backbone of every country community, and Calare is no exception. Twenty-two groups in Calare have recently received funding under the federal government's 2017 community volunteer grants program and I would like to take this opportunity to mention just a few of them and their great work. Firstly, the Wellington Multi Service Centre, which is best known for its meals on wheels service, has been a part of the Wellington community and surrounding districts for many years. The centre is receiving $5,000 for the reimbursement of fuel costs and volunteer training. I would like to make particular mention in this House tonight of manager Claire Manning, chair Judy Scott, vice chair Lisa Bennett, secretary Lyn Beggs, treasurer Judy Grasnick, board members Lorna Carpenter, Lyn Munro and Michael Brian, administrative assistant and bookkeeper Sharon Doherty, and general assistant Christine Oldfield.
