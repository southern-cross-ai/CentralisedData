        I was going to give this speech last week, but it got pushed to today. The speech I was going to give is now unusable, as in the last few days coronavirus has appeared in a number of places in Bennelong. These cases have been a local doctor at the Ryde Hospital and a nurse who had been employed at the Baptist aged-care home in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Macquarie Park
        </a>
        for over two decades. She has now presented with symptoms. Subsequently, we became aware that she has been in contact with 13 patients. We also know that a female in her 70s and a male in his 80s have now been diagnosed with the condition and have been transferred to hospital. Tragically, a 95-year-old lady has passed away. Our hearts go out to the lady's family and to all the workers and residents at this centre who have been, sadly, impacted by this tragedy. I would also like to commend the community for their response. We cannot fully control where the virus will spring up, but, on all accounts, the management and staff of the BaptistCare centre and of Ryde Hospital have been exemplary, and all practical measures that can be taken have beenâ€”and were done promptly and efficiently. I visited both centres on a number of occasions, and I'm delighted to see that they have maintained their high level of care at this trying time.

        Despite these outbreaks, there is something important to remember. If you do not have the disease and are not at risk, there is absolutely no reason to change your usual routine at this stage. Keep going to work, keep going out to eat and keep going to the shops and, please, stop buying toilet paper! Notwithstanding this, I would like to read a brief statement that the member for Reid and her team have put together and which will soon be translated into a number of languages. If you are concerned about the disease, the following statement forms the basis of the best advice we have on how to contain this disease together:

        Our community is already being impacted by COVID-19 (Coronavirus), and I wanted to convey the latest information from the

        and the

        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I want to reassure you that, whilst we are not immune from COVID-19, we are very well prepared as a country.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A number of cases have been identified around Sydney and, in particular, in our area, so it is important to be aware of the best way to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Practice good hygiene, such as frequent hand washing, using hand sanitisers, coughing or sneezing into your elbow, and avoiding shaking hands. This should not be replaced by kissing.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        People should monitor for symptoms such as fever, coughing, shortness of breath or tiredness. If you are unwell or concerned that you may have been exposed to COVID-19, you should self-isolate and call your
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        for advice before you visit your doctor. Please do not go to public places. Do not go to your doctor's waiting room and wait there. Call first.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If you have recently returned from or transited through China or Iran or another high-risk country or region in the last 14 days, you must self-isolate for 14 days from the time of your departure from that country.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If you have been in close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19, you must self-isolate for 14 days from the date of your last contact with the confirmed case.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Human-to-human transmission has been detected in Australia, so even if you have not travelled, please exercise caution.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Some groups are more vulnerable to COVID-19 than others, including the over 65s and people with pre-existing health conditions, particularly autoimmune diseases or respiratory issues. If you or a family member fall into this category, use extra caution and ensure that all members of the family are practising good hygiene.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A 24/7 national coronavirus health information line is available on 1800 020 080 for health and situation information on the COVID-19 outbreak.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Make sure you follow the most up-to-date advice of the Chief Medical Officer or the Department of Health.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is important that our whole community is aware of the risks of COVID-19.

        Please ensure this information is shared with your family and friends, particularly those who may not have access to information online or through other sources.
