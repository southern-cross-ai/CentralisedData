        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill amends the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997 to insert a new section 16A which states that:
       </p>
       <p>
        A livestock export licence is subject to a condition:
       </p>
       <p>
        that livestock that are sheep or lambs must not be exported from Australia, by ship, to:
       </p>
       <p>
        A place in the

       </p>
       <p>
        in a July, August or September, in the transitional period, or at any time after the end of that period, if the duration of that voyage is 10 days or more.
       </p>
       <p>
        The transition period is five years.
       </p>
       <p>
        From a childhood in the deserts of the

        </a>
        to an early life as a mustering pilot then worker in the shearing sheds of western Queensland, 17 years as a sheep farmer myself and a representative of sheep and wool producers for my entire time in parliament, I have spent more than half my life close to Australia's rural and pastoral industries.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know all the arguments that are used to support the live sheep trade because I ran them myself for 15 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently I found cause to look at the industry with fresh eyes. I have been shocked, angered, bewildered and disappointed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have researched the science, the facts, the economics and the opinions. I have not allowed emotions to overcome reason.
       </p>
       <p>
        The case for continuing long-haul live sheep exports fails on both economic and animal welfare grounds.
       </p>
       <p>
        Only six per cent of our sheep and lamb offtake are exported live.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most of these are sourced in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        , and I acknowledge that some farmers in this state will be affected and will move to alternative markets and/or production models.
       </p>
       <p>
        We export sheep and lamb to 100 countries.
       </p>
       <p>
        In WA the mutton price is 20 times greater than it was 20 years ago. Processing has built these markets.
       </p>
       <p>
        We can identify and fast-track new development in WA abattoirs and create more jobs and greater value-adding.
       </p>
       <p>
        If we set a five-year end date, investors can have the certainty and confidence to build new processing capacity.
       </p>
       <p>
        The live sheep trade is in terminal decline, dropping by two-thirds in the last five years.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is based on just two customers in two countries, Kuwait and Qatar who account for 70 per cent of exported sheep.
       </p>
       <p>
        The demand for live sheep comes from its cheap retail price due to government subsidies, not cultural or refrigeration reasons.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ninety-nine per cent of consumers in the Gulf have refrigeration.
       </p>
       <p>
        Every
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
         Middle East
        </a>
        ern country accepts Australian halal slaughter.
       </p>
       <p>
        The subsidies are phasing out. Bahrain ended theirs in 2015 and went from 325,000 live sheep from Australia to zero.
       </p>
       <p>
        The transition was not to live sheep from another country, but to the same number of carcasses, shipped by air, from Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        These countries are demanding more and more fresh bagged lamb and mutton; value-added in Australia and flown over in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Eastern" rel="nofollow">
         Middle Eastern
        </a>
        airlines, growing from 260,000 head in 2004 to 2.7 million head in 2016.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our live sheep are discharged into a feedlot, slaughtered and end up under cellophane in a refrigerated shopping mall, next to the chilled product air-freighted from Australia 24 hours earlier.
       </p>
       <p>
        The litany of animal cruelty in the live sheep trade makes a mockery of the industry's 'No fear, no pain' mantra.
       </p>
       <p>
        If the rules were actually enforced—access to feed, water and rest, avoiding high heat stress, no commercial operator would undertake the trade.
       </p>
       <p>
        Exporters have explained to me that it would not be viable. Unfortunately this is an industry with an operating model built on animal suffering.
       </p>

        As live export vet
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynn_Simpson" rel="nofollow">
         Lynn Simpson
        </a>
        remarked:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I watched animals suffer and die for 57 voyages. The spectrum of their suffering differed but the true death count has never been declared. It will likely never see the light of day. Like so many animals who died below the water line on a ship in the middle of the ocean.
       </p>
       <p>
        I applaud the agriculture minister's strong response to recent footage but I'm not confident that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthy" rel="nofollow">
         McCarthy
        </a>
        review recommendations will go far enough.
       </p>
       <p>
        A 60-kilo sheep will be allocated extra space equivalent to just under two A4 pieces of paper.
       </p>
       <p>
        We're told we need more research on an already questionable heat-stress model to work out where to draw the line. Perhaps we should accept the existing, overwhelming evidence of poor animal welfare associated with these voyages.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is farmers who have been deceived by an export industry that has for 33 years and countless second chances been very good at talking the talk and downright culpable when it comes to walking the walk.
       </p>
       <p>
        Exporters do not comply with the rules. Much of the live export chain lies outside Australia's legal jurisdiction in international waters and overseas countries.
       </p>
       <p>
        As one WA consultant to the trade told me, regulations written on paper in Australia cease to mean anything once the ship departs.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the modern world ethics and sustainability in the production of food and fibre are vital. Sanctioning further voyages on these ships of shame, particularly into a Middle Eastern summer, damages our brand.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australians will no longer accept rural export industries with animal welfare practices that are inferior to those our farmers willingly comply with every day.
       </p>
       <p>
        Nor will they understand the logic of putting our clean green sheep meat industry at risk for a sector that is one-tenth the size, in decline and actually competes with our domestic production.
       </p>
       <p>
        Parliamentarians are certainly noting high levels of community outrage, and I give the last word to Mrs Shirley Dale from rural
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
         NSW
        </a>
        who wrote to me saying:
       </p>
       <p>
        "I am 82 years and in this the last chapter of my life I did not think I would be so moved to want to stand up for any causes—but the plight of these suffering animals cannot be ignored.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is not an issue of economics—it is so much greater than that. It is a test of our humanity—as individuals and as a nation."
       </p>
       <p>
        I will give the rest of my allotted time to my excellent seconder, the member for Corangamite.

         </small>
         <p>
          It is my pleasure to second the Live Sheep Long Haul Export Prohibition Bill 2018, which has been introduced by the member for Farrer. I also want to acknowledge the support of the member for
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Trobe" rel="nofollow">
           La Trobe
          </a>
          . I congratulate the member for Farrer on the stand she has taken, which takes courage, and I'm proud to join with her in our proposal to end the export of live sheep to the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
           Middle East
          </a>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          It is significant that we both, as Liberal members of parliament representing large regional electorates including many farmers and agribusinesses, have taken this stand. Overwhelmingly, the people of Corangamite are saying, 'Enough is enough.' After decades of noncompliance, after decades of inhumane treatment of sheep, after decades of tolerating a trade which continues to tarnish our international reputation, Australians are saying, 'Enough is enough'. The scenes on the
          <i>
           Awassi Express
          </i>
          , where more than 2,000 sheep died—many literally cooking to death—were utterly horrific. The government response has been swift and strong, and I commend the agriculture minister on his efforts to fix this trade and hold rogue exporters to account, but we need to do more. The bill proposes an end to long-haul live sheep exports only—not cattle or short-haul exports—over five years. This is a measured and responsible lead time, in stark contrast to Labor's overnight shutdown of the cattle trade, which had dramatic consequences.
         </p>
         <p>
          The interests of farmers and rural communities on this issue are paramount. If the bill is passed, it will provide our farmers, processors and the extended supply chain with the appropriate time to transition completely to chilled lamb and mutton exports to the Middle East, to grow our sheepmeat processing capacity, to invest with certainty, to protect and enhance our reputation as a nation of agricultural excellence and to invest in more Australian jobs. There must be proper consultation with farmers and industry. This transition is, in fact, already underway. Where the live sheep trade is in rapid decline, we are seeing a dramatic increase in the export of Australian chilled lamb and mutton by air to the Middle East. This can, of course, only continue.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Western Australia
          </a>
          has the processing facilities to make this transition. The challenge is in securing and training the workforce, and that's where governments can play a major role.
         </p>
         <p>
          The bill also proposes that from 2019 there will be no export of live sheep to the Middle East during the hottest summer months: July, August and September. The highly credible scientific evidence from the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Veterinary_Association" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Veterinary Association
          </a>
          is that sheep deaths and heat stress cannot be avoided during the extreme temperatures and humidity of a
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Eastern" rel="nofollow">
           Middle Eastern
          </a>
          summer, even with improved ventilation and lower stocking rates. It is incredibly disappointing that the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthy" rel="nofollow">
           McCarthy
          </a>
          review has not followed the science and recommended the prohibition of live sheep export during the summer. If any person in Australia crammed sheep into a transport vehicle to stand in their own excrement for 25 days in the searing heat with limited access to food and water, that person would be charged with animal cruelty. The time has come. Backed by the science, the facts and the economics, this is a trade which must come to an end. I commend this bill to the House.
