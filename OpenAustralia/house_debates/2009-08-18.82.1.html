        My question is addressed to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. Is the minister aware that an insulation factory in my electorate, which is accredited under the government’s Energy Efficient Homes package has been the subject of numerous complaints and is headed by an undischarged bankrupt, who has apparently fled Bundaberg? Will the minister advise the House how such an operator received government accreditation and whether there are any other similar operators on the government’s register?

         I thank the member for his question. I did see the newspaper articles that he refers to concerning that particular installer in the Bundaberg area. I can confirm to the House and to the member that, to go on the register, it is a requirement of installers that they confirm they are privy to and understand all of the responsibilities that are necessary for proper accreditation as installers under the guidelines. On that basis, if there are any instances of installers who are in fact not observing the guidelines then we want to know about it, my office wants to know about it and the department also wants to know about it. There is a 1800 number that is available—

           I would have thought that the House would have appreciated the opportunity to know that there are many means by which either members of this House or members of the public can be advised on whether there are difficulties in relation to the installation of ceiling insulation under the government’s plan. I make these additional points to the member for Hinkler. The first is that we have a robust compliance and monitoring program underway in order to ascertain whether there are any instalments—

                  My department has also written to installers reminding them of their particular obligations under the guidelines. Finally, I make this point to the member: I have also asked my department to specifically investigate the matter that he has raised in question time in relation to the installer in Bundaberg and report back to me by the close of business today.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  And I want to add something more here—now that I have had the opportunity to answer the question that was put to me in some detail by the member—and that is that those opposite opposed putting ceiling insulation into the homes of Australians who want to reduce their energy costs and help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It was the member for
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
                   North Sydney
                  </a>
                  specifically who opposed the fact that we thought that one way of getting jobs into regional communities would be to give people the opportunity to have ceiling insulation and to build local business at the same time.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Over 180,000 householders have taken the opportunity to have ceiling insulation in their roofs. Not only are they satisfying the obligations that they have to want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions but they are reducing their energy costs as well. This is a program that is working extremely well. If there are any issues that need to be addressed, we will address them in a vigorous and assertive manner.
