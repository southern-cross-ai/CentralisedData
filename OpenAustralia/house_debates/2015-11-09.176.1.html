        I am delighted to tell the house about the Advanced

        Youth Crew training, and the pleasure I had at attending their graduation day last Thursday at Tallangatta fire station. A cluster of three schools—Tallangatta, Corryong and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Beauty" rel="nofollow">

        secondary colleges—have been successfully running this course since 1997. The current coordinators—congratulations on a fantastic job!—are Joy Campbell and Shaun Thorpe, and special thanks to Kimberley Taylor for your work. Funding is provided by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Human_Services" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , with support from CFA brigades in Tallangatta, Corryong, Mount Beauty, Tawonga, Eskdale and many neighbouring branches.
       </p>
       <p>
        Without the support of the volunteer members, the program could not be operated. Sixty-three young people—21 from each school—who are students in years 9 and 10 are selected via a competitive process to participate in this two-year program. The training days are rotated and held at each school's home twice a year to share the travel. The program includes an overnight camp at Howmans Gap. The students compete in theory and first aid training, and also participate in team building, fire skills management activities and leadership.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was so pleased to be part of the graduation program on Friday, and I would particularly like to talk about leadership, courage and community, because this is what these students absolutely demonstrate: leadership in helping fight fires, but being team leaders; courage in being out there taking the first steps and being brave; and then contributing back to their community in so many ways. Well done to all concerned; terrific effort!
