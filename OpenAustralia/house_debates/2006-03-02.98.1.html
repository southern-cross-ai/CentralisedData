       <p>
        According to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Health and Ageing
        </a>
        website, chronic illnesses, including diabetes, are shaping up as one of the greatest health challenges for Australia in the 21st century. It is refreshing to read an admission that diabetes is of major concern to the department. Sadly, however, such departmental admissions provide cold comfort to diabetes sufferers at a time when the government seemingly does not share its own department’s concerns.
       </p>
       <p>
        Type 1 diabetes is an illness which affects thousands of Australians. In layman’s terms it is an illness where the pancreas cannot produce insulin because the cells producing insulin have been destroyed by the body’s immune system. With access to effective treatments it is an illness that will not create an impediment to leading a relatively normal life. Yet, despite the availability of effective treatments on the open market, diabetes remains an illness that continues to cry out for more deserving attention from the government.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am appreciative of the information and advice given to me by several constituents in my electorate of Lowe who have succinctly and honestly described the illness and how more can be done to assist them. I have been moved by their descriptions of having to experience frequent injections, the pain from heavily punctured skin, vomiting, nausea, fatigue and blurred vision. This is not to mention their frustration at being unable to work or function with any certainty due to the peaks and troughs of traditional insulin treatments.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yes, amongst the described hardships, all of those in contact with me have preached the virtue of Lantus, a long-lasting insulin which, unlike other treatments, does not have short-term peaks and troughs. This is achieved by providing a steady release of insulin to the body, controlling blood glucose levels and keeping cells supplied with energy when no food is being digested. Remarkably, despite four applications to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_Benefits_Advisory_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee
        </a>
        , Lantus is still not listed on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_Benefits_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
         Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme
        </a>
        . I have analysed the committee’s public summary documents and understand that the listing has been refused on the grounds of ‘uncertain overall benefit’ and ‘an uncertain and unacceptably high cost-effectiveness ratio’.
       </p>
       <p>
        This decision has left my constituents with no choice but to pay over $100 a month for the drug or switch to a more ineffective form of treatment. It is therefore pertinent to look more closely at each of the committee’s main grounds. In contrast to the committee’s findings, I note the following: firstly, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_Diabetes_Research_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation
        </a>
        has commented that Lantus has been demonstrably effective at reducing the incidence of hypoglycaemic attack; secondly,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Diabetes Australia
        </a>
        ’s New South Wales President, Dr Neville Howard, has commented that fluctuations in blood glucose levels are reduced considerably by Lantus; and, finally, Dr Matt Cohen, Director of Medical Services at the International Diabetes Institute, has stated that Lantus is ‘a very big step in the treatment of any insulin treated patient’.
       </p>
       <p>
        Allowing those inflicted with diabetes to continue to suffer because of notions including allegedly high cost-effectiveness ratios is unconscionable and ought to be rectified by the government immediately. I fear that Australia’s health system is increasingly becoming one that can only cater for those who can bear the astronomical costs of treatment. The time has come for the government to bring back the ‘care’ in health care. It can start by listing Lantus on the PBS.
