        The wider Gracemere community has been advocating for a high school for almost 30 years. In this time various petitions and campaigns have been formed by the local community. Last week there was exciting news from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        candidate for Rockhampton, Donna Kirkland, and the LNP candidate for Mirani, Glen Kelly, that a state LNP government will build a high school at Gracemere.
       </p>
       <p>
        The nearest state high school to Gracemere is Rockhampton State High School, which is located at Campbell Street, Wandal. As the school is the only state secondary facility on the southern side of the city, it draws its student population from families of diverse economic and vocational backgrounds. The diversity includes nearby Gracemere, which is an urban development, along with semi-rural properties and small farming communities extending to Gogango in the west and to Bajool and Marmor in the south. Over 600 students rely on buses to Rockhampton every day. Overcrowded buses, high student-teacher ratios in classrooms, and bullying and overstimulation of children before they even get to the classroom are just some of the issues raised by parents calling for a high school in Gracemere.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm sure the announcement by the state LNP to build a high school at Gracemere will be strongly welcomed by the wider Gracemere community. Well done to the local residents, as well as to Donna and Glen, for your strong advocacy.
