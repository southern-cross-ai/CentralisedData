        I am pleased to present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation that participated in the 145th Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly held in Kigali, Rwanda, from 11 October to 15 October 2022. It was a great honour and privilege to lead this delegation. Travelling alongside me as part of this Australian delegation were: Senator the Hon. Linda Reynolds

        ; the member for Leichhardt, the Hon.

        </a>
        ; Senator Fatima Payman; and member for Robertson, Dr Gordon Reid. This delegation reflected the diversity of the 47th Parliament, which is fundamental and in line with the overall theme of the assembly: gender equality and gender-sensitive parliaments as drivers for a more resilient and peaceful world. All members of the delegation played an active and vital role at various proceedings of the assembly. The delegation attended the formal sessions and participated in the governing council. The delegation also participated in the meetings of the Asia-Pacific and Twelve-Plus geopolitical groups as well as the Forum of Women Parliamentarians and the various standing committees.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the assembly I contributed to the general debate on the topic of gender equality and gender-sensitive parliaments as drivers for a more resilient and peaceful world. I drew attention to the reforms underway within the Australian parliament and how we are working towards a safer, more supportive and gender-sensitive workplace. I stated that we have an obligation, as the Australian parliament and a workplace, to ensure our working environment is respectful and allows parliamentarians and those who support them to perform at their best on behalf of the nation. I also participated in the emergency item on the condemnation of the invasion of Ukraine and of the subsequent annexation of territories in defence of the territorial integrity of all states.
       </p>
       <p>
        Senator Payman made her contribution as a young parliamentarian on behalf of the Australian delegation. She spoke of the importance of addressing the barriers that prevent young women from recognising politics as a legitimate career option. The delegation participated in all meetings of the two geopolitical groups that Australia is a member of, the Asia-Pacific group and the Twelve-Plus group. During the consideration of the emergency item in the Twelve-Plus group, Senator Reynolds and I contributed to the debate, voicing our strong support for the solidarity with Ukraine. The group also considered a proposal, prepared by the Swiss delegation, to improve the implementation of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPU" rel="nofollow">
         IPU
        </a>
        resolutions. I congratulate and thank Senator Reynolds who will serve on a task force with Switzerland to consider and advance the proposal.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia put forward a proposal regarding measures to combat orphan trafficking and tourism, which was accepted for consideration by the

        </a>
        . This proposal will be put forward as a resolution to the committee for debate at the 146th IPU Assembly in Bahrain in March 2023 and for subsequent adoption of the 140th Assembly in October 2023.

        of Young Parliamentarians met to receive an update on youth participating nationally and internationally. Senator Payman, the fifth-youngest senator in Australian history and youngest and in the current parliament, made the I Say Yes to Youth in Parliament! pledge, along with me and other members of the delegation.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the benefits of the assembly is that it provides an opportunity for Australian parliamentarians to meet their international colleagues in both formal and informal settings. It offers a unique opportunity for delegations and individual parliamentarians to discuss issues of mutual interest, to develop an understanding of different parliamentary models and to strengthen parliament-to-parliament relationships. For these reasons, during our time at the assembly, the Australian delegation met with delegations from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        , Fiji, Timor-Leste, Canada and Britain. We also held bilateral meetings with delegations from Afghanistan, Georgia and Serbia.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the Australian delegation, I'd like to make a few acknowledgements: firstly, the support provided by Mr Dominique Vigie at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_High_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian High Commission
        </a>
        in Nairobi, Kenya; secondly, the work of the staff at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Canberra who provided background briefing materials, including Mr Greg Klemm and Jennifer Grouch who coordinated the provision of the materials. I extend our thanks to the Parliamentary Library who also provided important briefing materials to the delegations, which were extremely helpful and informative. I acknowledge the work of Mr Nigel Brew and his colleagues of the Parliamentary Library for providing this material and thank them for it. The delegation deeply appreciated the assistance and support of the International and Parliamentary Relations Office, with Ms Aleshia Westgate and Kim Bulman deserving special mention for their tireless efforts to arrange travel and accommodations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, the delegation would like to acknowledge and thank Ms Toni Matulick and Dr Jane Thomson from the Department of the Senate, Clerk Assistant Committees who served as delegation secretary for this delegation. I commend the report to the House.
