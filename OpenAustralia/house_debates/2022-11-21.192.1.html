       <p>
        My community of Chisholm in Melbourne is full of passionate young people, and today I want to lift up the young voices that champion climate action. I've been really privileged to meet with a lot of young people in my community who've told me their stories of when they became concerned around climate change and their vision for a more sustainable future.
       </p>
       <p>
        The leadership from young people has been inspiring. I met with the Tomorrow Movement, and it was wonderful to meet with Desiree, Molly, Sarah and another Carina to hear about the work they are doing. Something they're really passionate about is making sure there are good, secure jobs for people as we take action on climate change. That's something that, of course, the Albanese Labor government feels very strongly about too.

        I was privileged to be taken on a tour of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huntingtower_School" rel="nofollow">
         Huntingtower School
        </a>
        , where I saw the incredible program on fundraised solar panels and the sustainability leaders. Thank you very much to Xabier and Anjali for taking me so proudly around your school. You are wonderful leaders at a wonderful school.
       </p>

        I thank Max for his advocacy. He's a 25-year-old graduate of Melbourne university, and he told me about his time in Fiji working on community development and climate change adaptation. It's very important work in this region to be partnering with nations like Fiji. It's a privilege to meet and work with you all to secure a better future for all in our climate and our communities, and I'm really glad our first piece of legislation was getting through the climate change bill.
