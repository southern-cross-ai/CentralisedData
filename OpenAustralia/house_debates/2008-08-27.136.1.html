        , who died on 13 July 2008. I also offer sincere sympathy to his friends and family, that hardworking and very talented pioneering Durack family from the Kimberley region in Western Australia. Senator Durack served for 22 years in the Senate, becoming Attorney-General in 1977 during the Fraser government years. It was also during that time that he implemented several historically important legal reforms. Senator Durack earned respect from all sides of politics, basically because he was a thoroughly decent man with a genuine commitment to good government, a genuine commitment to good policy and a dedication to human rights and legal reform.

        Senator Durack served one term in the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Attorney" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        -General in 1977. In this role, he was responsible for the appointment of some of the most distinguished judges to serve on the High Court, and he remains one of a small number of Australians who have served in the Senate for over two decades—no mean feat. Senator Durack also served as Minister for Veterans’ Affairs and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate. He was a very strong advocate for freedom of information laws and a champion for the rights of individuals who had disputes with government. He presided over the Freedom of Information Bill in 1978 and the

        </a>
        in 1982.
       </p>
       <p>
        In spite of his considerable achievements in the political field, Senator Durack was respected as a true gentleman and someone who provided counsel, advice and support to many Liberals, including the member for Curtin, as well as mentoring those not involved in the political environment. I offer sincere sympathy to his wife, Isobel, his children, Anne and Phillip, and his four grandchildren on what is the most important loss of all—the loss of a husband, the loss of a father and the loss of a grandfather.
