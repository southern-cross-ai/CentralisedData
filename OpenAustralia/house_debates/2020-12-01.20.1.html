        I rise today to pay tribute to the late Lucy Kathleen Germon. Lucy was a well-known personality in Gloucester and received the Order of Australia medal on the

        honours list in 2009 for her service to the Gloucester community. She grew up on a farm near Pitlochry and went to school at Bulliac and later at Gloucester high. Bulliac school had only 20 students and most rode bareback and barefoot to school. She famously said, 'We never wore shoes to school except when the inspector or the sewing teacher was coming.' Lucy was a loving mother to Doug and Janette and a proud nanna to six grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren.

        Gloucester is a better and stronger community because of the service Lucy put in as an active member of the community since the 1950s. She was a Quota International member and a president during her 27 years of service. She was an inaugural member of the Westpac Rescue Helicopter Service and served on the Rookhurst Gloucester Hospital Auxiliary for 30 years. She was an active member of the jersey herd society, the Gloucester Show society, the Presbyterian Women's Association, the Gloucester Tidy Towns and

        committees, the Gloucester Meals on Wheels and the cricket club, and she was a life member of the Gloucester country music club, amongst many others. Lucy Germon loved Gloucester, and they loved her. Her services left an indelible mark on the region. On behalf of a grateful country and the country, I pass on our condolences to Doug, Janette and all the family. Vale Lucy Germon.
