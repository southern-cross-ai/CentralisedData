         I thank the member for Ryan for his question. Today, as the House knows, marks two years since the Prime Minister apologised to victims and survivors of institutional child sexual abuse—a period of Australian history that should not be forgotten.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
          Can I
         </a>
         acknowledge the very fine words of both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition this morning. The Redress Scheme was a key recommendation of the resulting royal commission. The royal commission made 84 recommendations, all of which have been implemented through the 10-year National Redress Scheme, which commenced in 2018. The latest figures I can report, as reflected by the Prime Minister this morning, are that 8,297 applications have been received and 4,670 decisions have been made, with payments totalling some $320 million—an average of approximately $82,000 per applicant Nearly 300 non-government organisations, on top of state, territory and Commonwealth government institutions, have signed up. This includes sporting groups, churches, local community organisations and schools. It covers 53,000 sites. It's clear that, together, we are on the right track.
        </p>
        <p>
         The date of 31 December this year marks another crucial date for the scheme. We're actively working with 158 institutions who have committed to join but have not yet done so. Sadly, four institutions have decided not to join, being Fairbridge,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah's_Witnesses" rel="nofollow">
          Jehovah's Witnesses
         </a>
         ,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenja_Communication" rel="nofollow">
          Kenja Communication
         </a>
         and Lakes Entrance Pony Club. I think it's clear that we are firm in our resolve on this issue. Should any of the 158 institutions not fully commit and join the scheme by the end of the year, after having six months or more to join, they will be publicly named and face the same consequences of the four institutions just named.
        </p>
        <p>
         Improving the scheme and ensuring survivors of institutional child sexual abuse are supported remains a clear priority for us all. We're now in the process of reviewing the scheme, with an additional $104.6 million over the next four years to further fund redress support services and employ further independent decision-makers. We anticipate the review will be presented to the government early next year, with recommendations to be considered by the Ministers Redress Scheme Governance Board.
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, I echo the Prime Minister's fine statement today. No currently or future named institution who refuses to join will be the beneficiary of any government grants, funding source or preferential tax treatment. They will not advance while victims and survivors remain forgotten.
        </p>
        <p>
         We all know there's more to do. We have over seven more years of the scheme's life, and that will mean further improvements. We can't undo the wrongs of the past, but we are taking meaningful steps to address those wrongs.
