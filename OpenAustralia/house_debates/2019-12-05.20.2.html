        <i>
         Watson
        </i>
        and address facilities and base infrastructure deficiencies, including the high-risk base engineering services. The project will redevelop key facilities on the base that directly support Navy capability which have not seen significant investment for 30 years. The estimated cost of the works to be undertaken over seven years from 2019-20 is $430.5 million, not including

       <p>
        The committee has conducted an inquiry and recommended that the House of Representatives resolve, pursuant to section 18(7) of the Public Works Committee Act, that it is expedient to carry out the project and that Defence ensure that the proposed works at HMAS
        <i>
         Watson

        do not preclude the building of a clifftop track along the eastern perimeter of the base as part of the Bondi-to-Sydney walk. Subject to parliamentary approval, the works are expected to commence by mid-2020 and be completed by mid-2026. On behalf of the government, I'd like to thank the committee for undertaking a timely inquiry. I commend the motion to the House.

        Property Replacement Project in Tarawa, Kiribati.

        The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade proposes to construct fit-for-purpose office accommodation and residential housing for the Australian High Commission mission located in Tarawa, Kiribati,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Islands" rel="nofollow">

        The
        <i>
         2017 Foreign policy white paper
        </i>
        listed Australia's engagement with the Pacific as being one of the highest priorities. Through this project, DFAT's overseas property office is aiming to develop a best practice design and construction model to enable it to undertake similar upgrade and replacement works throughout the Asia-Pacific region.
       </p>
       <p>
        The local community impact of this project is expected to be low as construction will be on land already leased by the Commonwealth. The project will obtain all necessary land development, building and environmental approvals as required. The estimated capital cost of the project is $19.7 million, excluding GST. Costs include the construction of fit-for-purpose office accommodation and residential housing.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project was referred to the Public Works Committee on 18 September 2009, and the committee has recommended that the House of Representatives resolve, pursuant to section 18(7) of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, that it is expedient to carry out the project. Subject to parliamentary approval, the project is planned to commence in early 2020 and be completed by mid-2021.

        Training Area Remediation Project.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Defence is proposing a remediation project for selected elements of the facilities and engineering infrastructure within the Department of Defence's Shoalwater Bay training area in Queensland. Both the
        <i>
         2016 Defence white paper
        </i>
        and 2016 Defence Integrated Investment Program foreshadowed further investments in and upgrading of a number of defence training areas, including Shoalwater Bay.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project will deliver critical infrastructure upgrades to the Shoalwater Bay training area that will improve environmental sustainability and support current and expected increase joint and multinational training activities and continuous amphibious training capacity. The estimated cost of the works to be undertaken over four years from the 2019-20 financial year is $135.4 million, excluding GST.

       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Defence is proposing to provide fit-for-purpose facilities and infrastructure required to support the introduction into service of new government approved naval capabilities: nine Hunter class frigates that will replace the existing Anzac class frigates; and 12 Arafura class offshore patrol vessels that will replace the existing Armidale class patrol boats.

         Royal Australian Navy

       </p>
       <p>
        The estimated total cost of the project is $1.8 billion, including contingency. The proposed facilities and infrastructure involve new works and refurbishment or upgrading of existing facilities and infrastructure at each of the proposed locations. Again, the committee has recommended that the House of Representatives resolve, pursuant to section 18(7) of the Public Works Committee Act, that it is expedient to carry out the project. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence in early 2020 and be completed by early 2027.
