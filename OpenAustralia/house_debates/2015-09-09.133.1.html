        On Saturday evening I had the pleasure of attending the 30th

        </a>
        Greek ball, organised by the Macquarie University Greek Association. This event, a celebration of shared Greek and Cypriot culture, was another resounding success. The founding father of the Macquarie University Greek Association, the late Mr Vasilli Georgiou, was a father of modern Greek studies at Macquarie University. For more than 10 years he worked tirelessly to keep the flame alive for modern Greek studies. There was never a doubt that he was passionate about Greek culture and language or that he was determined to showcase the vast beauty of Greek civilisation.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Greek" rel="nofollow">
         The Greek
        </a>
        Association was born on 26 November 1984 as a means of showcasing Greek cultureâ€”my own heritage, of course, shared by many Greek immigrants and expatriates around the world, particularly here in Sydney. I am pleased that the Greek cultural flame has continued to burn strongly at Macquarie University.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Greek ball is a much anticipated event of the university's social calendar, bringing together current and former members of the association to share Greek and Cypriot culture and enjoy this with current students. Since its inception the association has played an acutely active role on campus, seeking to provide a social and cultural meeting point for those interested in Greece or things Greek related and to promote a study of and contact with the country through its history, culture and people. The purpose of this great association is inextricably linked to its founder, Vasilli, who was a diligent advocate of Greek language and culture in Australia. It was Vasilli, through his commitment and hard work, who created a permanent department dedicated to modern Greek studies at Macquarie University. For 30 years now, the association has actively undergone fundraising efforts to raise funds and resources that are needed to keep Vasilli's vision alive. Vasilli would no doubt be proud of the legacy he has left behind, a legacy that promotes and fosters Greek culture amongst students, members and the broader community.
       </p>
       <p>
        On top of promoting and sharing Greek culture and language with communities, the association also raises funds to respond to various extracurricular activities, including student theatrical productions and the students representative council, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRC" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . The Greek ball is a chance for luminaries to get together and celebrate the achievements of this association. To be able to continue the great work from the foundation set by the late Vasilli is an absolute credit to all the students and members over the past 30 years. It was an honour to meet many of them on the night and hear their plans for the association. The Macquarie University Greek ball was also about acknowledging the countless community groups, businesses and individuals who have lent their support and assistance to the association in its endeavours since its inception. Importantly, the ball reminds all of us of Vasilli's efforts and contributions to the ongoing study and appreciation of Greek culture and language at Macquarie University and within the wider community. He left an incredible legacy which we are so fortunate to have.
