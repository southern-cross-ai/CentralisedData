       <p>
        I notice that Larmenier school is in the audience today. For those in the House who are not aware, Larmenier school recently won the Australian grade 6 spellathon.
       </p>
       <p>
        But I rise today to talk about a series of schools in my electorate which participated in Singfest, a great concert for schools throughout northern Tasmania. Nine northern Tasmanian schools participated. What I found particularly amazing was that they only had one full day of rehearsals. It was magnificent to be there. Sometimes we politicians underestimate the great opportunities we have to be invited to such wonderful events as Singfest in Tasmania. It was absolutely magnificent.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know that Larmenier school has a great choir, but they were unable to be in Singfest this year. I look forward to them being in Singfest next year. I congratulate Nelson Tabe, president of Singfest, for the work that he did to organise this wonderful event. I am confident that there are many potential musical stars in the electorate of Bass, and I look forward to their performance next year.
