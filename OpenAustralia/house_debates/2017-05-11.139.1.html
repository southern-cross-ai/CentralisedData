        Today I rise to speak about the important initiatives by the Turnbull government to tackle the challenges of brain cancer. A few weeks ago, I had the honour of attending the launch of the fifth annual Connor's Run, a charity event organised by the Robert Connor Dawes Foundation in the wonderful electorate of Goldstein. The foundation was established by Connor's parents after his battle with terminal brain cancer. Liz and Scott Dawes have channelled Connor's positive fighting spirit into an event to raise money to combat childhood brain cancers. Connor's personal mantra during the ordeal was: 'I will be awesome!' I love that. And this determination to overcome and be awesome is reflected in the idea of the annual fun run from the bay to Melbourne. This year I will take part in the 10-kilometre section running from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Kilda" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        to the city and ending at the banks of the Yarra. I have already started training, as have many people in the wonderful electorate of Goldstein. They know that brain cancers are one of the most fatal of all childhood cancers.
       </p>
       <p>
        The awesome work of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RCD" rel="nofollow">
         RCD
        </a>
        Foundation has helped it raise over $1.7 million for 63 projects. One of the key projects they have been working on is helping the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Children's_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Children's Hospital
        </a>
        and youth with brain cancer. The federal government, the Turnbull Liberal government, helped support that in this budget. I will quote directly the message from the RCD Foundation in celebrating this wonderful achievement:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Australian government announced $1.4 million milestone funding of paediatric brain cancer research, including the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIM" rel="nofollow">
         AIM
        </a>
        BRAIN project, which is an initiative of the RCD Foundation with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_and_New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         Australia and New Zealand
        </a>
        Children's Haematology/Oncology Group. So why should we all be so excited about that? Because this is a government acknowledgement that paediatric brain cancer research is important and needs more funding. It is significant that the Australian government has chosen to partner with the RCD Foundation. The charity is only four years old but has already worked to uncover the greatest opportunity to help children diagnosed with brain cancer. The AIM BRAIN project will impact every child in Australia and New Zealand diagnosed with brain cancer. We know it is important, and now the government agrees.
       </p>
       <p>
        I could not agree more with the RCD Foundation, because this is a significant contribution by the federal government to tackle the challenges ahead. I am very proud to have been able to speak to Liz Dawes as part of that, and also at the recent launch of Connor's Run, and to express my very sincere support for the incredible work that she and her team do and that the foundation continues to do.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not only the work of the Dawes family that inspires us and inspires the Turnbull government to make a contribution and commit this funding; it is also a reflection of the incredible efforts of the Goldstein community and their spirit. What happened with the RCD Foundation is that we took a terrible tragedy and worked together to develop a project that everybody can unite behind.

         It being 10.30, I understand it is the wish of the Federation Chamber to continue with constituency statements for approximately 90 minutes. If no member objects, we will follow that course of action.
