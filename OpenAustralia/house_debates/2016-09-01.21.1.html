        I ask leave of the House to amend the notice relating to the proposed amendments to the standing orders in the terms as circulated.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.

        (b) On Mondays, if any Member draws the attention of the Speaker to the state of the House between 10 am and 12 noon, the Speaker shall announce that he or she will count the House at 12 noon, if the Member then so desires.

        (f) If a quorum is in fact present when a Member draws attention to the state of the House, the Speaker may name the Member in accordance with standing order 94(b) (sanctions against disorderly conduct).

       <p>
        In moving this motion, I might just explain the process and what we are proposing to do with the standing orders. Yesterday we made a number of noncontroversial changes to the standing orders as agreed between the opposition, the crossbenchers and the government and today we are moving another change. Then, when we return on 12 September, there may well be other changes that we can agree between the government, the opposition and the crossbenchers. Of course, where we do not agree we might still pursue those changes, depending on the government's attitude at the time.

         <p>
          We will see how we go and how the opposition is behaving. These changes will mean that the divisions and quorums process, which at the moment is suspended between 6.30 pm and 8 pm, will be moved to between 7.30 pm and 9 pm. So there will be no divisions or quorums between 7.30 pm and 9 pm, rather than between 6.30 pm and 8 pm. So it is the same period of time and the same amount of government business can be done. Simply, between 7.30 and nine o'clock there will be no divisions or quorums except when we achieve leave of the opposition. There may be occasions when there does need to be a bill passed, particularly around national security issues. That is often the case when that happens. When we need to do that we will seek leave of the opposition to do so, and by leave a division might be held.
         </p>
         <p>
          This will mean that between 7.30 and nine o'clock on Mondays and Tuesdays members of parliament will be able to do their committee work, whether it is for standing committees of the House, joint standing committees with the Senate or backbench committees, without interruption. Ministers will be able to hold meetings without interruption for divisions and quorums, as will other members of the House. It makes for a much more sensible way of doing government business—and opposition business, for that matter—and much better management of the House and the parliament. I think it will lead to better outcomes for the government and also for the health of members.
         </p>
         <p>
          Of course, the 6.30 pm to 8.00 pm period is usually called the dinner break. I do not know of any members who actually leave the House during that time but I am sure there are some. I do not and I cannot remember the last time I did, quite frankly. It is probably not since before I was first a minister—or shadow minister, for that matter—which is now over 10 years. There was an interregnum. There was the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd interregnum, which I have tried to keep out of my memory bank; that was an unpleasant period. Most people do not use that time for a dinner break, and this will move it to a more sensible time. People who have dinner in the House will be able to do so without being interrupted. So I do commend the change to the standing orders to the House. I think it will be wildly popular with the people who work in this building. And I thank the opposition for their bipartisan support for this change.

          </small>
          <p>
           The opposition will be supporting the amendments to standing orders that are in front of us at the moment. They have been the subject of a negotiation. Like the Leader of the House, I have to say that whatever time the dinner break is meant to be is irrelevant to most of us. It makes a difference only to the extent that committee meetings and other things that are organised around the place can be guaranteed to occur without divisions.
          </p>
          <p>
           The opposition sought a particular change to standing orders, which is included in the amendment. Up until now, during these periods it has been possible for a division to be called anyway if a minister came in and simply moved a motion of that nature. This amendment says that can happen only by leave. It means that the capacity that has always been there for government members, in being able to schedule events during that period, will now be available for non-government members as well.
          </p>
          <p>
           With that, I thank the Leader of the House for what was a constructive negotiation. I will not say it was terse, but there were different moments during the process of the negotiation. There have been a number of different proposals floated for changes to standing orders. Some of them came up in the weekend media and amount to absolute atrocities. They are not in front of us at the moment. We are told that whether or not they will be in the future will depend on the 'mood' of the Leader of the House—which means that at a later date anything could happen. As to what is in front of us at the moment, the opposition will be supporting the amendments.
