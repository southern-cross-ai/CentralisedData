       <p>
        I rise tonight to pay tribute to two very special constituents and their extraordinary efforts in raising public awareness for their respective causes. One of the most rewarding things about being an MP is having the opportunity of meeting inspirational people dedicated to their cause—people like Tess Macartney and Anne Atkin.
       </p>
       <p>
        I first met Tess Macartney and her mother, Mairi-Anne, when Tess had just been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes as a 10-year-old. Following her diagnosis, Tess became a youth ambassador for diabetes and had the opportunity to describe her experience of being diagnosed with diabetes and the life changes and challenges that occurred after this diagnosis. As a youth ambassador she conducted fundraising at her local school and was part of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remember_Me" rel="nofollow">
         Remember Me
        </a>
        campaign, which in part raised awareness about child diabetes and funding to help find a cure for this debilitating condition.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tess has now become the face of another campaign, which has been raising awareness of carers allowance eligibility for carers of children with type 1 diabetes. The gover­nment has sought an independent review to ensure that a decision includes consideration of submissions by affected families as well as community and medical representatives. I commend Tess's and her mother's strong stance on this important issue and the widespread community support that they have received, most notably from the local
        <i>
         Leader
        </i>
        newspaper, which has established a Facebook group and raised public awareness of this issue by documenting week by week the challenges of everyday families in this situation. This is a tough time for the Macartney family and others in their situation, but their efforts in raising public awareness about diabetes are a tribute to their courage and their strength.
       </p>
       <p>
        I now wish to pay tribute to another very special person, Anne Atkin, a very special member of the local community. Anne recently published a book entitled
        <i>
         Living and Laughing with Parkinson's,
        </i>
        which, in a witty, uncomplicated and moving way, provides an understanding of the major life changes that occurred to Anne and her loved ones both prior to and after her being diagnosed with Parkinson's. Anne was diagnosed with Parkinson's at the age of 55. Since then she has worked tirelessly and passionately to promote awareness of Parkinson's in the broader community and to help those battling the disease. In particular, she has discovered and passed on to others the remarkable remedial benefits that artistic expression—in particular, painting—has had on her condition.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a dedicated teacher in her earlier life, Anne has an obvious passion for teaching and helping inspire others to self-development. Anne believes you can fight to have a life with Parkinson's disease, so she founded Painting with Parkinson's in Victoria, which includes coordinating a group of members who suffer from Parkinson's disease—affectionately termed by Anne as 'fellow parkies'. Through her leadership of the group, Anne helps others experience the transformation that occurred with her own life, passing on this unique painting therapy which has had a profound effect on sufferers' confidence, creativity and wellbeing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Through her encouragement of self-discovery, Anne has empowered countless other sufferers of Parkinson's to regain their lives and reconnect with the community. Anne has established Painting with Parkinson's classes in Portland, Shepparton and Melton. As an ambassador for Parkinson's Victoria, she travels to all three locations regularly to provide support and encouragement and also to carry out a study for Parkinson's Victoria on behalf of this particular group. Anne has organised art exhibitions where the wider community is invited to view the artwork and learn about Parkinson's, often dispelling common myths and stereotypes in the process.
       </p>
       <p>
        Anne actively contributes and collaborates with neurologists and neuropsychiatrists to broaden fields of academic research and to recognise the healing properties of artistic expression on Parkinson's and mental illness. Recently Anne's achievements have become internationally recognised. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Parkinson_Congress" rel="nofollow">
         World Parkinson Congress
        </a>
        selected Anne to contribute her ideas to international Parkin­son's exhibitions. Anne was one of four from Australia to do so. In 2009 Anne was also rewarded for her efforts by receiving an award for services to people with a disability through the arts by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Casey" rel="nofollow">
         City of Casey
        </a>
        via its volunteer awards.
       </p>
       <p>
        This book I am holding here,
        <i>
         Living and Laughing with Parkinson's
        </i>
        , is an amazing book. Anne said she wrote the book because she would have liked to read something like it when she was in the early days of her diagnosis—something that was not too heavy and not too light but, as the ad goes, just right. This book is really illuminating. It is divided into sections on the symptoms of Parkinson's and how to deal with those symptoms. It is an incredible book. It is written by someone with extraordinary courage. I will have the great honour of launching it this Saturday. For those people who can buy this book to learn more about Parkinson's, please do. It is an incredible tribute to an absolutely incredible woman.
