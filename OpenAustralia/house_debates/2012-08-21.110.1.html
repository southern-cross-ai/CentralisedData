        I rise today to talk about a very serious issue for my home state of Tasmania. There is a big threat heading to my electorate of Bass at the weekend. A big, dark cloud is coming, and it stems from the other side of this chamber. The Leader of the Opposition,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
         Tony Abbott
        </a>
        , is headed to Tasmania this weekend to meet his party faithful for their state council. While he is there, he needs to explain to the people of Tasmania why he is planning to rip hundreds of millions of dollars from the Tasmanian economy. He needs to explain to the Tasmanian people why he has now stated on two occasions that he feels the current

        distribution method is unfair and needs to be reviewed. He has advocating a per capita arrangement which will have a devastating effect on my state. He said he had 'long been sympathetic' to Premier Colin Barnett on this issue, who is one of the biggest proponents of a change. He went on to say:

       <p class="italic">
        This is the unified position of the Coalition premiers. I think it makes a lot of sense.
       </p>
       <p>
        Well, it does not make one ounce of sense to me. The proposed change would boost revenues for the biggest states—

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Let me tell you, there are many concerned teachers, nurses, police and doctors in my electorate who are worried about their jobs and worried about the future of our state. You cannot blame them. We have seen the devastating effects of a Liberal government on the public service jobs recently. Just look at Queensland. It is about time the Leader of the Opposition realised Australia is a nation and stopped pitting state against state. He has a different tune for every crowd. Our Federation has survived 111 years. The notion of a fair go is being put in danger by this Leader of the Opposition and his dangerous pandering to his Liberal mates in the rich resource states.

        , as conservative Prime Minister, introduced a fair go via the Grants Commission in 1933. He would be turning in his grave with this Leader of the Opposition. His $630 million cut to Tasmania's share of GST revenue would devastate my state's economy. The state government has already been forced to consider school closures and cuts to health services. Imagine what this Liberal attack on GST revenue would do to the smaller states. Our state's unemployment rate is also already higher than the national average, and his plan would put many more jobs in danger, not to mention the devastating flow-on effect to the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Leader of the Opposition, like his state Tasmanian colleagues, talk our state down at every opportunity. They are blind to some of the great projects and innovations that are happening in Tasmania, which I have highlighted in this chamber on a regular basis. Australia's economy does have patchwork pressures and, though our economic fundamentals are strong, there are pressures on some industries and some regions. Throughout our history the fortunes of towns, cities and states have shifted with the economic winds of the day. But there is one constant: the benefits of a united Australia to ensure a fair go for all Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        What the people of Tasmania will soon realise is that the Liberal Party are a threat to Tasmanian jobs in health care, education and police. They are a threat to Tasmanian families, and it is a threat we cannot afford. Tasmanians should be extremely concerned about this Leader of the Opposition breezing in and failing to reassure Tasmanians that he would not rip $600 million each year out of our state's economy, and they will hold him to account. The fact is that he is happy to tell his West Australian Liberal colleagues what they want to hear only to ignore the real fears of Tasmanians. Where are the member for Warringah's allegiances?
       </p>
       <p>
        It is now up to Tasmanian Liberals, like Mr Hodgman and Senator Abetz, to stand up for Tasmania and fight for horizontal fiscal equalisation. It is my understanding that the member for Franklin has written to Senator Abetz on this issue, in July, and he did not even bother to respond.

        , the Tasmanian Minister for Health, has said the combined Liberal cuts would mean the combined loss of 800 doctors, 3,000 nurses, 500 allied health professionals and over 100 child protection staff in Tasmania. The member for Warringah has not had an in-depth interview for some years, protected by minders and lazy journalists or Tory-protecting editors. I wonder if they will get a chance this weekend—
