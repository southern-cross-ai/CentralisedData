        I rise today in absolute and utter condemnation. That absolute and utter condemnation is directed at

        party. It's a party whose entire existence is based on a pathetic strategy of making outrageous claims to generate headlines. It's a strategy that is harmful and dangerous. I cannot believe I have to stand here today and argue that domestic violence is a bad thing. I cannot believe I have to stand here and make note of how damaging the legislation that the Queensland wing of

        has proposed is. They say they are 'thinking of the children' but really they're throwing vulnerable children into the crossfire. One Nation are using children as a political tool. It is absolutely despicable behaviour. Pauline Hanson and her Queensland leader,

        Just over an hour ago I was speaking on the phone to Estrelle from Caboolture Regional Domestic Violence Service. She's an expert in the field of domestic violence, having supported countless victims in the

        region. She was shocked and appalled at One Nation's policy. She said, 'Has anybody from One Nation consulted with the experts, looked at the figures, spoken to victims?' Estrelle noted, when she was speaking to me, how perpetrators of domestic violence are already using children to get to their partners—manipulating them into attacking them both verbally and physically—and now One Nation want to make things worse. One Nation's domestic violence spokesperson described their policy by saying that a victim must 'prove victimisation through injuries; otherwise visitation should not be restricted'. Can you believe that, Madam Deputy Speaker? It essentially means that unless a victim, be they a woman or a man, has a black eye, One Nation want to push their children back into the hands of the perpetrator. In doing this they are showing absolute disregard for the welfare of children, all for the sake of some headlines or

        interviews. Nearly 26,000 offenders breached protection orders last year—26,000 offenders. How many children involved in those situations would be forced back under One Nation's policy?
