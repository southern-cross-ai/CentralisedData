        Last week the Nationals held their first party room meeting of the year in my electorate of Hinkler. The party's visit was a clear demonstration of the Nationals' commitment to regional Australia. It gave my community an opportunity to show the rest of the country that after a tough couple of years of natural disasters Hinkler is open for business.

        A year on from the floods and tornadoes, as part of the visit Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss and I announced that repairs to the rock wall at the port of Bundaberg would be underwritten by the federal and Queensland governments by natural disaster recovery and relief arrangements. While it is anticipated that insurers will meet a significant part of the costs, the announcement of government funding for the shortfall will ensure that the wall is repaired more quickly. Shipping access to the port is vital to local industries and jobs, which is why the now Prime Minister,

        , and I made the commitment prior to the election to get it fixed. Since the election I have been in regular contact with Mr Truss's office to ensure the matter is resolved.

        The sugar industry is just one group reliant on the port. The sugar industry generates around $230 million a year for the

        Local constituents were encouraged and heartened by their genuine interest in the issues that are impacting their daily lives. I would like to thank my colleagues for their support and their willingness to engage with the Hinkler community. I trust that what they learnt will inform their deliberations here in this place.
