        My question is to the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment. Will the minister update the House on how the government's trade policies are supporting jobs of hardworking Australians. How does this compare to other approaches?

         I thank the member for Parkes for his question because this side of the House has a very strong track record when it comes to delivering for hardworking Australians on trade, tourism and investment, and particularly on trade. It was this side of the House that delivered the three
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Asian" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         powerhouse agreements with China, with Japan and with Korea. It was also this government that put in place the comprehensive upgrade to the Singapore-Australia Free Trade Agreement. So we have a long track record now of putting in place trade agreements that are making a material difference to the exports that Australia is able to ship to the world. We are a government that is committed to making sure that we continue to open up more markets for Australian exporters. The direct consequence of the policy settings and the market access—the world's best preferential access—that we are getting into export markets has been that we have been able to grow the Australian economy more strongly and drive Australian jobs.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our record stands in very stark contrast to that of that side when they were last in government. When Labor were last in government, their track record on trade policy was very different to our track record. In fact, if you look at my main priority right now, which is to focus on putting in place a comprehensive economic partnership agreement with Indonesia, I am having to repair the damage that was done by this mob when they were last in government because no-one over in Indonesia has forgotten the track record of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         when, overnight, they closed the gates on Australia's live export industry. No-one in Indonesia forgets the fact that, when Labor turned their backs on that protein supply for Indonesia, they not only did damage to Indonesia but also did incredible damage to the livelihoods of Australians back here at home. Those people who work the land, those people who rely on live exports and those people whose mortgage payments depend upon being able to export cattle to Indonesia were the people that Labor turned their backs on because they were more determined to make some point on principle than they were to make a rational, mature decision about the future of Australian markets.
        </p>
        <p>
         The simple fact is this: you cannot trust Labor on trade policy because they make knee-jerk judgements like calling the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement—arguably the best deal this country has seen for many years—a 'dud deal'. The simple facts are: when it comes to trade policy, Labor cannot be trusted; when it comes to the budget, Labor means black holes; when it comes to energy policy, Labor means blackouts; and when it comes to trade policy, Labor means a black day for our exporters.
