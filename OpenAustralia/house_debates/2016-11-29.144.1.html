        Small communities are the hubs of rural Australia. One community in the far western reaches of my electorate of Capricornia is Clermont. Clermont is a region rich in cattle production and coalmining. Indeed, the Adani Carmichael coalmine planned for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">

        is 160 kilometres from the Clermont townships. Next month I will be visiting Clermont. I want to take this opportunity to update the House on some of the funding initiatives that the Turnbull Joyce government has announced to support the people in and around the Clermont region. One of the critical things a regional community needs is water infrastructure. We are providing $225,000 to improve water access from Clermont via
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theresa_Creek_Dam" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . This is an important boost to the Clermont township. A further major investment from this government is for an upgrade of the notorious Clermont Alpha Road. The Turnbull Joyce government will put a further $6.97 million towards progressively sealing another section of the Clermont Alpha Road under the Northern Australia Beef Roads Program. Using
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSIRO" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        research, this program shows that by gradually improving the gravel sections on the road, we can help the Clermont beef industry, improve efficiency and productivity, and, ultimately, save money when it comes to the transportation of cattle to market.

        To benefit people living in regional and remote areas, the Liberal-National government offers grants under a scheme called the National Stronger Regions Fund. Several community groups have benefitted from the program at Clermont. The Clermont Rugby League Club received $6,624 to help install an electronic scoreboard at the Clermont Sports Centre. The Blair Athol Recreation Hall Association received $10,317 to help upgrade the Blair Athol Hall. Clermont Kindy and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_Care" rel="nofollow">

        was awarded an $11,454 grant to build a new play area. Clermont's Wildlife Rescue Service was granted $3,000 to help care for rescued native animals and orphaned joeys. We have also helped deliver to the Clermont Men's Shed a $2,000 grant. As well as this, we have previously provided Clermont Historical Centre with $3,112 for an Anzac Heroes and Heroines exhibition. Clermont's St Joseph Catholic Primary School was awarded a $7,624 grant for a Centenary of Anzac commemorative walkway. To further help business growth in the town, I have placed Clermont at the top of my list in the push for improved mobile coverage under the federal government's Mobile Black Spot Program. I look forward to catching up with representatives from the Clermont Bears and the Blair Athol Recreation Hall Association when I visit Clermont shortly.
