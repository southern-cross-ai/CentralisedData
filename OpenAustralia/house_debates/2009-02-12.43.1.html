        <p>
         I thank the House for the opportunity to speak. Over the last few days I have met survivors, firefighters and volunteers in many towns in Victoria—Whittlesea, Yea, Alexandra, Wallan and Traralgon, just to name a few—and I have heard their extraordinary stories of escape and survival and their tragic stories of loss. On Sunday I spoke to a woman who was still waiting to hear the fate of her family, and unfortunately it is the case that many, many people are still waiting—and it is an agonising wait. There are so many accounts of modest heroes: neighbours, friends, firefighters and strangers who risked their lives to save the lives of others. In Marysville, the Prime Minister and I saw the seared and twisted wreckage of homes, churches and all the shops—the whole main street gone.
        </p>
        <p>
         These people, our fellow Australians, have suffered inexpressible shock and trauma, and healing will take a long time. But even in these early days, despite their terrible loss, they have extraordinary hope for the future. Whether it is the people in Kinglake, Marysville, Wandong, Flowerdale, Churchill or any of the other communities, they are not about to give up. Overnight, some of them have become citizens of tent cities, each night going to sleep under the canvas, but they are already planning and thinking about how they can go back and start again. They want to get back to their towns and back to their farms to get on with the job of sorting through the wreckage and salvaging what they can. Already I have spoken to farmers out in their paddocks, assessing their losses but getting down to work.
        </p>
        <p>
         Those whose homes are still standing are taking in those who have no home. In Alexandra one family had 18 people in their home. They are sharing their stories of escape and survival. They are regathering and regrouping. They know, and we know, that their losses are enormous. But one thing is for sure: they have not lost their sense of community—bound together by incredible courage and sacrifice and, most of all, an incomparable generosity of spirit. It is that same generosity of spirit and determination which at a national level is driving everybody’s response. While we do remain a nation in shock, we are also a nation mobilised to help. We are ready and willing to tackle the huge task ahead, to help people rebuild the bricks and mortar of their lives, and to accommodate their indestructible spirit of community.
        </p>
        <p>
         Overwhelmingly, that spirit of community, the notion of belonging and of reaching out, will never be destroyed—not even by the fiercest flames. It is alive and well in each of the relief centres that I visited, where the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation_Army" rel="nofollow">
          Salvation Army
         </a>
         are working alongside government agencies, banks, insurance companies and the most extraordinary number of volunteers. The last few days have reminded us that Australians, being who we are, are not the sort of people who stand by and do nothing. And over and over, everywhere I have been this week, it is there for us all to see. People were arriving in Wallan the other day with literally carloads of clothing, baby food, toiletries and the little things that one woman knows another woman might need. People are not only rolling up their sleeves to make sure that the survivors have those practical things but also extending a hand of human kindness. People are holding others’ hands and sitting with them in these terrible times. It is true that we still have to be vigilant and aware of the continuing threat of the fires. But, while that happens, work on reconstruction and recovery has begun.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction and Recovery Authority has now been established to begin this task, and I will be working closely with the Victorian government, offering the full support of this government. I have already had discussions with the head of the authority, Major General Cantwell, someone who is well equipped to take up the challenge of recovery and reconstruction—a soldier for 35 years with front-line experience in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia" rel="nofollow">
          Saudi Arabia
         </a>
         , Iraq and Kuwait. He will be working closely with the Victoria Police Chief Commissioner,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Nixon" rel="nofollow">
          Christine Nixon
         </a>
         . His first task is to assess the immediate action required: for those whose homes are still standing, this means restoring essential services like electricity and water, and this is an urgent task; where homes and properties have been lost, this means making sure that people have somewhere to live. Then the authority will move to the permanent rebuilding, cutting through the bureaucracy and getting the job done—as the Prime Minister said, rebuilding, ‘… brick by brick, school by school, community hall by community hall,’ restoring the infrastructure which brings communities together. So many of the sporting fields, churches and community centres have been destroyed. These are the things that need to be replaced urgently so that people can come together to meet and connect. We will be doing this, of course, across government but also, and probably much more importantly, connecting with the experience and capacity of our emergency and relief services, the community and volunteer organisations, until the job is done.
        </p>
        <p>
         The public display of sorrow and sympathy of the last few days has made it obvious that, just as governments stand ready to do everything that we can to rebuild the lives of people and communities, so do the people of Australia. With so many deaths, so many of our people hurt and suffering, Australians everywhere want to extend the hand of human kindness. Financially, everybody’s contribution has been just overwhelming. But many other people want to do practical things. Many of them have been doing practical things: preparing meals and, of course, fighting the fires. There are so many other things that will need to be done into the future, and I do want to encourage anyone who is listening to register with the Victorian Bushfire Volunteer Hotline, and to remember that right now what the volunteer organisations are saying to us is that money is the best form of help but that in a little while they will certainly need the practical help from volunteers so that we, together, can really help people, as they harness their sorrow and grief, to put all of our energy into practical and useful purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is true that the lives of the fire survivors have changed forever. But they are resilient—very resilient—people. Many of them have told me that they will not be beaten by this tragedy—that they are ready to take on the huge challenge of rebuilding and starting over. But they are realists as well. They understand that rebuilding will take months—years, in some cases. It is going to be a very long-term investment. And they did ask me, on more than one occasion, whether the Australian government would be with them, supporting them all the way. And I was able to say to them that we will be there with them for the long haul, and that they will have our support and, I am sure, the support of the Australian people for as long as it takes.

           Introduction

         </b>
         <p>
          As the recovery efforts are continuing, we are learning more about the scale of this disaster, and in a few moments I will provide the House with an update on the recovery efforts.
         </p>
         <p>
          In these times there are also stories of the extraordinary heroism and courage of ordinary people as the destructive firestorm swept across Victoria on Saturday and Sunday. These are stories that simply take your breath away. Stories like that of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFA" rel="nofollow">
           CFA
          </a>
          captain Barry Mapley, who with his crew came across a couple in a ute surrounded by fires in the Mudgegonga fire near Beechworth on Saturday. The couple, Amelia Coombes and Paul Mercieca were trying to get away from their house that was alight, while gas bottles from their welding shed were exploding one by one. Then Ms Coombes’s hair caught fire. She thought for sure she was going to die. But Barry and his crew drove up to them, turned on their hoses, and threw Ms Coombes a blanket. The couple survived the fire as a result. People have told Mr Mapley he is a hero. But he is reported in today’s papers as saying:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          I’m not a bloody hero. It’s just the Aussie way.
         </p>
         <p>
          Barry Mapley is a hero. He is a genuine Australian hero.
         </p>
         <p>
          Another hero of these fires is
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thorneycroft" rel="nofollow">
           Peter Thorneycroft
          </a>
          of Kinglake. Again, he says he is no hero. He is the bloke who climbed onto the roof of the Kinglake National Park Hotel when the fire was roaring around the pub and threatening to send it up in flames. At the time 20 women and children were sheltering in the coolroom of the pub. Another 400 locals were piled into cars around the pub, and were at great risk if the building caught fire. Mr Thorneycroft spent an hour on the roof dousing the hot ash and wetting vents and drains with water while other brave locals handed him up buckets of water. There, in the papers today, is the unforgettable picture of him standing calmly on the roof—dressed in a pair of shorts and thongs, no shirt—as the sky blazed orange around him. And he did this carrying a serious arm injury. His wife Jodie says he has not had the injury operated on because he cannot afford to take a year off work to recover. The houses opposite the pub had all exploded, the witnesses say, and that if Peter had not done what he did, the pub would have gone up too. Peter says:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          There’s no-one who’s heroic—you just do it.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          … Everyone’s forgotten about their own lives—they just did what they did.
         </p>
         <p>
          Peter Thorneycroft is an Australian hero. He is a genuine Australian hero. There are so many others like Barry Mapley and Peter Thorneycroft, and in the days to come no doubt we will hear more of their stories. We need to hear these stories, because so much of the rest of what we are hearing is so grim.

         </b>
         <p>
          As I mentioned to the House yesterday, it is estimated that around 5,000 Victorians have been made homeless by the fires. Of course, many are staying with extended family or friends but for others this not an option and we need to make urgent arrangements to assist them. I can also report to the House today that I have instructed the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Defence Force
          </a>
          to make available to the government of Victoria short-term accommodation for up to 2,000 people. The Australian Defence Force will also be providing meals and other facilities at each of the locations that have been made available. Up to 1,200 beds will be made available at Puckapunyal near Seymour in communal accommodation. Pucka in particular is in reasonable proximity to a number of the fire affected areas. Puckapunyal is approximately 30 kilometres from Wandong and less than an hour from the main staging areas.
         </p>
         <p>
          At the Maygar Barracks, in the vicinity of Broadmeadows, north of Melbourne, approximately 150 beds will be made available. The Maygar Barracks are approximately 40 kilometres from Whittlesea and within one hour of the main staging areas. The

           RAAF
          </a>
          base in East Sale will provide accommodation for up to 500 people in a mix of individual and communal accommodation, including 150 places with disabled access. The East Sale base is approximately 70 kilometres from the fire sites and, given current road conditions, around one or two hours driving time.

Each of these facilities is being made available now as a short-term measure while the Bushfire Reconstruction and Recovery Authority works on longer-term solutions to the housing needs of the fire victims.

           Update on Centrelink

         </b>
         <p>
          I also wish to provide the House with an update on the assistance being provided on the ground by Centrelink further to the information provided by the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. By yesterday evening, Centrelink had made 3,123 Australian government disaster recovery payments and claims continue to be processed today. These claims represent support to over 4,500 adults and children. To date, nearly $3.7 million in payments has been distributed to families directly affected by the disaster. Seventy social workers are also being made available on the ground at the recovery centres, at relief centres, at Centrelink offices or over the phone as additional support for families during this important time.
         </p>
         <p>
          The government has reiterated to staff at the front line that they should be lenient in requiring proof of identity for the purpose of claims. Centrelink is moving more staff into the area and now has in excess of 320 staff handling the Australian government disaster recovery payments claims to help ensure that claims are processed within 24 hours.

         </b>
         <p>
          As I mentioned to the House yesterday, for the 5,000 or so Victorians made homeless by these fires it is crucial that their insurance claims are processed swiftly so that they can start rebuilding their lives. The Assistant Treasurer is continuing to be in regular contact with the Insurance Council of Australia to receive updates on how the insurers are assisting those who have lost their homes and businesses. The Insurance Council has informed the government that they are urgently putting into place a mechanism to allow them to play a coordinating role for the industry so that there are insurance industry representatives to assist fire victims in all recovery centres. The government has also put in place arrangements to assist those who are having difficulties with their insurers or their insurance claims. The

           Financial Ombudsman Service
          </a>
          , which is responsible for complaints handling for the insurance industry, has established a dedicated hotline to assist bushfire victims with any insurance problems. The Assistant Treasurer will shortly brief the House in greater detail on these arrangements.

          In the past 24 hours there have been some disturbing stories of banks not responding appropriately to the hardship being experienced by bushfire victims. The Treasurer and his department have been in regular contact with the Australian Bankers Association, with the association representing credit unions and building societies, Abacus, and with individual financial institutions over the past few days. The

          and Abacus have indicated their members have announced emergency assistance packages to relieve the hardship being experienced by bushfire victims. This includes temporary suspension of home loan repayments, loan restructuring, the waiver of fees, providing additional loan funds where appropriate and emergency credit limit increases on credit cards.

         <p>
          The banking industry fully understands that the government and the community expect banks to show the utmost compassion and flexibility when dealing with those who have been affected by these extraordinary natural disasters. I am aware there have been some concerns expressed on radio about how one bank is treating its customers. The Treasurer has today spoken with the

I understand that the bank in question has issued a public statement to clarify the situation. If other customers feel unfairly treated they can contact the Financial Ombudsman Service on 1300 780 808. In addition, they can also seek assistance from ASIC on 1300 300 630.

         <p>
          Around the country there has been an outpouring of support and offers of help. As we saw on last night’s television reports, food, clothing and other essentials are being sent to the emergency centres from across Australia. There are food suppliers, retailers, warehouse employees and truck drivers who are donating their time and resources to help the thousands of victims of these fires. My office has received many emails and letters, as I am sure all members’ offices have, that reflect the spirit with which Australians are responding to this tragedy, such as a farmer offering 850 bales of hay to help other farmers in distress; many Australians who want to donate their economic stimulus bonus payments to bushfire victims; a prison officer in Goulburn who emailed me this morning saying that he and a number of his fellow officers would like to donate their accumulated recreation leave to the fire victims; a lady from

          </a>
          who emailed to say she will use her annual leave to assist in any way possible; and others who have no money but want to donate clothing, bedding and other supplies. These expressions of support are not just coming from across Australia; they are coming from across the world. A lady from Cypress in Texas emailed me with these touching words:

          are asking people to make only cash donations because they now have so many clothes and blankets. But of course the survivors are going to need a lot more in the weeks, months and years ahead. The Australian government and the government of Victoria will continue to do all that we can to provide for their immediate needs and to help them put their lives back together while we also work to prevent such a catastrophe occurring again. As we work together on the recovery and the reconstruction efforts in the days and weeks ahead, we must also learn from the past and we must also act on the lessons from the past—from this catastrophe and from earlier catastrophes.

The President of Indonesia indicated that Australia has always dug deep in helping Indonesia in its times of national catastrophe and disaster and that he, as President of Indonesia, wishes simply to convey to the people of Australia that he is not just a neighbour but a friend.

Sir Michael asked me to make one point to all members assembled, and that was again to say that, whenever natural calamities have hit Papua New Guinea in the past, Australia, through the Australian Defence Force and through other Australian aid agencies, has always been first into the fray and that, in this small way, he too wishes to reflect to the Australian people that they are not just a neighbour but a friend. It is good to have, at times like this, neighbours who are indeed friends.

           On indulgence: on behalf of the opposition, I thank the Prime Minister and the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs for their report. Today we join with the Prime Minister in honouring the heroism of the men and women who have battled these terrible fires in Victoria. We also join with the Prime Minister in thanking the thousands of people from all around the world who have expressed their condolences, who have sent their love and who, of course, have made generous financial contributions. We acknowledge in particular the condolence messages from

           . We also note the touching generosity of our neighbours in the region and thank them for it as well. Prime Minister, I thank you for the courtesy you have shown me as we have discussed these matters, in particular the establishment of a national day of mourning and a service of mourning. You are quite right—the nation is grieving and a focus for that grief is of enormous importance.
          </p>
          <p>
           We have raised a number of matters of concern we have in common. The Prime Minister has spoken about insurance, and I look forward to discussing with him in the near future the proposal that we made yesterday for a special disaster insurance commissioner. We also look forward to there being bipartisan parliamentary representation on the reconstruction authority. As the House recalls, we propose that the Hon.

           be a member of that reconstruction authority. Equally, while we recognise the very important role the royal commission will play, so this parliament has an important role to play in reviewing these tragic events, particularly in the light of other recent inquiries. Again, we look forward to discussing the establishment of a joint select committee to look into this.

           , our local councils and community groups and people across Australia who, until a week ago, were to us total strangers. Today they are our friends.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           The need for understanding and assistance will last long after the final flames have been doused and the smoke clears from our valleys.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           In the coming months, and probably years, there is much to be done in rebuilding our communities.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           The immediate priority remains providing help for our residents to regain some degree of normality in their lives—the basics of clothing, food and toiletries; finding more suitable accommodation beyond tents, cars or staying with family or friends; ensuring that assistance and insurance claims are promptly and compassionately assessed.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           We must also be mindful of children, who have experienced horrors totally unexpected for their young years, as they return to schools, sometimes a new school.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           And there will be the massive clean-up task that our communities must face, an important step towards rebuilding townships properly planned to maximise the safety of our people and with improved facilities and resources.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           The utter devastation across our communities will require not only the spirit of the last week but considerable ongoing financial support from all levels of government as we rebuild entire towns.
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Some announcements have already been made and I will continue to work with our communities as we move from this period of grief and shock to putting in action our dreams for the future of our towns.
          </p>
          <p>
           Fran has also asked me to say to the House how grateful the people of Victoria and her community are for the numerous offers of assistance and help. She is overwhelmed by the generosity. She has asked me to say, however, that just because some offers of help, such as offers of building materials and offers from trades men and women to come and rebuild, cannot be taken up immediately that does not mean they are not appreciated—far from it; they are deeply appreciated and will be taken up in the weeks ahead when the fires are extinguished and the areas are stabilised.
          </p>
          <p>
           She asked me to conclude with two important points. First: please keep being generous. The dollars are very important.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">
            The Red Cross
           </a>
           and the Salvation Army, as the Prime Minister has said, have asked for cash donations; that is extremely important. So Fran says: ‘Keep up the flow of money. It is vital to help rebuild these communities and vitally needed now.’ Finally, she says, ‘Above all, let’s all pray for rain.’

           </small>
           <p>
            I rise to add my voice to those who have spoken on this motion of condolence and to give the House an update in relation to insurance matters in particular. As people return to their properties and try to put their shattered lives back together, they need to know that they are not alone. The speedy and compassionate resolution of insurance claims will be an important part of rebuilding these communities and of rebuilding lives.
           </p>
           <p>
            As the Prime Minister has already outlined to the House, the government have been in regular contact with the Insurance Council of Australia and with some individual insurers over recent days. The government have made it clear that we expect insurers to act with compassion and understanding and in a flexible manner to process claims as quickly as possible. As of this morning there have been 4,100 insurance claims lodged. Insurers are putting claims staff and assessors on the ground as soon as possible and as access to affected areas is granted by the relevant authorities. I am informed that there are already several hundred assessors available to enter bushfire affected areas when permission is given.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Insurance Council of Australia has also activated a catastrophe recovery task force to coordinate assistance to those who have concerns or questions about their insurance claims. The Master Builders Association has joined this task force to assist with the supply of trades and supplies for the rebuilding efforts. I have reminded insurers that the government expects insurers to have a strong presence on the ground in emergency centres and affected towns as access is made available. Last night, the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs advised the Prime Minister and me that, while many relief centres have representation by insurance companies so that policyholders can lodge claims at those relief centres, there were some relief centres without that representation. Last night the Insurance Council undertook to remedy that situation. I am advised that, as of today, there should be representation by at least one insurance company at each relief centre and that the last relief centre to receive such a representative will receive one by tomorrow morning at the latest.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is important that red tape and frustration for people making an insurance claim be minimised. To make this as easy as possible, the Insurance Council and the government have agreed that an insurance company that is represented at a relief centre will be able to accept claims on behalf of insurers who are not represented at that relief centre. They will also be able to process emergency payments from other insurers. The Insurance Council has developed a common claim form for victims of the Victorian fires. This will again make the process as easy as possible. The chairman of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
             ACCC
            </a>
            has this morning advised me that the ACCC has no concerns with this arrangement under the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade_Practices_Act" rel="nofollow">
             Trade Practices Act
            </a>
            , and it has been implemented.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Insurance Council will act as the clearing house for these claims and will coordinate the processing of the claims. The council has assured me that the processing of these claims will commence within 24 hours of receipt. This means that victims of this disaster, no matter who they are insured with, simply have to approach the insurance representative on the spot, even if that representative is not from their company, to get their claim processed. The Insurance Council has also advised that insurers are allowing the lodgement of home and motor insurance claims over the phone and are providing upfront, emergency funds where required for food and clothing.
           </p>
           <p>
            People who have suffered a property loss due to the bushfires should contact their insurer directly or by phone or contact the person in the emergency relief centres. They do not need to worry if their insurance documents are lost or destroyed; the insurer will have their details electronically and will usually require only the policyholder’s name and address and one or two other personal details in order to process the claim. I would advise that policyholders should also ask their insurer whether they are offering upfront payments for emergency food and clothing when they get in contact with their insurer.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Chief Executive of the Insurance Council of Australia, Kerrie Kelly, has been on site in Victoria yesterday and today, and we are in very regular contact. On behalf of the House, I thank the Insurance Council for its cooperation.
           </p>
           <p>
            In the event that bushfire victims are not treated appropriately by their insurer, there are arrangements in place to resolve disputes between policyholders and insurers. The
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Ombudsman_Service" rel="nofollow">
             Financial Ombudsman Service
            </a>
            provides independent and free dispute resolution for insurance complaints. The Financial Ombudsman Service can investigate a dispute and issue a written decision which is binding on the insurer under the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporations_Act" rel="nofollow">
             Corporations Act
            </a>
            . We have been in regular contact with the Chief Ombudsman of the Financial Ombudsman Service, Colin Neave AM, over the last 48 hours. The Chief Ombudsman has arranged for a dedicated hotline for victims of the Victorian fires and the Queensland floods who experience difficulties with their insurers. This number for the fire and flood hotline is 1800337444, and it is operational from now. The Chief Ombudsman has also told me that there will be a dedicated team of senior officers dealing specifically with concerns arising out of the natural disasters. I believe the Financial Ombudsman Service is well known and respected by all honourable members—particularly, for example, the honourable member for Aston, who was involved in the establishment of the Financial Ombudsman Service—and I am sure all honourable members would agree that the Financial Ombudsman Service will provide a very valuable service, as it has in this and other natural disasters.
           </p>
           <p>
            Experience from previous disasters, like the Canberra bushfires and previous flooding, indicates that there will be some cases that need to be referred to the ombudsman. In the past, this figure has been about one per cent of claims. The Chief Ombudsman has undertaken to keep me advised of progress and to provide me with a formal report quarterly on issues arising out of the Victorian fires, which I would be happy to table in the House. I repeat the Prime Minister’s request of yesterday: if any honourable member has constituents who are unhappy with the way they are being treated by their insurance company, they should please contact me directly. I will then personally raise the matter with the chief executive of the insurance company concerned, the Insurance Council or the chief financial ombudsman, as appropriate.
           </p>
           <p>
            While I am at the dispatch box, I think it might be useful to members to very briefly inform the House of the assistance available from the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Taxation_Office" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Taxation Office
            </a>
            to victims of both the fires and the floods. The tax office is fast-tracking refunds, allowing more time to lodge activity statements or tax returns without incurring penalties, allowing additional time to pay tax debts without any interest charged, arranging for debts to be paid by instalments, helping reconstruct tax records where documents have been destroyed and omitting penalties or interest. Assistance is not limited to those people who are directly affected but will also be made available to others, such as business owners whose main income is derived from the affected areas, and also of course to volunteers in both the floods and the fires.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would encourage people to contact the tax office at the appropriate time to make arrangements that meet their individual circumstances and give people the assurance that the Australian Taxation Office will show lenience in the short term while people are getting back on their feet. Again, in these extraordinary circumstances, if any honourable member has concerns about the way the tax office is dealing with an individual victim of these disasters, I would encourage that member to talk to me directly and I will raise the matter personally with the Commissioner of Taxation.
           </p>

            This has been a crisis for families in Victoria that has demanded an exceptional response from government agencies and emergency services. It also demands an exceptional response from insurance companies and other financial service providers. The government will continue to be actively involved with insurance companies and others to ensure that exceptional response is forthcoming.

             There will be a time when farmers turn to the cost to their business and move forward with respect to their business. Understandably, they are all dealing with the human tragedy in advance of dealing with the business cost. It is hard to focus on counting your lost stock when the nation is still counting your lost friends. Notwithstanding that, the government has been working to assess precisely what sort of damage we are talking about with respect to the farmers and forestry workers in Victoria. Stock losses, fortunately, have not been to this point as serious as we thought they might have been. Fodder loss has been extraordinary—stockpiling gone up in flames in seconds. Permanent plantings have done very badly in many areas. Dairies are now unusable in some cases. Farmers who had invested extraordinary amounts of money on better water management and on farm irrigation systems have found that, if those systems were concrete, they have cracked, and, if they were polypipe, they have melted.
            </p>
            <p>
             Similarly, timber workers are now dealing with what was something in the order of 100,000 hectares of native forest available for production no longer being there and something in the order of 20,000 to 30,000 hectares of plantation forest no longer being available—compounding the loss of life and loss of property with a loss of future resources. Added to that has been the loss of some mills. Before assistance came from government, that direct farmer-helping-farmer support was happening on the ground. Dairy farmers whose neighbours no longer had a useful dairy understood that, although some cows might be alive, if cows currently in production were not kept in production, it would be a long time before they would come back into production. So they allowed their neighbours who used to be just over the fence—when there was a fence—to use their facilities. Similarly, there has been extraordinary work from farmers interstate—in particular, from
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
              New South Wales

              South Australia
             </a>
             and Tasmania—working through systems that have immediately been put in place by the Victorian Farmers Federation, with transport costs supported by the Victorian government. A number of members from each side have already contacted my office with offers from their own farmers wanting to help out, with fodder in particular. The
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VFF" rel="nofollow">
              VFF
             </a>
             number for those donations of fodder is 1300882833.
            </p>
            <p>
             People around Australia are making donations, but I want to launch one extra appeal to every Australian when it comes to their role as a consumer. Australian consumers often get a bit fussy about whether their fruit and vegies have the tiniest blemish, even though it might make absolutely no difference to the flavour. If you are ever going to be fussy about your fruit and vegies, please do not do it over the next few months. If people can accept that it tastes just as good and are willing to be a bit more tolerant than they might be on other occasions, it will allow retailers to continue to buy the produce and it will allow farmers who are facing extraordinary difficulties to do their best with the produce that they have.
            </p>
            <p>
             In addition to the work that the Prime Minister has already announced to the House, the government has moved forward with existing programs and seen where existing programs could be modified or acted on quickly in order to be of assistance. At a time when we are talking about loss of life and we have the image of buildings being destroyed, it is very easy to discard the significance of not bringing natural resource management into play very quickly. Following a fire, there is the opportunity for massive erosion and a massive influx of weeds. That can be a good deal more damaging to a property than the loss of a building. For that reason, Minister Garrett and I have extended the application deadlines on Caring for our Country, and all uncommitted funds from this financial year are now being redirected to natural resource management work in the state of Victoria.
            </p>
            <p>
             The National Rural Advisory Council has also been responsible for a number of drought reviews. For states other than Victoria, an announcement will be made very soon as to the government’s response, but I think it is important to inform the House now as to the government’s response with respect to the state of Victoria. NRAC had conducted its reviews on drought assistance for a number of areas in Victoria which were coming up to expire in March. In every instance, they have been extended for a further 12 months. A number of areas were also due to expire in April and were not yet ready for full assessment. NRAC held an emergency meeting, and those areas, too, have been extended for a further 12 months. There are some areas in Gippsland which came out of drought assistance some months ago. When an area comes out of
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EC" rel="nofollow">
              EC
             </a>
             , it is not simply because the drought has ended; it is also because the recovery has begun. Arguments in some of those areas in Gippsland about the recovery having commenced that might have made sense some months ago now demand serious review. Minister Helper, the Victorian Minister for Agriculture, and I are currently in talks to make sure that we can also have a sensible outcome for those areas in Gippsland.

              The Victorian bushfires are Australia’s worst natural disaster. Australia is experiencing another natural disaster but, mercifully, with nowhere near the human consequences or toll of the Victorian bushfires. I refer, of course, to the floods in North Queensland.
             </p>
             <p>
              I remind members of the dimensions of those floods. At one point, 62 per cent of Queensland was under water. That is an area four times the size of
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain" rel="nofollow">
               Great Britain
              </a>
              . The Prime Minister sent me to North Queensland on Monday, while he attended to the bushfires in Victoria. The Treasurer had been to North Queensland over the weekend; the Prime Minister had been before that. The Prime Minister asked me to coordinate the Commonwealth relief effort and to work with the state and local governments. When we arrived, the town of Ingham was flooded. The little town of Halifax, 17 kilometres north, was completely isolated, and 3,000 homes had been affected just in that area. The road to Townsville from Ingham was cut. By Tuesday, that road had opened, and by Wednesday Halifax was accessible.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is a recovery centre at the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Hotel" rel="nofollow">
               Royal Hotel
              </a>
              in Ingham. It is staffed by Centrelink, the Queensland Department of Communities and the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Cross" rel="nofollow">
               Red Cross
              </a>
              . I can report that, as at the end of yesterday, 1,417 claims had been processed. People are queueing up, but it was marvellous to see the spirit with which they did that, the fact that they felt maybe they had been through the worst of it and how well they banded together. Today officers from Centrelink are going out with the Red Cross doorknocking, to houses in and around Ingham, offering help. There is an emergency accommodation centre at the showground, and I can report that this centre for displaced persons had up to 50 people in it, but last night it was down to 15. That is staffed by the Red Cross and by the

             <p>
              The outlook is encouraging. The waters are receding. The rain depression has gone south and it is hoped that it will not bounce back up. At present it is south and may be moving a little towards Mackay. The reports are that if it does rain—and it is raining a bit—it will not be anything like the flooding that has already occurred. Let us hope that holds true. Further north in the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Country" rel="nofollow">
               Gulf Country
              </a>
              , places like Karumba and Normanton are still cut off and lots of farms are too. That is very frustrating because they have been isolated for weeks.
             </p>
             <p>
              The relief operations are going quite smoothly. A lot has been learned from the experience of

               Cyclone Larry

              . I want to acknowledge the fine work of the Red Cross, the Salvation Army, St Vincent de Paul and other voluntary organisations in the area. Centrelink is doing a wonderful job, as are officials from the Queensland Department of Communities.

             <p>
              I would like to finish with a story that I think will gladden the hearts of everyone here. As people were queuing and being moved through the recovery centre at the Royal Hotel, we were all struck by the number of people who said, ‘We’ve been through a lot but nothing like the people in the bushfire areas of Victoria,’ and they told the Centrelink staff and other staff that they would be donating some or all of the money that they were receiving by way of relief to the bushfire victims. To add to that, the schools are chipping in as well. Gilroy Santa Maria College and
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady" rel="nofollow">
               Our Lady
              </a>
              of Lourdes Primary School are holding a fundraising exercise tomorrow. So too is Ingham State High School. In fact, they will be selling flowers for Valentine’s Day and the proceeds of that will go to the Victorian bushfire victims.
             </p>
             <p>
              The resilience and the generosity of the people of North Queensland and
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
               Far North Queensland
