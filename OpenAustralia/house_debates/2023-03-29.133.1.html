        On behalf of the Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Anti-Corruption Commission, I present the committee's report entitled
        <i>
         Report on proposed recommendations for app

        Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).
       </p>
       <p>
        by leave—I rise today as Deputy Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Anti-Corruption Commission, and I'm pleased today—very pleased indeed—to table this historic report, which confirms that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Anti-Corruption Commission has approved the recommendations for the inaugural appointments to the National Anti-Corruption Commission. These appointments are the Hon. Justice Paul Brereton AM

        </a>
        as inspector.
       </p>
       <p>
        In approving these recommendations for appointment, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the National Anti-Corruption Commission has fulfilled one of its important statutory roles. Under section 178(3)(b) of the act, the committee must approve or reject a recommendation from the Attorney-General for appointments to the National Anti-Corruption Commission. Once the decision has been reached, the committee must report that decision to both houses of the parliament. I'm pleased to report that the committee unanimously approved these recommendations. To me, it's important to have achieved a consensus decision.
       </p>
       <p>
        The National Anti-Corruption Commission needs support from across the political spectrum, and I hope that our unanimous decision today will set the culture of the committee for years to come—a culture of working together from all sides of the political spectrum. Having said that, this committee is not and will not be a rubber stamp, and we have set that standard today. These appointments represent a very important step towards the much-anticipated commencement of the National Anti-Corruption Commission.
       </p>
       <p>
        When Australians from every corner of our nation called for integrity in politics, they called for a robust, independent and enduring institution that they can trust—an institution that takes its place as a pillar of our democratic and accountable system of government. These appointments are a crucial step to ensure we deliver that vision for the Australian people. In fulfilling that vision, I hope that this sets in train an improvement in the trust that the people of Australia have in their government and in public institutions.
       </p>
       <p>
        To deliver a powerful anticorruption commission, we must have the right people in the job—people who are experienced, courageous and completely independent of government, political parties and political interests. In fulfilling its responsibilities to approve these recommendations for appointment, the parliamentary joint committee carefully contemplated each proposed appointment on their merit. We scrutinised past experience and qualifications. We looked closely at the skills these people would bring to these important roles. With these appointments, I am confident that the National Anti-Corruption Commission will be strong and independent. I thank the appointees for putting their names forward to take on this momentous task.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish to acknowledge my fellow committee members for the time, the effort and the diligence they've given to fulfilling their role on the committee and for approaching our task thoughtfully and cooperatively. I look forward to continuing to work together to provide oversight of the National Anti-Corruption Commission. I would especially like to thank the chair, Senator Linda White, for her leadership in bringing the committee together on this important decision. I commend this report to the House, and, in the spirit of genuine collaboration and cooperation, I would like to cede some time to the member for Menzies.

        <p>
         by leave—Thank you to the member for Indi, who informed me today that she would be doing that. I don't have notes for this because I don't think any of us need them. You have fought for this over many years, and you deserve credit and acclaim for that. It's a shame that the students who were there before have walked off; I would have told them that they were witnessing a bit of history. I'd like to think that this institution will be one we look back on and say, 'That's one that enhances our democracy; it doesn't take away from it.'
        </p>
        <p>
         We had a debate in the joint select committee and then in the parliament about getting the detail right. But there was goodwill from the coalition to pass this because, of all of the lessons that we learnt from the election, integrity was right up there—it really was. It certainly was in my seat in Victoria, where the member for Wannon is as well, and in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         . Integrity comes in many forms and, certainly, this institution was a key part of that. This is what Australians told us they wanted.
        </p>
        <p>
         But it's also about the quality of the people who we send here and the quality of the people who we appoint to that institution. When you look at this act, or any act, there's enormous discretion in them. Most of the decisions will be made behind closed doors, beyond scrutiny. So when it comes to an integrity commission, the integrity of the people that we put there is probably more important than the wording of the act. When the names were read out, from the inspector, to the commissioner to the deputy commissioners, I had confidence that they have been well selected and well chosen—but we won't give them a blank cheque to do the right thing.
        </p>
        <p>
         From a personal perspective, integrity isn't just about winning elections and telling Australians that we heard the message. It's fundamental to our democracy, because in my personal experience deployed with the ADF to Afghanistan—and you might ask why I am raising Afghanistan—it was quite clear, from the earlier tours and through to the end, that corruption was undermining the mission. Corruption was something that people noticed. In the end I think it contributed to a democracy falling on our watch. We must never forget that it's fundamental to our democracy.
        </p>
        <p>
         Corruption is defined in the act. Again, I would've said to the children that it's pretty simple. It's about putting others first, it's about not being selfish and it's about putting others first when no-one is watching. Maybe there are some people in this place or in a department who might've thought to do something, but a little light will go off in their head that says, 'Oh, but the corruption commission,' and if those little lights are going off then this institution is doing its job. For the integrity of this parliament I think Australians wants us to be honest, they want us to be courageous. Being courageous sometimes means, in this place or in the media, saying, 'I don't know, but I'll get back to you. I made a mistake.' And sometimes it means saying, 'I'm sorry.' I think we could all do more of that in our democracy.
        </p>
        <p>
         I thank the member for Indi or giving me this chance. I thank the Australian people for letting us know that this really matters. I think the Australian people deserve credit for this institution. This committee, chaired by

          Senator White
         </a>
         —and all of the members on the joint select committee and on this committee—is an important committee that, I think, will keep this institution on the right track and enhance our democracy.
