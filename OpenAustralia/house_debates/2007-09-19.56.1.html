              Mr Speaker, on a point of order: is the member putting forward a dissent or a party-political speech? If he is dissenting from your ruling, he has a responsibility to address the issue.

                  which is the inconsistencies in your ruling. We come into this chamber and we know that they have a majority. We know that they can use that majority. We know that everything is stacked against us in the standing orders and in
                  <i>
                   House of Representatives
                  </i>

                   Practice
                  </i>
                  . But what we expect on this side of the chamber, and what the public expect, is a fair go. But when we raise with you, in consecutive points of order and in questions to the Speaker after question time, the Prime Minister saying ‘when you know you are lying through your teeth’ and you rule him in order, we do not expect you today then to exclude the member for Melbourne from representing his seat for 24 hours after he has used the exact same words and then, on the basis of an interjection, to exclude the member for Gorton for one hour. It is the inconsistency that has this side of the parliament fed up, because we expect a fair go.

                  The inconsistencies go on. On 25 June 1996, to use just one example, the Minister for Foreign Affairs said about someone on this side of the chamber:

                 <p class="italic">
                  You’re just lying through your teeth …

                 <p>

                   As he should have. Every person on this side of the chamber who is asked by you to withdraw does so out of deference to you and out of respect for this parliament. But what we see are two different sides: on the one hand, this is reminiscent of what happened to the member for Lalor when the Leader of the House showed his leadership on parliamentary standards when he referred to ‘snivelling grubs’. What we saw then was this parliament being brought into disrepute.

                     Maybe, Mr Speaker, you should comprehend that the nature of a dissent motion is that, if it is carried, you lose your job. This goes to the heart of whether this parliament has confidence in you. But what we have seen over the last couple of days is an orchestrated attempt by a government that is out of touch and out of time and does not want to debate the issues so engages in disruptive behaviour. We saw it in response to the Leader of the Opposition’s first question yesterday, where we had an orchestrated attack from those opposite. We had the Prime Minister and the pretender without courage—

                     </a>
                     —yesterday and the day before giving the finger to the Leader of the Opposition and to those opposite as if that were acceptable. That is the sort of behaviour that we have to put up with time after time.

                     When we raise points of order, what we get is reminiscent of

                     Denis Denuto being asked, ‘Why are rulings being made in the High Court?’ You sit there and you say, ‘It’s the vibe.’ We never get to an actual point of order or to any substance. What we simply get is: ‘That’s the majority, and it’s right. This is the minority and you’re wrong.’ It simply is not good enough. We know that it is sporting finals time, and everyone who follows sport knows that the home team usually gets a bit of an advantage from the umpire, but the figures this year show that 52 Labor members have been ejected and only two—one of which was yesterday—from the coalition. That is a penalty count of 52 to two. But, to be fair, that is consistent because you have excluded more members of parliament than any Speaker before you since Federation. You have excluded 175 Labor members from the House and only five members from the coalition. That shows, Mr Speaker, just how unreasonable the rulings have been.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     You ruled question No. 1 today out of order, that the
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Minister_of_State" rel="nofollow">
                      Special Minister of State
                     </a>
                     did not have to answer it, even though standing order 98(c)(ii) makes it very clear that a minister is responsible for answering questions about administration. He is the Special Minister of State. He employs not just all his staff but every staff member in the parliament. He is responsible for it. But you, when there is a difficult question, say that it is optional whether ministers answer them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     Let me tell you that Mr Phelps has put out a press release and in it says, ‘
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr_Phelps" rel="nofollow">
                      Dr Phelps
                     </a>
                     is the chief of staff to the Special Minister of State but was attending the meeting in a private capacity.’ The only problem is that the media contact, Dr Peter Phelps, uses 0419261416, the phone number paid for by the taxpayer. He is sitting in the office there. He did radio interviews this morning but you ruled that it was somehow optional whether he be accountable to this parliament or not. It is simply the case that those of us on this side of the House do not expect to get an advantage. But we do expect, when there is a clear parallel less than 24 hours apart—such as the Prime Minister’s statement and the statements from the member for Melbourne and the member for Gorton—that you will make a consistent ruling and treat people the same.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     We are all accountable to our electorates, and you are accountable to this parliament. Whenever we raise difficult questions to you, you never refer to standing orders; it is just, ‘No, no, the government’s right.’ I have to say that you have a hard job, because the Leader of the House is probably the worst offender in the parliament when it comes to breaching standing orders. Not once has he ever got to that microphone at the dispatch box and referred to standing orders or
                     <i>
                      House of Representatives Practice
                     </i>
                     . That is because the members of the government do not care. Their arrogance is out of control. It is arrogance because they got a Newspoll result that was the same as the Newspoll two polls ago. How arrogant are they going to be if they are re-elected at the election later this year?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     That is what we are seeing from this government. It is an arrogant government, out of touch, out of control and out of time. But they do not want to call an election because when you call an election you cannot abuse standing orders in this House, you cannot abuse the advertising budget and get the taxpayers to pay for all your party political advertising. This is a government out of control, and you have a responsibility, Mr Speaker, to be fair dinkum and make consistent rulings so that they are brought back into line. You have failed to do that, Mr Speaker. That is why we are dissenting from your ruling and that is why this dissent motion should be carried, and everyone in parliament knows it should be carried.

                                    If the Manager of Opposition Business is going to be taken seriously, he should tell the truth. In the course of his contribution he made two statements that he knows to be untrue. First of all, he claimed that if this motion of dissent is carried you are out of a job. He knows that that is not true. There have been many motions of dissent. Some have been passed in this House and the speakers against whom they have been passed have not lost their jobs. It is only a motion of want of confidence in the Speaker that has the effect that the Manager of Opposition Business claimed. But a more important untruth is that he claimed in his contribution that more people had been suspended from the House under your speakership than ever before. That is absolutely untrue. It is completely untrue. He knows it is untrue and he should not make that kind of misleading statement before this House. This Manager of Opposition Business has no regard for the truth. He has no regard for parliamentary standards. The motion that he has moved cannot be taken seriously by this House.

                                         That is exactly what was dissented from. The Speaker dismissed the member in question from the service of the House. This is the issue that has excited the Manager of Opposition Business. But standing order 94(a) says:
                                        </p>
                                        <p class="italic">
                                         The Speaker can direct a disorderly Member to leave the Chamber for one hour. The direction shall not be open to debate or dissent ...
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         This is yet another example of the Manager of Opposition Business abusing the forms of the House.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         It is very clear that members opposite have had a very bad day. The Leader of the Opposition has been exposed as totally ignorant when it comes to tax. Yesterday, they were exposed as not having a clue about dental policy. We are supposed to believe that this motion of dissent was spontaneously triggered by your ruling when the Manager of Opposition Business plainly came well armed. But what has in fact triggered this motion of dissent is not just the opposition’s embarrassment over their failed dental policy; it is not just the opposition’s embarrassment over their lack of tax policy; it is the fact that the Leader of the Opposition’s question time attack today has completely collapsed.

                                                    he did not bother to try and change it—talked about ‘lying through your teeth’, and you said it was in order. The member for Melbourne said the same thing, and you called on him to withdraw and said it was not in order. The member for Gorton said the same thing, and you threw him out. The Minister for Foreign Affairs said the same thing, and you asked him to withdraw. That pattern of inconsistency has provoked this point of order, because it has provoked this opposition beyond acceptance, beyond reasonableness. I know, Mr Speaker, that the government behaves so badly that your job is very difficult. We accept that and try to make allowances for it because you have the foreign minister, who has never obeyed the standing orders in 10 years, and the Leader of the House, who does not know what they are and has not referred to them in 10 years.

                                                          Mr Speaker, I am describing your behaviour. If you think it is a reflection, it is your interpretation, not mine. I am simply describing it accurately, because it has been inconsistent and unreasonable. We find it entirely unacceptable, and that is what has provoked this point of order.
