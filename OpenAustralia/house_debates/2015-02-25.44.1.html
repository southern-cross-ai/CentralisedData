       <p>
        I was fortunate to be able to attend the Cowra Business Chamber awards a couple of weekends ago in Cowra of course. There was a room of innovative small businessmen and women—the backbone of the local economy in Cowra.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to congratulate all nominees and award winners on the night. Special mention must go to Brooks Beds R Us for winning the Excellence in Business Award; and to Brumby Aircraft—an extraordinarily innovative business in Cowra that I have talked about before in this place—who were presented with the Extraordinary Business Achievement Award for their export deal with China.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is also some innovation along Cowra's main street for the next few months. I have an electorate office in Kendal Street, and the block right outside my office is undergoing a revamp. A multimillion dollar investment will see the four main blocks of town transformed, and I am assured by council the wait will be worthwhile.
       </p>
       <p>
        Heavy vehicles have been bypassing the main street roadworks and travelling right past Cowra Public School. Parents contacted my office to see what could be done about the danger of the school pedestrian crossing now being located right next to a roundabout for heavy vehicles.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased to announce, after representations from my office, that Cowra Council is now operating the roundabout with flashing lights and personnel each school afternoon. It is hoped that when the streetscape is finished in a couple of months a more permanent solution can be found for heavy vehicles through town.
