       <p>
        Sometimes terrible things happen to good people. When tragedy strikes it makes you pause for a moment and be grateful for all the wonderful things you have in life, and our everyday flotsam and jetsam pales into insignificance. I first met Allison Murphy during my campaign to come back to the parliament in 2004. Alli worked for my good friend and former colleague Senator the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judith_Troeth" rel="nofollow">
         Judith Troeth
        </a>
        . Alli worked as the senator's media adviser while she was the Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. Alli said of that time:
       </p>
       <p>
        I can remember Alli leading a planning day at my office in Warragul with my staff, bringing forth some really bright ideas and holding court with her infectious enthusiasm for the task at hand. Alli had a bright, strategic mind and looked after her boss, Judith, as part of team Troeth beautifully.
       </p>
       <p>
        Towards the end of 2004 Alli decided to open a major new chapter in her life and branch out on her own by establishing her own business. From vision to fruition, Redstick Strategic Communications was a yield of that new beginning. Redstick quickly became a very successful operation in Alli's hometown of Geelong. Alli was involved in many aspects of Geelong community life, particularly in the last 10 years, including as a board member of Committee for Geelong and many other not-for-profit initiatives.
       </p>
       <p>
        Along the way Alli met a wonderful man to share her life with,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pete_Stevens" rel="nofollow">
         Pete Stevens
        </a>
        , or 'Stevo', as she referred to him. Alli and Stevo brought into the world adorable twins, Charley and Lucy, who just started school this year and were the apple of their mother's eye. Just a few days ago on Facebook, Alli lamented they were growing up so quickly. Ali was also very much loved by her stepson, Tom, who was flown in from Canada this week.
       </p>
       <p>
        Priscilla Ruffolo, who worked with Alli in team Troeth and on my campaign in 2004, loved Alli. Priscilla describes Alli as 'bubbly and smileyâ€”she was larger than life'. In many ways Alli was an absolute pleasure to work with. She was dedicated to her work and family but, importantly, managed to find a balance between work and family. Alli was an absolute hoot to be around; a negative was always turned into a positive. That Redstick was the success it was was a testament to her hard work and determination.
       </p>
       <p>
        Alli was completely adored by her husband and children. She loved everything Italian. Before she finished with Judith, Alli went on a European adventure to find her inner Italian. She would always say 'ciao, bella'. One of the best things about Alli was that even after she finished work with team Troeth, her colleagues loved that she always took the time to stay in touch with little notes and thoughtful gestures. Priscilla also remembers that Alli's husband was a passionate yachtie and he was, at one stage, the Commodore of the Geelong Yacht Club. When they got married Alli loved this position because she was able to hold the title of 'Madam Commodore of the yacht club'.
       </p>
       <p>
        Earlier this week Alli was meant to begin the day the same as any other. At some stage last Monday morning she collapsed and suffered a catastrophic brain injury. Alli could not be revived and tragically a bright light in many of our lives is now extinguished. I want to pay tribute to a young woman who was an outstanding community leader with a brilliant mind and a good friend to many of us in this place. Rest in peace, dear Alli.
