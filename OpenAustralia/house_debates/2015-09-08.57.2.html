        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. I refer to his answer yesterday where he said claims his department advised Bill Milby to re-flag the

Is he aware that last night Senator Heffernan asked his department's Judith Zielke, 'So Milby was telling the truth when he said you had discussed with him the option of going offshore? and Ms Zielke replied, 'Yes,' and, further, that

          While the question was asked after the time had expired, I will answer it. I have not corrected the record, because there is no error in the record. The record is correct. What I said yesterday was that Mr Milby was not advised to take any particular course of action. No-one from my department has ever said to Mr Milby that he should sack his crew or reflag the vessel as has been reported. That is simply inaccurate. There were discussions, as confirmed with the transcript last night, between Mr Milby and officers of my department to discuss options and in particular to talk about elements of the report and the sorts of things that might be possible for an operation like his and, for that matter, others in the Australian shipping industry to take with the new legislation in place. They discussed a range of options. At no stage did the government tell him what he should do. He makes his own decisions as a responsible businessman.

            for many years and doing so successfully, and I have got no doubt that, in the event of the legislation the government has put before the parliament coming into effect, he will be able to do so in the future. And it will be his choice as to how he wishes to operate his business. He will do it in the interests of his employees and his company, and I am sure he will continue to provide a good service to Australians in that area.
