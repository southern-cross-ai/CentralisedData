       <p>
        I rise to update the House on the vital issue of improving mobile coverage in my electorate of Robertson and to describe how the Turnbull government is continuing to work to deliver for local families, businesses and emergency services across the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        In the months leading up to the recent federal election, I heard from hundreds and hundreds of local residents from our region who told me why a lack of mobile coverage in certain areas is such a critical issue. Together, we have been working and fighting hard to see this issue addressed through our $220 million Mobile Black Spot Program. Under this program, we have already seen improved coverage for Somersby,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_White" rel="nofollow">
         Mount White
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove_Mountain" rel="nofollow">
         Mangrove Mountain
        </a>
        . But, in the election campaign, the Turnbull government also committed to improving coverage in Killcare, Spencer and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendoree_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Wendoree Park
        </a>
        . These three communities have struggled for many, many years with poor or, in some cases, non-existent mobile coverage. And it is no wonder. Despite six years of government, Labor did not invest one single dollar to improve or to address poor mobile coverage. Local communities like Killcare, Spencer and Wendoree Park cannot be ignored any longer.
       </p>
       <p>
        For communities like Killcare, their limited mobile coverage means that down on the beach and at the Killcare Surf Life Saving Club, for instance, there is little to no mobile coverage. That is something that club representatives and volunteer lifesavers have indicated to me and expressed their concern about. I visited them on the weekend for a community forum and spoke with a number of passionate local residents about their challenges and frustrations. I would like to thank each and every person who shared their stories on Saturday, not just for taking time out on the weekend but because community feedback in this process of delivering improved mobile coverage is actually important to delivering the best possible outcome, including for instance locations where the mobile tower could possibly be replaced and where some of the worst blackspots are.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sam from Fraser Road in Killcare told me that his home does not have mobile coverage and that, as a small-business owner, he has to rely entirely on his landline. Colin, who lives on the same street, has a similar story. Nearby neighbours Jean and Peter have no mobile coverage in their home. After the severe storms in April last year, their family were left with no power or phone connection for at least four weeks. Cut off from mobile networks, it was nearly impossible to contact family, friends, insurance companies and contractors for repairs. Not only is this a safety issue, of course, but it prevents families from keeping up-to-date with smartphone technology and innovative technologies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Michael, a resident of a nearby street in Killcare, shared a very similar story. He too is unable to access mobile coverage from his house. He also wanted to register his frustration at our community forum. Frances, Quentin and Caroline all shared very similar issues, telling me that in some parts of Patricia Place at Killcare coverage is so poor that not even emergency
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOS" rel="nofollow">
         SOS
        </a>
        calls can be madeâ€”and this to an area that would be considered to be fairly urban on the Central Coast.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thanks to the advocacy of the Wagstaffe to Killcare Community Association, we know that this is a long-running experience that has, in some ways, united the community in their frustration. Ian Bull, the secretary of the association, has been in regular contact with me on this issue. Through the local newsletter, the
        <i>
         Talking Turkey
        </i>
        , he helps keep the community informed. The stories of Killcare residents are, of course, shared by many more communities, such as Spencer and Wendoree Park. Earlier this year, I hosted a forum in Spencer, with many residents coming from Spencer and other places such as Wendoree Park to share their concerns.
       </p>
       <p>
        For remote communities on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawkesbury_River" rel="nofollow">
         Hawkesbury River
        </a>
        , access to mobile coverage can be critically important in the event of a medical or other emergency. During the same storms that left Peter and Jean in Killcare without a phone, the Spencer wharf was damaged and the region was cut off, with no power or running water and no telecommunications. This is the situation that hardworking community leaders like Robyn Downham, from the Spencer &amp; Districts Progress Association, and Vic Bula, from the local fire brigade, describe as 'dire'. Belinda Repton, from the Wendoree Park Progress Association, has also told me stories about how poor mobile coverage has left locals in a life-or-death struggle sometimes because of a basic inability to connect.
       </p>
       <p>
        This week, I was able to share these stories and many more with the Minister for Regional Communications to highlight the urgency of this situation and to ensure that we deliver the best possible outcome for these communities as soon as possible. We know that this is going to take a little bit of time because mobile network operators are an integral part of the process to ensure that the best solutions are found for this region. But this government has heard this message. We will work to deliver on our commitment to the residents of Killcare, Spencer and Wendoree Park for better mobile coverage services, which they desperately need.
