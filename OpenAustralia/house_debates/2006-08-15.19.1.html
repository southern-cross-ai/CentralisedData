         The member for Braddon is a great enthusiast for the health facilities in his electorate—most notably and most recently, the brand-new rural clinical school at Burnie, which will soon be training up to 50 or 60 medical students in his area. I want to congratulate him on the fact that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
          GP
         </a>
         bulk-billing rate in his electorate is now 17 percentage points higher than it was in December 2003.
        </p>
        <p>
         The private health insurance rebate is one of the signature policies of the Howard government. It saves the average privately insured family more than $1,000 a year—and that is great news for the 26,000 people in the electorate of Braddon who are covered by private health insurance. I can advise the House that in the last year an extra 150,000 people joined the ranks of those covered by private health insurance. That means 10.2 million Australians are now covered by hospital or ancillary policies, and that is an absolute, all-time record. As the member for Braddon knows, it certainly helps to take the pressure off our public hospitals because, if the two million admissions to private hospitals a year did not have private health insurance, sure as anything they would be on the public hospital waiting list queue. This government is getting on with the job of making a good system even better.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think it is worth noting that, since the last election, government members have asked no fewer than 105 questions on health—that is, 105 questions in 115 parliamentary sitting days. There have been just 14 questions from the member for Lalor. Since the last election, the member for Lalor has put out 118 press releases and not a single policy.

               Obviously from that point of order the Leader of the Opposition is hiding the member for Griffith as well as he is hiding the member Lalor. The simple truth of the matter is that this government is interested in health. All the opposition are interested in is the politics of health. They are not interested in any benefits for patients. Meanwhile, this government is going from strength to strength as the best friend that Medicare has ever had.
