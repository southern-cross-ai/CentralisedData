       <p>
        Just under a week ago I was thrilled to hear that aged-care workers across our nation are in line for a much-deserved pay rise. The Fair Work Commission has made an interim decision for an increase the minimum wage of at least 15 per cent for aged-care workers in direct-care roles on a number of different awards. It should have happened a long time ago and it has only happened now because of the advocacy of our aged-care workers, unions, the broader aged-care sector and the Albanese Labor government. The commission has announced a further process to consider timing and a possible further increase for these workers. It will also consider granting pay rises for aged-care administrative and support staff, who do such great work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our government promised to fight for a pay rise for Australia's aged-care workers and we did. We made a submission to the Fair Work Commission in August that unequivocally supported a wage increase. Unlike the previous coalition government, we delivered for dedicated hardworking carers across the country looking after some of the most vulnerable members of our communities. These carers battled on during the challenging conditions of the COVID lockdowns, providing essential support for those in their care.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over recent years, I have hosted several forums in my electorate about the issues in aged care. Sad, tragic stories were commonplace. Tears flowed as family members, care workers and aged-care residents told their stories. Aged-care workers do some of the most important and passionate work in our communities, and we thank them, yet many get paid less than someone who stacks shelves in a supermarket. They spoke of how overstretched they are and how understaffed they are. Donna, a personal care attendant in a local aged-care facility in my electorate spoke passionately about low wages, insecure work and the frustration of being unable to properly care for frail, elderly and vulnerable residents. Donna's hourly rate had only increased by $7 an hour in the 11 years she has been employed in the aged-care sector. She earns $21 per hour. This is a disgrace. Harley, a young personal care attendant spoke equally passionately about inadequate pay while battling to care for residents he considered family.
       </p>
       <p>
        This underpayment of these essential and dedicated workers must stop if we are to retain and attract skilled aged-care employees to the sector. We know that, consistently, they do go above and beyond for elderly people in their care.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Albanese government's submission to the Fair Work Commission made it clear we would fund an increase in award wages, and we will. We're fighting for a better future for aged-care workers and older Australians. If we don't start paying aged-care workers properly, we won't keep them, and then we won't have the care for our loved ones.
