        On 6 May I attended the presentation day for the Padstow
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        Youth Swim Club. It was great to be there again this year. It is one of the largest, if not the largest, swimming group in the entire Banks community. It was really good to be there to attend their awards ceremony.
       </p>
       <p>
        The club meets at the Max Parker Leisure and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquatic_Centre" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and uses the pools there at Revesby. The club has had a lot of success over the years. In fact, just this year they had over 20 swimmers competing at the state championships, in March. It was a fantastic event for the club. The club also plays a broader role in supporting Padstow RSL Sub-Branch through a range of activities, such as Anzac Day.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the day it was good to acknowledge Matilda Karatas, who was recognised for her contribution to the club as a state representative, a learn-to-swim instructor, and for her efforts in fundraising for the club. She was nominated by the club for the Banks Outstanding Sporting Achievement award, and it was good to be able to present it on the day. I would like to thank President Phil Kennedy and all the committee members of the hard work they put into making sure the club is so strong and provides such a great service, particularly for the young people of our area.
