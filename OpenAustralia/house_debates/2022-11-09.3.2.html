       <p class="italic">
        (4) acknowledges that it was the previous Labor Government that commissioned a review into pension payments, and ultimately adopted the recommendation to upgrade indexation requirements to support greater pension increases.

        That this House:

        (1) recognises the critical importance of harmonised road safety data in formulating road safety policy;

       <p class="italic">
        (2) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) individual state and territory governments collect road safety data on a non-uniform basis; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the road safety data collected by state and territory governments is not made available to the Commonwealth Government notwithstanding the Commonwealth Government's significant financial contribution to state and territory governments to improve road safety outcomes;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) commends the leadership of the former Government in ensuring road safety was a consistent agenda item for the Infrastructure and Transport Ministers' Meetings (ITMM);

       <p class="italic">
        (4) further notes that at the ITMM that took place on 5 August 2022 road safety was not included on the agenda or indeed discussed; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) calls for a nationally consistent approach to the collection and distribution of road safety data by establishing a national road safety data sharing agreement with the states and territories.
