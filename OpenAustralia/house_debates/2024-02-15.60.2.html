        The date of 24 February is an anniversary we wish did not exist, but it is one that this chamber should recognise: 24 February 2022 was the date of Russia's illegal and immoral full-scale invasion of Ukraine. After 24 February, it's clear that this illegal war will enter its third year.
       </p>
       <p>
        I do look forward to the day when this House can celebrate that Ukraine is at peace, the work of recovery and rebuilding is under way and the process of justice is running its course. Regrettably, today we instead acknowledge that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin's" rel="nofollow">
         Vladimir Putin's
        </a>
        invasion is about to enter its third brutal year. Australia strongly supports Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity—a position which has been taken by every member of this House. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is of course a gross violation of international law.
       </p>
       <p>
        I often think back to the great privilege I had of visiting Ukraine early on in this war, in 2022. I was awed by the immense courage of the Ukrainian people—courage embodied by my host, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. While I was there, I got some sense of what Ukraine is up against. There are things I saw in Ukraine that will stay with me for the rest of my life.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia stands with Ukraine. It is an unwavering support that has so far included the provision of Bushmaster protected mobility vehicles, heavy artillery, critical ammunition and contributions to the Ukraine Humanitarian Fund. It has also included the deployment of a Royal Australian Air Force E-7A Wedgetail aircraft to Germany, helping to protect a vital gateway of international humanitarian and military assistance to Ukraine. I believe all Australians are also proud of the fact that members of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        continue to train recruits from the defence forces of Ukraine in the United Kingdom.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I'm pleased to announce the government will provide an additional $50 million grant to the International Fund for Ukraine. The IFU is a crucial funding mechanism that draws on contributions from international partners to procure military assistance for Ukrainians. This grant will bring Australia's total military assistance to Ukraine to approximately $780 million, and overall Australian government assistance to $960 million—support that's come from the former government as well as this government. We do this because Australia has always been willing to step up, we do it because we're steadfast in our commitment to global security and the international rule of law and we do it because the strategic reason is also so compelling. The outcome of this war matters for the people of Ukraine and for the international rules based order, and that matters to all of us, including to us here in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Working in coordination with partners, Australia will continue to support Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. We have introduced a range of trade sanctions and tariffs that impose further costs and limit Russia's ability to fund its immoral war. We have imposed targeted financial sanctions and travel bans on over 1,100 individuals and entities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Ukrainian people have known the cruelty of tyrants before. Those tyrants have gone, but Ukraine goes on. We will continue to stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes. I know that this will be a bipartisan commitment, as it has been from the first day—tragically, almost two years ago. I thought it was important for us to make this statement here, given that parliament won't be sitting between now and the anniversary date. I acknowledge also the leadership of the member for Cook and the Morrison government for the support that occurred, including inviting President Zelenskyy to in a virtual sense to address this chamber.
       </p>
       <p>
        I table the media release from me, the defence minister and the foreign minister that we released earlier today.

        <p>
         I thank the Prime Minister for his fine words and join with him and associate the coalition with the sentiment. When Russian troops poured across Ukraine's border on 24 February 2022, many in the West finally awoke from a naive dream of the end of history. The cruel reality of a return of history hit home. Russia's invasion was illegal and it was immoral. It was unprovoked, it was unjust and it was unacceptable. It was a reminder that the days of despots are not gone, that the age of autocrats is not behind us.
        </p>
        <p>
         Putin, of course, expected a quick victory. He thought the people of Ukraine would swiftly surrender, and his appetite would only have grown with territorial eating. But Putin miscalculated. He underestimated. He was wrong. For the people of Ukraine did not acquiesce; they resisted. They did not lay down their arms; they took aim. They did not cower in fear; they fought back with courage. Amidst the heartache, the horror and the heroism of war, a man has continued to inspire his people and, in turn, imbibe their collective spirit. Volodymyr Zelenskyy—the Churchillian President Zelenskyy—reflected that Ukrainians made a choice on 24 February 2022 when he said 'not a white flag, but a blue and yellow flag'. And in the past two years, we've heard their stories, stories of Ukrainian defiance and stoicism, of bravery and resolve, of triumph and sacrifice.
        </p>
        <p>
         President Zelenskyy has said that evil cannot overcome any distance and any barriers, and he has importantly stated that the military assistance provided to Ukraine is not charity; rather, it is an investment in global security and democracy. Ukrainians are not just fighting for their freedom. They are on the front line of the battle for civilisation itself. Ukraine still needs our help. Australia and all those countries who believe in law and liberty, in sovereignty and security, and in peace and prosperity must continue to provide that help to Ukraine. It is not enough for countries to say that we stand with Ukraine through our words; we must show that we stand with Ukraine through our deeds.
        </p>
        <p>
         At Amberley airbase, as defence minister, I stood with the Ambassador of Ukraine, who himself is an incredibly brave man, and we gifted the first of the Bushmasters. I want to congratulate the ambassador for the work that he has done in his country's name here in Australia, the funds he has raised, the community networks he has created. I also want to acknowledge, as the Prime Minister graciously did before, the work of former Prime Minister Morrison. It was a particular focus of the Morrison government and I want to congratulate the government for the announcement today and for the extension of that support to the people of Ukraine. It is needed more now than ever.
