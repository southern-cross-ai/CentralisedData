       <p>
        In this budget, one of promises that was broken was to continue a program in my electorate for the support of Reclink. Reclink started out as a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Melbourne" rel="nofollow">
         South Melbourne
        </a>
        based organisation but it has developed nationally. It provides outstanding support and community initiatives to disadvantaged Australians nationally. Around 100,000 people across Australia benefit from the sporting and cultural activities for people suffering from mental health problems, homelessness, substance abuse, disability, language barriers and financial difficulties. These programs foster self-confidence, bring people out of isolation, develop skills and establish connections and friendships.
       </p>

        I have had a longstanding relationship with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Cullen" rel="nofollow">

        , the marvellous individual, who is the force behind Reclink. Since I became a member of parliament, I have been privileged to introduce him to members of the now government and members of the previous government. I had thought that this program was relatively modest and was so manifestly in the interests of bringing these people into the mainstream that it would have been supported; however, it has not beenâ€”cut by $560,000. I had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for

        , and our well-known local personality,

        </a>
        with me last week as we were down at Peanut Farm Reserve speaking to Reclink's chairman,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_O'Halloran" rel="nofollow">

        who said that 'disadvantaged people have been regarded unfairly in programs designed to improve the community's social inclusion, health and wellbeing. Unless we can find another $500,000, we are going to have to make very hard decisions about whether we continue to operate.'
       </p>
       <p>
        We were working with the Salvo Hawks training session, and I do not want members of the government to say that the local community does not put into this. There is now a function that takes place annually at Elsternwick, which I am pleased to throw the coin at to open the game where nearly 15,000 people attend. There is massive local support, including financial support, for the wonderful work that Reclink does. It is just a shame that its program to take its work right across the country and our electorate is being undermined by the cuts in this current budget.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reclink Australia makes a huge difference to so many lives. Its vital work deserves long-term support. I am sorry that it has been abandoned by this government. The disadvantaged in our electorate will have to be supported by locals, philanthropists and businesses to the tune of another $500,000, if we can raise it.
