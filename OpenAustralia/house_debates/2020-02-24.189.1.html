        I rise to talk once again about the state of the National Disability Insurance Scheme and the level of support that we provide to those most in need. Last week I had the privilege of hosting a roundtable alongside my friend the member for Werriwa, Anne Stanley MP. We were fortunate to be joined by our friends the member for Maribyrnong and the member for Dobell in their capacities as shadow minister for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        and shadow assistant minister for carers. On the day we met many brave, loving and caring individuals who either are participants in the NDIS or care for someone who is. Unfortunately, we heard some truly harrowing stories about the difficulties people are having in accessing support through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIA" rel="nofollow">
         NDIA
        </a>
        and the constant hurdles they are made to jump through when navigating a complicated and uncaring bureaucracy.
       </p>
       <p>
        The NDIS, a life-changing scheme initiated by former Prime Minister Julia Gillard, was designed to lift people up and provide essential support to those most in need. It sent a clear message to Australians living with a disability that we're all Australians and that Australians support one another. Shamefully, the present government is mismanaging the NDIS. The NDIA has become an organisation that says no more than it says yes. We must act to address the systemic problems in the NDIS to ensure it operates and supports people to achieve their full potential. We must cease putting up barriers that prevent people from getting access and stop making participants jump through hurdles every 12 months just to keep their packages. It's shameful what's happening, and we must stop it.
