        There are many things to not like about the Turnbull government's budget, but there's one serious act of destruction that has received little attention so far. That, of course, is the ongoing attacks on overseas development money in Australia. While the Prime Minister had no absolutely problem finding $80 billion to hand out to his mates in big business, multinationals and the banks, he was nonetheless determined to cut the aid budget a further $140 million over the next four years. This is in addition to $11.3 billion that has been cut out of aid by this government since coming to power. It means that Australia's funding that is now going to overseas development assistance is just 22c in every $100 of our national income. That is the lowest ever in our nation's history. Let's just let that sink in; it is the lowest ever. It will get worse over the next decade because it will drop to 0.16 per cent of the gross national income.

        But none of this should come as a surprise to the Australian people, because this government treats our vulnerable people in Australia the same way. It treats average-wage earners with utter contempt. Yesterday in question time the

        told workers to just get better jobsâ€”if you're struggling, just get yourself a better job. If you want to aspire to something more, you need an education. But this same government has cut funds to

        and the university sector. How do people get ahead when you make it so hard to get an education?
