        I would like to say special hello to St Joseph's Primary School from the beautiful town of Benalla. I was so pleased to meet with you when you were in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        this week. I would like to acknowledge and thank your teachers for the fantastic job they do, and all the parents and friends who came with you to make the trip possible. But, most of all, I would like to say congratulations to the students. These were outstanding students. They asked the best questions. They really drilled in to how parliament works and, particularly, how question time goes. They are excellent examples of what holds for the future of Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to say to them: stay tuned to parliament; keep watching it. It is really important that you understand how your democracy work and it is really important that you understand who your local member for parliament is. And you can keep asking me questions. I am looking forward to coming to your school in the really near future and seeing how your classrooms went. I particularly want to say that I loved that Chook Rocket. I want to say a particular congratulations to the community garden and all the wonderful work you are doing there.
       </p>
