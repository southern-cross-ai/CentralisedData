        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.

         Appropriation Bill
        </a>
        (No. 2) 2020-2021, along with Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2020-2021 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2020-2021, are the budget appropriation bills for the remainder of this financial year.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill seeks approval for appropriations from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Revenue_Fund" rel="nofollow">
         Consolidated Revenue Fund
        </a>
        of approximately $14.9 billion. This broadly represents five-twelfths of the estimated 2020-21 annual appropriations and new measures. Together with Supply Act (No. 2) 2020-2021, this bill provides a full year of appropriations for purposes that are non-ordinary annual services of government for 2020-21, including capital works and services; payments for the states, territories and local government authorities; and funding for new administered outcomes not previously endorsed by the parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill also includes a revised advance to the finance minister for $6 billion, as a part of the reset ceiling of $10 billion between bills 1 and 2. This is down from the total $40 billion that could be issued under previous

        provisions and takes into consideration the evolving nature of the COVID-19 pandemic, allocations that have been made to date and the uncertainty around what may be required over the balance of 2020-21.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will now outline very briefly the significant items provided for in the bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         The Defence
        </a>
        portfolio will receive nearly $8.5 billion to deliver on the government's commitments to improve defence capability, as set out in the
        <i>
         2016 Defence white paper
        </i>
        , as well as the 2020 Force Structure Plan and 2020 Strategic Update.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Agriculture, Water and the Environment portfolio will receive approximately $2.5 billion including for concessional loans to primary producers and related small businesses through the Regional Investment Corporation as part of the measure Drought Response, Resilience and Preparedness Planâ€”further support for farmers and communities in drought.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Communications portfolio will receive approximately $1.4 billion, including funding for local councils and the state and territory governments to maintain and deliver social infrastructure, improve road safety and bolster the resilience of our local road network.
       </p>
       <p>
        Details of the proposed expenditure are set out in the schedules to the bill and the 2020-21 portfolio budget statements.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend this bill to the chamber.

       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
