       <p>
        Last Saturday I had the pleasure of hosting the Prime Minister in my electorate of Barker. This is the third time he has visited
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Bridge" rel="nofollow">
         Murray Bridge
        </a>
        , first as immigration minister, then last year as Treasurer and most recently as Prime Minister. As the Prime Minister knows, the Murraylands punches well above its weight when it comes to very impressive businesses owned and operated in the region, supporting our local regional economy. Many of these are agricultural businesses or food manufacturing businesses, and these sectors present some exciting opportunities for growth.
       </p>
       <p>
        This government's tax cuts are helping the businesses grow and employ in the region. But, like many businesses all over the country, workforce shortages are often holding back investment decisions, particularly in the horticultural and agricultural sectors. That is why on Saturday it was great to hear the Prime Minister announce action to back small and medium businesses in the region, taking an important first step in addressing these workforce shortages. The Prime Minister visited local business Aquasun, a family owned and run small business growing tomatoes in Murray Bridge. He also met with some of the region's biggest employers, officially opened my new office in Murray Bridge and enjoyed a beer at the Murray Bridge Hotel, where we got a chance to chat to locals. Thank you, Prime Minister, for the visit. Thank you to all in Murray Bridge who participated in the visit. It was a great weekend.
