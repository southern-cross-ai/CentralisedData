        We are in now the adjournment debate. It is always a pleasure to follow the honourable member for Blair. The House, along with the member for Blair, would be happy to know that today in this place we have had none other than the South-East Queensland Council of Mayors. They have been here in the nation's capital all day. There are seven of them. I would like to formally welcome each and every one of them to Canberra.

          </a>
          . Welcome, Mark. Mark and I had business relationships many years ago; I think it would have been in the late 1990s. It is good to see the way that you are conducting local government business on the

          Unfortunately, my local mayor from the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockyer_Valley" rel="nofollow">
           Lockyer Valley
          </a>
          , Tanya Milligan, was unable to make the trip, but she is no stranger to Canberra. She is a regular attendee here as part of the Lockyer Valley junior council chamber. She brings a group of young, energised and enthusiastic members of the Lockyer Valley community here and introduces them to democracy and how the parliament works. She is doing an exceptional job in advocating and developing tomorrow's leaders in that community.

          We had the opportunity to catch up with them briefly today. They have left in Canberra a document about a smart, sustainable and safe South-East Queensland collaborative future. It is their 2017 federal advocacy document. To the constituents represented by these mayors: if you are listening to this broadcast or if you read this
          <i>
           Hansard
          </i>
          at some stage in the future, know that, irrespective of your political leanings or persuasion, this collaborative group of mayors representing South-East Queensland do an exceptional job in building relationships. They build relationships not only with their local communities but with their state members. As local governments, they know how much money comes out of the federal government into their coffers and how competitive that tendering process is. I offer my heartfelt congratulations for the way that this group goes about tactfully, democratically and effectively advocating for their regions. Queensland is a better place for the existence of the South-East Queensland Council of Mayors.
