        <p>
         Thank you to the member for Goldstein for her question, and I also say thank you to the member for the way she has engaged with her community about Labor's cost-of-living tax cuts for middle Australia. Right across the crossbench, the way parliamentary colleagues have engaged on this with their own community and with the arguments for our bigger tax cuts for more people to help with the cost of living has been a very good thing. I also want to thank the member for Goldstein for the opportunity to engage with her about it in the last day or so.
        </p>
        <p>
         When it comes to bracket creep, we do acknowledge the impact that bracket creep has on take-home pay. What the parliament also needs to acknowledge and recognise is that there is more than one way to return bracket creep to hardworking Australians. There is the way that the member for Goldstein asks about. There is the way that was legislated five years ago by the previous government, and there is the way that this government is going about it. We acknowledge that there are a number of ways to go about it. We're not proposing to index the thresholds as the member for Goldstein is suggesting. But we think we have found a very effective way to return bracket creep to more people. What the parliament needs to understand—I'm confident that the crossbench does and I know for a fact that our side of the parliament does but I'm not so sure that those opposite do—is that you can return bracket creep in a number of ways. It doesn't just have to be returned disproportionately to people who are already on the highest incomes. What the Treasury advice makes really clear—the Treasury advice that we released at the same time we announced our position and our policy—is that what we are doing is returning bracket creep where bracket creep does the most damage, and that's through the middle incomes.
        </p>
        <p>
         One of the motivations for the design of the tax package that we released almost a couple of weeks ago is that, as the average tax rates of people on lower and middle incomes climb faster, and as their incomes rise, bracket creep does the most damage, so our responsibility and our objective is to return more bracket creep to middle Australia. That's why, I think, from memory, average tax rates go, as a consequence of what we're proposing, from 25.4 per cent to 23.9 per cent. Getting those average tax rates down is an indication that we're doing something about bracket creep, even if we're not doing it exactly the way that the member for Goldstein proposes.

          <p>
           I thank the member for Swan for her question and for her ongoing support and enthusiasm for the resources sector and resources workers. On the first of July, Labor will deliver a tax cut for every Australian to deal with the cost of living. We're delivering a tax cut for everyone living in northern Australia and for everyone working in the resources sector. There are a select few that have invested and taken risks and created hundreds and thousands of jobs in the sector, and they have received great reward. But the average income of resources workers is $144,000. They will get a tax cut of over $3,700. There is a wide range of salaries in the resources sector.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
            CEO
           </a>
           s get paid in the millions, with salary and company stock options, but that is far from the case for most hardworking blue collar workers in the resources sector.
          </p>
          <p>
           From coal country in the Hunter to the iron ore mines in the Pilbara, there are trades assistants, haul truck drivers, diesel mechanics, heritage advisers, cleaners and cooks and they all earn between $75,000 and $95,000 a year. Each of them will get a tax cut of between $1,500 and $2,000 a year. All of these resources workers, and many more, will receive bigger tax cuts under Labor's cost-of-living tax cut plans.
          </p>
          <p>
           Those opposite don't really want to talk about the average resources workers, their rights, their conditions or their well deserved tax cuts. They don't really want to talk about the truck drivers, the mechanics, the cooks and the cleaners that make our mines run and keep the economy humming. I mean, they might like to jump in a private charter and go to a party in the Pilbara or maybe even Bali. Good on them. That's really top stuff, I suppose. But what we care about are the workers in the resources industry that will get a tax cut. Every single one of them will get a tax cut, and it will be bigger than they might have expected before.
          </p>
          <p>
           Then, when I go to northern Australia, every person living in northern Australia will receive a bigger tax cut. They have received an average income of $70,000 across northern Australia, and everyone earning that average will get an average tax cut of $1,400.
          </p>
          <p>
           Only Labor supports all the communities across northern Australia. We don't pick and choose who we support. This will be extra money in people's pockets—people who are doing it tough in northern Australia, where it is tough. There are more expensive items, a lack of competition and transport issues which all add up to making the cost of living even more challenging for those in northern Australia compared to the big cities. Labor's cost-of-living tax cuts will help everyone in northern Australia and every single worker in the resources sector.

           <p>
            My question is to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister and other ministers have committed to supporting the stage three tax cuts in full on over a hundred occasions. For example, on 29 August 2022, the Prime Minister said: 'Parliament made a decision to legislate these tax cuts and we made a decision that we would stand by the legislation.' How can Australian families ever trust this government on taxes again after he repeatedly lied to them?

                 <p>
                  I thank the member for Casey for his question. He should be pretty enthusiastic about the government making the decision to look after low- and middle-income earners, because in his electorate 87 per cent of his electorate will get a bigger tax cut—87 per cent! And every single one, 100 per cent, will get a tax cut—100 per cent!
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  He asked a question about the government changing its position, and, yes, we have, because economic circumstances have changed. But you've changed your position. You now say you are going to vote against the Morrison tax cuts. That's what you're going to do, or maybe you're going to go back to saying that you'll roll it back. You couldn't make this up, Mr Speaker. They need to make up their minds.

                                   Our changes are so bad that they're going to vote for them! Nemesis is like a reboot of Fight Club, except on Fight Club no-one could talk about it. But they can't talk about anything else but fighting themselves. They can't talk about anything else. The fact is they have no credibility. If they want credibility and to defend their position, they need to do what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition did and roll back these changes.
