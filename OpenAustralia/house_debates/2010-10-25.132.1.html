       <p>
        Today in parliament I want to launch the push for a national dugong and turtle protection plan. I want to deal with three elements in this. The first is the threat. We heard on 7 October in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Dhabi" rel="nofollow">
         Abu Dhabi
        </a>
        at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_on_the_Conservation_of_Migratory_Species_of_Wild_Animals" rel="nofollow">
         Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals
        </a>
        that the dugong is facing extinction globally within the next 40 years. We know that already, in areas such as Mauritius and Taiwan, in many of the straits of Indonesia and in many other parts of the world, the dugong has suffered from local extinction. It is facing local extinction in many other areas, and the threat and challenge around the world is that this magnificent, iconic species will not be available and will not be part of the world to be inherited by our grandchildren.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to acknowledge, secondly, the protectors, people such as: James Epong, the magnificent Indigenous leader and representative who has helped put together the plan and helped take the lead in his own community, south of Cairns, near Innisfail, to push for a national moratorium, led by the Indigenous community themselves, whilst we gather the data and information;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Entsch" rel="nofollow">

        , the newly re-elected member for Leichhardt, who placed his career on the line when many people said that this was danger and folly and who believed in the power of the idea; and, in particular, my great friend Colin Riddell, who is a passionate advocate for the turtle and dugong protection plan and who has been one of the great motivators, along with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Irwin" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the broadcaster
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derryn_Hinch" rel="nofollow">
         Derryn Hinch
        </a>
        , all of whom are among the many people committed to these species.
       </p>
       <p>
        So what are the steps? This is the third element. Firstly, we must have a crackdown on illegal poaching. This poaching has been done in the name of Indigenous communities who are furious that their good name has been exploited by those who have no business pillaging their resources. Secondly, there must be an enforcement process. To that end, the coalition announced $1.6 million during the course of the election campaign for Indigenous rangers and for Customs officials to enforce the law and make sure that there would be no quarter given. Thirdly, there would be $1 million allocated to marine debris clearance and marine protection for these animalsâ€”so a $2.6 million package. The last thing is to work towards a moratorium with the support of Indigenous communities while we gather the numbers and find out what is necessary to protect these majestic creatures. I commend to the parliament, on a bipartisan basis, the push for a national dugong and turtle protection plan.
