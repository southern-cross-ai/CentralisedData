       <p>
        Last night the Pakistan Association of Australia held its annual dinner in Granville. The dinner clashed with my flights to Canberra, unfortunately, so I was on a flight instead of being with them, but I would like to congratulate them on an event well held. I have had feedback this morning about how well it went.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Pakistan Association of Australia was founded over 40 years ago and represents Pakistani Australians. They have provided a voice for the Pakistani community for many years. They are an organisation that I have long had a connection with, having worked with them in my electorate of Parramatta.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank and congratulate Shahid Iqbal Chaudhry, who is the president of the Pakistan Association of Australia—he was elected last year—for his work in addressing some of the many pressing issues affecting the Pakistani community, including the need for a community centre, and showcasing the bright and vibrant culture of Pakistan to the greater Australian community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Their annual dinner was held at the Himalaya Palace restaurant down in Granville, a well-known restaurant for those of us who live in the area, and featured distinguished guest speakers, performances of national songs by local artists and other live entertainment. My state colleagues

        and

        were present last night.
       </p>
       <p>
        The dinner was a testament to their goal of bringing communities together. They are to be thoroughly congratulated for their work, their voluntary welfare activities, providing children's services and activities, providing religious education and promoting the image and culture of Pakistan in Australia.
