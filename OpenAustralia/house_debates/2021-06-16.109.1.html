         I thank the member for Mallee very much for her question. She gives voice to the people of Mallee and country Australia and is a true champion of the regions. When Britain left Australia for the

         , who became a republican because of it. With this new gold standard free trade agreement, Britain is back. It heralds a new era, and the benefits for country businesses, primary producers and country communities are absolutely enormous.

         and more Vegemite coming into the UK. Well, to that I would say: Prime Minister, you don't know the half of it. The best is yet to come, because we've got Chiko Rolls from Bathurst coming your way. Life is going to get much better! As the

         Across country Australia, there is excitement about what lies ahead. Woodward abattoir, in the electorate of Mallee, is one business that is very excited and delighted about the opportunities that this new free trade agreement brings with it. The wine industry is also very excited. One of the features of this free trade agreement is the immediate elimination of all tariffs on Australian wine. Ben Crossing, from Angullong Wines, near Orange and Millthorpe in the

         . He says: 'It's a terrific opportunity to boost wine exports from our region and around Australia. It's great news, and this vitally important market to the Australian wine industry is going to be the better for it.' He gave it two thumbs up. Thank you, Ben.

         Another feature of this FTA is that working holiday-makers will be able to stay for three years, with an increase in the age limit to 35 years. With that, comes the advent of the ag visa. It something that we on this side of the House have been fighting for a long time, and good on the Prime Minister for delivering it when he was over there. The member for Maranoa has been passionate about it. Guy Gaeta, who heads up the Horticulture Committee of

         Farmers, has said this: 'Our industry has been plagued by labour shortages in recent years. We've been fighting for an ag visa for a long time, and I think it's going to be a game changer for the industry as we come out of COVID. If we'd done nothing, we'd have fruit rotting on trees and shortages on supermarket shelves.' The new era has begun, and regional Australia will benefit.
