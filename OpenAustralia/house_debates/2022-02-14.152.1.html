        I rise today to pay tribute to my friend Daryl Burge-Lopez, who passed away last month. He had recently been in poor health, but his death at 78 was not expected. Daryl had three loves in his life: his family, his friends and the Labor Party. He was a long time member of the Homedale branch of the Barton electorate. He first joined the Labor Party in Victoria, in the then federal seat of Yarra, held by

        , and involved himself with many of the anti-

        protests. This started his lifelong love of politics and campaigning for a just society. He was with his cousin Barbara when he was admitted to hospital. Barbara and her granddaughter Chloe were very special to Daryl, and I extend my sincere condolences to each of them. I also extend my condolences to his brother Peter and his family.

        Daryl had many friends, but his closest friend was

        members. I think they were both Oscar Madisons actually! Rather than playing a regular game of cards, like Felix and Oscar, they met each day at a local coffee lounge and argued about nothing in particularâ€”often extending their arguments, I'm told, to two sessions at the cafe, morning and afternoon, with a break for lunch. David, I know my office can't fill the gap left by Daryl, but you are always welcome to come and discuss any day's issues with us.

        Daryl was a good son, caring for his mother until her death. Each week he took her to the hairdresser, met David for coffee and then came to my office to discuss issues, before collecting his mum and going home. His last debate with my staff was over which seats Labor would win at the next election. Sadly we can't finish that debate. Election campaigning was Daryl's greatest motivator. He was happiest on the hustings. He had a unique style, I have to say, that often prompted calming words from the returning officer and, on the odd occasion, the police! Daryl was a bookseller and had a fantastic library which he shared with people. I want to thank Daryl for his lifelong devotion to the Labor Party, for his friendship and for his support of Labor in Barton. Thank you, Daryl, for our memories of a true Labor stalwart. You will be very sadly missed.
