       <p>
        As a proud member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Town" rel="nofollow">
         George Town
        </a>
        community I'm pleased to stand here today to recognise Michael Barrenger, a much-loved member of our community, who recently received the Citizen of the Year Award from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Town_Council" rel="nofollow">
         George Town Council
        </a>
        . Michael has been an active member of the community since he first moved to the town 37 years ago. He joined the George Town Rotary Club for a number of years and restarted Apex in George Town. George Town
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        has also been very fortunate to have Michael involved.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although beginning his career as a sheetmetal worker, Michael has given 44 years of his life to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tasmanian_Ambulance_Service" rel="nofollow">
         Tasmanian Ambulance Service
        </a>
        . Michael started off as a volunteer during his spare time and went on to gain accreditation and become an intensive care paramedic. As stated by the George Town Council:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        His is a face that the George Town community has come to know and respect. A face that has given comfort to families in their worried times, who has helped young couples see new life enter the world and has dealt with things we dare not to think of.
       </p>
       <p>
        As someone who has been in an ambulance a few times with Michael as the attending paramedic, I can attest to his wonderful comforting nature. Indeed, he also came to my rescue a few years ago when I had a bad fall while working in my local hotel. Though off duty, he was there in a flash to render assistance.
       </p>
       <p>
        Michael, our entire community is proud to call you our own. We're thrilled to see your dedication and service to our town recognised in this way.
