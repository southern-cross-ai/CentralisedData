       <p>
        I rise to speak this morning about an important member of our community in my seat of Mackellar, one Judy Dubois. Judy is a person who has a history of involvement in community groups and of giving of herself selflessly, but she is also a vital member of the Liberal Party. Judy is the epitome of the sort of people we love to have within our membershipâ€”people who are vitally involved in the community and who also serve in a political party and, therefore, bring knowledge of what is happening among our people to the attention of the local member and the party as a whole.
       </p>
       <p>
        Judy volunteered 34 years ago as an instructor for the learn-to-swim program at Narrabeen pool and she has only just retired after 34 years of service. This is a community based organisation that provides free swimming lessons for children, which are so vital on our northern beaches where we have such vast, beautiful beaches as well as pools. The appalling tragedies that have been reported of children who have drowned because they were unable to swim just make the work that Judy did over those 34 years all the more important.
       </p>
       <p>
        Judy also spent 10 years working for Meals on Wheels, visiting people who either had disabilities or were aged and unable to leave their home as much as they would have liked. Judy is a warm person who came in and was part of their lives. Judy is also someone who carried the Olympic torch as one of the volunteers and I am proud to have hanging in my office a wonderful photograph of her holding it high as she was recognised for her involvement in the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the past 30 years Judy has served as branch secretary of the

        branch, but she has now been elected the vice-president, which is a good and just reward, I think, as 30 years of her being the secretary meant that that branch was always well run with good agendas, orderly meetings and good records. Judy has also been a strong campaigner. She has been the manager of the prepolling booths. She has been involved in all of my campaigns since the by-election and every election since, as she is for our state members as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Judy is a valued member of our community. She is someone who has the great affection of many people within the community. Judy is also a member of the

         Motor Neurone Disease Association

        and understands what a dreadful disease that is. Judy is someone who, I would like to put on the record, has given of herself and is loved by many. (Time expired)
