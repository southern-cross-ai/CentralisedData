        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture. I refer the minister to the Clean Energy Regulator's list of entities liable for the carbon tax, showing that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JBS" rel="nofollow">

        Dinmore has been hit with a $1.7 million carbon tax bill for 2012-13. Minister, how is the carbon tax impacting on agribusinesses like this one and what can be done about it immediately?

         I would like to thank the member for his question. In his area they were famous strawberry producers. In fact, as you go down the road, you go past Roys Road. Wyatt Roy—who remains the youngest member of this parliament and will be for decades—has asked this question but it should really be asked by the member for Blair, because Ipswich is in his electorate and this meatworks is the largest employer in his electorate.
        </p>
        <p>
         But, of course, he is not going to ask this question on behalf of the working families and the people of Ipswich. Oh, no, he is not going to ask this question on behalf of the working families of Ipswich, because he believes in the carbon tax. He believes that they should pay that $1.7 million. You believe they should pay that $1.7 million, don't you? They could actually use that $1.7 million to expand the production facilities. They could actually be employing more people in Ipswich. They could be helping out the people of Ipswich. But, oh, no; you believe that they should pay the tax because, apparently out there in the great vault of heaven, you are changing the climate. Well, congratulations; well done!
        </p>
        <p>
         But I am a bit worried because since the carbon tax has been in it is all supposed to be better and it is all supposed to be fixed—

           but it seems to be around about where you left it. This was the sort of insidious thing, the ridiculous economics, which the Labor Party had—it is the whole reason they are in opposition—but which also affected the people of Ipswich. It still affects the good working families of Ipswich because not only do they pay it in the processing sector but they also pay it on electricity, water and the trucks going in and out of Ipswich employing working men and women. They are going to pay it on that from 1 July. You believe this tax should be everywhere.

           You just sow it home, because the people of Ipswich can go to the member for Blair and say, 'He's not much of a member, but he is changing the climate, which is very good.' It is great to see that your belief—

             in this is greater than your belief in the working men and women of Ipswich, who you should be standing up for. This carbon tax is such a work of art because if less than 25,000 tonnes of carbon are emitted, they do not pay the carbon tax, but once a beast goes through on the hooks and they go over 25,000 tonnes they do. It is actually a $603,000 beast. You must have been on the working group to work that one out! So what we will do for the people of Ipswich—and thank you, Wyatt Roy, for asking the question—is help the working families and get rid of the carbon tax.
