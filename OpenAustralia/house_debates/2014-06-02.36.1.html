        The Eagleby Learning College is an alternative Education Queensland site that provides quality state secondary education and certificate courses to students who do not fit into the mainstream education system. As a winner of the recent Showcase Award for Excellence in Inclusive Education, the college, located in Eagleby, embodies its motto: 'It all STARTS here.' The motto promotes the ability for students of any age to re-engage with education and to kick-start their career, whether it be in further education or in the workforce. By delivering programs in a condensed manner, focused on maths, English and certificate courses, students are also able to fast-track their schooling.
       </p>
       <p>
        The reality is that many of the students at Eagleby Learning College were struggling to attend 20 per cent of their schooling commitments in mainstream education, with 50 per cent disengaged completely. However, with this alternative program they now average 71 per cent, with a 98 per cent pass rate in their individual areas of study.

        I recently had the pleasure of visiting Eagleby Learning College and was greeted by staff and students who not only strive for excellence but are also committed to their community. It was wonderful to see the incredible opportunities these students have been provided with and to experience the incomparable influence that an alternative type of education can have on individuals looking to further their education. It is this commitment and re-engagement into education that will drive future successes in our community.
