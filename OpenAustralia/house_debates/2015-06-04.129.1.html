        I wish to congratulate and thank the Bangladeshi and Greek communities in my area for two recent fundraising efforts in support of medical research. On 10 May the Bangladeshi community came together once again to organise a biggest morning tea in support of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Cancer Council. Hundreds of families came together to enjoy Bengali food, desserts and entertainment with representatives from the cancer council and local political leaders. On the day in Mascot over $5,000 was raised for cancer research and prevention. This was one of four events that the Bangladeshi community in Sydney organised. Another event was organised in Blacktown, in the member for Greenway's seat. In total over the four locations $23,000 was raised for the cancer council this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        This event has been running since 2001. Since 2001 the Bangladeshi community has raised an amazing $125,000 for cancer research in Australia at those morning tea events. I am really proud to have such an active and philanthropic Bangladeshi community in my area. I wish to in particular congratulate once again Azad Alum and his organising committee for their work on putting on and organising this wonderful event in support of cancer research.
       </p>
       <p>
        Secondly, the Greek community through

        </a>
        , the Australasian Hellenic Educational Progressive Association, have once again held their annual fundraising dinner in support of medical research. Over $20,000 was raised on the evening for oncology research and juvenile arthritis. This event has been running for many years and they have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars for medical research. I congratulate Tasha Vanos, the Chair of the Medical Research Foundation for AHEPA, and the organising committee for the wonderful work they do.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, once again for AHEPA, the

        in the New South Wales parliament. At the lunch, the Daughters of Penelope raised $1,000 for domestic violence organisations, but they also donated much women's and children's clothing and toys for those who are afflicted by domestic violence. I thank Louisa Melas and her board, for the Daughters of Penelope.
