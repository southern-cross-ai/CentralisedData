        Last week I had the honour of judging the grand parade of the schools-led cattle and goat competition held at Kadina. It was the first ever, and the reason it was the first ever is that normally these children would exhibit at the Adelaide show. Of course the

        has been called off, along with the Kadina show, which last year in fact staged the first-ever led goat competition. Particularly to Port Broughton Area School, Central Yorke School, Clare High School,

        and

        : well done.
       </p>
       <p>
        Well done to the Kadina Show Society; the president, Maxine Tully; and in particular Natasha Westbrook, who worked so hard to bring this together. She thought that the kids, having gone to all this effort of beautifully preparing the animals and building that bond between human and animal to exhibit them, should have the opportunity to do just that.

       <p>
        We hit some pretty cold and inclement weather. I think there's a photo kicking around of me hunkering down under a brolly on the edge of the arena. But these kids just soldiered on. It didn't matter how wet it was. It didn't matter how cold it was. They presented the cattle and the goats in the finest of styles. I congratulate everybody associated with this event. It's really important—and this is what country shows do anyhow—that we build the interest in our kids in agriculture and the things that that does for Australia.
