        On Saturday, 26 August I had the great honour and privilege of opening the Sunnybank Quilters 2006 quilt show at the Mount Gravatt Showgrounds. This well-respected cottage group has been operating for over 20 years and in that time the 40 members have raised many thousands of dollars for charity. As a Sunnybank club, the group is within the electorate of Moreton and I take this opportunity to acknowledge my colleague the Hon.

        , who is very appreciative of the Sunnybank Quilters and their support of the Southside Education Centre throughout the years. His hard work and willingness to help has always been much appreciated, as it is by other clubs and organisations in the Moreton electorate.
       </p>

        This year’s quilt show was organised by Mrs Mary Dettori, ably assisted by Mrs Jan Munn, Mrs Cecily McMahon and Mrs Clarice Elford. All members contributed by sewing for the well-stocked sales table, working tirelessly throughout the day to provide refreshments and by displaying their beautifully crafted quilts, dolls, bears, bags and jackets. As a result of their fine efforts, the show was an outstanding success with more than 520 members of the community gathering at the grounds to show their interest and support. Most importantly, the net proceeds of $7,000 will be equally distributed between the

        of Queensland and the Community Angels for Homeless Youth. I commend the Sunnybank Quilters on their exceptional service to our community and their commitment to bettering the lives of others through regular contributions to charity. It is through the dedicated efforts of people such as Mary Dettori and her entire team that the local community not only can enjoy events such as the 2006 quilt show but also can contribute to an extremely worthwhile cause.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 26 August I also had the great pleasure of officially opening the

        Arts and Crafts Show. This too was a great success and congratulations are due to President Ian Bigalla, John Wearne and all the Lions Club members who were instrumental in organising the show. A wide variety of arts and crafts lined the many stalls that were present on the day. It was an overwhelming display of the local talent we have in the Bonner community. The Lions Club of Moreton Bay has been operating for many years and in that time the Lions have worked tirelessly for the betterment of the community and its people. Through their work the local bayside community has been able to support international Lions Club projects such as the Campaign SightFirst

        project, which seeks to eradicate preventable blindness. The funds raised from the arts and crafts show will be donated directly to this project which will ultimately benefit disadvantaged Australians throughout the country as well as international communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the local federal member, not only is it an honour to regularly participate in community events such as the 2006 quilt show and the Lions Club arts and crafts show but more importantly it is an enriching experience. So many organisations and individuals within the Bonner electorate are committed to assisting others, and I commend them on their unique ability to mobilise the local community for a greater good. The Lions Club of Moreton Bay and the Sunnybank Quilters have my full support and I thank my colleague Minister Hardgrave for allowing me the opportunity to open the Sunnybank club’s 2006 quilt show.
