A local couple, Cate McQuillen and Hewey Eustace live near Whiporie. They used to play in a pub duo called Two Pot Screamers. But their creative talents are about to be recognised worldwide. Their company, mememe productions, has teamed up with Canada’s

        ’s message of encouraging kids to lead environmentally sustainable lives is very much down to earth. It is very localised. It even has one of the local schools in it, the Wooli local school. They will also be able to benefit very much when the
