        This morning I rise to advise the House of our new breed of leaders coming through the electorate of Wright. Recently I have had the opportunity to attend many award ceremonies at high schools throughout my electorate, of which we have 11. I refer in particular to Jude Fox, the principal of Flagstone State Community College. She was doing an exceptional job up there with her students last week. Particular mention should go to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Kelly" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Lyndsey Skipper, the new school captains of that school. Boonah State High School owes a debt to their school principal, Bronwyn Johnstone, who has done an outstanding job in the work that she does not only throughout the school but through the extended community. The new school captains there are Euwan Treharn,

        , Tahlia Kinrade and Laura Pennell. Congratulations go to each of them. At the Hills

        has presided over some outstanding achievements. The school captains this year are Arish Soogirm and Charlene Quinn. Hills International College has a golf course attached to the school. One of the outstanding students leaving that school is playing off a handicap of three.

        Emmaus College Jimboomba had their awards ceremony the other day under the guidance of their principal, Kevin Schwede, and the elected captains for this year were Louise Bolland and

        </a>
        . Over at The Kooralbyn School, its principal, Geoff Mills, has been doing a fantastic job recently and I look forward to spending more time with him this year. Sarah Black and Chang Dong Yang are the school captains. I refer to Faith Lutheran College, over in the Laidley area, which is under the auspicious leadership of Janelle Anderson. Janelle is very emotional and is connected very closely to her students. I took the opportunity to thank their leaders who next year will be Abby Dennien and Claire Jahnke. Closer to my office is Beaudesert State High School, under the direction of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allan_Smith" rel="nofollow">

        , its principal. Mitchell Hyam and Natasha-Rose Stapleton will lead the charge. As of last week I would like to acknowledge a particular award recipient in Megan Grummitt, who won an essay-writing competition throughout our electorate. Megan prepared a thousand-word essay for our office on the relationship between Australia and America over the next 60 years. for her effort she was rewarded with my ticket to the gallery. She had come down under the sponsorship of Virgin, sat in the gallery, had the opportunity to meet the Leader of the Opposition,

        , and got her photograph taken with Kamahl. She returned a very happy and proud girl after this auspicious event. I would like to congratulate Megan for the wonderful work that she did in presenting that report to our officeâ€”a well-deserving recipient.
