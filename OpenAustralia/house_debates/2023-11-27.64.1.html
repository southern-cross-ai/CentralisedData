       <p>
        I rise today to deliver a speech written by Aislinn Ninnes, a year 6 student from my electorate of Dawson:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Dear Members of Parliament,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I strongly suggest that we lower the costs for fuel because so many people around Australia have to travel a lot.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And some people even have to drive from a whole other town to get to work, like my teacher.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To start with, I have a teacher who drives all the way from Ayr to Bowen to teach art.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        But then she has to go to the service station to get fuel and uses the money that she has worked hard for just to drive all the way back to Ayr.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I also know for a fact that some people from Bowen, including me, have to drive to Proserpine in the afternoons for dance lessons.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        On the way we have to stop for fuel most of the time and pay an overpriced amount per litre.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Another point is that my mum, and other mums, work hard for money to support their children but have to pay for really expensive fuel to take them places.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Don't you want them to give their child a better life?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        After all, I believe that you should consider lowering the price of fuel.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Please lower the prices for all of the parents and teachers who work hard and try their best to support their children and students.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you, Aislinn, for these words. Have a great day and all the best to you and all the kids from Bowen State primary school and
