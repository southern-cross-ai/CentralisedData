        One thing you'll find in regional Australia, and it's certainly true of my community, is a can-do attitude. I've seen it during drought, bushfire and COVID-19. Last week I saw it again through the Gilbert's Motor Museum in Strathalbyn. This new museum in our community is the brainchild of a group of volunteers from the Strathalbyn Tourism Organisation who when enjoying a Christmas drink or two a couple of years ago were sad about the closure of the Gilbert's garage on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Street" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . The garage had been there for 116 years. Many parts of the site were heritage listed, including an old bank building, and it has a secret underground tunnel to the pub and old stables across the road. The owners were going to shut the doors and, as it was located on High Street, a tourist destination for antiques and collectables, the community thought something more could happen. And so they created a motor museum. Seven thousand volunteer hours later, they have created something truly unique. The displays change constantly. When I was there I saw a Rolls-Royce that had featured in the movie

         </a>
        </i>
        and a remarkable collection of grand prix memorabilia. The local volunteers call their transformed garage a memory museum, not a motor museumâ€”and it truly is that. There is something for all ages. There are little cars for children to have a look at. It is open from Wednesday to Sunday and it is very affordable to attend. I highly recommend a visit.
