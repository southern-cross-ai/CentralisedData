       <p>
        Today, I would like to give a shout out to all the students at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canterbury_College" rel="nofollow">
         Canterbury College
        </a>
        , at Waterford, and highlight some of the students' recent achievements.
       </p>
       <p>
        Firstly, I would like to commend the 23 members of the Canterbury College's Cantabile Choir, who recently returned from their Passion of Italy tour. The students performed at a great number of venues during their 10-day tour, including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Peter's_Basilica" rel="nofollow">
         St Peter's Basilica
        </a>
        . The girls performed concerts where they were the exclusive choir and others where they performed with the Passion of Italy Festival Choir. The Cantabile College Choir had an amazing experience performing around Italy and I commend them for the great job they did representing their school and our region.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to recognise the efforts of an outstanding and high-achieving Canterbury College student, Caitlyn Peck. Year 7 student Caitlyn won gold and silver in the Australian Artistic Roller Skating Championships earlier this year. Caitlyn finished first in figures and second in set dance. Her parents and coach said she was training three days a week and is a very driven competitor.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations to all the students in the Canterbury College Cantabile Choir and to rollerskating champion Caitlyn Peck on their outstanding achievements.
