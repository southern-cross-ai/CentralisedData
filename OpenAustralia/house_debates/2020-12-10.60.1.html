       <p>
        I'm very lucky to have an electorate that is beautifully nestled between the Adelaide foothills and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Torrens" rel="nofollow">
         River Torrens
        </a>
        . So it's no surprise—that being the catchment for the upper Torrens—that I've got a number of waterways such as Fourth Creek running through my electorate. There are also lots of great Landcare groups who do such excellent work in our nature areas throughout the electorate—particularly through the waterways—and many of them were successful in the Communities Environment Program grant scheme that was announced at the start of the year. Of course, the coronavirus—as it impacted on everyone—has also impacted on them. I just wanted, on the last sitting date, to extend my warmest congratulations to those groups who were able to successfully complete all of those funded programs despite the challenges that came their way. We are making excellent progress in the eastern suburbs of Adelaide in improving our environment and particularly in improving the catchment area, which is a complete metropolitan area in the city of Adelaide. They do phenomenal work. It was a pleasure to help them secure those grants and get the support for the programs that they do. Despite the disruptions of COVID, they were all able to successfully complete them. I congratulate them warmly, and I look forward to working with all my Landcare groups for the next 12 months for more success.
