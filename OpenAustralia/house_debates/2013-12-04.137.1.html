        I rise to congratulate the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_Airport_Corporation" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane Airport Corporation
        </a>
        on its announcement today of a $45 million overhaul of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_International_Airport" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane International Airport
        </a>
        Terminal. In a statement today, the Brisbane Airport Corporation announced the redevelopment would create a world-class airport environment for travellers including new specialty stores, food and beverage outlets and unrivalled views of planes and runways.
       </p>
       <p>
        On its completion in late 2015, Brisbane international airport will boast one of the most spectacular arrivals and departures areas in the world. Since the Brisbane international terminal was first developed in 1997, Brisbane has grown into a modern and vibrant international city. First impressions count, and it is welcome news that we will have a first-class international terminal to reflect Brisbane's relaxed, outdoor but cosmopolitan lifestyle. Brisbane Airport Corporation's

        and Managing Director Julieanne Alroe described the new design as 'a fresh welcome which captures Brisbane's unique design and entrepreneurial spirit, the drive and enthusiasm of enterprising small business and the local lifestyle'. I congratulate Ms Alroe and

        on their continued dedication and professionalism in advancing the redevelopment project. It has been in the planning stages for the past 12 months, and construction will start in early 2014.
       </p>
       <p>
        Once it is underway, the project will continue further job growth on top of the 2,700 jobs that have been created during the construction of the new parallel runway. These developments provide an example of the kind of private sector led jobs growth that the Abbott government is committed to. We are creating the right conditions for the private sector to grow by getting taxes down, reducing regulatory burdens on business and improving productivity. In addition to creating jobs growth, the project will create opportunities for local Brisbane businesses. I congratulate particularly Richards &amp; Spence and Arkhefield, two talented Brisbane architectural firms which have been appointed to the project. Both firms are responsible for designing some of the most iconic retail and commercial spaces in the Brisbane electorate. Richard &amp; Spence is well known for the work it did on the fantastic

       </p>
       <p>
        The international terminal upgrade and parallel runway are part of the $2.5 billion the Brisbane Airport Corporation is investing in infrastructure over a 10-year period. There are other projects, including a new multilevel car park, walkway facilities, road terminal expansions, road upgrades and a number of new commercial buildings. I look forward to the wonderful and continuing contribution the Brisbane Airport Corporation is making.
