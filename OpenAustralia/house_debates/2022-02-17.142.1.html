        Today I rise to highlight the outstanding work being done by one of Calare's great service clubs, the newly named
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Lions Club
        </a>
        of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Panorama" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Panorama
        </a>
        . The club was formerly known as Bathurst Macquarie. It became part of Australia's largest service club organisation about 46 years ago. Since then, scores of outstanding members have volunteered their time and service to raise hundreds of thousands of dollars to make the wider Bathurst community a better place for everyone lucky enough to call it home.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lions" rel="nofollow">
         The Lions
        </a>
        motto is We Serve. I know this because I, too, am a proud Lion, and I see what these wonderful men and women do for our communities and also our younger Leos. Members continue to be there in times of flood, drought and bushfire. Day in, day out, they quietly take on projects to improve the lives of area residents. Their work provides funds to buy vital equipment for those who need it most: a state-of-the-art wheelchair for a young school student; hearing dogs; insurance to allow students to take part in riding for the disabled; toiletries and clothing for the city's homeless; a sewing machine, material and thread to allow disabled residents to learn to sew. All this valuable work is funded by money raised by the Lions. Their main income comes from the monthly riverside markets where members collect donations from visitors and fees from stallholders. Members also run a catering van to cook up a storm at fundraising barbecues. The food van and storage shed are made possible thanks in part to Australian government funding.

        This month I was honoured to take part in celebrations to launch the club's new name, a name its members have chosen to take it into the next chapter. What better year to rename the club than the same year Lions Australia celebrates its 75th anniversary and the same year Mount Panorama Lion

        These men and women exemplify the community spirit that makes Australia such a wonderful country. On behalf of this parliament, I formally recognise them and thank them for their dedication and service. I also recognise Lions right around Australia, wherever they may be, and thank them for all of their wonderful work. They are part of the fabric of our communities right around Australia. We would certainly be lost without our Lions, and I know all members of this House join me in saluting our Lions and the wonderful work that they do.
