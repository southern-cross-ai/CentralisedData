       <p>
        Last month more than 300 girls were kidnapped in the middle of the night from the safety of their beds. Nearly all of them are still missing, and this week we saw a video from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boko_Haram" rel="nofollow">
         Boko Haram
        </a>
        , their captors, showing 77 of the girls in a frightened group. Some parents were able to identify their daughters in that group, and I can only imagine the anger and pain that they suffered. Perhaps the only people suffering more were the parents who could not see the daughters in that group and would be wondering what has happened to them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Defending the right of girls to an education is a responsibility for us, not an aspiration. Keeping girls in school leads to happier and healthier families, fairer and more equal societies and more prosperous economies. It is good for the girls as individuals and it is good for all of us—for their families and their countries. In developing countries one extra year of primary school boosts a girl's future wage 10 to 20 per cent and an extra year of secondary school increases that earning potential by 15 to 25 per cent. Each additional year of female education reduces child mortality by 18 in every thousand births. An estimated 65 million girls are not in school worldwide, and 31 million of those schools are of primary school age and 17 million are expected never to attend school. The Australian aid program has been working successfully to reduce that number. Aid keeps more girls in school; it improves maternal health; it reduces domestic violence. The Australian aid program has made a very real and measurable impact on the lives of women and girls.
       </p>
       <p>
        These are just some of the contributions of aid. Since 2000 the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GAVI" rel="nofollow">
         GAVI
        </a>
        Alliance has immunised 440 million children against preventable disease. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Fund" rel="nofollow">
         Global Fund
        </a>
        has provided 6.1 million people with antiretroviral therapy and detected and treated 11.2 million cases of tuberculosis. Since 1990, 2.3 billion people have got access to better quality drinking water from improved sources and 700 million fewer people lived in extreme poverty in 2010 compared with 1990. So for all those people who say, 'What is the point; aid does not work,' remember that figure—700 million fewer people lived in extreme poverty in 2010 compared to 1990.
       </p>
       <p>
        These achievements are not accidental. They have been driven by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Development_Goals" rel="nofollow">
         Millennium Development Goals
        </a>
        . The goals were agreed by the international community and all of the leading development institutions around the world in an effort to end extreme poverty. It was the Howard government that first signed Australia up to achieving the Millennium Development Goals in an agreement under which Australia committed to aid spending with a target of 0.5 per cent of gross national income. It is not an arbitrary target, as suggested in the Commission of Audit. It is an international commitment signed up to by the Howard government with bipartisan support from Labor, guided by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
         OECD
        </a>
        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations
        </a>
        and agreed to by all of the world's leaders.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under Labor, the aid project was on track to reach that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNI" rel="nofollow">
         GNI
        </a>
        funding target of 0.5 per cent in 2017-18. Overseas aid increased every single year during our time in government. It doubled in fact during our time in government. In March Prime Minister Abbott described aid funding targets for 2017-18 as an 'aspiration'. He walked away from the growth funding detail in his own MYEFO document and, following his $7.6 billion cut to aid in this budget, the foreign aid budget will decline from 0.33 per cent of GNI in the current financial year to 0.29 per cent in 2017-18. It will fall.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just as aid funding growth under Labor had a real and measurable impact, cuts under this government will have a real and measurable impact on the world's poorest people. This government does not understand that our aid program has been built on commitments not aspirations. As Australians, we come from a generous and a prosperous nation and we can afford to have a strong aid program. We can afford to protect the rights of girls to education, the right for children to feel safe in their schools, and the right for parents to send their daughters to school knowing that they will see them again that night.

        <p>
         As the federal member for Higgins I have used my position to advocate strongly for health and medical research in Australia both in the community and in this place. One of the reasons that I founded the Parliamentary Friendship Group of Women in Science, Maths and Engineering was to ensure that there were no artificial barriers to women in research. One of the reasons that I am proud to be an ovarian cancer ambassador is because I know how many lives are devastated by this disease, a disease that has no early detection test and no cure. Health and medical research is critical to delivering better health care for all Australians and it is also critical to our economic future.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sadly, not everyone shares this view. Not long ago, in fact in February last year, I had occasion to speak in this chamber because of Labor's approach to research—playing games with freezing and unfreezing funding for such things as the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHMRC" rel="nofollow">
          NHMRC
         </a>
         grants and strangling the sector in red tape, as evidenced by the increased time and money needed to successfully implement a clinical trial in Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
          The Abbott
         </a>
         government is focused on both reducing red tape and also on providing certainty to researchers around the funding framework. That certainty will be delivered through the establishment of a $20 billion medical research
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_Fund" rel="nofollow">
          Future Fund
         </a>
         as announced in the budget this week. This fund will commence on 1 January 2015, assuming that the health savings in the budget receive support through the House and the Senate. Once the fund reaches $20 billion, it is expected to be the largest of its kind in the world. The fund's annual net interest earnings will fund medical research. Distributions from the fund to medical research will be around $1 billion by 2022-23, which will double the government's direct medical research funding.
        </p>
        <p>
         The capital of the fund will be protected and that capital will be managed by the Future Fund Board of Guardians under the chairmanship of Hon. Peter Costello
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC" rel="nofollow">
          AC
         </a>
         . It will be the earnings from the fund that will provide a secure and ongoing funding stream. Decisions on the allocation of this funding, though, will be determined by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Health" rel="nofollow">
          National Health
         </a>
         and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Research" rel="nofollow">
          Medical Research
         </a>
         Council, as is appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
         So why is this new fund appropriate? Why is it important to all Australians? If we provide the right research framework in this country—one that encourages talented researchers and innovators who are home grown, as well as those from overseas to work in Australia—it will deliver economic benefits for Australia and better health care for all Australians. As I have said before, health and medical research is critical to Australia's future and should be one of our strategic priorities and, as announced in the budget, it certainly is.
        </p>

         With a hub of world-class universities and research institutes based in Melbourne, it is particularly critical for Victoria. We have institutes and also hospitals that conduct research such as the Florey Institute of Neuroscience and

         </a>
         , just to name a few.
        </p>
        <p>
         Importantly, as a country we are very good at medical research. Thanks to Australian research we have life-saving innovations such as penicillin, first used as a medicine by the Australian Noble laureate
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Florey" rel="nofollow">
          Howard Florey
         </a>
         . We also have the bionic ear, the cervical cancer vaccine and spray-on skin for burns, to name just a few.
        </p>
        <p>
         Commercialising research can lead to direct wealth creation and jobs growth. Importantly, it can also reduce spiralling healthcare costs and deliver a higher quality of life. I hope that the Greens in particular, and deputy leader
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Bandt" rel="nofollow">
          Adam Bandt
         </a>
         , who has like me been an advocate for certainty in this sector, will do the right thing by both our nation and our research community, who are depending upon them for this fund.
