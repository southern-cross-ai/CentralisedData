        My question is to the Minister for Health. Minister, given the government's priorities in relation to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        and education reform, does the minister believe that there is scope for savings in the

        through the extension of the supply of generic drugs under the PBS to fund those reforms?

         I thank the member for New England. I know that he is a very serious and responsible representative of his community. He is always interested in working cooperatively where he can to find savings where it is possible. When it comes to the further use of generics, Australia has already experienced a great deal of change in this area in recent years. Certainly there was a report a couple of days ago that suggested that we could make further savings in this area. But it is worth pointing out that over 1,400 brands of 137 medicines have already fallen in price by between 10 per cent and 87 per cent—some very substantial savings already. In 2010, there was a $1.9 billion saving in one go. More recently, we are looking at another $1 billion saving on the reduced price of generic medicines.
        </p>
        <p>
         The member for New England asked whether we should perhaps spend that money on the National Disability Insurance Scheme or on the very important education reforms. Both of those, of course, are priority policy areas for this government. They will make huge changes to people's lives—to the lives of Australians with a disability and to our next generation of young people. But I have to say that, as a health minister, I have some priorities of my own. We have listed $5 billion worth of new medicines on the

         </a>
         list since 2007. They are very important medicines for a whole range of conditions. We have new medicines—

            saying that we should not be listing these new medicines for hepatitis C, chronic pain, cancer, arthritis, asthma, diabetes and specialist paediatric treatments?
           </p>
           <p>
            I want to say to the member for New England that I understand his concerns. I value the recent work that has been done by

             Stephen Duckett
            </a>
            on looking for further areas in which to look for more savings. Indeed, I agree with him on the areas that he has named as important policy areas for the government. But as health minister finding that money for some of the important new medicines that we want to list is also a priority for me. We have worked hard to find savings in the older, more commonly used drugs so that we can make headroom for those exciting new treatments as they emerge.
