       <p>
        I would like to associate myself with the remarks and comments from the honourable member for Leichhardt and add that there is huge support in this place across the parties for the contribution that the honourable member gave. A week ago, Sunday, in my electorate of Page in Yamba, Jill Bradshaw and a group of committed people who are friends of volunteering for Tibet held an event at their place with an art show and a whole range of works to bring attention to the plight of the human rights suffering that is ongoing and seems to be systemic in Tibet. It is something that is intolerable in 2013, and we are right to speak up and speak out on that particular issue.

        I would also like to talk about something else that has happened in my electorate. Some people here, I am sure, would know about the

        , Cate McQuillen and Hewey Eustace, live in my electorate at Whiporie. They beavered away for years and made this program hugely successful. Just recently, on 25 February, they were nominated for the International Digital Emmy Award for an Aussie company. That is pretty good. It is pretty up there. They live—and I have the Google map here of where they live—on the
