        I rise to clear up the confusion in the electorate of Mallee that seems to be propagated by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Education_Union" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Education Union
        </a>
        . The 119 schools and the 23,069 students of Mallee are all going to be better off under the education funding that we announced in the budget. This is a great initiative. It is fantastic. If you talk to these schools you see that they are a bit confused about what is going on, and I wanted to clear this up for them:
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Brigid's_College" rel="nofollow">
         St Brigid's College
        </a>
        , Horsham—better off;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Patrick's_College" rel="nofollow">
         St Patrick's College
        </a>
        , Stawell—better off; St Patrick's College, Nhill—better off; Red Cliff's—better off; Horsham Secondary College—better off; Mildura Christian College—better off. Every one of the 119 schools are going to be better off.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have funded the things that we are going to deliver. The three words that you should always say to members of parliament are: 'Yes, but how?' 'How are you going to pay for it?' In contrast, Labor are making lots of big statements but have not allocated how they are going to pay for anything. We have money on the table to pay for these education reforms and ensuring that every school in Mallee is better off.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor have not learnt. Labor still see the money of every Australian as a credit card. Instead of putting money aside to pay for things, they want to rack it up onto your bill, and your children and grandchildren will pay for it in the future.
