       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Export Control (Consequential Amendments and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2019 is a companion bill to the Export Control Bill 2019.
       </p>
       <p>
        It will facilitate the smooth transition from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_Control_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Export Control Act
        </a>
        1982, the Export Charges (Collection) Act 2015 and part 2 of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Act 1997 to the new legislative framework.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill will repeal 17 acts which are redundant, or which will become redundant, with the enactment of the Export Control Bill 2019.
       </p>
       <p>
        It will deliver a simpler and easier way to understand legislative framework.
       </p>
       <p>
        It will also make minor consequential amendments to seven Commonwealth acts that refer to the Export Control Act 1982, as well as remove provisions that will be incorporated in the Export Control Bill 2019.
       </p>
       <p>
        Importantly, this bill will support a smooth transition from the existing legislation to the new regulatory framework.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill will do this by ensuring that arrangements to manage the export of goods are transitioned appropriately, without disruption to exporters, to industry or to trade.
       </p>
       <p>
        For example: an accredited property or a registered establishment under the existing legislation will transition to be recognised as an accredited property or a registered establishment under the new legislation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Any outstanding applications made under the existing export law that are not dealt with before the Export Control Bill 2019 commences will be transitioned in this bill so that they can be dealt with under the new export legislation framework.
       </p>
       <p>
        The compliance and enforcement measures in the Export Control Bill 2019 will apply for the purposes of monitoring and investigating compliance with the repealed laws. In addition, the monitoring and compliance powers under the existing legislation will continue to apply in relation to notices and directions given under a repealed law. This will ensure that compliance and enforcement activities can continue to protect the integrity of Australia's exports.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill will also preserve rights (such as the right to seek review of decisions) and liabilities (such as the requirement to pay fees) that exist under the repealed legislation. This will help to ensure there is no impact on the export industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the bill to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
