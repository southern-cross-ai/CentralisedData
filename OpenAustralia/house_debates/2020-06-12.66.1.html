        My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister outline to the House key outcomes from today's national cabinet meeting aimed at driving Australia's economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic?

         I thank the member for Sturt and I also thank the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Premier of South Australia
         </a>
         , which is where the member hails from, and thank all the premiers and chief ministers for the great work they've done in participating in the national cabinet. The national cabinet has been one of the most important mechanisms through which Australia has sought to manage the very complex issues that've been before us during this COVID-19 crisis. One of the things that have made Australia stand out from so many other countries, particularly those with federal systems, is the way that Australia's federation has been working together, with all the premiers and chief ministers. That's not to say there aren't disagreements. That's not to say there's always complete uniformity. Of course there isn't; we wouldn't expect that to be the case. But I want to thank very much the commitment shown by all those premiers and chief ministers. Not all agreed, not all supported and not all were as kind to the formation of the national cabinet as the government has been, but we will remain committed to that and have enshrined the national cabinet, together with the National Federation Reform Council, as the new way forward of managing federal affairs for this country.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today we focused on the usual agendaâ€”that is, the economic crisis that Australia faces and continuing to manage the health crisis that Australia faces. Now we're in the phase of reopening our economy under the three-step plan that was committed to by the national cabinet some weeks ago. We are on track and we are on target to reach that third step of that plan. States like

         and the

         are already there in step 3, South Australia also is moving into that territory,

         </a>
         , even Victoria. Queensland: I welcome the opening of the borders next month. In Queensland they've torn down that wall, and I'm very pleased that they have. I'm very pleased that South Australia is also responding and nominating the date by which those borders will come down. We look forward to other states following suit, and I thank them for the good faith way they engaged on these issues today.
        </p>
        <p>
         Importantly, with opening up and removing more restrictions, particularly in July when it comes to indoor venues, one of the most difficult issues that we have dealt with has been funerals and attendance at funerals. Step 3 previously put a limit of 100 on the attendance at funerals in most parts of the country. Today, it's only as many as 50. But in step 3 that limit will go, and the number of people who can attend a funeral indoors will only be limited by the four-square-metre rule. Outdoors, they'll be able to have many more, provided there is appropriate seating. I know that will be welcomed by so many Australians. This has been the biggest of so many hardships that Australians have had to confront in not being able to say goodbye to their loved ones. There have been many others. But that one is an important change.
