          On behalf of all Australians our thoughts are with the people of South-East Queensland and northern

           New South Wales

          who are dealing with yet another flood disaster. I am advised that in the last 24 hours there have been 1,654 people affected by evacuations in Smithtown, Gladstone, Kinchela, Jerseyville, Woodburn, Cabbage Tree Island and Bellingen. Approximately 20,000 people remain isolated in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Rivers" rel="nofollow">

         </p>
         <p>
          The evacuation order has been lifted for areas around Kempsey, Grafton, South Grafton, Ulmarra, Brushgrove and Maclean; however, the

           Pacific Highway

          and a number of rivers continue to be monitored.
         </p>
         <p>
          On behalf of the parliament I send my condolences to the families of the two people who have died as a result of these extreme weather events. One man was struck during high winds on the

           Gold Coast
          </a>
          last weekend and another man died in flooding at Raleigh, south of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffs_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
           Coffs Harbour
          </a>
          , on Saturday. Our thoughts are with the families and friends of those during this difficult time. I would also like to acknowledge the untiring efforts of all emergency services workers in these areas. Some of them have travelled significant distances to volunteer their efforts. I know that local members have been working to assist their local constituents with their needs in this difficult time. In particular I would acknowledge the work of the member for Page, who has been providing me with updates over the past week about the impact of the flooding and those living in and around her electorate in northern New South Wales. I would also refer to the contributions of other members.
         </p>
         <p>
          The government has been in constant contact with the Queensland and New South Wales governments to ensure that any assistance required from the Commonwealth is being provided. Over the weekend the Minister for Human Services, Senator Ludwig, toured affected areas in the Ipswich region and South-East Queensland and the Attorney-General toured flooded areas in northern New South Wales.
         </p>
         <p>
          Last week the government commenced making payments under the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements available to people affected both in South-East Queensland and northern New South Wales. In Queensland this assistance provided in cooperation with the Queensland government across 12 local government areas affected by the flooding, included emergency assistance payments of $165 per person and up to $765 per family; essential household contents grants of $1,635 per individual and up to $4,910 per couple or family; and essential repairs to housing grants of up to $10,100 per individual and up to $13,600 per family.
         </p>
         <p>
          In New South Wales the assistance provided, in cooperation with the New South Wales government across 12 local government areas, has included personal hardship and distress grants to low-income earners whose principal place of residence has been damaged; concessional loans of up to $130,000 for eligible small businesses and primary producers affected by the disaster; concessional loans of up to $25,000 to voluntary non-profit organisations for the restoration of essential facilities; and road and rail freight subsidies of up to $15,000 to assist primary producers for the carriage of livestock and fodder.
         </p>
         <p>
          Today the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs also activated the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment to provide further assistance to help those in northern New South Wales affected by the flood disaster. The Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment will be a one-off immediate payment of $1,000 to adults and $4,000 to children. Claims for assistance can be made through Centrelink.
         </p>
         <p>
          Today, in recognition of the severe damage to local communities in northern New South Wales, the government has agreed to a request from the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Premier" rel="nofollow">
           New South Wales Premier
          </a>
          to extend the current assistance being provided to small business and to primary producers in the flood affected areas in northern New South Wales. This assistance will include one-off grants of up to $15,000 for small businesses and primary producers that can provide proof of expenditure on flood related recovery. The New South Wales Rural Assistance Authority will administer these payments. I have also today authorised this assistance for people affected by the earlier floods in New South Wales in late March.
         </p>
         <p>
          In announcing these payments the government recognises that this is the third season that many farmers have gone through without any substantial income as a result of extreme weather conditions. Damage to the agricultural sector has impacts on many other interdependent aspects of the community and the local members will be liaising with their communities to advise of any other additional assistance which is required. Mr Speaker, it is important to remember that this is not the first time these areas have faced severe weather months. In true Australian spirit these communities, who have already suffered and picked themselves up, are facing yet another battle today with tenacity and courage and the government stands ready to assist. As I have said on many occasions in the past, the Commonwealth stands ready to provide whatever assistance is necessary to those affected and I know all members of this place and all Australians around the country are standing by them in this time of need.

          </small>
          <p>
           On indulgence: I rise today in support of the Prime Minister’s remarks regarding the floods in South-East Queensland and the floods in northern
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
            New South Wales
           </a>
           . It is worth contemplating and reflecting on the unpredictability of our weather in Australia, and I note that, until relatively recently, South-East Queensland was going through an unprecedented drought, with dams getting very close to empty. Just last week, as my colleagues the members for Moncrieff,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McPherson" rel="nofollow">
            McPherson
           </a>
           and Fadden will attest, their communities received one year’s worth of rain in just three days. All of us saw the frightening pictures on the news of debris being hurled around in gale force winds which tragically resulted in the death of one man, and, of course, there was another life lost tragically as well. I join with the Prime Minister in giving our condolences to the families and friends of those two people who were killed.
          </p>
          <p>
           There have been very many anxious moments over the weekend. The Prime Minister mentioned the efforts of his colleague the member for Page, and the New South Wales seat of our colleague the member for Cowper, adjoining Page, was also affected mightily. Hundreds of residents in Grafton, Maclean and Kempsey were evacuated from their homes. The levee banks in these communities were tested to their absolute limit. We should in this House pay tribute today to the incredible dedication, diligence and bravery of our emergency services personnel. Many of these men and women will be at, or near, the point of exhaustion in their struggle to deal with this challenge of getting vital supplies and emergency assistance to the affected areas. Almost all of them are volunteers and we extend the gratitude of this parliament and the nation to them for their tireless efforts.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Australian spirit of mateship, generosity and self-sacrifice always shines through at times like this on so many occasions during these floods. I note, especially, the way in which the coastal community of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffs_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
            Coffs Harbour
           </a>
           made its example where its residents helped out their neighbours from the Clarence with food and a warm bed. Australians are strong and resilient people. We have an often capricious and certainly unpredictable climate. In times like this, as we have in the past, we must always stand ready to support and encourage our fellow Australians as they face these tough times.
