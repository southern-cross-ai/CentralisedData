        On Sunday 30 September I was very pleased to attend the official opening of the Warburton Bowls Club's new upgraded synthetic green. It was a great gathering of all of the members of the club. This is a vibrant club with a great history and, quite obviously, a great future as well. The club was established in 1922. It currently has around 70 members and it has been their ambition for many years to raise the large funds required to upgrade their green to a synthetic green. The fact that that long-held ambition was realised was a testament to their dedication and commitment. The club, with council, multiple community groups and club funds, injected the many thousands of dollars that were needed to construct a first-class synthetic green that will enable the club to host two pennant matches on the one day at the one time as they now compete in the metropolitan competition and bowl virtually every day of the year. With a club of such a rich history there are many people who have contributed so much to it over the years.
       </p>
       <p>
        The club president, Mr Ray Vizard,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC" rel="nofollow">
         MC
        </a>
        -ed events and he announced, quite fittingly, that two club members—Keith and Edna Thomas—were to be specially recognised and to have the synthetic green named after them. We were there for the unveiling of the Keith and Edna Thomas Green plaque. They have both given over 60 years of continuing service to the club. But, like so many volunteers, they are multiple volunteers in the Warburton community. They are stalwarts of the community. They are builders of the community. You cannot go to Warburton and not hear about the great contribution that Keith and Edna Thomas, and their wider family, have made to the Warburton community. So I want to mention their great contribution in this House and thank all of the club members and the president, Ray Vizard, for everything they do at the club but also in the wider community.
