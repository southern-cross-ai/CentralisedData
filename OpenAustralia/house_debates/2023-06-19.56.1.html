       <p>
        On Saturday, I joined around 200 Moreton locals in showing our support for the upcoming referendum on creating a First Nations Voice to Parliament.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Walk" rel="nofollow">
         The Walk
        </a>
        for Yes happened on a gorgeous morning, with the sun shining and people walking to show their commitment towards a First Nations Voice becoming enshrined in our Constitution. It was an uplifting experience. I know it will be these community people who decide the success of the referendum in the last quarter of this year. It will be the people's voices that will get this referendum over the line. It's the discussions they'll have with their families, their friends, their neighbours and at their community and sporting groups and clubs that will hold sway, that will win the day.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was comforted to see such a diverse range of ages, from students and P&amp;C reps from Yeronga State High School through to grandparents and everyone in between. It was great to hear why they're supporting the Voice and to also set them the challenge of starting more conversations. These personal interactions can be used to combat the mistruths and falsehoods being pedalled by the 'no' campaign and their enablers.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know the people of Moreton will vote yes, and I have faith in the people of Australia doing the same. But obviously, it's crucial that we have these conversations with our neighbours, with our community groups. I'll be doing my bit, as a member of parliament, but I know in Queensland there is a lot of work to do to get Queensland over the line when it comes to this referendum.
