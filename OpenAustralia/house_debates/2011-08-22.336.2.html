       <p>
        The member for Dobell needs to assure the House of these matters in a personal explanation or otherwise the Prime Minister's confidence in him is baseless and her protestations of his innocence sound hollow. The Prime Minister and the member for Dobell are essentially in lockstep today. The Prime Minister herself should demand that the member for Dobell attend the House and make a personal explanation dealing with each of these so-called misrepresentations. A personal explanation is the correct mechanism in this House for a member to dispel doubts about whether claims made about him or her are a misrepresentation. The fact that he has not done so suggests that he is not beingâ€”

            Mr Speaker, on a point of order: with regard to the motion that has been moved and now seconded before the chair, in the past motions have been ruled out of order because they were overly lengthy. This is a motion that took the mover some four minutes to read into

             Order! I stand by the decision of the person occupying the chair at the time to allow this suspension motion to proceed. It is of the A to Z that the Minister for Defence knows much about and the compromise there is that it takes four minutes to read and that is four minutes of a speech. I understand that the Leader of the House will have some grievance about the fact that he cannot move that the member be no longer heard until after that point, but I think that that is the accommodation. I agree with him that it would assist the House if motions were truncated, but on this occasion we have got this far.
