        My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister understand that today Victorians are dealing with the impacts of an extended lockdown, including the closure of schools, disruption to small businesses without JobKeeper, concern about vulnerable loved ones in aged care and ongoing mental health impacts? Prime Minister, wouldn't this have been avoided if, instead of insisting it's not a race, you'd simply done your job? Why should Victorians be punished for your negligence?

         I have greater faith in the people of Victoria than what has been suggested by the assertions from the member. Australians understand, whether they're in Victoria or anywhere else, that we are combatting a virus that is insidious, and they know—

           They understand that the job of our government has been to do two things: to save lives and to save livelihoods. In this country—

          </p>
          <p>
           I note the interjection, which was, 'When is that going to start?' It may have escaped the member that, in this country, had we had the same death rate from COVID as the average of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
            OECD
           </a>
           , more than 30,000 people would have lost their lives. Here in this country, that is not what occurred. That is not what occurred here in this country. In addition to that, it has been our job to save livelihoods as well. As the national accounts demonstrate today and as the national employment figures demonstrate today, there are more people in work today than there were before the pandemic, and our economy is bigger today than it was before the pandemic began.
          </p>
          <p>
           Those opposite, the Labor Party, may seek to undermine the government's efforts and talk down Australia, but what I know is that Victorians will face this challenge. They'll face it with the same strength and the same resilience as all Australians have all around this country. This government will continue to provide support, as we have in the past and as we continue to do even now. Emergency cash assistance, pandemic leave payments, the JobSeeker payments, the relaxation of the work activity test, and the income arrangements that apply to these payments and waiting lists are all being provided.
          </p>
          <p>
           I'll be speaking again today to the Acting Premier, and the Treasurer will also be speaking to the Treasurer in Victoria. Those opposite may want to use the pandemic for their political purposes. We'll keep doing our job—saving Australian lives and saving Australian livelihoods.
