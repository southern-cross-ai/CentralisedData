        One of the great advantages and privileges we have in our job is to see what ordinary everyday Australians do for each other in volunteering. It is the 10th anniversary of the United Nations International Year of Volunteers and I, along with lots of colleagues in this House, have been privileged to present national volunteer awards recently. Over five million volunteers in Australia give around 730 million hours of volunteer time valued at something like $15 billion, though they never measure it like that, and in Tasmania there are over 130,000 volunteers in 5,000 not-for-profit organisations and more. In my electorate I was really pleased to be able to acknowledge some of the volunteers that do this fantastic work. For example, June Baker has done tremendous work for Strathdevon aged care; Josephine Weeks and Judy Ling for the tremendous service that they have given to the

        municipality and community; Julia Butler Ross for the Central North Wildlife Care and Rescue Organisation; Kaye Cameron for tireless work for the Burnie Eisteddfod; Diane and Mick Davis for their tremendous work on the Penguin Visitor Information Centre; Linda Munday for Zodiac Gymnastics Club; Gwen Pulford for the

        Devonport and the fantastic work she has done through that organisation; Pamela Hutton for her tremendous work for Riding for the Disabled; and Sarina Laidler and

        and their fantastic work there. I want to congratulate those people and all those other volunteers in my electorate who give of themselves and indeed create the fabric of our community.
