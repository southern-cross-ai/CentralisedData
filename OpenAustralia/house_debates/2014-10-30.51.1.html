        I recently attended the 60th anniversary feast day of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Hilarion" rel="nofollow">
         St Hilarion
        </a>
        , a religious, cultural and gastronomic celebration which draws thousands of people from across Adelaide and, in particular, from my electorate of Hindmarsh. As you would expect from an Italian community event, there was plenty of fine food: fine pasta and fine beverages, including that famous Italian beverage, chinotto!
       </p>
       <p>
        I enjoyed talking to many in the St Hilarion community, including the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        , Marcia Fisher, and staff at the Fulham facility, Caroline Russo and Rosie Manzilla. The Fulham facility in my electorate of Hindmarsh has undergone some upgrades and renovations recently, which will ensure the residents continue to have great facilities now and into the future.

        was founded as a cultural and religious body in 1955. Its origins are owed to the passion of a group of migrants who settled in

        after migrating from the town of Caulonia and surrounds in southern Italy, either side of World War

        This year I have been fortunate to support their quiz night and also to donate to their new bus for the residents. In the past I have attended their fundraising events, which were as sensational as last Sunday's feastâ€”always an enjoyable occasion.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a not-for-profit organisation, they owe a great deal to their fantastic volunteers and I thank them all for their efforts. And, speaking about volunteers,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PISA" rel="nofollow">

        and ANFE are other great organisations that support the Italian community in South Australia.
