        Yesterday we saw one of the nastiest speeches by the Prime Minister since the election night dummy spit. The second he was questioned about his attacks on families, he spat the silver spoon across the dispatch box. The Leader of the Opposition had the figures; the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM" rel="nofollow">

        had the tantrum. He tells us that the solution to not being able to afford housing, not being able to afford health care and not being able to afford education is simply to get more money. Get rich parents—because that is what he did. It is all about the money for the member for Wentworth. Even billionaire

        </a>
        said he would hate to come between Turnbull and a sack of gold. And yesterday we were told no-one else can associate with millionaires but other millionaires. The Prime Minister tells us: if you are not a millionaire, you are not of any value to him.
       </p>
       <p>
        I ask the Prime Minister: what about those Australians who are actually doing the hard work? What about the ones farming our produce, the ones teaching our children and the ones fixing the sinkhole near your joint? The government's $50 billion corporate tax cuts to big businesses are benefiting the same millionaires I mentioned before: 'the

        club'. But tell me, 'Mr Harbourside Mansion', what about the families you are hurting? What about the services you are cutting? Eating truffles with your turned up polo shirt collar and your sockless boat shoes might be a thing of the rich, but as you showed yesterday—

         It has certainly been a hot summer, possibly as hot as the summer 120 years ago in 1896. Tomorrow, in my electorate, down in Sutherland, they are expecting 38 degrees, and, to the west of the electorate, they are expecting 41 degrees. Many of the residents of Sydney will come home tomorrow and want to turn their air conditioning on, but unfortunately, with electricity prices already double that of the

         , there will be many hardworking Australians who will be unable to afford their electricity bills. But at least they do not live in
