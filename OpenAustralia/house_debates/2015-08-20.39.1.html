       <p>
        During the winter break, my electorate of Eden-Monaro lost one of its finest citizens. On the morning of 24 July, Eurobodalla councillor and former mayor

        passed away peacefully at his Belowra home surrounded by his family. Fergus was an important part of our community and worked tirelessly for the people of Eurobodalla. He was well loved and known throughout our community for his long commitment to public service. He was elected to the

        in April 2004 and served proudly and diligently as mayor until September 2005 and then again from 2008 to 2012. We remember him not only for his service in local government but also for his lifelong commitment to

        and—less publicly known—for all those lives he touched through his kindness and dedication. Even through illness, his commitment to helping others was undiminished. I know that current Mayor Lindsay Brown would not mind me relating to the House that, even while battling a brain tumour, Fergus showed great concern for others, including Mayor Brown whilst he was undergoing treatment for prostate cancer.

        The high regard in which he was held was clearly evident in the hundreds of council employees who formed an honour guard as Fergus made his final trip past the council chambers. We will long benefit from Fergus's service to our community through the enduring legacy of his good work. I offer my condolences to his wife, Yvonne, and sons, Brendan and James. Vale Fergus Thomson.
