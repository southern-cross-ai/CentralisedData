       <p>
        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Treasurer's announcement that 'the Morrison government is providing an unprecedented $314 billion in economic support, the equivalent of $12,500 for every Australian man, woman and child'. How much of this announced support has actually been delivered by the government?

         Well, let's go through it. In relation to the cash flow boost, 785,418 recipients have received $24.1 billion. In relation to economic support payments, phase 1—which is in relation to the $750 payment—7.3 million people received $5.5 billion. In relation to economic support payments, phase 2, 4.9 million people have received $3.7 billion—

          The Treasurer will pause. I've already asked the member for Rankin to cease

           interjecting
          </a>
          . I've got to say, there are lots of complaints in question time. He's asked a very direct question and the Treasurer's answering it very directly, and he's still
          <a class="glossary" href="/glossary/?gl=1" title="An interjection is when a member of parliament says something that can be...">
           interjecting

          . He does not have to add it up for you. He's giving the figures. The Treasurer has the call.

          <p>
           The member for Rankin should quit while he's ahead and say no more. The coronavirus supplement has gone to 2.3 million people, at $9.7 billion. In terms of JobKeeper, 996,388 businesses with more than 3½ million employees have received $42.27 billion. That program is costed at $101 billion. The reality is that we're getting on with the job of helping businesses stay in business and people stay in jobs. When it comes to our $314 billion, which is 15.8 per cent of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
            GDP
           </a>
           , we'd also like to see the states contribute more, because their contribution has been around 2.4 per cent of gross state product—that is in comparison to our 15.8 per cent.
          </p>
          <p>
           We hear from the member for Rankin. He is often complaining about debt and deficit but then asking us to spend more. The member for Rankin had been asking for a transition down from JobKeeper. Now he says he's not in favour of a transition. The member for Rankin said that people on JobKeeper were getting paid too much. Now he wants people on JobKeeper to be paid more. The member for Rankin is jumbled. His head is jumbled with all these different facts and figures. The member for Rankin should no longer be known as the member for Rankin; he should be known as Jumble Jim.
