       <p>
        The benefits of golf extend far beyond the boundaries of the golf course. From building communities to preserving our natural treasures, from promoting physical and mental wellbeing to contributing to our economy, golf is a sport that enriches us in many ways. Across my electorate of Forde, there are five golf courses: Carbrook
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golf_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Golf Club
        </a>
        , Windaroo Lakes Golf Club, Riverlakes Golf Course, Meadowbrook Golf Club, and the Beenleigh
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        and Mt Warren Park Golf Club. Each of these clubs plays a significant part in the community—economically, environmentally and socially, and for mental health benefits. As we look at the work that these golf clubs do across my community, we see those benefits each and every day, from the juniors all the way to those older—or, more advanced in age—golfers who enjoy getting out on a Saturday morning and having a hit, and everyone in between.
       </p>
       <p>
        We also see the big headline tournaments both overseas on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
         TV
        </a>
        and also here locally in Australia. Later this month the Australian PGA championship will be held in Brisbane at the Royal Queensland Golf Club. The Australian PGA championship is one of the major highlights of this year's summer of golf and will see the world tour season commence in Brisbane. An all-star field of Australian and international players will compete for the Joe Kirkwood Cup and some $2 million in prize money—the richest prize on the Challenger PGA Tour of Australasia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Approximately 3.5 million Australians have participated in various formats of golf over the last 12 months. Currently, there are over 1,600 golf facilities in Australia, including golf courses, minigolf courses, driving ranges and a growing number of indoor simulators and entertainment venues. Importantly, golf generates around $10.3 billion per annum in household expenditure, which includes $3.6 billion associated with golf tourism. I know, as I go out on some of my local courses, I well and truly contribute to that via balls lost or mis-hit in the process. Golf tourism attracts visitors from around the globe, showcasing our picturesque courses and promoting local businesses. From the golf equipment manufacturers to the hospitality services, the industry generates employment opportunities and stimulates economic growth. Furthermore, golf events, both local and international, draw attention to Australia on a global scale, showcasing the country as a premier destination for sports and recreation.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to take this opportunity to mention a few of those events at my local golf clubs, which I mentioned earlier. The Carbrook Classic is a staple on our local golf calendar every year, bringing together golfers from not just South-East Queensland but around Australia to compete in a two-day event on one of the best golf courses, I believe, in South-East Queensland. The Windaroo Lakes Golf Club have a pro-am series every year, of which I am proud to be but a small sponsor. Again, they bring together a range of golfers from around the country, particularly trainee professionals and other professionals, who have the opportunity to hone their skills on a terrific golf course, which used to be the host of the Queensland PGA many years ago. The Mt Warren Park Golf Club holds a veterans day every year, in memory of our veterans and to raise funds for their veterans services. It's always well attended by our local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Importantly, many of these golf clubs also have function centres and restaurants that not only support the golfers when they're out playing but also provide the ability for community groups to host events at these various centres. All of this contributes to the fabric of our society. These golf activities generate important benefits for golfers and the community at large. I know at Windaroo Lakes—I think it's once a month—they have a ladies 'chip &amp; sip', which my wife has enjoyed more than once. I suspect there's more sipping than chipping, but the ladies thoroughly enjoy the afternoon and it's great to see them out on the golf course. It's also for the juniors. I want to thank all of our golf clubs for the tremendous work they do right across our community.

           It's safe to say that my views on this motion are on par with that of my colleagues. They are not a fairway removed. Apologies for the bad puns. There'll be no more. The electorate of Bean and the

           and Gungahlin Lakes clubs in the northern part of the ACT, Canberrans of all ages have a diverse range of options to choose from.
          </p>
          <p>
           I say 'all ages' because one of the unique aspects of golf is that it is a sport that allows everyday Australians to be engaged in physical activity, from childhood to older age. There is simply no age barrier to this sport. Golf is shown to provide moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity and therefore could be expected to have beneficial effects on longevity, physical health, mental health and overall wellness. Walking around an average course for a round of golf can be between five and seven kilometres. If you walk 18 holes three to five times a week, you'll get an optimal amount of endurance exercise for your heart.
          </p>
          <p>
           Golf also provides important benefits for people's social health. Golf facilitates social interaction between friends and community members, thereby reducing feelings of loneliness and isolation that may otherwise occur. Beyond benefits for golfers, golf clubs and their facilities are often community meeting hubs which help to generate a sense of belonging, especially in regional and rural areas where such facilities can be lacking.

          <p>
           In addition to the health benefits, our golf courses regularly host charity events. Such events contribute to broader investment in the health and wellbeing of Australians. Early in the day, I mentioned the Menslink Great Walk. As part of our fundraising for this great Canberra organisation, Paul Eccles ran a successful golf charity day at the Federal Golf Club a few weeks ago. On the subject of the Menslink Great Walk, may I commend the particular fundraising and walking efforts of Sarah Rajic from Capital Recruit, who was participating in this 142 kilometre walk for the third time. Over the last 12 months, Australia's golf courses hosted 1.5 million golfers, while a further 1.2 million played off course at a range of spaces including driving ranges, minigolf facilities—about my standard—and simulators.
          </p>
          <p>
           The community benefits report also discussed the environmental benefits that golf courses contribute to national ecology. It was found that an 18-hole golf course produces enough oxygen annually to sustain around 85,000 people. In addition to this, Australia's golf courses and driving ranges provide enough oxygen to sustain around 80 million people. The message is clear: golf is one of the biggest sports in Australia, contributing significant economic, social and environmental benefits to golfers and the Australian community. The Albanese government recognises this contribution and is supporting golf through high-performance, wellbeing budgets and 2024

            I definitely agree with this motion because I strongly believe in the benefits of golf. It's a very popular game. There are 3½ million Australians who play golf, aged between 18 and 79. If you include children, you might even top that by another 100,000. In my electorate of Lyne, I have—and I've mentioned just about all of them—

            Golf is one of the biggest sports in Australia. The health benefits, both physical and mental, are extensive. It has many positive flow-on effects. It's an active, healthy lifestyle and it generates vital open spaces. Green spaces and environments are created by golf courses. They're also cultural hubs. They're a big employer. Annually, there are over $3.3 billion worth of benefits to the Australian economy from golf. The actual expenditure by households is quite staggering, and golf tourism is a major industry. Golf tourism generates $3.6 billion. Household expenditure, expenditure on the facilities themselves and payments by golfers is about $10 billion.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of the things that many people are not aware of is it's a very egalitarian sport. Anyone can play it. And while the wonders of the modern world are many, one of them is the Stableford handicap, which means you can play with
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Norman" rel="nofollow">

            or anyone. And if you've got a handicap of 41, you might catch him or her! It is a great game.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is an environmental treasure. Did you know that open green spaces, golf courses, are right up there. There's greater thermal comfort, especially in city areas, like around
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centennial_Park" rel="nofollow">
             Centennial Park
            </a>
            , where they're trying to close down half a golf course and turn it into green space. So they're closing a golf course, which is full of green space, to create green space. Go figure that out. Connect the dots. Aha! There's real estate involved. That means, across the road, many more real estate developments can happen because if the golf course is attributed to a golf course and not to the owners of the land across the road then, hey presto, they can't build high-rises. So if you want to work out what's going on in Sydney, look at the real estate and follow the money.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are also benefits for water filtration and purification. Many golf courses are part of sewage systems, natural sewage systems. Soil and vegetation benefit from it. There's reduced impact from flooding and management of storm water. Carbon reductions from emissions are absorbed by these golf courses. Each year, carbon sequestration services from golf courses total $6 million—I think some of the golf clubs need to get some carbon credits out of their business as well! There's enough oxygen produced by all those plants to support 85,000 human beings. There are also the local ecosystems. There are more insects per square 100 metres than there are in ordinary suburbia.

            It is a great game. You can play it with your children, you can play it with your wife, you can play with total strangers and at the end of it you've got a friend for life on many occasions. And you perpetually have something to worry about apart from your job or parliament or anything like that. It's to be commended.

            I support the golf industry because of all those benefits. It is not a game for rich tossers. There are more golf courses in Australia than in most other countries—1,600 of them in fact. That's why we have so many professional golfers. Look at the women's golf circuit; look at the seniors, or geriatric, golf circuit—it's a game for all ages and all causes. I thoroughly commend people to take up golf. And I ask the

             I want to support the motion that has been put forward by the member for Forde in support of golf. It's so interesting, and the member for Lyne is correct when he says that golf is often portrayed as a game for elites. I have to tell you that when my mum was pregnant with me in 1970 and playing golf, she and my father were not elites at

             In fact, the story of their love affair with golf and that course is something that is very close to my heart. And when you think about it, it's a little patch of dirt where the community came together. They started off building a golf course and they got to nine holes, and then they got to 13 holes, and then they got to 15 holes, and finally we got our 18 holes. Our little course, Kurri Kurri—which is, funnily enough, located in Heddon Greta—became an 18-hole course. That was a real community journey, and that's what it's like for many country golf courses. The courses that may have members that are a little more well-heeled are still great places for community. That's what golf does—it brings people together. It doesn't matter where you go across the world, you can have a game of golf with someone you have never met before and you know what to do. You don't have to be a particularly good player, but you can go and have a game. You can look into someone's personality and character.
            </p>
            <p>
             Golf is one of those things. Often, you hear that kids don't get taught manners these days—well, I tell you what, if you get your kid playing golf, not only have they got the prospect of potentially becoming a pro and maybe earning a lot of money, but here's what your child will learn: they will learn to wait their turn; they will learn to be quiet and respectful when someone else is having their turn; they will learn that they should not walk across the line of another player; they will learn that they have to dress appropriately and suitably to go and play a sport; and they will learn that you shouldn't wear a hat inside or you will have to shout the bar. These are just some of the rules you learn very quickly in golf. It is a game of etiquette and manners. It is a game of strategy. It is a game for life. Whether you're seven or 107, you can still get out on the golf course, and many people do.

             Golf not only employs around 28,000 people here in Australia but it also gives many thousands more the opportunity to have recreation. It is one of those things that is also very inspiring. My whole family have played golf since mum and dad joined Kurri Kurri Golf Club. In fact, our house was from here to the Deputy Speaker away from the 12th green, so I pretty much grew up on a golf course. I spent my childhood playing, and it is such an important part of who I am today. I encourage anyone, if they are thinking about having a game of golf, to go and do it. These days, you can play putt-putt golf or you can go to a driving range, and you'll still be considered a golfer. You can start anywhere and you can start with a set of sticks off Gumtree—it doesn't need to cost you the world. What it will do is help you live five years longer, it will bring your blood pressure down—even if you're not playing that well—it'll create a whole network of people and an opportunity to make friends, potentially at a time in your adult life when you may never have thought you would be able to do that.

             We hear there is a crisis of loneliness across our country, and I would say to anyone, if you are feeling lonely, check out some of your local golf courses—go and get a lesson off one of your local pros. They will help you become a better person. It is great for mental health, and I just want to give a shout out not only to my beautiful home clubs of Kurri Kurri and Newcastle—which is one of the great courses in Australia—but also to Maitland, Horizons,

              It is a pleasure to rise on this motion. It's bipartisan, but I do have to disagree with my good friend the member for Paterson—whenever I've played golf, it definitely drove my blood pressure up, but that was more owing to a lack of ability than the game of golf. It is a great game and it's a big part of many communities. In my electorate of Casey, golf plays an important role in a social element but also an economic element, driving golf tourism. We're fortunate to have the Heritage golf course, the

              But, unfortunately, last month we had some bad news at the Eastern Golf Club when it was destroyed by fire. It was burnt to the ground—the pro shop, the lounge, the restaurants. It's a relatively new club, about 10 to 12 years old. It's a beautiful facility, and I've been lucky enough to attend and spend time there with Ben Telley, the general manager. But it burnt down.

              I mentioned Gardiners Run. I was lucky enough to attend their 49-year anniversary dinner just a week and a half ago. It's a wonderful golf club run by the Chirnside Park

              , and it would be remiss of me not to mention the indominable Barb Kelly, who runs that club and does an amazing job in supporting not only golf but also the wider community. At the 49th anniversary dinner, we had the pleasure to celebrate Bert and Joyce Patrick's 67th wedding anniversary, which was on the day, but they love the club that much. They were founding members; Bert was instrumental in getting the club established 49 years ago. It was wonderful to chat to Bert, catch up with him and hear about how the club was started 49 years ago and about some of the challenges they've had over the journey.

             <p>
              A club like Gardiners Run is so important for our community because, while it's a golf club, it also has many other sports. I want to talk quickly about the bowls club that is connected to the golf club and particularly the event I went to on Monday, just before the cup, the Bowls Gr8 for Brains fundraiser, which clubs from all around the area came to support. I was fortunate to open it and I met with Darryl, who I've met a couple of times now. Bowls Gr8 for Brains do work supporting first responders and veterans that are struggling with post traumatic stress disorder. It's a wonderful organisation and it's an example of how golf clubs and community clubs are bigger than just sport and do more for the community. I also met Shane, Cam, Tony and Mark from Bowl For Your Lives, and it was great to hear their story and the work they're doing using bowls to support first responders. It's another example, as I said, of what the community can do.
             </p>

              Given it was a charity day, there was an auction. There did happen to be a Collingwood 2023 premiership poster, and I know the member for Solomon will be happy about that. I did buy it—he'll be happy to know—because it was my obligation and duty to support that charity. My wife understood, which is the only time I can buy memorabilia! On a serious note, it is a great example. Congratulations to Barb Kelly at Gardiners Run and Bowls Gr8 for Brains for the work they do supporting our community, our first responders and our veterans.

               Golf is a game for all. It's a game that is testing and sometimes frustrating, but it's a game that is exciting and rewarding. Some love it, some hate it, and sometimes even those who love it can hate it. But at the end of the day, no-one can doubt that our world is a much better place because of the game of golf. Golf helps our community and our economy to grow, providing 3.3 billion in annual benefits. The sport encourages spending in the economy on activities and facilities related to golf, with 6.7 billion being spent by local golfers and 3.6 billion being generated by tourism.

               Golf really does have something for everyone. If competitive golf or a social game of racing golf carts around 18 holes on a golf course isn't for you, there's also putt putt golf or aqua golf, which can be a great family day out. The Hunter is also lucky to have great venues for putt putt and aqua golf. I know my daughters love it whenever we take them there.

               Golf is good for your health, too. The health benefits of golf are highlighted by the fact that Australian golfers walk around 280 million kilometres annually.

               . The young man was Corey Lamb, and he has only recently achieved his lifelong dream of becoming a pro golfer. He didn't quite take home the chocolates in this event, but he showed lots of promise by finishing second. I think it's fantastic that young golfers like Corey have the chance to show their skill on the big stage so early in their careers, and I can't wait to watch his career progress.

               When I play golf, there are two big winners on the day: the pro shop, because I lose a lot of balls and I have to go and buy more after losing them, and the bar, because I like to drown my sorrows after a terrible game. A sport that looks so simple really can be difficult at times. It really makes you admire those who can actually hit a ball straight consistently. But it is always a good day, no matter how many balls I lose. So, whether you play with your mates and have some beers along the way, or whether you take the game a little bit more seriously—get out there and have a hit of golf this weekend. It's good for your health, it's good for our local golf courses and our community as a whole. And, most importantly, it's bloody good fun.

               I'd also like to just talk about one of my favourite golf courses in the Hunter, which is Branxton golf course. Or, as the locals like to call it, 'Royal Branxston'. It's a lovely area. Sometimes when it has been raining, Gos, there are a lot of water views there, the course floods a little bit, but it is one of the best courses in the area for the local golfers to go and just have a really good time—lose a few balls there but enjoy the day as well. To everyone at Branxton golf course: have a great weekend and have a great day playing. I hope everyone enjoys their golf this weekend.

                I did not ever think that I would be standing in this place to talk about the game of golf, and particularly to extol the virtues of the game of golf.

                Nonetheless, I support this motion brought by the member for Forde, which brings to this place's attention the importance of the game of golf to our country—economically, financially, socially and also health-wise. I do not profess to be an expert on golf, a regular player of golf or even a semiregular player of golf. However, I was very glad that I was in the chamber to have heard from the members for Lyne, Paterson, Casey and Hunter, who are all clearly very passionate about the sport for the sport's sake.

                On the few occasions that I've played golf, I have not covered myself in any type of glory. But I will share this story for the sake of embarrassing my husband about the one time that I did actually win a trophy in golf. I was playing with him and my mother-in-law. We were playing Ambrose in a competition out at
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Cargelligo" rel="nofollow">
                 Lake Cargelligo
                </a>
                for a charity event at the time. Mostly due to the efforts of my mother-in-law and me, we won. We won the Bradman prize, and that consisted of two frozen chickens. My husband refused even to get up and accept the frozen chickens, but my mother-in-law and I were not so proud, and we were delighted to have won. That is the one and only time I've ever won any prize in golf, and I do not see myself ever winning another prize.
               </p>
               <p>
                However, I am convinced by the terms of this motion in this place that we should acknowledge the tremendous role that the golf industry plays, and I also want to acknowledge the three excellent courses that I have in my electorate of Hughes. We have the Ridge Golf Course and Driving Range at

                at Kareela and also Brighton Lakes Recreation and Golf Club at Moorebank. I was recently out at Brighton Lakes to give them three new flags: the Australian flag, the Aboriginal flag and the

                flag. It was lovely to have a tour of their facilities.
               </p>
               <p>
                Some statistics about golf that have been released recently by the Australian golf industry support this motion brought by the member for Forde. They reveal things such as golf provides $3.3 billion in total annual benefits to the Australian economy and the community. There are also significant environmental benefits that are brought by this game. There is a growing and deepening participation in all forms of golf, and golf's estimated annual household expenditure is in the realm of $10.3 billion. Apparently, according to current statistics, 37 per cent of adult Australians, which is over 7.2 million Australians, say they visit a golf course on a fairly regular basis. This is a massive participation sport, and it brings communities together. That is why I think this is a motion that should be supported and we should acknowledge the benefits that golf brings both to local communities and to the country as a whole. The overall contribution to the Australian economy is valued at about $394 million for businesses alone and about $122 million for industry workers. This is yet another example of why the game of golf is very important to our economy.

That was when somebody out in the audience had said to him, after he performed a particularly good shot, 'Wow, that was lucky, Tiger.' That was Tiger's response. But I am a baseball tragic, so I will leave it to
