        I rise to recognise the

        ,

         Mark McGowan
        </a>
        , who yesterday announced that he will be resigning as premier and as the member for Rockingham. Mark's energy, enthusiasm and commitment to WA started when he got in his Corolla and drove from the eastern states to what I believe is the best place in the world, Western Australia. He successfully stood for office in decision-making roles in both local and state government. His steely determination to look after WA was steadfast and he did not let us down. Actions speak louder than words, and WA's economy and resource sector is in a better place than it was when he first became premierâ€”and he worked incredibly hard to achieve this.
       </p>
       <p>
        WA became known as the safest place on the planet during the COVID pandemic. I sat with him on the COVID taskforce, the State Recovery Advisory Group. I saw firsthand the angst and research behind the decision-making to close our borders, and the understanding of the impact that this would have on communities, families and businesses. Mark McGowan stood strong. He clearly articulated that WA was his priority, and he demonstrated that. Regular radio and

        interviews took place, and nobody was left guessing about what was happening. He was a daily voice in households and businesses. He listened, he acted and he absorbed the stress to help others cope with the significant changes to lifestyles.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mark McGowan, we salute you and we thank you for all that you have done for Western Australia. I'm sure your beautiful wife, Sarah, your children and your fur baby will be very happy to spend more time with you.
