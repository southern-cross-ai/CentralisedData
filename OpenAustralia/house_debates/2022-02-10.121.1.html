        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        Honours List recognises great Australians for the extraordinary contributions they make to our nation. Some remarkable Brisbane residents have been recognised this year, including—fittingly, in these times—some extraordinary healthcare professionals.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate Professor Barbara Leggett, now a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Member of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        , for her work in gastroenterology, hepatology and medical research. I also congratulate Professor Margaret Turner, now a Member of the Order of Australia, for her efforts in the fields of medical research, psychiatry and psycho-oncology. There is also Dr Gino Pecoraro—congratulations to him for receiving the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        for his contributions to medicine as a gynaecologist.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also receiving the Medal of the Order of Australia was Janice Blackford, for her service to the arts and the Brisbane community, and Margot McKinney, the renowned Brisbane jeweller, for her charitable pursuits and service to the arts. Both Janice and Margot are a source of inspiration for everyone contributing to Brisbane's already-vibrant arts scene, making it even better.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also commend Dylys Bertelsen and Mark Sheridan, both awarded an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        , for their services to community health and charitable organisations. Their hard work, in a way, symbolises the contribution of community and charitable organisations, which make an immeasurable contribution to the welfare of others—especially through challenging times, like through the global pandemic.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations also to Irma Howell OAM for her services to the youth of Brisbane through the Scouts movement, and congratulations to James McClelland OAM for his efforts and dedication to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Life_Saving_Society" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Life Saving Society
        </a>
        . Big congratulations to Otway Benson, to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Clark" rel="nofollow">
         Charles Clark
        </a>
        , to Jon Just and to Dr Edmund Spork for their outstanding contributions through a range of community roles and organisations. All have been awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        A Brisbane resident has been awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Police_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Police Medal
        </a>
        , as well; congratulations to Assistant Commissioner Katherine Innes. And thank you to all the police around greater Brisbane for everything that you do for our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Representing Australia's defence forces, a Brisbane local has received the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distinguished_Service_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Distinguished Service Medal
        </a>
        . Brigadier Edward Smeaton, thank you for your distinguished leadership. Chief Petty Officer Janelle Scrase has received the Medal of the Order of Australia in the military division for her meritorious service in the

       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the entire Brisbane community, I would like to congratulate all the worthy recipients in the Australia Day 2022 Honours List for helping to make our great nation the very best it can be.
