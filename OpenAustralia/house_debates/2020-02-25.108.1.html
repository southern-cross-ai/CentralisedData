        When I ask people why they choose to live in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Wide Bay
        </a>
        or start a business there, the answer rarely varies: it's just a fantastic place to live with incredible natural beauty, friendly people and none of the stresses of city life. But, behind its hinterland charms and stunning beaches, Wide Bay punches well above its weight when it comes to innovation. Wide Bay has long been a powerhouse of manufacturing and engineering pioneers, most notably my good friend Peter Olds and his team at Olds Engineering in Maryborough, who have created a world-first grain elevator that is so unprecedented that engineers have flown from across the world to Maryborough to see this remarkable technology.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Noosa, Helitak is at the forefront of innovation when it comes to bushfire fighting. Helitak makes a difference in combating blazes that threaten people and properties by supplying aerial tanks that bomb fires with water and retardant. We have seen the massive difference that aerial firefighting has made in Wide Bay and throughout Australia during this terrible bushfire season. It's great to see a local company producing a world-class product that is helping keep our communities safe.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our region is also making great strides in the medical field, where the highly respected Dr Michael Monsour at Analytica has developed a unique device to improve women's pelvic floor health. This could change the lives of thousands of women, ensuring they don't need to undergo surgery.
       </p>
       <p>
        We're seeing advances in health and fitness technology, with GravityFit in

        producing smart functional training garments for athletes and astronauts. These garments stabilise and strengthen the spine and joints, reducing the risk of injury and improving performance. They also help to maintain the musculoskeletal health of astronauts, putting this technology developed in Wide Bay onto the world map.
       </p>
       <p>
        Innovation is also being fostered at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTM" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Timber in Maryborough, where the coalition government is helping them develop revolutionary new processes to turn waste timber into new engineered product for the building industry. That's been a significant win for DTM Timber, for jobs in Wide Bay and this valuable hardwood timber industry. It's also a win for the environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Morrison government is working hand in hand with business to help them build success that will flow through the local economy, evidenced by the Rheinmetall NIOA Munitions plant in Maryborough, where we have committed $28.5 million towards the construction of this $60 million projectile forging facility that will create more than a hundred full-time jobs and open the area up to new markets. This new investment between the Morrison government and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNM" rel="nofollow">
         RNM
        </a>
        will put Maryborough on the defence industry map and will potentially add more than $100 million in economic output, including $36 million within the Wide Bay region alone. The plant will feature specialist machines to create large-calibre military projectiles. This project will not only introduce a new industry into Australia but also give our region access to global supply chains.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Gympie, the Australian government is investing $5 million to expand the production line at Nolan Meats. This project will create more than 200 jobs, which will boost Gympie's economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Wide Bay, my home, is a magnificent place. We must continue to invest with business to bring the unemployment rate down. Since the 1860s the Wide Bay economy has been underpinned by industries including manufacturing, agriculture, forestry and fisheries, and in more recent times it's been bolstered by tourism and health. These sectors drive economic growth; however, a shifting economy and lifestyles mean our region must be entrepreneurial and forward thinking, not just to capitalise on emerging opportunities but to create those opportunities into the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am working hard with the Liberal-National government to secure our fair share in the region. With the support of local government and business, we will work together to create economic opportunities and build the community that we all want to live in in the years to come.
