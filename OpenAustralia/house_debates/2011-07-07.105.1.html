       <p>
        I rise to pay tribute to the wonderful work undertaken by Rotarians throughout the world, particularly the 10 local Rotary organisations that play an active role in the electorate of Kooyong. Founded in 1905 by Chicago lawyer
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Harris" rel="nofollow">
         Paul Harris
        </a>
        , Rotary's mission is, in its own words, to provide service to others, encourage high ethical standards in all vocations and help build goodwill and peace in the world. From a seed of an idea first countenanced over lunch between Harris and three business friends, the organisation derived its name as early meetings were rotated between the offices of the members. The exponential growth in its membership over the last hundred-plus years now sees the organisation comprising 1.2 million Rotarians, belonging to over 32,000 clubs in more than 200 countries. Its values are universal and transcend any form of national boundaries or explicit race, religious or linguistic ties.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rotarians are exemplified as individuals who do not seek fame or fortune but are motivated by an active intent to contribute to their local communities. Rotarians in return enjoy some immense satisfaction from their contribution to humanity and the fellowship they share with their fellow members. In Kooyong, I have been fortunate to have met many fine Rotarians and indeed I am an honorary member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">

        of Canterbury. I have seen firsthand the fantastic work each club does in our community. I would like to pay tribute to each club individually.

         The Rotary Club
        </a>
        of Balwyn is extremely active and well known. It has raised a significant sum of money over the years and distributed to it many deserving causes, including scholarships for Indigenous youth, medical research, disaster and drought relief and, importantly, youth leadership programs. I pay tribute to outgoing president, Ken McQualter, and incoming president, Peter Freuh.

        The Rotary Club of Canterbury has also had an extremely busy year under the presidency of Kyle Wightman. Its work supporting children with disabilities at Bel足more School, the Boroondara Cares program for communities suffering the impacts of drought and in the Philippines, including an eye screening project, is to be commended. Best of luck to incoming president, David Chudasko.
