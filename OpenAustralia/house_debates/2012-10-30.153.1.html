        As I was saying yesterday, the 10th anniversary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali" rel="nofollow">
         Bali
        </a>
        bombing is something we should all commemorate. Through the initiatives of people on both sides of this House, we have done much to stamp out terrorism, both at home and abroad, and ensure that we never see a repeat of those events in Bali. As I said, one of the benefits, one of the small rays of light, that came out of the tragedy in October 2002 was the high degree of cooperation between Indonesia and Australia. We are not just neighbours; we are friends and we are partners in the fight against terrorism.

         Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono
        </a>
        , who was the security minister for Indonesia at the time of the Bali bombing and in 2004 became the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Indonesia" rel="nofollow">
         President of Indonesia
        </a>
        —and he got a second term, so he will be there until 2014—has worked with successive Australian governments in an effort to stamp out terrorism. I wanted to share a quote from Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, President of Indonesia. He said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali_bombings" rel="nofollow">
         Bali bombings
        </a>
        created a set of critical chain reactions. The Bali bombings created a set of critical chain reactions. The public debate over whether terrorism was a real or imagined threat to Indonesia was laid to rest. We recognised that freedom, democracy and tolerance cannot be taken for granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        He also said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The entire nation galvanised to defend freedom, democracy and tolerance. Internationally, Indonesia became a key player in the fight against terrorism. Indonesia also became an active proponent of interfaith cooperation.
       </p>
       <p>
        He went on to say:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Bali attack was also a turning point in relations between Indonesia and Australia. Our relations with Australia suffered challenges brought forth by the events in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
         East Timor
        </a>
        . It produced a compelling reason for Jakarta and Canberra to explore new ways of cooperation in a world haunted by new, unfamiliar threats. The Bali bombings cemented an emotional connection between Indonesia and Australia. A connection that grew stronger following the tsunami tragedy in Aceh and Nias, and the development of the Comprehensive Partnership and Lombok Treaty. As we remember 10 years since the Bali bombings, our thoughts are with those who have endured the terrible loss of their loved ones.
       </p>
       <p>
        That was Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, the President of Indonesia, who put it so succinctly, saying that in the days, the weeks, the months and the years after the tragedy of the Bali bombings our two countries have come together in a way that is unprecedented to fight a common enemy. Indonesia looked within itself and saw the radical elements of Islam: the Noordin Tops, the Mukhlas, the Samudras, the Abu Bakar Bashirs of this world, who conspired to kill 88 innocent Australians and 202 people representing countries as diverse as the Europeans, the Americans and other countries in our region. That is what they did. They ruined the innocence of hundreds of Australians and many others around the world, but they do not have and have not had the last say. The people who have had the last say are the survivors and the families of the victims, who have committed to go forward with courage from this day and to ensure that the memories continue and that the lives lost on that tragic night in October 2002 were not lost in vain.
       </p>
       <p>
        We, both in the time of the Howard government and in the coalition since then, with our colleagues across the political divide, have worked in a considered and concerted manner to tackle terrorism at its source, to fund our law enforcement agencies and to do better at the cutting edge of the fight against terrorism. So, as we look back on those tragic events, we can say that, as a result of what happened in the nightclub district of Bali in 2002, we have bonded together and we have made a difference to ensure that the world is a safer place for Australians and our other friends in the world.

         On Friday, 12 October, we commemorated with great sadness one of the darkest days in Australian history—a specific moment in time when the people of Australia were attacked, albeit in a foreign land, and when the people of Australia realised that we are not immune from extremism and some of the more horrific aspects of human nature. On 12 October 2002, Australia lost its innocence in what was and to this day still is the worst terrorist attack in our short history. Eighty-eight Australians were slain in the most random and brutal way. What was meant to be a joyous and cheerful time in people's lives as they shared vacation time with family and friends in the tropical oasis of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali" rel="nofollow">
          Bali
         </a>
         turned into a nightmare as three bombs went off in a coordinated and sinister attack throughout Kuta and at the United States consulate in Denpasar. In these attacks, 202 innocent people lost their lives, including, as I have mentioned, 88 Australians in a deliberate plan to cause as much damage as possible, a single backpack-laden suicide bomber entered Paddy's nightclub and, without warning, detonated the explosive. This in turn had people flooding into the street to try and avoid the chaos and confusion. As they ran for what they thought was safety, a second, larger car bomb was detonated outside the

         across the road. The devastation was endless and the destruction was horrific. We remember in this place those that lost their lives. We grieve with their families and we honour those who came to their aid. The pain and mental anguish of those who survived is immense and enduring.
        </p>
        <p>
         In my electorate of Higgins, I have been in contact with Laurence Kerr, a survivor of the Bali bombing. Today I am going to read to you a letter that he has given me permission to table in the parliament about his feelings as a Bali bombing survivor:

         One of the recommendations read as follows - the Commonwealth government prepare a green paper on the establishment of a national compensation scheme for victims of terrorism related crimes that fall within the Commonwealth jurisdication; and

        <p class="italic">
         - the national council of Attorneys-General develop a proposal for the harmonization of state laws dealing with compensation for victims of crimes so as to provide for circumstances such as terrorist attack.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The government did not accept the recommendation of lump sum assistance preferring to opt for case by case as they had done after 2002 bombings.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The government response also stated that it would "continue to monitor the needs of those affected by the tragedy and to provide ongoing assistance such as emergency financial assistance"

        <p class="italic">
         If there has been any MONITORING I have not been aware of it.

         Since the bombings, for which the government paid the associated medical bills, I have also benefitted via the Bali Med scheme which continues to pay any medical bills that are directly linked to the bombing and also covers pharmaceutical bills that are for treatment associated with the bombings.

         The terrorist acts of the 2002 Bali Bombings were unprecedented in Australian history and came with lifetime consequences.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         With the benefit of hindsight or indeed some MONITORING, was the Government's method of assistance the best option for its citizens?
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Being a SURVIVOR makes it worth while to ask the QUESTIONS
        </p>
        <p>
         I am proud to say that I supported a piece of legislation brought forward by the Leader of the Opposition that does go to this question about compensation for victims of terror. Instead of simply being prospective, it is important for us in this place to also look back at those who have suffered from some of the most horrific incidences of terrorism that have occurred throughout the world, and I think that Bali is a very good example of that.
        </p>
        <p>
         I think we in this place have a duty to provide a small gesture to them and their surviving families, and I think a small amount of compensation is that appropriate gesture to help people get back on their feet. That is why we in the coalition have committed to support Australians who are victims of terrorist attacks overseas. A $75,000 payment brings them into line with the level of assistance provided to domestic victims of violent crime. We know that no amount of money can ever fully compensate for what these people have endured, but we hope that this gesture allows those in need to find some solace as they cope with the very significant changes in their lives that they never expected, as they need to continue to rebuild their lives.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is said that every cloud has a silver lining, and it often takes the worst in human nature to bring out the best in human behaviour. This was true in the case of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali_bombings" rel="nofollow">
          Bali bombings
         </a>
         and those that responded. From the first emergency workers on the scene to the doctors who treated the many burns victims to the psychologists and counsellors who continue to this day to work with those affected, we saw the best in the Australian spirit and in the human spirit on show. The first people to arrive at the Sari Club risked their very lives to bring the injured and wounded to safety. Within 26 hours, the first patients arrived at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Darwin_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
          Royal Darwin Hospital
         </a>
         . Sixty-one patients arrived at Darwin, and 48 were then taken throughout Australia to receive specialised services. We honour and thank those that worked so hard to save the lives of others—not just the Australians that responded but the Indonesians that responded as well. They came together in the spirit of solidarity.
        </p>
        <p>
         We remember those that lost their lives, and we forever stay vigilant to rid the world of violent extremism. Together Australia stands with Indonesia against violent extremism, and we hope never to have to stand in this place and move such a condolence motion as this again.

          I rise to talk on the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali" rel="nofollow">
           Bali
          </a>
          bombings. They are a point in Australia's history at which a traumatic event impacted on families, on individuals and on the psyche of Australia, because we had never experienced such a traumatic event in the way that it transpired on Friday, 12 October 2002 at 11.05. It will always be remembered, like the assassination of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F_Kennedy" rel="nofollow">
           John F Kennedy
          </a>
          or September 11. We will always remember where we were, what we were doing, how the visual images in the breaking of that news story impacted on us, and our reactions of disbelief at seeing the carnage that was a result of the event.
         </p>
         <p>
          At the time my wife and I were in Caporio in Italy. We had just sat down to lunch with Antonio and Concerta, two of her cousins, and their family. We were having a discussion, and while we were talking Italian news broke the story. It led with 'Australians killed in Bali', and we stopped the conversation and tuned into the television. What we saw was footage that we could not believe happening in Bali, and the Italians that we were with said, 'Why would anybody want to do this to Australians?' Then it came out that there were Italians affected as well. We had a discussion at that point about the senseless slaughter of people. The loss of life because of extremists was something that was hard to comprehend, particularly when you know that all of those there were holidaying and it was something that they were looking forward to.
         </p>
         <p>
          The disbelief, though, I think was a significant factor for us around that table. Later on that night we sat and watched the news again and rang home to see if any family members had been affected—or friends or people that we knew.
         </p>
         <p>
          We came back fairly soon after that event. We came through Singapore and gleaned news items that we happened to see. The media coverage was very explicit on the impact that it had on those who had gone there for a good time. I always remember reading those articles, looking at explicit nature of the events as they occurred—the footage and photographs. I could not comprehend the damage to another human being in the way that I saw. I understand there are conflicts where there are battles and wars that are fought and the weaponry that is used, but not in terms of innocent people. To see that brought back the reality that the world was changing.
         </p>
         <p>
          I watched coverage by Nick Ray, who was working for one of the commercial stations—I am not sure which channel—and his comments after filing some stories,. Him then saying, 'I find this extremely challenging,' looking at limbs separated from bodies, bodies that were not recognisable. There is one thing that I always think about in terms of the Bali bombing—it does not matter when the context is; I think it was brought home very sharply with the memorial service held here in the parliament, when Professor Fiona Wood made her profound comments about the humanity of goodness in a time of crisis and in a time of need. It was her comments about the resilience of individuals. She spoke of a particular person who she said had serious burns. But the thing that struck her was the hope and aspirations of that individual. She said that the person eventually recovered and she challenged them in a sporting event. She got beaten but what she liked was the fact of the resilience and the recovery.
         </p>
         <p>
          Fiona, who I know personally and have worked with and enjoyed her professional approach to much in the health area, was quite affected by those who she saw with the degrees of burns that people experienced. She was affected by the stories that were shared with her about those who were affected and hospitalised—both in Perth and Darwin—about the way in which heroism was extremely noticeable. It was evident in the way in which, at a time of confusion and in a time of your world being turned upside down, individuals looked around to see who needed help and those that they were able to help, they took them to the nearest medical facility or they stayed with them until help arrived.
         </p>
         <p>
          The thing that was even more amazing was the way in which health professionals—medical specialists, those who specialise in burns, those surgeons that were needed, the allied health professions that became involved, the nurses who gave their time—Australians and Indonesians, worked together to ensure that those who had been injured were given every level support and assistance.
         </p>
         <p>
          Then came the second phase after evacuation and after treatment—that is, the trauma that individuals experience. Here it was the psychologists, psychiatrists and the counsellors that were needed to help people through something that, in a sense, you would not comprehend, because it was something that you would not then be prepared for nor had you ever anticipated occurring to you.
         </p>
         <p>
          Then I looked with great pride at fellow Australians who gave their time to work closely with the Indonesians in Bali—the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Federal Police
          </a>
          in the identification of people, and those who assisted to ensure that family members who were killed were brought back to Australia.
         </p>
         <p>
          One point that always stuck out in that list of people that were killed—the 202 of which 88 were Australians and 38 were Indonesians—was this. At the bottom of the list there were two who were never identified and were cremated in Bali. I always thought, 'I wonder whose family was affected. Did they ever know that those two, who were family members, would never return back to where they had come from?'
         </p>
         <p>
          I admire the resilience of those affected, because all of them have got on with their lives. When we saw a photographic display of those who had lost lives and when we saw family members put flowers on the wreath of flowers in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Hall" rel="nofollow">
           Great Hall
          </a>
          , we could see their emotion but we also saw their resilience and acceptance, that they were still acknowledging somebody that they had lost.
         </p>
         <p>
          The attack involved the detonation of three bombs, but I note in particular the two which inflicted the terrible loss of life: a backpack mounted device carried by a suicide bomber and a large car bomb, which were both detonated within 20 seconds of each other. They would have created, in anybody's mind, a considerable level of confusion because any explosion near you disorients you. If you are directly affected then you have this double impact, so the surrealness versus the reality of what you experience becomes a challenge but your survival hopes kick in.
         </p>
         <p>
          I note the way in which we responded, in partnership with the Indonesians, was incredible when you give consideration to the logistics of responding to such an event. When I saw the photographs and the images, both electronically and in media stories, I noted the damage was immense, with the scorching of the earth, with the glass that would have flown, with the impact on buildings several blocks away a reality jolt of the brutality that was inflicted by people who set out to kill innocent holidaymakers, people who had no regard for the fact that they were not involved in their war of terror. What they should have done was look at other opportunities of expressing their dissatisfaction than to take the lives of family members.
         </p>
         <p>
          When you looked at the hospital facilities that were available then in Bali, you saw they were not adequate. I am reminded in memory of the number of people who had severe burns and were taken to buildings around there that had swimming pools in which people could immerse those people with serious burns to alleviate their pain. Then I am reminded of the memories of reading newspaper articles about people who then went looking for family members and who knew that they were missing but did not know where they were and about the experience that they went through.
         </p>
         <p>
          But the plus out of all of this is that Australia committed resources to provide in Bali a hospital that would enable future people that required treatment to have access to good services. Additionally, Professor Fiona Wood and those within Darwin worked together to create two units that in the future would serve Australians well and also others who would need any specialised treatment. I think the thing that was important for all of us was the fact that we had given a special place to all of those who were affected through the memorials that had been established, here in Canberra and other parts of Australia and certainly in Bali.
         </p>
         <p>
          As a mark of respect, a permanent memorial was built on the site of the destroyed
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paddy's_Pub" rel="nofollow">
           Paddy's Pub
          </a>
          on Legian Street. The memorial is made of intricately carved stone, set with a large marble plaque which bears the names and nationalities of each of those killed. It is flanked by the national flags of the victims. The monument is well maintained and illuminated at night.
         </p>
         <p>
          I could spend time talking about the perpetrators, but I do not intend to do that. I want to remember those families who suffered the loss of a son, a daughter, a mother, a brother. In Perth, the memorial at
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_Park" rel="nofollow">

          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Eliza" rel="nofollow">
           Mount Eliza
          </a>
          in Kings Park, overlooking the city. The memorial is specifically designed to frame the sun's rays at dawn on 12 October each year, and it faces in the exact direction of Bali. The family names on there reflect the diversity, in a sense, of those families affected. The Kingsley Football Club, which had a number of members killed in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali_bombings" rel="nofollow">
           Bali bombings
          </a>
          , had in it kids from an area that I taught in. My sons were friends of some of those footballers. When I rang home from Italy I was talking to my youngest son and I asked him whether he knew anybody and he said yes, and he said some of the people from the Kingsley Football Club were schoolmates. I want to acknowledge what the member for Cowan,

         <p>
          The bonds between Indonesia and Australia, and our joint approach on terrorism and our combined efforts with other nations to tackle terrorist groups who inflict injury on innocent people and families, has been heightened and strengthened over that period of time. Our commitment and resolve to never allow any terrorist group or group of extremists to affect our way of life, our beliefs and our compassion about what we stand for and what we are as a nation will never change. But I hope we never again see something of the magnitude of what occurred in Bali.
         </p>
         <p>
          I acknowledge all of the families affected, and certainly acknowledge every Australian who contributed to the efforts at that time and our service men and women and the police forces who in the future will continue to ensure that we are protected and accorded the safety that is important to us as a nation of people.

           I rise to speak on the tragedy of the 2002
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali" rel="nofollow">
            Bali
           </a>
           bombings—a matter close to my heart. I have previously spoken on this topic, as have many of my colleagues. I am following the member for Higgins and the member for Hasluck, and I thank them for their contributions. These bombings were an event that had a profound impact on our national identity and one which Australians everywhere have managed to find inspiration and hope from amidst the pain and suffering.
          </p>
          <p>
           On Friday, 12 October 2012, Australians everywhere stopped to remember the tragic blasts that killed over 200 people, including 88 Australians, at the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sari_Club" rel="nofollow">
            Sari Club
           </a>
           in Kuta. As a country we were horrified that such a popular Australian tourist destination was the victim of barbaric terrorists with no regard for human life or for the livelihoods of the local Balinese. I recall the strength shown by former
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
            Prime Minister John Howard
           </a>
           as he responded to his own and to the Australian people's outrage, loss and grief as we mourned the loss of those lives. Mr Howard used the tragedy as an opportunity for subsequent cooperation with Indonesia. In the aftermath he ensured that the world knew Australia would stand side-by-side with Indonesia in ensuring those responsible were brought to justice.
          </p>
          <p>
           Australia's response to this tragedy was instantaneous. Our armed forces, police and medical professionals joined their Indonesian counterparts in providing on-the-ground support for the victims and families of those affected by the attacks. Over the following weeks the fledging partnership between Indonesia and Australia grew into a strong cooperation. Our armed forces assisted with the clean-up and with the provision of medical supplies. An initial medical team of seven doctors as well as nurses and surgeons worked from the ground in Bali to provide urgently needed medical treatment for the victims.
          </p>
          <p>
           The bombings were an event that could have driven a wedge between Australian and Indonesian cooperation; instead our partnership strengthened. The partnership between our police forces and intelligence agencies was further strengthened. Immediately after the attack,

           </a>
           , began work with the Indonesian chief of police to ensure the safety of possible targets in Bali and to secure the apprehension of those responsible for these heinous attacks. It is in this spirit that Australians and Indonesians come together on 12 October every year, not just to remember and honour those who lost their lives in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali_bombings" rel="nofollow">
            Bali bombings
           </a>
           , but to recognise and celebrate the joint achievements of our two nations and the ever-strengthening bonds we have between us.
          </p>
          <p>
           At 5 am on the morning of 12 October this year I had the privilege of joining the

           s in a moving dawn memorial service at
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kings_Park" rel="nofollow">
            Kings Park
           </a>
           in Perth. This service honoured the courage of the survivors, friends and families of the victims as well as those volunteers who provided support and services in the aftermath of the attack. It was a cool morning and as the sun rose a lone piper walked down from the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
            War Memorial
           </a>
           towards the Bali Memorial at Kings Park. Premier Barnett gave his speech. It was simple, but straightforward and to the point. It was a moving speech, as were other parts of the ceremony, which had enormous effect on people in the crowd. The service even affected those who were participating in a traditional Perth morning ceremony of having a drink. That time of the morning is when you usually see some of the parents and footballers of the Kingsley Football Club. The service also had an enormous effect on my wife, Cheryl, who had never been to a Bali memorial service. Being with the families and survivors at the service brought tears to her eyes. I know some of the survivors from my electorate flew back to Bali for the ceremony. They were friends with my sister, who passed away in 2004. She had a close relationship with those survivors and I hope they had a great experience when they went back for the ceremony in Bali.
          </p>
          <p>
           Ten years on it is inspiring to see how far all those affected by this tragedy have come. The impact from many of those in my home state of Western Australia was devastating. Many Western Australian's often frequent Bali's warm welcoming shores and, naturally, many local families were affected. In all, 16 Western Australians were killed in the blasts and many more were injured, which had a devastating impact on the WA community. Western Australia was vital in providing assistance to those injured, with many receiving treatment in our hospitals due to close proximity of Perth to Bali. The efforts of Dr Fiona Wood, the Perth burns specialist, are well known and were instrumental in treating and saving the lives of many injured in the attacks. Dr Wood pioneered the revolutionary spray-on skin treatment that saved the lives of countless burns victims and provided hope around the world to many families affected.
          </p>
          <p>
           The first face many people watched on the news coverage of the Bali bombings was that of Western Australian Peter Hughes.
          </p>
          <p>
           His swollen and badly burnt body resonated in the minds of viewers around the globe. Although badly injured, he was shown quietly telling rescuers to go and help others worse off than him, saying, 'Mate I’m
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK" rel="nofollow">
            OK
           </a>
           , I’m doing OK—there's lots of people worse off than me.'
          </p>
          <p>
           Peter has recovered from the trauma of the Bali bombings and continues to run his own successful roofing business. He also established the Peter Hughes Burn Foundation, to see burns victims successfully transition back into active life after a burns injury, becoming burns survivors. With co-patron Professor Fiona Ward and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Overton" rel="nofollow">
            Peter Overton
           </a>
           , the Peter Hughes Burn Foundation works with burns victims to provide inspirational support and help them achieve their dreams. Peter is a shining example of the hope that can spring from tragedies such as the Bali bombings.
          </p>
          <p>
           Ten years on, it is successes such as these that the Australian people and the international community can look to to provide inspiration, even in the face of tragedy. Who could ever forget the vision of

           —an inspiration! So many good things have come out of the Bali bombings.
          </p>
          <p>
           Before I conclude, I would like to take the opportunity to speak about an inspirational community organisation which began in Western Australia: the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bali_Peace_Park" rel="nofollow">
            Bali Peace Park
           </a>
           Association. It comprises survivors, supporters, friends and families of victims of the Bali bombings, which provides support for all those affected by the bombings. The organisation aims to establish a Peace Park Memorial on the site of the Sari Club, where the bombings occurred in 2002, where people may reflect upon and acknowledge the terrorist attack on 12 October 2002, along with all the acts of terror worldwide. The Bali Peace Park Association has the backing of the Australian state and federal governments, as well as the Indonesian government, and is currently engaged in negotiations to acquire the Sari Club site.
          </p>
          <p>
           I met with the Governor of Bali, Governor Pastika, in Canberra, when the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_Indonesia" rel="nofollow">
            President of Indonesia
           </a>
           came to Canberra. I had a meeting with him and I asked him to support the aims of the Bali Peace Park Association. He has been instrumental in helping and assisting that association. So I thank him for that.
          </p>
          <p>
           The association has also developed the Beyond Bali Education Kit, which aims to use the tragedy of the Bali bombings to try to counter violent extremism and home-grown terrorism by educating high school students across Australia. In a positive move forward the experiences of the survivors, including
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aussie_Rules" rel="nofollow">
            Aussie Rules
           </a>
           footballer Phil Britten and Balinese Muslim leader Haji Bambang, will be used in the educational kit available to all Australian high schools in 2013. The education package was developed by the Bali Peace Park and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtin_University" rel="nofollow">
            Curtin University
           </a>
           , in my electorate of Swan, and was trialled in two Western Australian schools—
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth_Modern_School" rel="nofollow">

            Australian Islamic College
           </a>
           in Kewdale, which is also in my electorate. This fantastic initiative was made possible by a $55,000 grant from the federal Attorney-General's Building Community Resilience fund. It is a testament of the spirit and compassion of the Australian people who were able to turn around a horrific and shocking event such as the Bali bombings into a movement of peace, inspiration and renewed cooperation with one of our closest neighbours, Indonesia. May our strength and friendship continue to grow and thrive for many years to come.
          </p>
          <p>
           In finishing, I do support the call of the opposition leader—and we also heard from the member for Higgins—for compensation. You can never be compensated enough for anything like that but, at the same time, these people could use that compensation to get on with their lives and to assist them and their families in moving forward.
