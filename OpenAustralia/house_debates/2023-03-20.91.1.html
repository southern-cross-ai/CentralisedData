        My question is to the Prime Minister. How did the Prime Minister's recent trip to India work to strengthen the links between our two nations on trade, renewable energy, education and security?

          I thank the member for Lalor for her question and for her intense engagement with the Indian diaspora here, Australia's largest growing diaspora group, who are making an enormous contribution to Australia. India is a key strategic partner, a partner of some 1.4 billion people. That represents a growing, dynamic nation that is brimming with opportunity. We have a very rich friendship, shared by our common democratic values. Our cultural links as well are critical. It was good to meet with Prime Minister Modi for the fourth time, and I look forward to welcoming him at the Quad leaders summit in a couple of months time.
         </p>
         <p>
          This visit did advance our cultural, economic and security ties. We discussed the comprehensive economic cooperation agreement that we want to conclude by the end of this year. On cultural issues, I arrived on the day of Holi, a very important, colourful spectacle that takes place here in Australia, but particularly in India. I was able to pay tribute to

          and had that great honour given to me. We also took the trade minister, who showcased Australia's products there in India, including the wonderful food and wine that we have available here, and concluded an agreement between Australian film producers and Bollywood producers to bring more film production here. That means more jobs here.
         </p>
         <p>
          On the economy, we have a potential for massive growth. Over 25

          </a>
          was signed between the Business Council of Australia and the Confederation of Indian Industry. We also had 34 leaders from the renewable energy sector, again showing the cooperation that's there on renewable energy partnership. The Minister for Resources was there talking about extending the Australia-India critical minerals partnership as well. On education, we announced that

          </a>
          will be the first overseas university to establish a campus in India, in Gujarat. Wollongong university will be the second. This will make an enormous difference to us. On security, Australia will host Exercise Malabar for the first time this year, and I had the honour of touring

         </p>
         <p>
          We have a great more to do to build this relationship. India will grow to be the third-largest economy in the world in coming decades. This means opportunity for us if we get the relationship right. I thank Prime Minister Modi for his extraordinary hospitality during my visit.
