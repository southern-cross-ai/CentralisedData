        GOODENOUGH () (): The connection of

        </a>
        with a realigned Gnangara Road at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanneroo_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Wanneroo Road
        </a>
        intersection represents a priority infrastructure project worthy of federal support. It will yield significantly more economic benefit than the initial investment. Since the land acquisition process was completed several years ago little progress has been made in proceeding to the design and construction phase and securing funding. This is a project which I have been actively campaigning in support of over many years, requiring the joint cooperation of the City of Wanneroo and the WA state government through
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Roads_Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Main Roads Western Australia
        </a>
        . This priority initiative will unlock several hectares of undeveloped commercial and industrial zoned land for development, creating a vibrant, bulky goods transport and logistics hub. It will also improve access to employment and services in the Wangara industrial area for my constituents who commute on a daily basis.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have been working closely with local landowners, who have engaged consultants to prepare advanced plans for the construction of new commercial buildings along the realigned Gnangara Road frontage. They have secured leases with national tenants ready to establish showrooms, factories and warehouses, creating hundreds of local jobs. Facilitating this development will attract significant investment in construction totalling millions of dollars for the local economy. In the lead-up to the last state election, the WA Liberal opposition committed $10 million towards the roadworks. Unfortunately, the McGowan Labor government is yet to make a funding commitment to this vital economic development project, which is expected to cost $20 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        Upgrading the connection between the residential suburbs of Moore and the vast industrial powerhouse of Wangara will be the catalyst for further economic development within the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Joondalup" rel="nofollow">
         City of Joondalup
        </a>
        , as local people will be able to commute more easily to work and businesses based in Joondalup will be able to supply goods and services to customers in the Wangara commercial and industrial area. This critical east-west route through the heartland of the Moore electorate complements the other recently constructed links between the Joondalup and Wanneroo communities, in the form of the grade separated traffic bridges at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joondalup_Drive" rel="nofollow">
         Joondalup Drive
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_Reef_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Ocean Reef Road
        </a>
        , which have facilitated more free-flowing traffic between our residential suburbs and commercial hubs. The project has wide support from the local community, as it will alleviate traffic congestion. I strongly make the case for federal funding to act as the catalyst for development. The economic benefit realised will far exceed the infrastructure investment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The creation of a community hub in the established suburb of Kallaroo is another priority project within my electorate which is worthy of federal support. At the heart of the suburb is a small community facility built around a clubhouse. It includes tennis courts, a playground and outdoor recreational area and caters for a thriving local community. The 40-year-old facility has long since outgrown its capacity. The local residents association has advanced a proposal to extend and redevelop the ageing facilities to create a new not-for-profit community hub. The committee has completed due diligence by commissioning extensive research to ascertain community needs, culminating in a strategic business plan for the next five years, including indicative building plans for the redevelopment of the existing facility. The North Shore Community Hub is intended to cater for the existing community base of more than 600 local residents through a program of community activities and events, including health and wellbeing programs, tennis, pickleball, fitness, tai chi and yoga. The local community recently enjoyed a Christmas carols event and a musical performance staged by the local orchestra in the grounds. In partnership with local and state government, a funding contribution from the federal government is necessary to make this landmark project a reality. The North Shore Community Hub redevelopment has significant merit and I wish to formally place on record my strong support for a federal funding contribution.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the current highly competitive environment for government funding, these priority projects have both considerable merit and community support. I am pleased to advocate for them in the upcoming budget process.
