       <p>
        Last weekend I was very proud to host a Big Aussie Barbie in my electorate of Hindmarsh in support of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostate_Cancer_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Prostate Cancer Foundation
        </a>
        of Australia and to raise funds for the foundation. The Big Aussie Barbie is all about starting a discussion among blokes about a significant health issue for all us men, prostate cancer, and we must make sure men are hearing the message.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our barbie on the weekend was a great gathering. I was honoured to have in attendance members of the public who turned up to have a snag, a bit of onion and some sauce on a bit of bread and throw a gold coin into the tin. Some very good mates attended, including the

        </a>
        . We were also very lucky to have a special guest speaker, David Merry, who attended with the state manager of the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia, Karyn Foster. David is a survivor of prostate cancer and not only gave a great account of the statistics but is a great example that men in their 40s and older should be checked regularly for prostate cancer.
       </p>
       <p>
        We raised several hundred dollars for the foundation through donations and I am very pleased that tomorrow I will be hosting another barbecue here at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">

        and many other members of parliament will be there.
       </p>
       <p>
        The barbecue here at parliament is always very successful. Every year it is a big event. Of course, the reason all of this is happening is that September is International Prostate Cancer Awareness Month. Around the nation, blokes and their friends and families have been firing up the barbecue in support of the cause and to get the message out there, which is: check your prostate on a regular basis. Early detection means that the likelihood of survival is far greater.
       </p>
       <p>
        This campaign is easy for people to get involved with because it centres around one of our great Aussie icons—that is, 'the barbie'. It celebrates the good things about this country—the weather, the food and the people. It seems only natural to us that it can also help us to raise money and awareness for prostate health. These barbecues will be hosted by people who want to share the importance of prostate cancer awareness all around the country. Indeed, there are fewer things that Australian men need to become better aware of and here are a just a few sobering reasons why Australian men and their families need to be talking about prostate cancer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prostate cancer is a significant health problem and due to our ageing population it is likely to become the leading cause of death from cancer in men in the future. Prostate cancer is still the most common cancer in Australian men and more than ever we are seeing the impact it has in our community. The chance of developing prostate cancer increases as men get older and, if there is a family history of prostate cancer, again the chances are high. Approximately 20,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year. One in nine Australian men will develop prostate cancer in their lifetime. Every day around 32 men learn the news that they have prostate cancer and tragically one man will lose his battle with this disease every three hours.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thanks to Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia, we are now aware of the major impact this disease has. The PCFA is dedicated to reducing the impact of prostate cancer on Australian men. Their great work includes promoting and funding world-leading, innovative research into prostate cancer; implementing awareness campaigns and education programs; and, supporting men and their families affected by prostate cancer through evidence based information and resources, support groups and providing world-class prostate cancer nurses to men requiring specialist care.
       </p>
       <p>
        I encourage all members in this House today to get in touch with the PCFA and your local support groups and get your electorate involved in this important campaign. Your neighbourhood community groups, clubs, family and friends can help spread the message so that many losses in families around our nation can potentially be avoided through men talking about prostate cancer, spreading the word and getting checked just to be safe.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are making great progress but more work still needs to be done to help prevent and manage the impact of prostate cancer in the community. Initiatives like the Big Aussie Barbie campaign help to bring a serious issue like prostate cancer to the fore and to get the message out there. I encourage all of you to come tomorrow to hear what will be said by the Prostate Cancer Foundation of Australia and just have some fun, while raising funds for the PCFA. I hope to see you all there tomorrow.
