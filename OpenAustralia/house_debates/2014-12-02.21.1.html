       <p>
        On Saturday there was a state election in Victoria. I am sure that members opposite will be very interested in hearing some of the issues raised in that election which are relevant to them and relevant to how we are conducting ourselves in this place. I spent many hours in pre-poll booths and doorknocking talking to constituents in the marginal electorates of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yan_Yean" rel="nofollow">

        and Eltham and what struck me was how much voters were concerned about this government's regressive higher education agenda.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a context to this, of course. Youth unemployment is going through the roof, as state government has cut back on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , closing the Greensborough TAFE in my electorate, which the state Labor government will reopen. But that will not fix all the problems. That will not open up all the avenues that young people deserve.
       </p>
       <p>
        I spent a lot of time speaking with the member for Kingston, speaking with students at Latrobe university, and I was struck by their concern—not for themselves but for their brothers and their sisters—younger people who will not have the opportunities they are presently enjoying if this government gets its way.
       </p>
       <p>
        This government's higher education plan is not flawed in execution and it cannot be fixed by tinkering at the edges in the Senate; it is fundamentally flawed. Our challenge here in this place is to boost Australia's productivity and to boost our fairness. We do so by opening up higher education to all based on merit. I urge members opposite and crossbench senators to start listening to the people of Victoria.
