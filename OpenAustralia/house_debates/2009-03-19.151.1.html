        Australia is a Shoalhaven based not-for-profit organisation whose purpose is to provide supported employment in hospitality for people with disabilities. I would like to read their story into the record, and to add how privileged I am to have been with them through their journey.
       </p>
       <p>
        Their story started in 2006 and took 18 months of difficult lobbying and several meetings with ministers and senators to obtain seed funding. Former senator

        and I firmly believed in their proposal and went strongly into bat for the group. They were granted $25,000 and a two-year pilot project which allowed them to employ eight supported employees. Flagstaff Shoalhaven were given funding to guide them through all aspects of the establishment process. The pilot project was completed on 30 June 2008 and they were given a 12-month stand-alone contract to prove their viability to deliver on their own. Just recently, they have been awarded their compliance certificate and they expect a decision on their status this month. I can only wish them well as they wait.

        , Slice of Life started their activities in the Reflections Cafe at the Shoalhaven Memorial Gardens Cemetery at Worrigee. Catering on-site for wakes, they also provide cafe facilities for visitors to the cemetery as well as off-site catering within the Shoalhaven and surrounding areas to local businesses, individuals and community organisations. They continue to grow and expand their premises, moving to new and expanded premises and opening a general store, which added to their range of services.

        Slice of Life is presently working within the local community to establish a community style garden to provide disadvantaged people with an opportunity to connect with the earth and produce fresh vegetables in support of their commercial activities. In 2007, they were awarded the area consultative committee Stars of the Shoalhaven chairman’s award for community contribution, which was presented by the

        . Karen Anstiss, founder and managing director of Slice of Life, was awarded the Shoalhaven community boss of the year award in 2008.

        SOLA currently employs 17 local people, 14 of whom have a disability. Eight employees are supported by FaHCSIA under the disability enterprise scheme and nine others are supported by profit-making enterprises. SOLA have seven longstanding volunteers, who are invaluable to the organisation. They provide work experience opportunities for schools and for local disability support organisations. SOLA’s turnover for the 2007-08 financial year was in excess of $250,000.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is an example of an enterprise that delivers on a number of fronts and one that is worthy of continued support to assist more disabled people who want to participate and contribute in her own right. I congratulate all who have been involved in the evolution of Slice of Life Australia. The community of Gilmore is very proud of Karen and her group of wonderful, special workers.
