        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. Will the Deputy Prime Minister give a guarantee to Australia’s wheat growers that, before any changes are contemplated to wheat export arrangements, a properly constituted poll of all registered wheat growers will be conducted?

        <p>
         I thank the member for New England for his question. Obviously, the whole debate about the oil for food program and wheat exports across the world, particularly to Iraq, has raised an element of expectation and concern for Australian wheat growers, who are genuinely trying to do their job of growing wheat and selling it for the best price overseas. We have continued to support them in that. As the Prime Minister indicated yesterday in his response to the member for New England’s question, he is well aware of the government’s policy on the existence and operation of the single desk.
        </p>
        <p>
         On the member for New England’s point about the operation of the single desk and the involvement of wheat growers, the wheat growers of Australia, whether they be in the eastern states or the western states, feel very attached to the mechanism that has served them well over many years. We do not envisage in the short term any changes in this policy. As we have done in the past, in communicating, seeking responses and consulting with grower bodies in the different sectors of agriculture, of course we would consult with the wheat-growing community of Australia if there were any proposed changes to the mechanisms that are in place.
