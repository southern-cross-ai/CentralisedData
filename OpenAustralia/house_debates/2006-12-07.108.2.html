       <p>
        Yesterday the honourable members for Fowler, Throsby, Adelaide and Franklin asked me a series of questions concerning proceedings of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Standing Committee
        </a>
        on Family and Human Services. The honourable member for Mackellar, chair of the committee, also raised some questions on the same matters. She referred to certain matters again in the adjournment debate last night. In addition, I have received a letter from the honourable member for Fowler canvassing several of the issues. As well as raising a number of points about particular aspects of the operation of the Standing Committee on Family and Human Services, the questions go to wider matters of committee practice and administration.
       </p>
       <p>
        The work that members of the House put into fulfilling their obligations in respect of committee service is very important. Committee processes are a feature of the modern House of which I am particularly supportive. In the time available it has obviously not been possible for me to obtain all the information that will be needed to respond to the matters that have been raised. However, I will seek to obtain necessary details during the summer adjournment and report further as appropriate. I also intend to ask the Deputy Speaker, in his capacity as chair of the liaison committee of chairs and deputy chairs, to consider the issues of procedure and practice raised in this case and provide me with advice as to whether action is required to clarify any aspects of committee practice and procedure.
