        , it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: OneSKY equipment rooms project in Melbourne and Brisbane.

        </a>
        are planning to replace their existing air traffic control systems with the new civil military air traffic management system being delivered under the OneSKY program to provide a common air traffic control platform in both civilian and military controlled airspace. To achieve this outcome, Airservices is proposing to construct new equipment rooms in Melbourne and Brisbane to house the critical OneSKY computer and communications infrastructure in a Defence protected status building.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposed works will include facilities to ensure that two systems can be run in parallel during the transition phase while providing a clear separation between the existing operational air traffic management system and the new air traffic control system. The new civil military air traffic management system will require continual work to develop and test the system without disruption to existing operations and operational equipment. The proposed facilities will meet stringent reliability and security requirements in order to adequately support air traffic control in more than 11 per cent of the world's airspace, 24-hours a day, seven days a week.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee has conducted an inquiry and is of the view that the project signifies value for money for the Commonwealth and constitutes a project that is fit for purpose and expedient to carry out. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for undertaking a timely inquiry. Subject to parliamentary approval, the proposed works are scheduled to commence in late 2015, with a staged practical completion and commissioning between September 2016 and November 2016. I commend the motion to the House.

         GST

The project includes new and upgraded facilities and infrastructure essential for the operation of the special forces, which includes new working accommodation, maintenance hangars, storage and workshop facilities. ADF special forces are highly trained and specially equipped to conduct operations at short notice in a range of domestic and international environments. Special forces give the government a range of strategic options beyond those available through conventional forces.

        equipment, including vehicles, weapons, communications equipment, watercraft and personnel equipment. Campbell Barracks is an operational mounting base and a command-and-control centre for global operations. It supports a highly trained and specially equipped force that must be able to prevent, deter or respond to a threat at short notice in a range of domestic and international environments. Campbell Barracks enables current operations, planning for impending operations and enables the development and application of classified and sensitive capabilities.

        The redevelopment project will replace ageing and obsolete facilities by delivering functional, flexible purpose-built facilities and improved infrastructure at Campbell Barracks. These will include a new operations precinct, new and refurbished operational support squadron facilities and quartermaster store, a new entry precinct and a fibre transmission facility. The project will deliver upgraded facilities, services and infrastructure, and demolition of 34 obsolete facilities.

The design of a new fit-out will allow the 'new' AAT to improve the service to clients by using new technologies to deliver services more efficiently and effectively, and by providing a single point of access for most Commonwealth merit reviews.

         Northern Territory
        </a>
        .

       <p>
        The Department of Defence is proposing to construct new fit-for-purpose facilities to support the Royal Australian Air Force's primary training area for air-to-surface weapon deliveries at the Delamere Air Weapons Range, which is in the Northern Territory. The Delamere Air Weapons Range includes an airfield complex, an urban environment and a fuel storage complex. The range also includes a high-explosive impact area, a practice bombing impact zone, a practice rocketry impact zone and air-to-surface gunnery lanes.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project will deliver new working and living accommodation and vehicle maintenance areas, a new alternative high-explosive impact area, upgraded roads, improved boundary fencing and general airfield remediation. The project will also conduct demolitions, civil works and landscaping. The project will support increased exercise activity and meet the desire from coalition partners for increased exercise access and greater operational fidelity. The project will also support the safe employment of the Air Force's weapons capabilities and the new Growler mobile threat training emitter systems.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project cost is estimated at $74.4 million, excluding GST. This includes costs of construction, escalation allowances, professional service fees, design, information technology equipment and contingencies. This investment will bring economic benefits for the Northern Territory. Subject to parliamentary approval of the project, construction is expected to begin in the first half of 2016 with completion expected by early- to mid-2018. I commend this motion to the House.
