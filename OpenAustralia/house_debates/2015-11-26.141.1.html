        Today I rise speak about the events that have taken place in Paris and around the world. Recently, Lady Jane Edwards AM, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Honorary_Consul" rel="nofollow">
         Honorary Consul
        </a>
        for France in Queensland, held a vigil following the horrifying events on 13 November in Paris, where 129 lives were lost and many more were injured. Thousands of people's lives will never be the same. I pay tribute to my dear friend Lady Jane Edwards for her dedication and her commitment to this important role and for organising such a beautiful vigil in such a short period of time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The vigil was attended by the

        As the darkness descended and silence fell upon the crowd, we imagined for a short moment what it would have been like to be one of the victims in the Bataclan Theatre, the stadium or the beautiful restaurants and bars on the streets of Paris. Marcel Poualion, vice-president of Brisbane's Union of French Citizens Abroad. He said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our motherland, the land of freedom, equality and fraternity, is mourning.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        She has been painfully hurt in the flesh.
       </p>
       <p>
        But while we were there to mourn the loss of life from unspeakable evil, the overwhelming mood was not one of fear but one of defianceâ€”defiance, because we will not succumb to the acts of terror witnessed right across the globe. Australia's contribution to the war on terror has been repeatedly stated. We are the biggest contributor to the crisis in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">

        , second only to the United States. But our efforts abroad have also been matched by our efforts at home, not with the bullet and the bomb, but with the commitment to unity and diversity. Fostering a society in the seat of Brisbane, where many cultures can live harmoniously, is a model to be emulated and one that I am so proud of. Brisbane is one of the most culturally diverse seats in Queensland and it is a point of pride for me.
       </p>

        To the people of France, we mourn with you, we support you, we honour what you bring to our nation. We stand as one. We are one.
