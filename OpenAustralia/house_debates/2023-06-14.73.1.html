        My question is to the Minister for Health and Aged Care. We all support cheaper medicines but the government's new dispensing rule is asking community pharmacies to pay for it. Will the minister provide modelling that demonstrates no community pharmacies will see job losses or closures under this policy?

        <p>
         I relish yet another opportunity to talk about this government's commitment to cheaper medicines. We went to the election last year promising to deliver cheaper medicines to millions of Australian patients. In July last year we managed to cut the safety net for millions of pensioners by 25 per cent. The maximum amount pensioners will pay for all of their medicine needs across the year is now only $5.05 per week. We cut the price of 2,000 brands of medicine in September, delivering $130 million back into the pockets of hardworking Australian patients. And, as I might have said once or twice at this dispatch box, on 1 January we delivered the biggest cut to the price of medicines in the 75-year history of the PBS.
        </p>
        <p>
         We know there is more to do, which is why we accepted advice from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_Benefits_Advisory_Committee" rel="nofollow">
          Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee
         </a>
         that had lain on the table for five years to allow 60-day dispensing of medicines for chronic disease. That's very common across all of the countries to which we usually compare ourselves. These are medicines that people are on for years and years, if not decades.

          The minister will pause. The Leader of the Nationals is being highly disorderly before his call to start speaking at the dispatch box. I give the call to the Leader of the Nationals on a point of order.

           It's on relevance. This is a very tight question; we've been very patient. It goes to the heart of the minister providing the modelling that demonstrates no community pharmacies will see job losses or closures. There's nothing about cheaper medicines. It was about the modelling of pharmacies that he's going to destroy.

              There was a question in there, but there was also a preamble around cheaper medicines, in particular about the government's dispensing rules and asking pharmacies to pay for it. So, obviously, if that's part of the question, the minister is entirely in order to talk about that.

              is pretty clear about how ministers are being relevant. I'm listening to him carefully. If he strays off the topic and doesn't refer to the question, he'll be pulled back into order, but I'm going to listen to make sure he is relevant. The minister has the call.

                     The Leader of the Nationals said we all support cheaper medicines, but, when that advice was provided to the former government five years ago, they decided to do nothing about it. Instead, they required all of those millions of patients to traipse to the pharmacy every single month and, over those intervening five years, pay hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars in co-payments that the advisory committee overseeing the PBS said were unnecessary. This is a policy that will halve the cost of these chronic disease medicines for millions of patients. It's a policy that will improve their health. We have said that every dollar saved by the Commonwealth will be reinvested into community pharmacy. We're in the process of finalising the detail of that, talking with pharmacy groups across the sector, particularly focusing on smaller rural pharmacies to make sure that the impact on those rural pharmacies is mitigated. We want a viable community pharmacy sector. Instead of politicising this issue, maybe the opposition should work with us.
