        I rise today to acknowledge the generosity of my local community in southern Adelaide who came together to collect donations for the most vulnerable people in need over the holiday season.
       </p>
       <p>
        My office acted as a drop-off point to collect donations to help local charities and animal shelters over the Christmas period. It was a huge success again this year, and we received a huge number of donations, including hundreds of toys, hundreds of toiletries and thousands of food donations not to mention a whole lot of pet products.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our office was overflowing with donations, and t hese items were donated to a number of organisations: toys were donated to Junction Australia; food was donated to Anglicare Christies Beach and The Vines Uniting Church; toiletries were donated to St Vincent d e Paul; and pet food and blankets were donated to the Lonsdale

        . These organisations do a great job in supporting those in need in our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The generosity of the people involved in collecting donations was wonderful to witness. I would like to thank all the individuals, schools, sporting groups, childcare centres, businesses, aged-care facilities and community groups who donated this Christmas.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to make some special mentions of some particular efforts that were noteworthy. A number of organisations dug deep and contributed greatly to the cause. These included: Aldinga and Sellicks Spinners, Knitters, Weavers and Felters; 50-plus Activity Club; Spectrum Art Group; Southern District Midweek Ladies Tennis Club,

       </p>
       <p>
        There were also many individuals who made a significant contribution. I would like to recognise Jo and Carey Habel, who brought in stuffed animals; Rhonda Smith, who donated a Christmas tree, decorations, dog food, toiletries and toys; and Peter Rayner, who donated cinema tickets.

        , all generously donated to the appeal as well. Everyone in the southern suburbs of Adelaide who donated showed a huge amount of compassion and care, and this was heartening to see.
       </p>
       <p>
        Christmas can be a very difficult time for many people. It can be a difficult time for people who are struggling, who do not have the food and toys they need. Our community worked very hard together to ensure that Christmas was a little better for those who had not very much. So I would like to again thank everyone who participated, who collected donations. It was a wonderful effort and it was wonderful to see that the giving spirit was truly alive and well this Christmas.
