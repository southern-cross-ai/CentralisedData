       <p>
        Mr Speaker, on indulgence: overnight in the Indian city of Mumbai there have been a series of coordinated attacks on up to 10 hotels, train stations and other public places. It is unclear at this stage who is responsible for these attacks, although one organisation has claimed responsibility. The Australian government unreservedly condemns the atrocious attacks on innocent people in Mumbai, whoever has carried out those attacks.
       </p>
       <p>
        As we speak, these events continue to unfold, but we understand that up to 80 people have been killed and some 250 injured. Our sympathy and condolences go to the victims and to their families. Attackers may still be in the hotels, and there are reports that hostages have been taken. The government is seeking to confirm as a matter of urgency the safety and welfare of Australians who may be affected. We have 317 Australians registered with us as being in Mumbai. There are likely to be more than that. Our consular staff are currently attempting to contact all the Australians who are registered. At least two Australians have been injured, and our thoughts are with them and their families. I am advised that Australian casualties may rise. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
        </a>
        has been in contact with the families of those who are known to have been injured so far and with their families in Australia and is providing consular assistance on the ground in Mumbai.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australians who are concerned about the welfare of loved ones can contact a hotline that has been established by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The number of the consular hotline is 1800002214. I have just now spoken to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_High_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian High Commission
        </a>
        er to India, who is in Mumbai and leading the government’s response. Officials from the Australian Consulate-General in Mumbai and the Australian High Commission in New Delhi are checking with local authorities and hotel owners to determine exactly how many Australians may have been caught up in these incidents.
       </p>
       <p>
        The group that has claimed responsibility for this attack calls itself the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deccan_Mujahideen" rel="nofollow">
         Deccan Mujahideen
        </a>
        . Together with other ministers, I have just attended a meeting of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         National Security Committee
        </a>
        of Cabinet. At this stage, little is known about this group—or at least a group using that name. But whichever group has perpetrated this attack, they are cowards—absolute cowards—and murderers. It is likely to take some time to identify all the perpetrators. This cowardly attack on India’s stability, peace and democracy reminds us all that international terrorism is far from defeated and that we must all maintain our vigilance. We have to continue to work closely with our allies and partners around the world to defeat terrorism.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the light of this attack, we have today reissued our travel advice for India. The advice says that Australians should avoid travel to Mumbai at this time. I would encourage all Australians to read the advice carefully. We are offering, through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Federal Police
        </a>
        , assistance with counterterrorism and forensics policing to the Indian authorities and any other assistance which may be of direct relevance at this critical time. We stand ready to assist India in any way it needs right now.
       </p>
       <p>
        This latest attack on Indian peace, stability and democracy reminds us again of the need to remain forever vigilant. I remind all honourable members of this: this is an unfolding event, it is a serious incident and it is therefore of deep concern and distress to all Australian families who have members of their families in India, especially Mumbai, at this time. I would join with all members in offering our thoughts and prayers at this time, given the great uncertainties which continue.

        <p>
         Mr Speaker, on indulgence: on behalf of the coalition I join the Prime Minister in expressing our deep sense of shock and revulsion at today’s cowardly and murderous terrorist attacks in the very heart of Mumbai. This is an assault on all of us who cherish the value of free societies. We may not know how many lives have been lost to this senseless savagery but we do know the cost will be horrific and the pain will be immense for the families of the innocents who have died or suffered serious injury.
        </p>
        <p>
         For the people of Mumbai, sadly, this is far from their first encounter with violence and extremists—the cowardly, murderous terrorists. We well remember the horrendous bomb blasts in March 2003 which claimed 257 lives. We remember the serial bombings on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Railway" rel="nofollow">
          Western Railway
         </a>
         three years ago, claiming the lives of more than 200 people simply going about their daily business. After a wave of terrorist attacks across India this year—in Delhi, Hyderabad, Bangalore and other cities—in which hundreds of people have been killed or wounded, these murderers have now returned to Mumbai. It is a reminder to the world that the terrorist threat to freedom has not retreated and we must remain, as the Prime Minister said, as vigilant and courageous and as stalwart and forthright in our opposition to terrorism as ever. It is a reminder too to Australians that terrorism is a present threat around the world and we must be resolute in our own determination to defeat the enemies of freedom and democracy.
        </p>
        <p>
         At this time we understand that two of our own citizens have been injured in these attacks and we pray for their safe recovery as we pray for the families of all the people affected by this tragedy. Our thoughts and prayers are also with those trying to contact friends or family in Mumbai, the hub for many Australians who are dealing with, working in, or trading with India, one of the world’s oldest and most revered civilisations. Today the people of India have our heartfelt support and solidarity.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia and India have so much in common—a common heritage through the Commonwealth, through the British connection, the English language, cricket and, above all, democracy. When we think of our achievements in Australia, of our parliamentary democracy, let us spare a thought of admiration for India, that vast country of over a billion people, which maintains a rich and vibrant democracy and which is now facing these murderous cowards who are trying to bully and threaten the people of India, disrupt their economic growth and disrupt their democracy. Democracy and economic freedom have lifted tens if not hundreds of millions of Indians from the very bottom of poverty. They have provided great opportunities in that free society, and these terrorists seek to stop that. They are seeking to stop the progress of poor men and women out of poverty, and for that terrible crime they are condemned. We on the opposition benches stand together with the government in condemning the men and women who committed this crime and resolve to be as vigilant and stalwart as ever in our opposition to terrorism wherever it may be around the world.

          On further indulgence, I will just add to my remarks for the benefit of the information of the House and of the Australian people. The government is advised that at this stage Qantas will be flying to Mumbai on Friday, 28 November. However, the situation is being reviewed and reassessment will occur at 3 pm today, given the security situation. We further advise that Qantas stands ready to assist the Australian government if asked to help evacuate Australians.
