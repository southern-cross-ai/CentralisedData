        My priority in Parramatta at the moment is jobs; in fact my second priority is jobs and my third priority is jobs. My electorate, according to local council surveys recently, is shielded to some extent and unemployment is holding quite well, largely due to a large public health sector based around the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Westmead_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Westmead Hospital
        </a>
        , a very large retail sector that is growing slightly and a construction industry that is booming, largely on the back of the housing market and the first home owner’s boost. But, for people who lose their jobs—and

        had one of their factories in my electorate—the overall figures do not matter. The figure that matters is the figure related to their pay packet and bank account.

        That is why the government’s stimulus package is so important for my electorate. With 70 per cent of the stimulus package going to infrastructure, it is building jobs for today and building the infrastructure that we need for tomorrow. My work over the last few months has been to make sure that not one—

        I am working hard to make sure that the people in my community benefit from the government’s nation-building plan. I confess to being selfish—I would be happy if all the jobs went to Parramatta, Blacktown and the Hills region. I do not think that is going to happen, because I know that my colleagues are working very hard on jobs in their own areas. This is why Laurie Ferguson MP, Roger Price MP and I created the Keep the West Working campaign. This campaign will ensure that Parramatta, the Hills and the Blacktown region extract maximum advantage from the Rudd government’s stimulus package through the clear dissemination of information, the broad consultation with all stakeholders and the promotion of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The campaign is up and running after a kick-start information session for local business and community groups at the Parramatta Town Hall last month. The information session was attended by more than 450 businesses and was an example of the essential strength of Western Sydney, which is our rich diversity. On the night of the forum I presented a practical how-to guide for accessing all parts of the stimulus package, including the school construction projects, the home insulation installation, social infrastructure and employment projects, small business tax concessions, free business advice and mentoring, solar hot water installation and community infrastructure.

        The
        <i>
         Keep the West Working Guide
        </i>
        provides concise practical information for local businesses and community groups on where the money is and how it flows through our region. The
        <i>
         Keep the West Working Guide
        </i>
        provides the dates, deadlines, guidelines, phone numbers and people to contact on every aspect of the Rudd government’s $42 billion nation-building jobs plan. We on this side of the House see ourselves as service providers. It is not just about announcing the project; it is about making sure that our community is in the best position to access the assistance available through the stimulus package.
