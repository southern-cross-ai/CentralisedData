         Queen's Birthday
        </a>
        honours list gives us an opportunity to acknowledge the extraordinary achievements and the community service of our fellow Australians. So it's with much pride that I formally acknowledge these recent honourees from the electorate of Brisbane.
       </p>
       <p>
        Firstly, three residents have been awarded an Order of Australia in recognition of their achievements in the fields of health, medicine and medical research. Dr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Redmond" rel="nofollow">

        has been awarded for his significant service to medicine, neurosurgery and medical organisations. Dr Redmond is the director of neurosurgery at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Brisbane_and_Women's_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Brisbane and Women's Hospital
        </a>
        as well as serving as the head of neurosurgery at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Darwin_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Darwin Hospital
        </a>
        . He was central to the establishment of the children's neurological service at the Lady Cilento hospital and served as director of pediatric neurosurgery there until 2017.
       </p>
       <p>
        Professor Jeanine Young has been awarded for her significant service to tertiary education, medical research and nursing. Professor Young is one of the nation's most respected leaders in the field of perinatal and infant mortality, and is currently serving as lead researcher into infant deaths in Indigenous communities, alongside her other work at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_of_Nursing" rel="nofollow">

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Beth Mohle has been awarded for her significant service to nursing as secretary of the Queensland Nurses and Midwives' Union. This is a fitting and timely honour and a tribute to the thousands of health workers she represents who have served at the forefront of Australia's response to the global coronavirus pandemic.
       </p>
       <p>
        Other Brisbane recipients of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        include Mrs Margot de Groot, for her service to the law, professional legal bodies and to women in business; Mr Peter Turnbull, for his significant service to business administration and to corporate governance institutes; and Mrs Margaret Hinton, for her significant service to education, philosophy and professional associations.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to acknowledge these Brisbane residents awarded Medals of the Order of Australia: my good friend, Peter Constantini, for his service to business, particularly in education, skills and training; Dr Arthur Briner, for his service to the Jewish community and ophthalmology; Dr Harold Paul Spiro, for his service to pediatric ophthalmology; Mr Tashi Tsering, for his service to education and Buddhism; and Mrs Geena Luckin, for her community service, including her tireless work with the Crosby Park Meals on Wheels service, where I caught up with her again recently to see the amazing work that organisation does throughout our community. These outstanding Australians have made a wonderful contribution to our city, our nation and the wider world. On behalf of the Brisbane community, I offer them our congratulations and thanks, and I extend our best wishes to all the recipients of the Queen's Birthday honours list.
