        I like to think that my electorate has some of Australia's most beautiful beaches. From the surfers paradise of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bondi_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Bondi Beach
        </a>
        to the gentle waves of Clovelly, Sydney's eastern beaches have something for everyone. Our beaches are lucky to be served by excellent surf clubs, staffed by courageous and selfless volunteers. The courage shown on a regular basis by our lifesavers is a testament to their own community spirit and their commitment to our safety. Our surf clubs are also the centre of much of our community in the east. Earlier this year many of the clubs stepped up to the plate during the bushfire crisis, working to deliver and collate donations for those in need who were suffering from the bushfires. Four of our surf clubs have recently held their annual general meetings. Last weekend it was Bronte Surf Life Saving Club and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Bondi" rel="nofollow">
         North Bondi
        </a>
        Surf Life Saving Club. They both elected new committees to lead the clubs for another year. I want to congratulate Basil Scaffidi on his election as president of Bronte Surf Life Saving Club. It his 10th year now leading Bronte. Also my congratulations go to Vanessa Power, Amber Brown, James McClennan,

        , Craig Betts, Kimberley Johns, and Gaby Naher on their election. I'd also like to recognise Roley Tyrell, who has stepped down as treasurer after serving for 16 years. In North Bondi, I'd like to congratulate Andrew Christopher for his re-election as president. I'd also like to extend my warm wishes to Karen Stott, Daniel Ekins, Phil Suriao, John Clothier, Eloise Starr,

        , Brenan Bastyovanszky, Lex Mankur and others on their recent election. I'd also like to thank outgoing committee members Peter Zieme and

        In July, Tamarama Surf Life Saving Club and Clovelly Surf Life Saving Club held their

        Sydneysiders are only able to enjoy everything our beaches have to offer thanks to the selflessness of our lifesavers and the volunteers that run and organise our surf clubs. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all lifesavers and all volunteers at our surf clubs for their efforts, their courage and their sacrifice and wish them the best for the lifesaving season ahead.
