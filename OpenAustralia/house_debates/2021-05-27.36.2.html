        this week it was revealed that there are hundreds of Aussies who've applied for the HomeBuilder grant and, because of a confusing online application form, have now missed out.

Then, when they went back on the website last month to put extra documents in, they found the application was gone. It had disappeared like it never existed. Now there are hundreds and hundreds of people in financial strife.

This is just one sentence from one email from Tara and Wayne from Bendigo: 'It was like someone had just burnt $25,000 right in front of me and said we can no longer have it, and your dream will go up in smoke with it.'
