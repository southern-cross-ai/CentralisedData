        [by video link] I want to acknowledge the service of my constituent, Lloyd Babb
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SC" rel="nofollow">
         SC
        </a>
        , who recently stepped down after 10 years as New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions. Lloyd Babb was educated at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asquith_Boys_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Asquith Boys High School
        </a>
        , where he was school captain. He took degrees in arts and law from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_University" rel="nofollow">
         Macquarie University
        </a>
        . After being admitted as a solicitor, he completed a masters in criminal justice from the University of Illinois and later became a visiting fellow at University of Copenhagen's institute of criminology. After returning to Australia in 1993, he served as a solicitor advocate at the office of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPP" rel="nofollow">
         DPP
        </a>
        and was called to the bar in 1995. In 2000 he was appointed a Crown prosecutor and in 2007 he took silk and became New South Wales Crown Advocate. He was appointed New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions in July 2011.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lloyd Babb is not only a great technical lawyer but is also a great leader of people. He told
        <i>
         Bar News
        </i>
        :
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The leadership and culture building is also important. I put a lot of time into that.
       </p>
       <p>
        As DPP he was instrumental in introducing the early appropriate guilty pleas regime, which has helped reduce delays in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_Court" rel="nofollow">
         District Court
        </a>
        . He appeared in many important High Court appeals, including Hughes v
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Queen" rel="nofollow">
         The Queen
        </a>
        , a leading case on tendency evidence; Swan v The Queen, a leading case on causation; and Aubrey v The Queen, a leading case on grievous bodily harm.
       </p>
       <p>
        Throughout, he has continued to be a contributor to our community through the local basketball association, where he serves as president. On behalf of my community and the federal parliament, I want to thank Lloyd for his service as New South Wales DPP and wish him all the very best for the future.
