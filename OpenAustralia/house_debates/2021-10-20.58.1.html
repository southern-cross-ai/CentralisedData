          I find it rather peculiar that the member for Gellibrand has straightaway opened with a joke about Ronald McDonald, obviously referring to

           The member for Gellibrand will not interject again, or he'll be ejected. I say to the Deputy Prime Minister: I have already cautioned the member for Gellibrand. The Deputy Prime Minister has the call.

            As to the Building Better Regions Fund, in the last round there were $1.7 billion worth of requests, which shows that this is an incredibly well responded to grant system. Within that system, we had over 1,000 applications in the last round.
           </p>
           <p>
            There are so many areas in regional Australia. I acknowledge the member for Eden-Monaro's question, where she talked about a certain grant. Unfortunately, within the envelope that we have, we were unable to help on that issue. But what we can say quite clearly is that, in the last round, in further discussions within the Expenditure Review Committee of the coalition, we extended a further $100 million—that's a $300 million package—because we look towards those corners of our nation which we can help—

             The Deputy Prime Minister will pause. Members on my left will cease
             <a class="glossary" href="/glossary/?gl=1" title="An interjection is when a member of parliament says something that can be...">
              interjecting

             . The member for Macquarie is persistently

              interjecting
             </a>
             . I will not tolerate members who ignore my repeated warnings. I'm trying to listen to the Deputy Prime Minister's answer, which I'm finding difficult. Those behind the Manager of Opposition Business are the first to complain when I'm asked to rule on a point of order and I haven't heard everything. I am going to labour the point. It prevents me doing my job, and it's disruptive to the house. If you think it makes any political difference, you're wrong. You're all wearing masks. It's just a loud wall of noise. The Deputy Prime Minister has the call.

              Of course, we are making sure that we continue this program. Obviously, we hope the Australian people find it prudent, for the re-election of a coalition government, and we are striving our very best to make sure that they see us in that light.

              We look forward to the Labor Party putting forward their views on what they intend to do with the Building Better Regions Fund. It's interesting that you bring that up, member for Eden-Monaro, because I note that, back in 2014 in the electorate of—we don't want to hear this, do we?

               The Deputy Prime Minister will resume his seat. I think the Manager of Opposition Business can resume his seat too. At this point I can anticipate where the Deputy Prime Minister is going, which is back seven years. The question was very specific. It asked whether the Deputy Prime Minister could confirm that one grant had been received and another one hadn't. Within that context, he's been very relevant up until this point, but he doesn't have the ability to go down a track of looking at other grants. The Deputy Prime Minister has the call.
