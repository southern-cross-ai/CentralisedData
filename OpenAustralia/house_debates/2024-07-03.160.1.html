        Community is at the heart of Tangney. I have had the pleasure of meeting many of the Tangney community leaders and learning about their countless contributions. They are leaders who bring together local groups and individuals to help improve lives—leaders who create and strengthen a sense of belonging. They promote harmony, reduce isolation and do their best to make everyone feel welcome and included. I want to acknowledge all our community heroes in Tangney.

         Andy Lau
        </a>
        is a lead staff member at Chorus Aged Care Service, located at the Bull Creek Community Centre in Tangney. Together with more than 24 support workers and 40 volunteers, the service provides in-home care, a multicultural day centre and many other services for more than 500 residents in Tangney. When I first met Andy at Bull Creek Community Centre, he was working alongside local senior citizens, volunteers and people with disability. They were all working together to provide Christmas food parcels for the disadvantaged families in the community. It is a wonderful hive of activities. Their teamwork brought the project to life. This is not an uncommon story in Tangney.

        Of course, teamwork is at the heart of Tangney sporting clubs, on the field or on the court but also behind the scenes. David Timmel of Melville City Hockey Club, Nick Gorht of Murdoch University Melville Cricket Club, Mark Hallet of Applecross Cricket Club, Bryan Raeburn of Murdoch University Melville Football Club,

        of Blue Gum Park Tennis Club are presidents of some of Tangney's vital community organisations. I am proud that the Albanese Labor government has supported these local sporting clubs by delivering upgrades, from new cricket nets to new clubrooms. It is great to see our election commitment being delivered. While these community organisations focus on sport, their reach and impact extend far beyond.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have also delivered an election commitment to enhance the space at Melville Community Men's Shed. Led by President Quentin Wilson, the Melville Community Men's Shed is an opportunity for fellowship, support and collaboration. The Rhein-Donau Club and president Steve Schlegel help the community enjoy the culture, music and food of the countries Germany, Austria and Switzerland.

        communities is much needed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The WA Multicultural Lions Club was one of the many recipients of this year's $10 million 2023-24 volunteer grant rounds, receiving funding to support volunteers. In Tangney, 33 local volunteer-run community nonprofits each received a grant. Others were organisations such as playgroups and seniors groups and sporting clubs such as Riverton Football Club, organised by Luke McCorkell. Tangney is full of clubs and organisations that are led by volunteers. I would love to mention each and every organisation in Tangney, but unfortunately this speech is really limited to just five minutes, and I would need much, much more time to name them all.
       </p>
       <p>
        With the cost of living impacting many Australians, volunteer-run groups are the fabric of our community. We are fortunate to have such dedicated community leaders who have a passion for making our Tangney community better and stronger every day. I give my heartfelt thanks to everyone who makes a difference in our community. Thank you to all the volunteers and community leaders in Tangney; thank you very much.
