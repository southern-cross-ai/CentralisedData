       <p>
        As we stand on the cusp of a new A-league season, I think it is important to acknowledge that the world game goes from strength to strength, and that strength is built on the wonderful work of our local clubs, who have just finished the season. These local clubs—Loganholme football club, Ormeau All Stars Football Club, Park Ridge Panthers and Bethania Rams—with over 1,500 players, are a cornerstone of our football community. They are part of a growing football family which has reached nearly $1.2 million players in 2015, with over 100,000 of those players being young girls and women. When you include the volunteers, referees, coaches and managers, the number of people involved in football is nearly two million, making it the largest participation sport in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank all of those players, coaches, managers and volunteers for the terrific work that they do during the season to make these clubs the success they are, and the strength that they provide in our community. I would also like to wish all the teams and participants in the new A-league season every success as we look forward to a terrific season of professional football built on the foundation of terrific local football clubs.
