        Men's Shed. 10 years ago,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Wheeler" rel="nofollow">

        and other local community members came to me with an idea to start a men's shed in Mount Gravatt. Now I'm happy to say that the Mount Gravatt Men's Shed has grown to over 360 active members and is a very important part of our community. From building chairs and tables for community groups to fixing lawnmowers and fences and restoring old machinery, the Mount Gravatt Men's Shed is the perfect example of how community supporting community makes a difference. It's so much more than just a simple workshop; it's a sanctuary. Crafted out of old-fashioned mateship, men's sheds provide a safe, welcoming space for men to come together, chat and engage in meaningful connections.

        We all know men are less likely to talk about emotions and their struggles or to ask for help when they need it most. That's why men's sheds are so important. They bring together individuals who might otherwise feel lost or disconnected, providing them with a sense of purpose and belonging. This helps to combat social isolation, depression and other mental health challenges that men just don't want to talk about. With seven men committing suicide every day across Australia, we all must and need to make sure that institutions like men's sheds are supported, are well funded and continue to grow. I'd like to thank everyone who has contributed to the success of men's sheds across Australia. Thank you very much.
