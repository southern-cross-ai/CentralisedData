        I wish to advocate for more research funding on behalf of the Cyber Security Cooperative Research Centre based at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edith_Cowan_University" rel="nofollow">
         Edith Cowan University
        </a>
        in my electorate, which is one of the foremost new centres for cybersecurity research and capacity building. I commend the work of the vice-chancellor,

        The growth in popularity of cloud based services, personal mobile devices and social networking sites has resulted in an increased exposure to high levels of security threats. The Cyber Security CRC is part of the work of key government, industry and research groups to strengthen systems and networks, training the next generation of cybersecurity specialists. Ultimately, this will have benefits for the community, which will enjoy an online experience that is more secure.

        Adequate resourcing of the CRC is required in order to focus on building three key areas of capability: firstly, ensuring the security of critical infrastructure by developing new approaches, tools and techniques to predict, prevent, detect and respond to cyberthreats from nation-states, criminals and other individuals; secondly, ensuring industry, small enterprises and the community can access online services with confidence, which will also grow Australia's reputation as a safe and trusted place to do business and access cyberspace; and thirdly, to build and develop the next generation of industry, government and research cybersecurity leaders.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last year, the federal government named ECU as one of two academic centres of excellence, with initial funding of $1 million. However, more resources and funding are required in order to develop world-class knowledge and expertise in Joondalup. I make the case for more substantial investment by the federal government in research and development at Edith Cowan University. I look forward to working closely with the Minister for Jobs and Innovation to ensure that the Edith Cowan University remains well resourced.
