       <p>
        I rise to acknowledge the passing of Michael Coffey
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        on 11 January 2021. Mr Coffey was President of Liverpool Catholic Club for more than four years and had been on the board for over 17 years. The Liverpool Catholic Club has provided support for the community for over 50 years and currently supports over 13 sporting and community groups, with significant funding and facilities and other logistics support.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Coffey was awarded an OAM in 2015 for services to business and commerce and to the community at large. Michael also served on the board of Karitane. Michael's experience with his fellow Liverpool Catholic Club directors has seen the club's facilities grow. It now boasts new family-friendly entertainment facilities, indoor play equipment and a four-star motel. He was instrumental in bringing the New South Wales Senior Open golf championships to Thurgoona Country Club Resort, which is amalgamated with Liverpool Catholic Club. On a personal level, Michael always made me welcome at events I attended at the club. He was willing to discuss issues and solutions for our community. I know he will be sorely missed by board members of the Catholic club and the wider community, but his loss is most keenly felt by his family. I send my deepest condolences to his wife, Trudy, and his children and grandchildren.
