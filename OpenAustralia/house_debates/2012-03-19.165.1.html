        I rise today to commend and congratulate some residents of Hasluck who have been recognised recently for their achievements and benevolence in their local community. I feel that this is an important thing for us as parliamentarians to do when we can so that the community can be inspired by these efforts and maybe use them as a catalyst to make their own contribution to volunteering in their local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first I would like to mention is not an individual but a collective of dedicated people in the north of Hasluck. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Swan Valley
        </a>
        Visitor Centre was recently awarded the silver medal at the 2011 Qantas Australian Tourism Awards. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Swan" rel="nofollow">
         City of Swan
        </a>
        mayor, Charlie Zannino, was quoted in a newspaper article from
        <i>
         Midland-Kalamunda Reporter
        </i>
        as saying, 'There are 600 visitor centres in Australia, so being recognised in the top two is an amazing achievement.' The Swan Valley is a beautiful part of Hasluck and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        and is home to numerous tourist attractions, such as parks, rapids, wineries and heritage listed buildings. I am proud to have a section of the Swan Valley in the electorate of Hasluck and even prouder that the Swan Valley Visitor Centre was recognised in this manner.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the south of Hasluck, I would like to recognise the dedication that Gosnells resident Patricia Best displays when promoting understanding about epilepsy in the community. Patricia has epilepsy and a visual impairment. Despite this, she runs the Gosnells Epilepsy Support Group, which has expanded in numbers and distributes important information to sufferers while offering a place to come and talk about their experiences. Her work was recognised by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Districts" rel="nofollow">
         Southern Districts
        </a>
        , which has awarded her a Shine On Award for community service by a person with a disability. This is an amazing achievement and Patricia's example should act as a beacon to others that, when faced with adversity or a disability, hard work and selflessness can help you to lead a positive and rewarding life. I acknowledge Patricia's amazing efforts to help others.
       </p>
       <p>
        To the east of Hasluck, I would like to congratulate two people I have had a lot to do with since my time in office: Terry and Carmela Izzard. The husband-and-wife duo are never short of an opinion on how we as parliamentarians can improve people's lives in Western Australia. Whilst they talk the talk, they also certainly walk the talk. They have been recognised in the
        <i>
         Hills Gazette
        </i>
        for their 'shining example' to others with their volunteering efforts within the local community. I wish them well in this year's 2012 Volunteering WA awards.
       </p>

        ,a fantastic young man named Aaron Hurst, who is just 16, was featured for winning the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Scout_Award" rel="nofollow">
         Queen's Scout Award
        </a>
        . His dedication to the Kalamunda Venturers saw him start his qualifying course in 2010 and he completed it a full year ahead of schedule. This is a remarkable achievement and Aaron's efforts should be held up to the community as a positive example of our young people. Congratulations on your achievement, Aaron.
