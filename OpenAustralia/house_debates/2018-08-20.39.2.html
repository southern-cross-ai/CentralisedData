       <p>
        The spirit of my electorate shone brightly this weekend as the Launceston Tornadoes battled it out on the national stage in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_East_Australian_Basketball_League" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        grand final at the State Basketball Centre in Melbourne. As the only semiprofessional basketball team in northern Tasmania, the Tornadoes are well loved in my community, enjoying the support of local businesses and with a media and fan following that many sporting clubs would indeed envy. It is a common occurrence on a Saturday night in Launceston to have 1,000 or more Tornadoes fans descend on the

        to cheer on their team.
       </p>
       <p>
        The players, coaches, administrators, fans and sponsors past and present should be congratulated on the hard work that went into the 2018 season. The Torns have had a season of ups and downs, with the loss of

        import Mikaela Ruef to injury before the start of the season compounded by defeat in the first three games. However, under the guidance of the new coach, Derrick Washington, the team have rediscovered their winning ways and were able to fight their way to the championship decider and the chance to win their first

        title since 1995. Unfortunately, the game on Saturday night against the

        did not go their way, despite a hard-fought effort from the team.
       </p>
       <p>
        I once again congratulate the Launceston Tornadoes. I congratulate the Bendigo winners and look forward to seeing what the 2019 season brings.
