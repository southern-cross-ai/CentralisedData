        My question is to the Prime Minister.

       <p>
        It's hard to see why employers would keep paying parental leave if it meant the government stopped paying.
       </p>
       <p>
        So why is the Prime Minister undermining paid parental leave, when he has been telling Australians for some years how much he is committed to it? And, by the way, why does the wannabe Treasurer keep accusing mums of being rorters on Sky News?

          Of course I support paid parental leave, but it has got to be the right paid parental leave at the right time. That is what it has got to be: the right paid parental leave at the right time. And the first priority right now has got to be to build jobs, to build opportunity, to promote economic growth—and I was told by many people, including, it has to be said, by members opposite, that the priority right now has got to be a better childcare system. And that is exactly what this government will deliver tonight: a Jobs for Families childcare system.
         </p>
         <p>
          The great thing about the childcare proposal that this government is bringing down as part of this budget is that, if you are a low- or middle-income family with children in the childcare system, you will be better off to the tune of $30 a week. That is working families benefiting to the tune of $30 a week.

           <p>
            And, of course, as I am reminded by the Leader of the House, there is no carbon tax and no mining tax, much less regulation. We are a country that is open for business because we have three historic free trade agreements with our three biggest customers, China, Japan and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" rel="nofollow">
             South Korea
            </a>
            —all of which spells more jobs. It all spells more jobs.
           </p>
           <p>
            This is a government which has to make choices. This is a government which has to decide what our most urgent priorities are for this time. I have to say our most urgent priority when it comes to benefits for families is an improved childcare system as part of our Jobs for Families package. This is not just good policy for families, although it certainly is good policy for families; it is strong economic policy. That is what it is. It will contribute to the strong and prosperous economy that ultimately is the best thing that governments can give to the people of our country.
