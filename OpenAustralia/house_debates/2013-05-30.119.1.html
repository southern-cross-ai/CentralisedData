        Many residents of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Melbourne" rel="nofollow">
         Port Melbourne
        </a>
        are quite rightly concerned about the proposed high-rise development known as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfront_Place" rel="nofollow">
         Waterfront Place
        </a>
        . The proposal from property developer
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCNA" rel="nofollow">
         BCNA
        </a>
        is to build residential buildings of five, 10 and 19 storeys on the site, removing existing restrictions in this area which currently require any development to be no more than five storeys high and predominantly for community use.

        determined the plan was not satisfactory, but it is my understanding that the developers applied to the

         Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal
        </a>
        to make changes to the plan to allow them to proceed. Although there is no date set for the hearing, I believe it will be soon. I am concerned about the breach of the original Mirvac arrangements for this site and the detrimental effect that this inappropriate high-rise will have on our local community. This area was always planned to be low-rise and a gateway to the port, particularly for the cruise shipping industry, which regularly uses the port with ships such as the

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The amenity issues such as traffic and congestion caused by such a development would choke this area should it go ahead. Because of the adverse effects that this development could have on the operations of port facilities, I have written to the federal Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, the Hon.

         Anthony Albanese
        </a>
        , regarding my concern about the impact that such a development would have on shipping and asking how the federal government can assist the local community by removing potential negative impacts of this development on local amenities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Further, I have written to the state Minister for Planning, the would-be Premier, the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Guy" rel="nofollow">
         Matthew Guy
        </a>
        , calling on him to stop sitting on his hands and to help the community to support Melbourne and

        by preventing such inappropriate development, which not only impacts on the living standards of local residents but also has the potential to hinder effective operation of crucial tourism and the cruise shipping business. It is crucial for the local area and for Victoria that we keep Port Melbourne gateways open, for the benefit of residents and local industry alike. The Kuwaiti royal family's sovereign wealth fund paid too much for this andâ€”
