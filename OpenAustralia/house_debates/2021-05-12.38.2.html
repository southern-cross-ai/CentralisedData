        I want to send my best wishes to everybody at the end at the holy month of Ramadan for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eid_Mubarak" rel="nofollow">
         Eid Mubarak
        </a>
        , for Eid early tomorrow morning, which we won't be able to be at because parliament is sitting. There has been a cloud over the entire period of Ramadan with COVID, in the sense that people haven't been able to gather at the large iftars as they would like to.

        , one of the holiest places in the Islamic faith during their holiest month of the year, has been chilling. People often say, 'Do you condemn all acts of violence?' Of course we do, but let's not pretend the escalation didn't come from somewhere. The escalation we've seen is directly connected to the settlement movement, innocently called 'the settlements'. We're talking about people being evicted from their homes, as they were at
