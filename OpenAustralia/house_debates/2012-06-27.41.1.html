       <p>
        Because there appears to be a little bit of table talk between the Leader of the House and the Manager of Opposition Business about who gave notice to whom and when it was given, I should probably put it on record here that I spoke to the Prime Minister's office shortly after one o'clock today. I was not able to speak directly to the Prime Minister because she was apparently in a meeting that could not be interrupted but I nevertheless paid the government the courtesy of informing the Prime Minister via her chief of staff that I would be seeking to move in the parliament today the legislation which is the subject of the suspension of standing orders—the Migration Legislation Amendment (The Bali Process) Bill 2012. I want the Australian parliament and the people to understand that, at least on the coalition side, there was no disrespect or discourtesy to the government. The Prime Minister, who has been seeking talks, did get a phone call from me. Unfortunately she was unable to take it—but, nevertheless, I did ask her chief of staff to indicate to the Prime Minister that we would be moving this way to provide a firm legislative basis for a stronger policy response.
