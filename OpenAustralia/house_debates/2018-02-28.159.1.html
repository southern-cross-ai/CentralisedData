       <p>
        At the outset, I thank the opposition for engaging constructively with the government on this bill and these government amendments. The proposed amendments on sheet KN135 will modify schedule 3 in the bill to align it with the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Misuse of Market Power) Act 2017. As introduced, the bill contained two sets of consequential amendments to part
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XIB" rel="nofollow">
         XIB
        </a>
        of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 that were contingent on the commencement of the misuse of market power act. This was because, when the misuse of market power act was introduced as a bill into parliament, it proposed to amend the same provisions in part XIB as this bill. As the timing of the passage of the bills was uncertain, contingent amendments were included in the bill to address different timing scenarios.
       </p>
       <p>
        The misuse of market power act was enacted in August 2017, with amendments such that it does not amend the same provisions in part XIB. As a result, the relevant consequential amendments in the bill are no longer contingent on the misuse of market power act. The amendments reflect the original intention of the bill to be aligned with the misuse of market power act.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposed amendment on sheet KN136 will remove schedule 2 from the bill. As introduced, schedule 2 streamlined two separate and distinct frameworks for the broadcasting complaints-handling and investigation functions of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Communications_and_Media_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Communications and Media Authority
        </a>
        , or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACMA" rel="nofollow">
         ACMA
        </a>
        , under the Broadcasting Services Act. Due to a recent Federal Court decision, the complaints-handling framework was found to unnecessarily duplicate the investigation framework. As a result, the government considered the complaints-handling framework redundant, and schedule 2 would have repealed the framework. The schedule also introduced minor consequential amendments to create a combined complaints-handling and investigation framework, which better reflected ACMA's current complaints-handling procedures.
       </p>
       <p>
        A number of members of the broadcasting industry expressed concerns with the amendments contained in schedule 2. The opposition has also indicated concerns with this schedule. In order to not delay other, non-controversial, reform measures, the decision has been made to remove schedule 2 to the bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposed amendment on sheet GX170 will correct a provision of the Radiocommunications Taxes Collection Act 1983, which was inserted by the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Broadcasting Reform) Act 2017. The provision entitles a person to a pro rata refund of tax imposed on the issue of the transmitter licence if particular criteria are met. The intention is that the pro rata refund only apply to tax on transmitter licences paid in the financial year ending on 30 June 2017. However, this intention is not properly reflected in the provision and, if unamended, could result in higher payments to some commercial broadcasters than was intended. As such, the amendment will ensure that the provision operates as intended.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, the proposed amendment on sheet GX 170 will replace
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Rivers" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Rivers
        </a>
        Television Pty Ltd with Network Investments Pty Ltd as a specified company eligible for receive a transitional support payment under the broadcasting reform act. This payment supports commercial broadcasters in transitioning from commercial broadcasting licence fees to the new spectrum tax. To be eligible for payment, recipients must hold a commercial television or radio broadcasting licence. However, on 1 June 2017, after the introduction of the relevant legislation, Northern Rivers transferred its commercial television broadcasting licence and assets to Network Investments, making it ineligible. The government was only made aware of this transfer after passage of the relevant legislation. The amendment will specify Network Investments Pty Ltd as an eligible company. This recognises that Network Investments held the relevant licence at the time of the passage of the broadcasting reform act and will ensure that it receives a transitional support payment to support the relevant broadcasting licence as intended. I commend the amendments to the House.
