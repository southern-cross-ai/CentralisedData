        I rise today to support this motion of condolence for Private Benjamin Ranaudo, a proud member of Townsville’s 1st Battalion,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Regiment
        </a>
        , who was tragically killed in action on 18 July 2009 while serving with the second Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force in Afghanistan.
       </p>
       <p>
        I believe there is no greater sacrifice than to give one’s life in the service of one’s country. Like all Australians, I am deeply saddened by the loss of Private Ranaudo, who fought so bravely on behalf of a grateful nation. At only 22 years of age, Private Ranaudo showed a maturity far beyond his years and upheld the values and ethos of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        to the last.
       </p>
       <p>
        Private Ranaudo was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Service_Medal" rel="nofollow">

        Medal, the East Timor Solidarity Medal and the Infantry Combat Badge. While Benjamin’s death reminds us all of the dangers of military life and the fragility of our own being, his actions will ensure that his memory will live on in the hearts of his family and friends. May I say I believe that that memory will be as strong as the character he demonstrated while soldiering in the worst of environments.

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … a professional soldier who served enthusiastically and with distinction. His career record speaks to a young man, very well trained, with an extraordinary array of completed courses. Benjamin was clearly dedicated to his career as a soldier and committed to the profession of arms. He died ensuring that terrorist groups do not have Afghanistan as a base from which they can plan and mount attacks.
       </p>
       <p>
        I stand here today to give my condolences to Private Ranaudo’s family and to pay tribute to the service and, ultimately, the life given by their courageous son. I say to them that I hope they can take comfort in knowing that the thoughts and prayers of all Australians are with them during these very difficult times.
       </p>
       <p>
        I recently had the honour of meeting Private Ranaudo’s family and expressing these sentiments personally. This occurred at the repatriation service for Private Ranaudo, which was held in Melbourne on 26 July 2009. I was truly humbled to stand with Private Ranaudo’s mother, Jennifer; his father, Angelo; his stepfather, Terry; his sisters, Hayley and Melissa; his brothers, Phillip and Terry; and his girlfriend, Haylee, as their son, brother and friend was returned to Australian soil. As I stood on the runway at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalon_Airport" rel="nofollow">
         Avalon Airport
        </a>
        and witnessed the return of a soldier, son and friend I felt a mixture of relief as this fine young man returned home and absolute sadness as I watched Private Ranaudo’s family try to come to terms with their sudden and devastating loss.
       </p>
       <p>
        Along with the Minister for Defence, Senator John Faulkner, I stood behind the family as the rear door of the C17 dropped. I shared their grief, for there was the casket carrying Private Benjamin Ranaudo covered in his flag, the Australian flag. The cargo bay of the C17 was partitioned off by a huge Australian flag proudly showing the stars of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Southern Cross
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I said to Terry that that flag is Private Ranaudo and that, ‘every time you see an Australian flag it should remind you of Benjamin’. It should remind you of his commitment, his courage and his sacrifice. But most of all it should remind you that we as a nation honour our fallen heroes. Although I was deeply saddened on the day, I can honestly say that the loss fell by Private Ranaudo’s family, although unmeasurable, would easily surpass that of an entire nation. Yet the entire nation stands with Private Ranaudo’s family in paying their respects for the service he gave to his nation and, ultimately, the sacrifice he made in the name of all Australians. There was a profound sense of loss that day, but as tragic as the event was for the entire family of Private Ranaudo, I would like to reassure them, as well as his friends and comrades, that his death was not in vain; in fact, it was honourable. History will remind us that his name sits alongside those of fallen brothers from years gone by.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the things that moved me at the repatriation service was a poem on the order of service, and I would like to repeat it to you. It was written by Private Gary McMahon, 6
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAR" rel="nofollow">
         RAR
        </a>
        , Vietnam. It reads:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We would do anything for a mate, anything except leave him on the battlefield. We shared our last drops of water, or our last cigarette. We patrolled together, we slept together, we laughed together, we fought together. We even died together.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to take this opportunity to pass on my appreciation and support to Private
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Warren" rel="nofollow">
         Paul Warren
        </a>
        , the soldier injured in the same bomb blast that took Private Ranaudo’s life. It is my understanding that Private Warren has now arrived back in Australia, after receiving medical care in Germany, and that he is undergoing rehabilitation following his injuries, which include the loss of his right leg above the knee. Private Warren is another dedicated soldier who has put his life on the line every time he has stepped outside the confines of the base. Although he was lucky to survive the bomb blast, his life has been forever changed. Now is an appropriate time to pause, to take a moment to reflect on those soldiers who have been injured in the line of duty and who now live with the daily reminder of the hardships of war.
       </p>
       <p>
        In our enduring effort in Afghanistan, there is no doubt that improvised explosive devices are the most sinister threat facing our troops. They are indiscriminate, difficult to detect and deadly. When they do not kill, they maim horribly and leave the victim permanently disabled. Those terrorist groups that employ improvised explosive devices are desperate, cowardly and will as easily target product civilians as they do armed soldiers. We were reminded of these dangerous conditions as recently as last week, when Australian troops encountered four roadside bomb attacks in just two days, ultimately resulting in the wounding of three soldiers. But the advantage that our soldiers have—in addition to their excellent training, discipline and world-class equipment—is the support they can expect from their families, their friends, their colleagues and their nation in their time of greatest need. I am reassured at this point by reading that Private Warren is getting the support he needs from his family, his mates and his fellow soldiers. I believe that his recovery can in no small part be attributed to the supportive environment he now finds himself in. I would like to wish Private Warren a speedy recovery and, further, to thank his family, friends and colleagues for the support and time they have given freely to help Private Warren recover from his injuries.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I stand here in this parliament and mark the loss of our eleventh Australian soldier to be killed during operations in Afghanistan, it is fitting to ask all Australians, without regard to their political persuasion or ideological beliefs, to continue to support our troops. Our soldiers serve in some of the most dangerous and unforgiving environments, and while they are sent into harm’s way by the government of the day, they themselves have elected to give their lives in support of a nation they dearly love. It is for this latter reason that all Australians should get behind our troops and offer their support and heartfelt appreciation for the often thankless job they undertake on a daily basis.
       </p>
       <p>
        In calling for the support of all Australians, I wish to acknowledge the great level of admiration and appreciation that is already present in our community. This was shown during the welcome home parade that was held in Darwin last Saturday for some 1,200 troops returning from Afghanistan, Iraq and East Timor. Again, I was fortunate enough to represent the opposition at this parade alongside the Minister for Defence Personnel, Materiel and Science,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Combet" rel="nofollow">
         Greg Combet
        </a>
        . I witnessed the support our troops received. You only needed to look down the main street of Darwin, which was lined with people standing shoulder to shoulder and layers deep, to truly appreciate the community’s gratitude for the troops’ service.
       </p>
       <p>
        Indeed, the pride of the nation was on show as these returned troops marched down the street with their heads held high, to the unrelenting sound of applause. Each and every soldier marched proudly. Their eyes steely on the long, hard fight yet, at the same time, filled with an almost palpable sense of pride and accomplishment. They marched proudly, having returned from war, but they also marched knowing that some of their mates had not returned.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of those who did not return with his comrades was Corporal Mathew Hopkins, who was killed in action on 16 March 2009. Corporal Hopkins was a member of the Darwin based 7th Battalion. To mark his loss, and as a reminder that we never forget, a riderless horse with boots facing rear formed part of the welcome home parade. After the parade I had the opportunity to meet again with Corporal Hopkins’s wife, Victoria, and their growing son, Alexander. Although the pain of the loss was still clearly evident, again I was humbled to see the amount of support afforded by those close to the family and, to quote Victoria, to Alex from his ‘army uncles’ as they supported him there.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to conclude today by reiterating the words of Lieutenant General Ken Gillespie,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Chief of Army
        </a>
        , who said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Private Ranaudo died while serving his nation, and his sacrifice will never be forgotten. This loss is felt heavily by the wider defence community, and particularly by members of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Army
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Lieutenant General Gillespie’s remarks ring true in my heart and the hearts of all serving and retired ADF members. Indeed, Private Ranaudo’s death will not have been in vain as long as we continue to show resolve in securing Afghanistan free from violence, terrorism and extreme ideologies.
       </p>
       <p>
        These sad times give us an opportunity to reflect on the peril that our serving men and women face every day while serving in places like Afghanistan. It also gives us time to thank those men and women for their hard work and sacrifice. Private Ranaudo made the ultimate sacrifice for his country, a sacrifice that will not be forgotten and one that time will prove to be in the interests of his beloved country.
       </p>
       <p>
        To Private Ranaudo, I say: thank you for your sacrifice and bravery. I join with a mournful nation in expressing my condolences to his family. Private Ranaudo has joined the ranks of those who have given their lives in Afghanistan: Sergeant Andrew Russell, Trooper David Pearce, Sergeant Matthew Locke, Private Luke Worsely, Lance Corporal Jason Marks, Signaller Sean McCarthy, Lieutenant Michael Fussell, Private Gregory Michael Sher, Corporal Mathew Hopkins, Sergeant Brett Till and Private Benjamin Ranaudo.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Ferguson" rel="nofollow">

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Remember this:

        It is the soldier who makes all of this possible, day after day after day.

        <p>
         I rise also to speak about the tragic death of Private Benjamin Ranaudo, killed in action on 18 July this year. Private Ranaudo died while deployed on
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Slipper" rel="nofollow">
          Operation Slipper
         </a>
         , serving Australia in Afghanistan. I would like to extend my personal and sincere condolences to the family of Private Ranaudo—his mother Jennifer, his father Angelo, his brothers and sisters and his girlfriend, Haylee McCarthy. All of our thoughts and deep sympathies are with his family and Haylee, and with those who served with him in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         , during this very difficult time. I had the honour of attending Private Ranaudo’s funeral on 31 July at Boyd Chapel at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springvale_Botanical_Cemetery" rel="nofollow">
          Springvale Botanical Cemetery
         </a>
         in Melbourne. The service that paid tribute to Private Ranaudo was solemn and very moving.
        </p>
        <p>
         Benjamin Ranaudo served in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Army
         </a>
         for three years and during this time he served on active duty in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
          East Timor
         </a>
         before deploying to Afghanistan with the Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force. Private Ranaudo deployed as a member of the Townsville based 1st Battalion,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
          Royal Australian Regiment
         </a>
         . He was assigned to a force protection combat team as part of the Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force 2. Focused on ensuring safety, the MRTF2 has been working closely with coalition partners in Afghanistan and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_National_Security_Forces" rel="nofollow">
          Afghan National Security Forces
         </a>
         in the lead-up to the election in Afghanistan this month.
        </p>
        <p>
         Private Ranaudo was only 22 years of age. He was tragically killed when an antipersonnel explosive device detonated during a cordon and search operation in the Baluchi Valley 25 kilometres north of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarin_Kowt" rel="nofollow">
          Tarin Kowt
         </a>
         . Private Ranaudo’s death is a very sad and tragic reminder of the dangers that our deployed soldiers face while serving their country in Afghanistan.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is important for us to reinforce our continued focus on our goal to restore security and stability to Afghanistan.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oruzgan_Province" rel="nofollow">
          Oruzgan Province
         </a>
         , where we operate, is an environmentally challenging area and we are facing an enemy that is ruthless and determined. Despite these challenges, we are making progress in this theatre. We are disrupting and limiting the ability of Taliban insurgents to operate in the area and, together with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Afghan_National_Army" rel="nofollow">
          Afghan National Army
         </a>
         , we are providing security to local civilians so that they can rebuild and move forward in a stable and secure environment. In addition to security operations against Taliban-led insurgents, the Australian Defence Force continues to make a very significant contribution to improving infrastructure and Afghan government services in Oruzgan Province.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is those goals that we as a nation must remain focused on in this time of tragedy. For us to honour those who have died in Afghanistan, we must stay very focused on the goals, the purpose of our mission in Afghanistan and our commitment to restore both stability and security to that nation.
        </p>

         The tragic death of Private Benjamin Ranaudo brings the total number of Australian fatalities in Afghanistan to 11. At this time it is extremely important to reflect on the courage and commitment that each of them have shown in serving this country. To all those currently serving in Afghanistan, on behalf of the government in my capacity as a minister within the portfolio, I want to thank all of them for their extraordinary service and commend all of them for representing their country with such professionalism and courage.

          This is a story about a country, our country Australia, and what our values are and where we sit in the world. It is a story about the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Defence Force
          </a>
          , its people and its families and the loyalty that they show to one another. It is a story about a garrison city, Townsville, where soldiers and their families live and work and relate to the ordinary citizens of that city. It is a story about a battalion, 1st Battalion,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
           Royal Australian Regiment
          </a>
          , the ‘Big Blue One’, and the ethics and the professionalism of the men and women who serve in that battalion. It is a story about a private, Ben Ranaudo, who served in the 1st Battalion, and his contribution to our country.
         </p>
         <p>
          I have been very privileged in representing the garrison city for so many years now in the Australian parliament. And I have been very close to the Australian Defence Force and I think I understand their views and their ethics and how they work. When the news came through that Ben had lost his life in Afghanistan, my community was very visibly touched—not just ADF people but mums and dads, and kids going to high school. They all felt it. They genuinely felt the loss of this private. That is what the ADF and the families and the garrison city are about. People genuinely felt the sense of loss. Ben’s family can know and understand that that loss is felt in the community.
         </p>
         <p>
          Recently—last week—there was a story about Ben’s battalion which came to my notice. A corporal who has been a corporal for as long as anyone can remember, Corporal Renahan, sent out this excited email across the network—and I am on the email list, because I know him quite well—saying: ‘Today, would you believe, I’ve been promoted to sergeant. I don’t believe it.’ Within a couple of hours, back came some emails. Yes, they came back from his mates in the battalion, but they also came back from General Mark Kelly and General John Caligari, senior leaders of the ADF who genuinely congratulated Reno for being promoted. But the point of the story is that that is the ADF family. You can be a person at this or that level of rank, but everybody respects each other and everybody shares in successes and of course in pain. That is our Australian Defence Force. Long may it continue.
         </p>
         <p>
          Ben knew why he was in Afghanistan. He knew that Australia and the other nations that contribute to
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISAF" rel="nofollow">
           ISAF
          </a>
          understand that if we do not face up to terrorism it will just get worse tomorrow and next year. He did not die in vain. His family should understand that, and I think that they do.
         </p>
         <p>
          We have been very lucky, through the professionalism and training of our ADF members, that we have not lost more. Other defence forces have in fact had significantly higher casualty rates. One of the things that helps protect us is our wonderful Bushmasters. They have very much saved lives. The v-shaped design of the underneath of the vehicle deflects blasts. Because of that, you can have the front wheels blown off and ending up 100 metres away, but the people inside remain safer than they would otherwise remain. They have been a very good acquisition for the Australian Defence Force. As soon as we can get some more, they should be provided to other elements—the special operations task group, for example—who could well use Bushmasters where they have not used them previously.
         </p>
         <p>
          The
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IED" rel="nofollow">
           IED
          </a>
          s that we talk about are getting more insidious. We are now seeing these terrorists make these things out of materials that you cannot detect with magnetic detectors. They are being made out of materials that are virtually undetectable. That is a very insidious development. But it just reinforces Australia’s view that we have to defeat these people and that we have to help the people of Afghanistan. I heard a statistic last night about the number of girls going to school in Afghanistan now. Before we entered, most girls were illiterate. They were not allowed to go to school. There are now some five million girls going to school in Afghanistan, which is a wonderful outcome for the people of that country. Long may that continue.
         </p>
         <p>
          Two weeks ago, Deputy Speaker Washer, you and I were in Mongolia. Mongolia is a relatively remote place, but you and I were there. We met the Prime Minister, who very proudly told us that the cabinet had just made a decision to send a battalion to Afghanistan to do their bit. Mongolia is a small country. It is only the size of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Western Australia
          </a>
          . It is relatively small. Its infrastructure is not good. But that country recognises its obligations to the world and is fulfilling those obligations. Their contribution is certainly very well and very gratefully accepted.
         </p>
         <p>
          I can assure Ben’s family that the people of Townsville, the people of the 1st Battalion and the men and women of the ADF will not forget Ben. His contribution was not in vain. We thank him for his life and we thank him for what he has done for our country and the world in helping to produce a better and more secure outcome for the world. May he rest in peace.

          <p>
           It is a privilege to follow my friend the member for Herbert on this condolence motion. He has the great privilege of having the 1st Battalion,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
            Royal Australian Regiment
           </a>
           , in his electorate and I know he appreciates that great privilege. Private Ranaudo has now become a part of the wonderful story of that battalion. It has an incredibly proud history. I am very privileged myself to have been a part of that history, having served with the 1st Battalion in Somalia. I know that battalion operates, exists, trains and survives as a family. I echo the comments of the member for Herbert. They will no doubt feel this loss as a family would and treat it accordingly. They will wrap around each other to help each other, and the family, through this. They will incorporate the contribution of Private Ranaudo into the wonderful history of that battalion.
          </p>
          <p>
           Private Ranaudo was a young man, at the age of 22. He obviously had so much more to give in life. There is a famous old poem that talks about one crowded hour of glorious life being worth an age without a name. Private Ranaudo I think illustrates that. It was a short life, but it was definitely a crowded hour and a glorious hour that he graced us with his presence on this planet. He was a character who was full of the joy of life. You can see that absolutely beaming out at you from the photographs of Ben. Certainly that is what his colleagues from the unit will tell you. He contributed greatly to the esprit of the battalion, and that element—the camaraderie and the mutual contribution that each member of that organic family brings to the table—is as important to the effectiveness of a battalion as the equipment with which it goes to war. Private Ranaudo was in the forefront of contributing that esprit and that effectiveness in his unit. He made a great contribution to our effort in Afghanistan as part of the Mentoring and Reconstruction Taskforce.
          </p>
          <p>
           Our focus in Afghanistan has become building local capacity to enable us to eventually depart from Afghanistan but importantly also creating the conditions for that departure in building the ability of the Afghan people and the Afghan security forces to take responsibility for their own security. Private Ranaudo helped advance that cause, in bringing that capacity and security to the people of Afghanistan. We have heard reference to the fact that in three years, in his crowded time, he managed to serve in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
            East Timor
           </a>
           and Afghanistan. To demonstrate the initiative and drive of this individual, he was accomplished in a large number of courses. He was a self-motivated, self-starting individual, the type of person we prize so much in the Defence Force. He lost his life on 18 July 2009 in an improvised explosive device incident in a cordon and search operation in the Baluchi Valley, which is about 25 kilometres north of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarin_Kowt" rel="nofollow">
            Tarin Kowt
           </a>
           . That illustrates the ongoing threat we face from
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IED" rel="nofollow">
            IED
           </a>
           s, as has been mentioned. This really is a focus for this government.
          </p>
          <p>
           We are intent on leaving no stone unturned. We are intent on delivering the equipment, improving the tactics, techniques and procedures of our ADF to deal with this threat and making the operations of our troops as safe as possible. We will reach out to any country, any friend, any ally, to achieve best practice in dealing with this issue. It is now becoming a question of facing not only the technical challenge of improvised ordnance but also the more sophisticated tactics of the enemy. I was at a briefing just the other day at Headquarters Joint Operations Command where they were deconstructing the casualties the British have recently suffered. They, tragically, lost about 15 soldiers in a period of just 10 days. An initial incident involving improvised explosive devices and causing casualties was made much worse, was amplified, by the fact that the enemy, the Taliban, had factored in how the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISAF" rel="nofollow">
            ISAF
           </a>
           personnel would respond to that incident and had configured IED placements accordingly, which of course resulted in much more severe casualties. So we are facing a sophisticated enemy. We must compare notes and develop, as far as we possibly can, tactics, techniques and procedures to counter the methods by which the enemy employs these devices.
          </p>
          <p>
           I should also emphasise that in the same incident where Private Ranaudo lost his life we also suffered the casualty of another private soldier,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Warren" rel="nofollow">
            Paul Warren
           </a>
           , who has subsequently lost his right leg above the knee from that incident. Of course, Private Ranaudo lost his battle and has moved on, but the battle will continue for Private Paul Warren and his family. It will require great courage and strength for him to move forward and recreate and reconstruct his life with the disability that he now faces. I know that he has that courage and strength and he is well supported by his wonderful family.
          </p>
          <p>
           We should also remember that, on top of the 11 fatalities that we have suffered in Afghanistan, there have also been 78 wounded. We should not forget that and we should also salute the service of these individuals who are going to be living with the legacy of their service in Afghanistan for the rest of their lives. Whatever help the community and the government can provide to these individuals should be provided. We thank them for their sacrifice and service as much as we thank those who have lost their lives. I also thank the Dutch medical team in Afghanistan who rendered service to our personnel, the American medical team in Germany and, of course, and in particular, the colleagues of Private Ranaudo and Private Warren who rendered such life-saving emergency assistance on the spot of the incident.
          </p>
          <p>
           I was also deeply impressed by the fact that at the funeral of Private Ranaudo, Felix Sher, the father of Private Greg Sher, attended to render what comfort and support he could to the family of Private Ranaudo. It shows what a wonderful family they are. I continue to be incredibly impressed by the way they support our men and women in the ADF and the support they have provided to their fellow sufferers in the losses that they endure. It emphasises that, if they can maintain that strength in the face of the direct loss and suffering that they have endured, how much more so should we maintain the course, stay the course, and continue to endure in the face of these losses in order to achieve success and honour the memory of these brave soldiers.
          </p>
          <p>
           Today we will be talking about
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Kenna" rel="nofollow">
            Ted Kenna
           </a>
           . I look back at that great generation who fought in World War
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
            II
           </a>
           , and it is interesting to note that we suffered nearly 40,000 fatalities in the course of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" rel="nofollow">
            World War II
           </a>
           over a long period of nearly six years. That generation bore that struggle, that sacrifice and that suffering and delivered us from one of the greatest, most malevolent forces of evil the world has ever seen. Today, of course, we are confronted with a similar long-running, enduring task against a similarly malevolent and evil force. No-one should be under any misapprehension about what we face with these Islamic extremists. In no sense should their tenets, their beliefs, be tolerated by democracies around this world. They have an agenda which is absolutist and denies basic humanity and basic human rights. Fundamental tenets of gender inequity are at the source of their beliefs as well as other measures of intolerance to diversity and religious belief. It is a struggle, therefore, that we must endure and continue to fight for, because it is important for that region. There are obvious issues and implications for the whole of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asia" rel="nofollow">
            Central Asia
           </a>
           in relation to Afghanistan and Pakistan’s stability, and we must stay that course.
          </p>
          <p>
           Although we focus on a security challenge that is confronting at the moment, and there is no guarantee of success, there have been improvements in the situation in Afghanistan. In Oruzgan province alone in the time that ISAF has been there, we have seen the number of children in school rising from 12,000 to 50,000. We have seen 100 health centres open. We have 100 doctors, up from two previously, and the infant mortality rate has dropped from a horrendous 36 per cent to 25 per cent. In these key areas where success will ultimately be achieved, in the social, economic and political areas, some progress is being made. A whole range of areas, of course, still remain to be tackled—good governance and the rule of law, where this battle will ultimately be won.
          </p>
          <p>
           But it should be emphasised that we are not in fact facing a war on terror here; we are facing a war on ignorance. Doing as much as we can to deliver a new generation of educated Afghanis with equal opportunity will be how we ultimately achieve success in that country, and not just while our troops are there but in our ongoing engagement with them long after. In that respect, the Australian government, fully recognising that, has committed significant resources to that effort. At the last conference we committed $250 million to address those very areas, adding to commendable commitments made by the previous government in this respect.
          </p>
          <p>
           I thank Private Ranaudo for his service, for his life, for his contribution to this country. In particular now, to his surviving family, we acknowledge and salute their sacrifice and their enduring commitment to this country. We pass our condolences to them. We shall continue to provide whatever support we can to them, and all Australians should continue to recognise their ongoing suffering and provide whatever support and comfort they can bring.

            I rise to add my comments on the life and sacrifice of Private Ben Ranaudo. This is not the first time that we have stood here to reflect on the life and the contribution made to this nation by a serviceman who has lost his life, and it is likely that it will not be the last. The death of Private Benjamin Ranaudo and the cause he died for is evidence that sometimes you just have to fight for what you believe in and for the freedom of others. In the days after Private Ranaudo’s death, the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_the_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
             Chief of the Defence Force
            </a>
            ,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus_Houston" rel="nofollow">
             Angus Houston
            </a>
            , warned that the withdrawal of Australian and other coalition troops could leave the way open for the Taliban resuming control of Afghanistan, and that is a warning worth heeding.
           </p>
           <p>
            For those who did not know Private Benjamin Ranaudo, perhaps on hearing of his death there would have been no more than a passing moment of regret for most Australians. That is also a tragedy, because there should be a greater appreciation of those who lay down their lives for this nation and the causes for which Australia fights. I would like to take this opportunity to speak on two aspects of his sacrifice. Firstly, I would say that I did not know Private Ranaudo, but what I do know is that he was a son, a brother, a partner and a soldier. His life will always, of course, have its greatest meaning to his family and his friends. Ben Ranaudo cannot be replaced for his family and those who knew him. His loss will be a defining moment in the life of his family and for those closest to him. His death is an event that they will have to endure for the rest of their lives.
           </p>
           <p>
            Beyond the grief and loss that his family and friends will endure, the people of this nation should also reflect on the big issues. In Afghanistan the coalition, the Afghan national army and our troops oppose the Taliban.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Taliban" rel="nofollow">
             The Taliban
            </a>
            are Islamic extremists and fundamentalists. They are extremists who would see the subjugation of women, extremists who would impose restrictions on Afghani society. They would withdraw democracy and impose their hardline religious law to control the people, just like they did last time they ruled Afghanistan. Their world is what most of us would consider a bad version of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Ages" rel="nofollow">
             Dark Ages
            </a>
            . They would also extend their warped view of the world on to Pakistan, and they are still fighting there to achieve that right now. Their allies also seek similar control elsewhere in the world. They cannot be reasoned with, as they see negotiation as a weakness to be exploited. The reality is that these sorts of people continue only until they are stopped by someone who is prepared to fight and defeat them.
           </p>
           <p>
            When I talk of ‘someone’, I talk of young and courageous men like Private Ranaudo and the men who already have given their lives for this cause in Afghanistan. That ‘someone’ also comprises those who are still there and are out on patrol or preparing for a patrol as we speak, fighting for a cause to defend the weak and protect the liberty of the people of Afghanistan—a cause where young children will, hopefully, be able to grow up with opportunities and freedoms something like what we have in Australia. If we did not have nations prepared to fight and courageous and honourable young men like Private Ben Ranaudo then the forces of extremism and oppression would eventually dominate the whole world. That world would live under religious law, the women would be denied an education and would be forced to cover themselves completely, and there ultimately would be no democracy. It is absolutely true that if Ben Ranaudo and the soldiers of this and other coalition countries were not prepared to risk their lives then we would not have this country the way we enjoy it. That is the reason that Private Ranaudo put his life on the line and that is a cause worth fighting for.
           </p>
           <p>
            It remains my view that no number of casualties will ever be acceptable. We do not want any of our soldiers to die in Afghanistan and we did not want Ben Ranaudo to die, yet we must be prepared to continue the fight and stand by our allies in that fight. If we withdraw or take a step back then those who oppose freedom and democracy will step forward into that space. Until at last we stand in Australia, and we have no choice but to fight. As Winston Churchill once said at another time, ‘you had the choice between war and dishonour. You chose dishonour, but you will still have war.’ That is a lesson for those who think the Taliban and Islamic extremists will listen to reason. They will not listen and they are not misunderstood; they can only be fought.
           </p>
           <p>
            I pay tribute to Private Ben Ranaudo, who made the supreme sacrifice in defence of the weak and for the cause of freedom and democracy. He was a great Australian and will never be forgotten. His life was not given in vain, and his family, I am sure, has the thanks of more than one grateful nation.

             Like those who have spoken before me, I rise to support the Prime Minister’s motion of condolence, a motion which, appropriately when unanimously supported, will express the House’s regret at the loss of Private Benjamin Ranaudo. Private Ranaudo gave his life while serving in Afghanistan with Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force 2. He was a member of the Townsville based 1st Battalion of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Regiment" rel="nofollow">

             </a>
             . As
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Minister" rel="nofollow">
              Defence Minister
             </a>
             , I was in Townsville with the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_of_Army" rel="nofollow">
              Chief of Army
             </a>
             to send off Private Ranaudo and the men and women who make up MRTF2. That is one of the many reasons I have chosen to speak on this very important motion.
            </p>
            <p>
             Australian defence ministers face many challenges and burdens, but none is greater than the arrival of news of the loss of a member of the ADF on operations. Being part of a government decision to send young Australians into harm’s way brings a unique feeling of responsibility, but the sense of grief felt by a defence minister pales into insignificance when compared to the grief felt by the loved ones and friends of the fallen soldier. I do not believe I have had the pleasure and honour of meeting with them, but I expressed my deepest sympathy to Private Ranaudo’s mother, Jennifer, his father, Angelo, his stepfather, Terry, his partner, Haylee, and his sisters Amy and Hayley.
            </p>
            <p>
             If Private Ranaudo’s loved ones are like those of the fallen soldiers I have met then I know that they will be finding strength in the fact that he was a highly skilled and dedicated soldier but also, just as importantly, the fact that he believed in what he was doing and understood and appreciated the risks. One of the many things that stand out when you attend a military funeral is the support the fallen soldier had from his immediate family and their understanding and appreciation of his understanding of what he was doing, his belief in what he was doing and his full appreciation of the significant risks involved.
            </p>
            <p>
             Believing in what you are doing is a very, very important thing. It is important to both soldier and minister. I, like the volunteer men and women of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Defence Force
             </a>
             , believe in what we are doing in Afghanistan. We are there for at least three very important reasons. First and foremost is that we are there to protect Australia and Australians. I do not need to make the case in this place that terror born in Afghanistan directly threatens Australia and Australians. That is an incontestable fact. The second reason we are there, and it is not often talked about, is that we are there as part of an alliance commitment. On 11 September 2001, the American homeland came under attack. Rightly,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZUS" rel="nofollow">
              ANZUS
             </a>
             was invoked and we joined with our partners in a response to that attack, in the same way that Australians would expect our US partners to come to our aid if we found ourselves in similar circumstances. I think that is a very important point. The third reason we are there—and it goes, in many ways, to the first reason—is to build an economy in Afghanistan, to bring the people of that war-torn country out of poverty and to protect them from the worst excesses of Islamic extremism.
            </p>
            <p>
             It is important that we not only believe in why we are in Afghanistan but also believe we can achieve our objectives there. I acknowledge that there are many who do not believe we can meet with success in Afghanistan, and of course they are entitled to their view. Certainly, the challenges are enormous and at times seem insurmountable. But I disagree. Afghanistan, in my view, is a beast capable of being tamed. I certainly would not be part of a decision to maintain our troop presence in Afghanistan if I did not believe that were the case. I know that Private Ranaudo and the 10 Australians who gave their lives before him believed in our prospects of success—I should say 12 Australians, if we keep in mind, appropriately, Rifleman Nash, an Australian who died serving with British forces, and all those who have been wounded in Afghanistan. Our collective determination now must be to ensure that they did not give their lives in vain and those who have been severely wounded did not have those wounds inflicted on them in vain.
            </p>
            <p>
             We will meet with success in Afghanistan if: (1) all the parties share our determination to meet with success rather than, if you like, go through the paces as part of a
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO" rel="nofollow">
              NATO
             </a>
             alliance commitment; (2) the objective is realistic, and of course the objective is to ensure that we stabilise Afghanistan, protect the democratic processes there and build the capacity of the Afghan government to enforce their own rule of law and their own security; (3) we have sufficient troops and capability; we cannot win the military campaign without sufficient troop numbers and the right capability; and (4) if we have the right strategy—a proper marrying of the military, political and capacity building efforts. When I say political, I do not just mean reconciliation within the country; I mean effectively dealing with those significant issues outside Afghanistan in places like Pakistan.
            </p>
            <p>
             It might sound like a bit of a cliche, but it is true: Afghanistan is a battle for the hearts and minds of the local people. We will meet with success in stabilising Afghanistan when the vast majority of the Afghan people believe that the economic, social and democratic model we are offering as a partnership is better than that being offered by any other individual or group. They must believe that we are there for the right reasons and that is to improve their country, to raise living standards and, again, to protect them, the population, from the worst excesses of Islamic extremism.
            </p>
            <p>
             On the operational front, our troops are there simultaneously disrupting the work of the Taliban and building the capacity of both the

              Afghan National Army
             </a>
             and the Afghan national police. It is very important work and it is work they are doing very, very well indeed—exceptionally well—and as members of parliament we should all, collectively, be proud of them. Today we think of Private Ranaudo and his loved ones. We also think of Private

              Peter Rose

              Parliamentary Christian Fellowship
             </a>
             . His presence is welcome but also reminded me of the words of a padre or minister at the funeral of Lance Corporal Jason Marks at
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holsworthy_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
              Holsworthy Barracks
             </a>
             . He said, I thought very astutely and quite succinctly—and they may not have been original words on his part, I am not sure, but I appreciated them, particularly coming from a person in his position—that he believed peace is worth fighting for and I agree.
            </p>
            <p>
             Unfortunately military operations are sometimes unavoidable. What we are doing in Afghanistan is very important both to the Afghan people and to the broader international community. I believe in what we are doing. I know that Private Ranaudo believed in what he was doing. I know all men and women of the Australian Defence Force who are serving there, or have served there, believe in what they are doing, and they are deserving of the highest admiration of all members of this parliament and the broader Australian community.

              in southern Afghanistan, the 11th Australian soldier killed in Afghanistan. He was killed by an improvised explosive device. He was serving in the Baluchi Valley, north of Tarin Kowt, at the time. The 22-year-old was the fifth Australian to die from an

              blast. A cortege of vehicles, including one carrying Benjamin Ranaudo’s flag-draped casket, passed between a line of diggers to carry our fallen comrade home.

              He was serving with the 1st Battalion, the

              </a>
              , a battalion I know well, having served with a sister battalion as a very young platoon commander with the 3rd Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment. I know it is with great sadness that the commanding officer and the men of 1

               RAR
              </a>
              farewelled one of their warriors. It is always a solemn ramp ceremony when one of our fallen men comes home, killed in battle fighting for what he believes. The regimental sergeant major, Warrant Officer Darren Murch, spoke glowingly of Private Ranaudo. He spoke of a man being a pleasure to be around and one who displayed the true qualities of an Australian soldier. We must never forget—not in this place, not in any place—that Benjamin Ranaudo fought for us. He fought for a freedom that we value and that we wish to extend.
             </p>
             <p>
              We must never forget that the battle in Afghanistan is one of the front-line battles for Western civilisation as we know it. It is a battle to rebuild a nation, to restore a democracy, to remove a safe haven from those who would seek to convert it to an extremist form of government completely incompatible with our way of life—a form of government they wish to see extended throughout the world. The battle in Afghanistan is a forward fight for our Western way of life. It is a fight we must win; it is a fight we will win. It is a battle for the hearts and minds of Afghani people, who do not want to return to an extremist Taliban rule. This is a battle for families—for mums and dads who want to live a life that they have known historically. Let us not forget that Afghani mums, too, love their kids and they want a country where their children can grow up and be educated. They want a country where little girls have the right to go to school and live in a free and fair democracy and where their children do not have to live in fear of warlords subjugating them into a slavery of fighting for a dictatorial regime and an extremist view of government. We are fighting to reconstruct a nation so that it can no longer be used as a safe haven for terrorism. The fight is a worthwhile fight. It enjoys bipartisan support across the political divide, as it should. It is a fight we will continue until it is won, in concert with our allies and partners. It is a fight that Private Benjamin Ranaudo paid the ultimate price for. He laid down his life for a fight he believed in.
             </p>
             <p>
              There is a saying attributed to
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Orwell" rel="nofollow">
               George Orwell
              </a>
              that we sleep safe in our beds because rough men stand ready in the night to visit violence on those who would do us harm. If freedom is indeed the sure possession of those who alone have the courage to defend it, then may I suggest that Ben Ranaudo stands tall in our nation’s history. He joins 10 other warriors who have laid down their lives in Afghanistan, because they had the courage to defend the freedom many of us take for granted.
             </p>
             <p>
              I conclude, as I so often have in this place, in the great tradition of an ancient warrior, statesman and king, Pericles, who founded the great Athenian empire 2,500 years ago and led that nation during the first two years of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peloponnesian_War" rel="nofollow">
               Peloponnesian War
              </a>
              . He said:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              What you leave behind is not what is engraved in stone monuments, but what is woven into the lives of others.
             </p>
             <p>
              When we look at Facebook and see Private Ranaudo’s partner’s comments, when we hear the accolades from peers and superiors alike; when we see the public’s reaction to another warrior, another brave Anzac, the son of those who have gone before us, it inspires us to know that heroism remains alive. It inspires us to know that young Australian men continue to fight, that young Australian men and women continue to serve because we uphold freedom as a fundamental, sacred right in this country and we are prepared to fight to ensure that freedom remains. Private Ranaudo has indeed left behind something significant woven into the lives of others. His sacrifice has indeed touched lives, and this place will not forget that.

               I join with my colleagues in this condolence motion. It is with great sadness that I rise to speak on Private Benjamin Ranaudo. On his first tour to Afghanistan, at the young age of 22, Private Ranaudo made the ultimate sacrifice for his nation on 18 July when he was killed by an antipersonnel explosive device. Private Ranaudo was a local
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferntree_Gully" rel="nofollow">

               </a>
               in Ferntree Gully. On the day of his funeral I spoke to his Principal, Vin Feeney, who remembers Private Ranaudo as a fantastic student and a young person who just wanted to serve his country and be a soldier.
              </p>
              <p>
               At Private Ranaudo’s funeral, which I had the great honour and privilege to attend, he was described as a loving family man and a dedicated and professional Australian soldier. I found it rather compelling and daunting that there were so many young soldiers at the funeral. It fills one with great pride to see these young men and women serving our country with such honour and dignity but, at the same time, it kind of haunts you to realise how young our men and women are when they actually join the Army to serve our great country.
              </p>
              <p>
               Private Ranaudo’s career was one of distinction. He was a member of the 1st Battalion of the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
                Royal Australian Regiment
               </a>
               based in Townsville. In Afghanistan, he was a member of the Mentoring and Reconstruction Task Force. His death is another very tragic reminder of the terrible dangers our troops face in Afghanistan. Our young men and women are doing a brilliant job, working under the toughest of conditions. I applaud them and thank them. They too will be feeling the immense loss of Private Ranaudo.
              </p>
              <p>
               At this point, I would like to pass on my thoughts to Private
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Warren" rel="nofollow">
                Paul Warren
               </a>
               , who was badly injured in the same incident. We should never forget the sacrifice that Paul Warren has made for his country.
              </p>
              <p>
               Private Ranaudo demonstrated those finest of qualities that make our Australian soldiers so great—professionalism, bravery, mateship and sacrifice. It is clear from the statements made by Private Ranaudo’s family that he was a soldier who believed that what he was doing was the right thing to do. His family said, ‘Benjamin was a proud soldier. He believed in what he did.’ From what I heard that day, he was a soldier’s soldier.
              </p>
              <p>
               We fight terrorism because we believe in our freedoms, we believe in democracy and we believe in our liberties. Private Ranaudo sacrificed his life for these ideals and we must not allow his sacrifice to be in vain. We will continue the fight with his great sacrifice in our hearts and minds. I express my deepest condolences to the Ranaudo family—father Angelo, mother Jennifer, stepfather Terry, big sister Amy and younger sister Hayley-Rose—and other close family members. Also, my condolences go to Private Ranaudo’s girlfriend, Haylee, to his friends and to all those who knew him. He sounded like an amazing mate to have and a great friend when you needed someone to support you.
              </p>
              <p>
               I want to particularly say to Private Ranaudo’s parents, during this time of terrible loss, that I hope that it is of some comfort to you to know that your son has served this nation with courage and distinction and that he will never be forgotten. Indeed, he is in the hearts, minds and prayers of millions of Australians who are grateful for the sacrifice he has made. He has served this nation fighting terrorists in Afghanistan in order to ensure security in his home country and also around the globe and for that, as a nation, we will always be indebted to you. Rest in peace.
