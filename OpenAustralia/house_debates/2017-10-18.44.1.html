       <p>
        Today I'm asking for help. I need help from locals in my electorate who have had to deal with the notorious Lindum Station level crossing for too along now. I need your help to gather as many signatures as possible for a community petition in support of an overpass for Lindum Station. Yes, it has been promised before. For years, we have had finger-pointing about the blind spot and the all-round terrible design of the Lindum, North and Sibley roads intersection. Many promises have been made but have fallen short at each level of government. It's time we put aside politics and got an overpass built. There's strong support in the community for a solution.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my time as a member, I have lost count of the number of accidents and near misses I have heard about at the crossing. In my latest Biggest Survey, an overwhelming number of people called for an overpass. My community petition calls for three levels of government to work together to fund this vital project. I know it is possible. To local residents and businesses listening: adding your voice to the chorus will help make things happen. If you can get others to sign the petition as well, even better. I'd love to hear from those wanting to help. Please contact my office for copies of the petition to hand out. Together, we can fix the station crossing once and for all.
