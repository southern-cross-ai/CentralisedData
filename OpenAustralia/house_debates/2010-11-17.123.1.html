        </a>

        and the fire service but moved to help kids with special needs and other young people. His achievements include setting up Special Kids Inc, which was a major supporter of Noah’s Ark, and he also opened the Redlands wheelchair and mobility aids bank. Michael secured around 50 wheelchairs, a range of walkers, crutches and other aids, all of which he stored in his shed. Schoolies prep camps were another of his innovations, taking Year 11 and 12 teenagers to the

He had a severe disability and managed, despite that, to raise his two sons. We lost Michael this year, and it was a great loss to our community. He was a wonderful contributor throughout his life in Redlands.
