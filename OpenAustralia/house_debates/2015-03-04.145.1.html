        endangered woodland regeneration program in Macarthur was fortunate enough to be in the first round of funding, and commenced in September last year. Since its establishment in 1988, the garden has become recognised as a jewel in the crown of south-west Sydney. The garden is a haven for wildlife and has now some of the finest examples of local bushland in the Cumberland Plain Woodland. Listed as a critically endangered plant community, the Cumberland Plain Woodland is threatened by weed invasion and urban and industrial development.

       <p>
        Macarthur's Green Army participants are working to conserve this important bushland by controlling problem weeds such as the African olive tree within core conservation areas. Tree planting on areas now cleared of African olive will create future fauna habitat and link bushland areas within the garden. They are also receiving technical training from the garden's staff in seed collecting and plant propagation. This project would not have been possible without the tremendous support and assistance of Green Army supervisor, Jacinta Rheinberger; the Curator Manager of the Australian Botanic Garden, John Siemon; garden staff

        On behalf of the government and all those involved in the Green Army, I would like to congratulate Macarthur's inaugural Green Army graduates David Lefu, Amy Peacey, Nicole Peacey, Taylor Divine-Litson, Nikitah Smith, Kome Ualesi, Damian Semple, Kane Watson and Graham Devlin. Macarthur's inaugural Green Army graduates have successfully completed work that has had real environmental and conservation benefits in the Macarthur region, and on behalf of our community I would like to say thank you for this great achievement. They have also gained valuable practical training and experience to help prepare them for the workforce or further their training and improve their careers, which has already begun to pay off, with Nicole Peacey and David Lefu securing employment at

        The highly successful Green Army project at the Australian Botanic Garden, Mount Annan, is just the beginning of the government's plans for a Green Army in Macarthur. Last month I announced that my electorate of Macarthur had received approval for yet another Green Army project involving

        in which the Green Army participants will create habitats for Camden white gums by removing 2.4 hectares of its main threat, privet, as well as removing 8.85 hectares of African olive and African boxthorn in the Cumberland Plain Woodland at Gundungurra Reserve north and south and at Elizabeth Throsby and

        Once again, I would like to congratulate Macarthur's inaugural Green Army graduates and all those involved in the Green Army program at the Australian Botanic Garden, Mount Annan. You are doing a great job.
