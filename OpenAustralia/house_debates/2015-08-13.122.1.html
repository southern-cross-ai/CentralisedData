        , and that is because of what Native ARC represents as an organisation that cares for native animals and does so through community support and volunteer contributions. Having worked and campaigned for better animal welfare throughout my professional life, I find it incredibly uplifting to visit Native ARC and see animals being rescued, cared for and returned to their native habitat. Native ARC and its near neighbour the Cockburn Wetlands Education Centre are places where our community, and particularly our young people, can learn about the importance of local ecosystems not only as habitat for native animals but also as a critical part of the wider environment. For all those reasons, I am honoured to be the patron of Native ARC, and once again I would like to recognise the amazing work of all involved, especially the staff, the board and the incredible band of volunteers and supporters, whose time and energy are essential.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week I was fortunate to take part in the launch of Native ARC's new animal management system, a software program that will greatly reduce the paperwork involved in caring for the more than 2,500 animals admitted to the centre each year. Developed for Native ARC through Volunteering WA's skills-based volunteering program, the animal management system was created by Bankwest staff who volunteered their skills and time for the project. It was fantastic to see the Bankwest's team's eagerness to tour the enclosures and their joy as they took turns holding the band of young joeys, peeking out of their faux pouches. This very useful tool created for Native ARC showed how partnerships which draw on the skills and expertise of people in the corporate world, and not just funding, are key to helping both community groups and the spirit of volunteerism to thrive.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since my first visit back in 2008, Native ARC has continually improved in order to make the biggest possible difference to the wellbeing of our native wildlife. Recent upgrades include air conditioning in the hospital area; a new microscope, which allows for on-site faecal testing; new enclosures; completion of the boundary fence; and the purchase of an industrial washing machine, which helps improve infection control and the capacity to cope with the vast quantity of laundry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Native ARC is obviously going from strength to strength, but its work is now, sadly, threatened by the spectre of Roe Highway Stage 8, sponsored by both the state and federal governments. The proposed six-lane road would tear a massive strip through the middle of the surrounding wetlands and have a negative effect on native animals, directly and in terms of loss of habitat, damage to the ecosystem and loss of connectivity. Roe 8 would impact negatively upon Indigenous heritage, and enjoyment of the local community would be destroyed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have never understood the rationale for this road, because I do not think there is one. The sensible solution involves the proper development of an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Harbour" rel="nofollow">

        in Kwinana, with a supporting road-rail intermodal site that would significantly increase the proportion of freight on rail, keep trucks out of our residential communities to the greatest extent possible and out of our few, precious remnant wetlands altogether.
