        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister's promise: 'We, the coalition government, are not going to repair our budget this year at the expense of your family budget.' So why then is the Prime Minister still ripping $6,000 a year from the typical family budget?

         This is the opposition's problem: they have not moved on. They are still fighting the battle of last year's budget. They are incapable of understanding that we are building on the successes of last year to give tonight a budget for confidence, a budget for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Middle Australia
         </a>
         and, above all else, a budget for fairness. That is what we are doing tonight. The fairest thing that we can do is give the people of Australia a government which is living within its means, and that is what members opposite and, indeed, the entire Australian people will see tonight—a credible path back to a sustainable surplus. That is what people will see tonight.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am very happy to repeat for members opposite the themes of this budget. It will be a budget that is measured, responsible and fair. It will be a budget that is focused on jobs, growth and opportunity. It will be a budget that delivers a tax cut for small business and gives more and more Australians the opportunities to take the increased number of jobs that will be out there. That is what it does. We want to encourage the Australian people to be the best they can be. This is a budget that will invite the Australian people to have a go, because that is in our nature. It is in our nature to want to have a go and to seize the better future that is within our grasp.
        </p>
        <p>
         We as a nation have so much going for us. We have the best people. We have excellent schools and universities. We have tremendous institutions. We have people who are creative and adaptable. I want the people of Australia to be the very best they can be. I want the people of Australia to have all the opportunities they deserve, and that is exactly what tonight's budget aims to give them—the opportunities that they deserve to get a job, to work more, to work better and to earn more. I want the small businesses of Australia to invest more and to employ more, because I have faith in the people of Australia; I have faith in the small businesses of Australia. Tonight's budget will be a demonstration—
