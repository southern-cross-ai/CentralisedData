        Back again, but this time I am going to talk on something positive, because it is not about the government.

        is the countless examples of communities stepping up in times of need to look after their own. Whether I am in Seymour, Pyalong, Lancefield or Doreen, I see examples of the life-changing impact of that spirit of caring for our neighbours.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Monday, 26 September, I had the great honour to participate in a fantastic example of this in Sunbury. The Sunbury Neighbourhood Kitchen exemplifies the fundamental truth that simple respect and kindness can sometimes be the difference for a person who is struggling. It can give them comfort, peace of mind and, most importantly, a sense of belonging.
       </p>
       <p>
        The kitchen is run every Monday night out of the Sunbury Neighbourhood House. It is designed as a place where people can come together, meet each other, and socialise as a community over dinner. It is a place where no mobiles or other distractions are present, where guests and volunteers can all focus on person-to-person interaction—that sense that the biggest difference we can make in the lives of others is to be present and to listen.
       </p>
       <p>
        Three years ago, Neil and Marianne Williams—just beautiful people—saw a need in their community and decided they were going to be part of the solution. They saw many struggling to make ends meet and recognised that one of the first things to go when we are struggling is our connection to community. We see people shut themselves off; sometimes they are embarrassed or ashamed that they are in need of that little bit of help and support.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year the Sunbury Neighbourhood Kitchen celebrated three years of serving the greater Sunbury community. From those humble beginnings back in September 2013, when Neil and Marianne were joined by six volunteers and four guests, the kitchen now has 60 passionate volunteers and serves a hot meal and, just as importantly, a community to share it with, to over 170 guests every Monday evening.
       </p>
       <p>
        These volunteers—community members like Julie and Ned Summers who joined the kitchen in the beginning, or Faye Marsden Ivor who joined not long after—are often modest about it, but the truth is that their kindness and their company can be a light in the life of people every Monday night.
       </p>
       <p>
        So there can be no surprises why it was my pleasure to attend the 'Pay It Forward' event. The 'Pay It Forward' dinner is the kitchen's annual major fundraising event. It is a chance to invite members of the community and the public to come along, have a meal and experience the passionate work that the team of volunteers spend every Monday night doing—dedicating themselves to feeding those in our community who are finding it tough.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each $40 ticket purchased to this dinner assists the kitchen to help 'Pay It Forward' and will cover at least 10 meals for a single guest within the Sunbury Neighbourhood Kitchen community. The team also held an auction with items so generously donated by residents and community groups. That is in keeping with the all-in flavour and approach of the group. We ate, drank, chatted and listened to some great tunes from local muso Pip Joyce. I have to give a special mention to the ladies who were cutting a rug up on the dance floor. I did tell them I pulled a hamstring, but the reality is that it was a heartstring and dancing is not my forte. I guess I jibbed it, in that sense. All in all, a fantastic night which provides a strong foundation for the year's fundraising.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last year's 'Pay It Forward' raised enough funds to serve meals to 150 guests for 13 weeks—13 Mondays without the anxiety of wondering where tonight's meal is going to come from for those guests at the kitchen. What a powerful example of the difference one night of great food and good company can make for those who need the help most!
       </p>
       <p>
        While we are waiting to hear the final tally from this year's event, we can safely say that, through the commitment of the team at Sunbury Neighbourhood Kitchen, there will be community members who feel that little bit more supported as a result; they feel a little bit closer and more connected; they have the opportunity to get out and share some times.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is interesting to sit there, talk to people and hear their stories. By a stroke of whatever, you and I can be sitting here doing what we are doing, but people can end up on a different path. Sometimes it is not hard to end up in a position where you are alone, where you do not have friends or family around and you need the support of your community. I guess we are all blessed to be able to stand here and talk about wonderful things.
       </p>
       <p>
        The pride I have in the Sunbury Community Kitchen and its supporters can never be overstated. It is an absolutely fantastic thing. I ask them to keep up the great work. We appreciate it: not only are you filling people's stomachs, but you are filling people's hearts.
