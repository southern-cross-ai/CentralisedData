        In the last sitting week of the federal parliament for 2008, I want to extend my thanks to two local organisations in the Ryan electorate that very kindly invited me to their annual Christmas dinners last Friday and Saturday. I refer first of all to the Kenmore-Moggill
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        Sub-Branch, in the Ryan electorate. This is an organisation that has the widespread respect of the western suburbs of Brisbane. It has this respect, esteem and affection because of the dedication of all its members. It is a sub-branch which pays tribute to all those who have worn the uniform of Australia and who have fought under the flag of our country in so many ways. It does this by honouring the memory of those who have fallen in our country’s name but it also attracts the affection and respect of the community by all it does in the education of young people in the schools of Ryan. It does a very significant job in speaking to young people about the place of our military, about their contribution and the sacrifice of all those who have worn the uniform.
       </p>

        Anzac Day is a special part of our calendar and it is a day when the RSL comes to the fore, with all the logistics and the organisation of that special day in April. I want to thank the president of the Kenmore-Moggill RSL Sub-Branch,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Cameron" rel="nofollow">
         Stuart Cameron
        </a>
        , and his committee for organising a very pleasant, very enjoyable evening. There were nearly 150 members and guests in attendance at the Jindalee Hotel that evening and I felt very honoured to be invited and to receive a vote of thanks for my support of their organisation. I acknowledge also the attendance of the Queensland RSL president, Doug Formby. His stature in Queensland is without peer for what he does to fight to represent the interests of the RSL sub-branches.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to thank
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Anderson" rel="nofollow">
         Keith Anderson
        </a>
        , the president of the Jindalee Golf Club, who invited me to present the annual awards of the club. Those who love the game of golf—and there are many across our country and in this parliament—contribute to the community in more ways than I think we perhaps appreciate. They not only play golf for the love of the game but also take the opportunity as a club to make a contribution to the local community, the seniors in the community and those less fortunate than themselves. I would like to take this opportunity to say merry Christmas to all of them.
