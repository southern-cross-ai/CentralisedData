        As soon as Australians woke to the news that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_Majesty" rel="nofollow">
         Her Majesty
        </a>
        Queen Elizabeth II had passed away, constituents in my electorate of Lilley began queuing outside the door of my electorate office in Nundah. Some were seeking a portrait of the Queen to have something to remember her by. Others sought to express their condolences and pay their respects by writing a message in our condolence book. All expressed their disbelief and grief over the loss of a figurehead whose presence and influence has spanned multiple generations of Australian families. That day my office received scores of calls from constituents requesting a portrait of Queen Elizabeth—so many, in fact, that our stocks were exhausted within hours. Another 100 requests quickly filled the waiting list.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two days later the Lilley community turned out in force for this year's Nundah Festival, an annual celebration that has been cruelled twice by COVID. I give congratulations yet again to the Nundah Festival organisers on another great festival, and to the organising committee for its continued success. Thousands of northsiders attended the festival this year with their families on a beautiful sunny day. I know that local northside families like mine mark the progress of our families by the photos we take each year at Nundah Festival, and it's a very special community tradition that I am looking forward to us continuing.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the midst of the Nundah Festival atmosphere, many more northsiders signed the condolence book that I have brought with me to Canberra this week to be sent on to

        . Lara Meyers from Nundah wrote: 'Thank you for your service. You have been my queen for my lifetime, and for the rest of my life there will be kings. It was amazing that you were able to forge the way for what female leadership can be and an inspiration for us all. An authentic person, true to your nature and forever true to your duty and service to your people. Thank you, and rest in peace'.

        It is heartening to see our community come together in this time of grief but it's not a surprise. Whether it be through grief, loss or natural disaster—my electorate was based in the February floods this year—the residents of Lilley join together, drawing on our shared strength, and we can help each other to move forward.
       </p>
       <p>
        With my remaining 23 seconds, let me congratulate the North Devils on back-to-back premierships, which they celebrated on Saturday. It was an amazing achievement for them to do that back-to-back, particularly against the
