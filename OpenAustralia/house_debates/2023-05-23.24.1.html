        I represent a community that is passionate about taking action on climate change. So important is that issue for them for them that for only the second time in 70 years they elected a Labor MP in Bennelong. They voted for Labor because they trusted this government to take climate change seriously and start the country's long overdue investment in renewable energy.

        Before the election I promised to deliver a community battery for north Epping, and I'm proud to tell the House that the application from Ausgrid and Hornsby council to install one was successful. In the first round of funding, $500,000 was awarded to install a 240 kilowatt community battery in north Epping. It is one of 400 batteries that Labor has promised to deliver across Australia. We know those opposite would prefer we install nuclear reactors in

        , but—thank goodness for the people of Bennelong!—the Liberals are not in charge. This battery will mean that those who have solar will be able to continue to export solar power and store it for the community to use later in the evening. This battery will support the grid, it'll drive down emissions and it'll put downward pressure on everyone's electricity bill.

        I'd like to thank the former member for Berowra, now the Mayor of Hornsby, Councillor the Hon.

        , for his support of this project. His council has worked closely with Ausgrid to get where we are today and, in particular, proposed the land at North Epping for its installation. I eagerly anticipate the next round of community consultation and the battery's installation.
