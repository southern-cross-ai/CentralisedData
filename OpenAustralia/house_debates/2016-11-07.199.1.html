        I have recently had the pleasure of attending awards nights at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victory_College" rel="nofollow">
         Victory College
        </a>
        , James Nash State High School and Gympie State High School. It was great to see the range of awards presented, and I congratulate the students on their achievements under the guidance of their dedicated teachers. At Victory College, there was a wonderful band and a dance performance. The principal, Johannes Solymosi, delivered a very inspiring speech about the importance of students being the best they can be. Johannes is leaving the school after having been there some years, and I wish him well for the future. At James Nash State High School, there was also a very entertaining band and choir performance, and I thank principal Darrin Edwards and his staff for all their work throughout the year. Their deputy principal, Robert Doust, is retiring after more than 30 years of service, and I wish him and his wife, Sue, who is also a teacher at the school, well in his retirement. At Gympie State High School, there was a special performance of original country music that was written by students. It was a brilliant showcase of their talents. Thanks, principal Anthony Lanskey and your dedicated team, for a great night. We need to give our students every opportunity to be the best they can. I am pleased these three great schools in
