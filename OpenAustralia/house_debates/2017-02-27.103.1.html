        On behalf of the

         Joint Committee
        </a>
        of Public Accounts and Audit I present the committee's 460th report, entitled
        <i>
         Public Sector Governance - Inquiry based on Auditor-General's report 29 (2015-16)
        </i>

        Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).
       </p>
       <p>
        by leaveâ€”On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the following report: Report 460:
        <i>
         Public sector governance: Inquiry based on
        </i>
        <i>
         Auditor-
        </i>
        <i>
         General's report 29

         (2015

        . This inquiry was based on the Auditor-General's examination of the government's deregulation agenda. The committee focused on the theme of public sector governance when considering this audit, and was pleased to note that the deregulation agenda was implemented according to many of the practices central to good public governance.
       </p>
       <p>
        Initiated in late 2013, the deregulation agenda aims to reduce the cost of unnecessary or inefficient regulation on individuals, business and community organisations through whole-of-government coordination of the policy, overseen by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Prime_Minister_and_Cabinet" rel="nofollow">
         Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet
        </a>
        . The committee found that the deregulation agenda was implemented according to good public governance principles. The Auditor-General's report concluded that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM" rel="nofollow">
         PM
        </a>
        &amp;C moved quickly to put in place governance frameworks to support implementation and that audited departments established internal deregulation units with clearly articulated roles, responsibilities and consultative mechanisms.
       </p>
       <p>
        To support future deregulatory decisions and to emphasise the economic and productivity benefits of the deregulation agenda, the committee report supports the Australian government's December 2013 decision that an economic impact assessment should be undertaken; however, despite the government's commitment to do so, there still has not been an independent verification of the outcomes of deregulation. Such a review would provide a basis for greater confidence for government's claims as to the economic benefits they report. The committee has, therefore, recommended that PM&amp;C report back on progress of implementing this decision.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to extend my thanks to all members of the committee for their consideration of this inquiry and their ongoing efforts to maintain the committee's strong tradition of proper parliamentary scrutiny.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
