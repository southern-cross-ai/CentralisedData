        My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister advise the House of the advice being provided by the government to Australians travelling to India?

        <p>
         I thank the member for Parramatta for her question. Obviously, Australian athletes and supporters are very much focused on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games" rel="nofollow">
          Commonwealth Games
         </a>
         in India. Of course, we would want the focus to be on what will happen at the Games and the potential for our athletes to win medals, but obviously the focus has also been on security questions. I take this opportunity to advise the House that the Australian government has been working closely with the Indian authorities on Games security since early 2009. A task force has been set up to provide travellers with the best available information, which is contained in the India travel advice and a Commonwealth Games bulletin on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">
          DFAT
         </a>
         website.
        </p>
        <p>
         This information is reviewed regularly, and my purpose in raising this matter today is to draw people’s attention to the fact that this advice has been updated today. I encourage all Australians in India or people intending to travel to India to read the updated advice carefully. That advice states that Australians should exercise a high degree of caution in India. Australian authorities continue to receive reports of possible terrorist attacks in New Delhi, Mumbai and other major cities, and the risk of a terrorist attack is high. The updated advice also notes that some public places should be avoided.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian government continues to seek assurances about the safety of Commonwealth Games venues. Ultimately, of course, the Australian government is not in a position to independently verify the safety of games venues or security in India more broadly. Instead, we urge every Australian in India to read the travel advice carefully and make an informed decision.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would like to say a word on reports in the media today that two extremist groups are planning to attack the Commonwealth Games. I have seen those reports and I am advised our initial assessment is that those specific reports lack credibility. Of course, we are following this up with the Indian authorities and we will provide any information should it come to light. As I have said, our best assessment of the security situation is contained in the India travel advice and every Australian in India should read that advice, think carefully and make an informed decision.
        </p>

          Can I
         </a>
         conclude by saying a word about this advice and our relationship with India. This advice is not meant as a slight on the government and the people of India, who are our good friends and partners. Our travel advice is our best factual assessment of the situation on the ground in the country concerned. It is not a judgment or a criticism; it is simply a service provided to help travellers make an informed decision. I am sure I speak on behalf of all the members of this place when I say that we all want to see a peaceful and successful Commonwealth Games—nothing would please the Australian community more.
