        This is a eulogy offered by our friend
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mal_Washer" rel="nofollow">
         Mal Washer
        </a>
        for Gloria Riley.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mal worked with Gloria for just over 40 years. Gloria first came into' Mal's life when she started work at Green Road Medical Centre. Mal says that she was a high spirted personality and made visiting the centre a pleasure for the patients.
       </p>
       <p>
        Gloria undertook the evening shifts. One night she tried to convince a demanding patient that Mal was overbooked and running late, and that perhaps the patient should see another doctor. In the end Gloria relented and the indignant patient told Mal of how she had tried to fob her off onto someone else. Mal said, 'I naturally said, "Don't worry about those old boilers out on the front desk, luv."' Of course, the patient happily reported this back to Gloria on the way out. 'I first then felt the sting of an angry and indignant Gloria,' says Mal. 'Gloria's temper could rise as quickly as those high kicks she used to love doing.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Gloria joined Mal after he had established Seacrest Medical Centre.
       </p>
       <p>
        She was a dedicated and detailed practice manager who balanced the handling of sometimes demanding doctors and patients with acrobatic skill. Gloria was relentless in ensuring the best patient care and kept the doctors in good check, most of whom, including, of course, Mal, were more than a little bit scared of her. Dr Geoff Reynolds used to affectionately refer to her as 'the dragon lady'. Gloria moved on with Mal into federal politics as Mal's chief of staff. She loved her life in that role. The staff and politicians of all political persuasions were fond of her, and, members, that is why I have the honour of making this speech today.
       </p>
       <p>
        'We never really left medicine behind,' says Mal, as Mal and Gloria became carers for the many people in the parliament too. Basically, Gloria was good at most things except losing at cards, staying calm when provoked and giving directions. If you needed to get somewhere, Gloria would make sure that you would be really lost. One time she took two hours to get to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        when parked in the Senate car park instead of the House of Representatives car park, and Mal made the mistake of asking her how she took that long to make a journey that would normally take only five minutes.
       </p>
       <p>
        For many, being in parliament meant long stretches away from home and family. Gloria gave the parliament a homely feel and Mal reflects how sorely missed she was when she left. We all knew of her fiery personality. This led to many disputes between Mal and Gloria over the yearsâ€”disputes that Gloria always seemed to win. However, she could also be fiercely loyal and dedicated to those that she cared for. She was tenacious in helping people in the electorate. She was determined and fearless in dealing with all levels of government and no case was too hard for her. She never let go until the job was complete. She reminded Mal many times of the badger in the movie

         </a>
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        She worked hard and she also enjoyed a good wine and happy hour with colleagues and friends. The last 12 months of Gloria's life were extremely tough for her. She never gave up, however. She never, ever stopped trying. Although this attitude may have extended her suffering in some ways, she was still bright and alert to the very end. Gloria will be sorely missed by all sides but not forgotten. Mal reflects that beyond the pearly gates things will be sorted out in true Gloria fashion. Let's just hope that none of them ask her for directions. I thank you for your indulgence.
