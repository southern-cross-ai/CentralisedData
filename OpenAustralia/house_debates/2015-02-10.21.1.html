       <p>
        I am pleased to inform the House that there was a great result for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_South_Perth" rel="nofollow">
         City of South Perth
        </a>
        ratepayers last weekend, with the region's local government amalgamations referendum returning a majority of no votes. I have been vocal in my opposition to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian
        </a>
        state government's idea to cut the number of councils from 30 to 16 by making local government regions amalgamate. Thankfully, the City of South Perth and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Town_of_Victoria_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Town of Victoria Park
        </a>
        's petition for a referendum was approved on the question, 'Should the City of South Perth and Town of Victoria Park be abolished and amalgamated to form a new local government?'
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate all those who took the opportunity to have their say, and in particular those, like Cecilia Brooke, who led a grassroots campaign to oppose the amalgamation. Approximately 54 per cent of issued votes were returned, including informal votes, and there were 50.8 per cent eligible votes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ratepayers in the City of South Perth and, by extension, the Town of Victoria Park, along with ratepayers in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Fremantle" rel="nofollow">
         East Fremantle
        </a>
        and Kwinana, have sent a very clear message to the state government that they do not want to amalgamate. I am also aware of a number of other councils who are vehemently opposed to amalgamations but unfortunately were not successful in their calls for a referendum, including the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Canning" rel="nofollow">
         City of Canning
        </a>
        in my electorate of Swan. If this is not a wake-up call for the state government, then WALGA's withdrawal of support for reform earlier today should be. I now call on Premier Barnett to accept the ratepayers' overwhelming rejection of amalgamations and to scrap the reform process for all metropolitan councils who do not wish to amalgamate. A very good reason for this is that Labor initiated it and it is a bad idea.
