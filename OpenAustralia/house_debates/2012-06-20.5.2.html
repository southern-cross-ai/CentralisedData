        The capital investment in the program will have economic benefits in these locations for local industry, with significant opportunities for subcontractors and the construction industry over the next three years.
       </p>
       <p>
        The total capped budget for the program is $899.6 million, which includes $752.7 million plus

        , which provides for the construction costs; management and design fees; furniture, fittings and equipment; contingencies; and an escalation allowance.

       <p>
        Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence in late 2012 and is planned to be completed on all sites by mid-2015. I commend the motion to the House.

       </p>
       <p>
        DHA purchased this well-located land from the private market via a private treaty in late 2011. The site was selected due to its close proximity to established shopping and service facilities at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rouse_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Rouse Hill

        and the Parramatta CBD.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposal will involve development of the site over two stages with stage 1 consisting of general, civil and roadworks for the development of 65 serviced allotments; and stage 2 consisting of the construction of 34 dwellings for defence personnel use in the form of 26 integrated townhouses and eight detached dwellings.
       </p>
       <p>
        The estimated overall project cost is $22.834 million, including GST and excluding the cost of the land. The cost will be met by DHA and recovered through the sale of surplus lots and the DHA sale and leaseback program.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subject to parliamentary approval, civil construction is expected to commence in April 2013 with dwelling construction to be completed by December 2014. I commend the motion to the House.

        Moorebank Units Relocation, Holsworthy, NSW.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 23 April 2012, the Australian government announced its commitment to facilitate delivery of an intermodal terminal by mid-2017 at Moorebank, New South Wales. The future Moorebank Intermodal Terminal is to be developed on land currently occupied by a number of Defence units and facilities, the largest of which is the Australian Army's School of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_Engineering" rel="nofollow">
         Military Engineering
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Through the Moorebank Units Relocation project, the affected Defence units will be relocated from the Moorebank site into the new facilities to be constructed at the nearby
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holsworthy_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
         Holsworthy Barracks
        </a>
        by the end of 2014. The project proposes to establish five new precincts within the existing Holsworthy Barracks cantonment, which will include the provision of new working, training, living and support facilities for all relocated Defence units.
       </p>
       <p>
        As part of establishing the new precincts, the project also proposes to improve the overall capability of the base by upgrading or replacing inadequate and non-compliant essential engineering services. Within the new entry precinct, the project also proposes to provide upgraded security arrangements and a new entry to Holsworthy Barracks to address local traffic congestion issues, which will involve the development of a new intersection on Heathcote Road.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to the facilities required at Holsworthy Barracks to support the relocated Moorebank units, several new multi-use facilities are also proposed to be provided by the project to better support the increased base population and to achieve improved cost efficiencies and operational synergies. Redundant facilities beyond their economic life in the vicinity of the proposed new works will be demolished. With about 2,000 construction jobs to be generated by this project over the next three years, it is expected that this project will provide major economic benefits for the wider Sydney region and local industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        The decision to deliver an intermodal terminal at Moorebank has provided Defence the opportunity to consolidate its activities at Holsworthy Barracks and to achieve cost-effective capability upgrades. This is consistent with extant Defence policy of co-locating units to achieve enhanced operational outcomes and improved operating efficiencies.
       </p>
       <p>
        The estimated out-turned cost of the proposed work is $869.999 million plus GST. Subject to parliamentary approval of the project, the main construction program is scheduled to commence no later than January 2013 and all works are planned to be completed by late 2015. I commend the motion to the House.
