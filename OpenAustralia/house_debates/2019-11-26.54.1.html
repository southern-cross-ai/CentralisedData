         I thank the member for his question. He, like everyone on this side of the House, understands how important it is that businesses have access to skilled and job-ready workers. We understand how important it is for workers to be able to access the skills that they need, because skills are the opportunity for them to proceed and to do well and the opportunity for all Australians to do well. We understand how important it is that we have a world-class vocational education and training sector here in Australia.

           Thank you, Mr Speaker. That has given me the opportunity to point out that when Labor were last in office, in their last year, they oversaw nine successive cuts to employer incentives in vocational education—$1.2 billion in cuts. Those opposite were responsible for bringing vocational education and training in this country to its knees, and we are the ones that have methodically gone about rebuilding vocational education and training in this sector, starting with the announcement of the Joyce review about 12 months ago and then announcing its recommendations just in April this year. That was on top of the investment of $585 million.

We have commenced nationwide consultations with stakeholders to design the National Skills Commission, the National Careers Institute and Skills Organisation pilots. We've got agreement on and announced reforms to the Australian Skills Quality Authority. We've announced a Skills Organisation pilot in the mining sector. We've announced Industry Training Hubs—including in the member for Herbert's electorate in Townsville—so that we can build connections between local industries and schools. We've commenced the Productivity Commission's review of the National Agreement for Skills and Workforce Development. We hosted the inaugural
