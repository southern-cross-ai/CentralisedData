        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rental_Affordability_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
         National Rental Affordability Scheme
        </a>
        is designed to encourage large-scale investment in affordable housing.
       </p>
       <p>
        The scheme offers tax and cash incentives to providers of new dwellings on the condition that they are rented to low- and moderate-income households at 20 per cent below market rates.
       </p>
       <p>
        The incentive comprises a Commonwealth contribution in the form of a refundable tax offset or payment to the value of $6,000 per dwelling per year, and a state or territory contribution in the form of direct financial support or an in-kind contribution to the value of at least $2,000 per dwelling per year.
       </p>
       <p>
        The incentive will be provided for a period of 10 years to complying participants, and will be indexed in line with the rental component of the consumer price index.
       </p>
       <p>
        The National Rental Affordability Scheme Bill 2008 establishes the National Rental Affordability Scheme. The explanatory memorandum to that bill provides further information on the scheme.
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <a href="http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R3086" rel="nofollow">
         National Rental Affordability Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008
        </a>
        amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to enable entities participating in the National Rental Affordability Scheme to claim a refundable tax offset in their annual tax return. These entities include companies, superannuation funds and unit trusts.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill also amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to ensure that state and territory contributions to entities participating in the scheme, whether in cash or in-kind, are non-assessable and non-exempt income for taxation purposes. In addition, the bill ensures that there are no capital gains tax consequences from the receipt of incentives under the scheme.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bills implementing the National Rental Affordability Scheme fulfil one of the government’s important election commitments.
       </p>
       <p>
        The scheme aims to assist institutional investors, developers and not-for-profit groups to deliver 50,000 rental dwellings over the next four financial years by creating a new residential property asset class for property investors.
       </p>
       <p>
        If market demand remains strong, the government will make available another 50,000 incentives for a further 50,000 affordable rental dwellings over five years from July 2012.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government is strongly supportive of the work of the not-for-profit sector. Where the National Rental Affordability Scheme is consistent with the objectives of a not-for-profit body, the government welcomes their participation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The sector’s involvement is important to the successful implementation of the scheme. Under the right circumstances, not-for-profit groups could be tenancy managers, developers or owners of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRAS" rel="nofollow">
         NRAS
        </a>
        dwellings, as well as being members of consortiums. To ensure their participation, the government is making its contribution available as a cash payment for endorsed charities.
       </p>
       <p>
        If problems arise as a result of the genuine involvement of the not-for-profit sector in the National Rental Affordability Scheme, the government will consider what steps are required to better assist them to participate in this scheme.
       </p>
       <p>
        The National Rental Affordability Scheme is one of a number of measures the government is implementing to improve the affordability of housing for families and individuals with low- to moderate-income levels.
       </p>
       <p>
        Other measures include establishing the Housing Affordability Fund. This fund will be used to streamline development approval processes, and reduce infrastructure charges and regulatory costs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another measure is the audit of Commonwealth land to facilitate improved housing supply through the identification of surplus Australian, state and territory land for possible release for housing development.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government is also establishing the National Housing Supply Council to provide research, forecasts and advice to the Australian government and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Australian_Governments" rel="nofollow">
         Council of Australian Governments
        </a>
        on issues relating to the adequacy of housing and land supply to meet future housing needs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, the government’s program called A Place to Call Home will deliver 600 new dwellings for homeless people.
       </p>
       <p>
        Full details of the measure in the National Rental Affordability Scheme (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2008 are contained in the explanatory memorandum.
