        There will be many stories of the ways that COVID-19 has impacted us all, but today I want to share the story of one constituent whose moving story I came to know after sending him a 90th birthday card.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wallace" rel="nofollow">
         John Wallace

        to Australia with his bride, Margaret, in 1952. John spent his working life at the Coats Patons factory and Margaret worked as a personal assistant to the head of the

        before retraining as a teacher. John was active in the local

        community as a Rotarian and continues to play golf today with his 96-year-old golf partner.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently Margaret has moved to a nursing home due to ill health. Because of the restrictions in place this year for the first time in 68 years of marriage the couple were unable to be together for their wedding anniversary. John's son David wrote to me: 'My wish for them is that the awesome strategy that both our state and federal governments are undertaking to subdue COVID-19 will prevail and my parents will be together again.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Thanks to our community who have done the right thing, no matter how difficult, in staying home over the past few months. John and Margaret can be reunited tomorrow as restrictions ease slightly. To the people of Bass I say: thank you. Your efforts are working but it's not over yet. Please remain vigilant. For John and Margaret, I wish you every happiness.
