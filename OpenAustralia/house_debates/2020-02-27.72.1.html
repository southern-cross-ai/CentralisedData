         I thank the member for Cowper for his question. In his electorate, we're seeing the result of government investment and the ways it can shape a community's future. The member knows that all too well. He got elected because he fought hard. He advocated hard for the people of his
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_North_Coast" rel="nofollow">
          Mid North Coast

         electorate. This government has a plan for regional Australia, just like the member for Cowper has a plan for his people. We know that regional Australia is the engine room of our economy. When the regions are strong, so too is our nation. When the Mid North Coast is strong, so too is
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Infrastructure plays an integral role in our plan for the future. That important word 'plan'—a blueprint, a vision to unlock potential, whether it's in Cowper,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Macquarie" rel="nofollow">
          Port Macquarie

         or
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffs_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
          Coffs Harbour
         </a>
         ; wherever it is—is backed by a $100 billion infrastructure rollout over the next decade. Our regional communities are driven by industry, driven by agriculture, driven by tourism and driven by services, just to name a few. They need good infrastructure and they need a good plan, and with the Liberals and Nationals in government that is what they're getting, both at a federal level and, in New South Wales, at a state level. And by ensuring a strong economy, we create opportunities for businesses to grow, for small businesses to prosper and hire more people. Because it's small businesses that have enabled this nation to have 1½ million new jobs created since we came into government. It's a good plan. It's a good blueprint.

         Round 3 of the Building Better Regions Fund held tourism in focus. When we invest in regional tourism, we boost development. When tourists travel to a regional community they can see the vibrancy that's out there.

         is not broken. I've said it time and time again. Regional Australia deserves visiting. Regional Australia deserves investment. People should make, should consider, should think about that tree change and get out to regional Australia and see the vibrancy, see the development, see the prospects, see the future that is in regional Australia—just like in the member for Cowper's electorate.

           It is part of the plan, Member for Grayndler! It is certainly part of the plan. A $6½ million investment in the community through the BBRF is now open and running world-class events. We were there for the

           grand final. I won't tell you how the member for Cowper's drop-punt went into the crowd, but he was there. He was there with the local mayor, he was there with me, and we were there with a lot of supporters. And they were thrilled because he advocated hard for that stadium and he delivered. All part of the plan. All part of the blueprint. A project which
