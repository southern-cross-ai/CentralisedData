        My question is to the Prime Minister. There have been 437 Aboriginal deaths in custody since the royal commission delivered its final report. Prime Minister, if you don't want Black Lives Matters protests to continue, why don't you do something about institutionalised racism in this country? Will you agree with the Greens proposal to put action on black deaths in custody on the national cabinet meeting for this Friday and make it a standing agenda item for every future national cabinet meeting, with strict time lines for changes to the criminal law so that we stop locking up Aboriginal and

         I thank the member for the question on what is an extremely important issue, and that is Indigenous deaths, whether it be in police custody or it be in custody more generally. As the Minister for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         pointed out to the House yesterday, this already is a very significant issue of attention for not just the government but state and territory governments as well. It previously did feature, with two specific goals more broadly under justice headings in this area that related to the previous Closing the Gap objectives, but it is also featuring in the new, reformed set of Closing the Gap goals, which is now coming to agreement, for the first time having the direct involvement of Indigenous peak groups in agreeing what those goals should be.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is also the case that, in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         , for example, we are pleased that progress has been made. In police custody in New South Wales, I'm advised there has been one death since 2000, and in particular 2000 was when the new arrangements were put in place to provide access for Indigenous persons who found themselves in police custody to make calls and get access to legal advice. The government is now funding that program over the next three years, and that has proven to be a very effective mechanism to prevent deaths in police custody. Every death in custody, particularly Indigenous deaths in custody, is an absolute national shame and tragedy. What the Minister for Indigenous Australians has been working to do is also to address the contributing factors which find Indigenous Australians in custody.
        </p>
        <p>
         You asked about the agenda of the national cabinet. When I announced the formation of the national cabinet going forward, I also announced the establishment of the National Federation Reform Council. There are only two national task forces that report to that council. Importantly, one deals with these very issues in Indigenous affairs. The other one deals with violence against women. We all agreed—premiers, myself, chief ministers—that they were the issues that needed constant national priority and attention by the National Federation Reform Council, which brings all the key decision-makers together, and for progress to be tracked against the successes that we hope to achieve in that area.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our government is very committed to action in this area. It's an important issue. But when it comes to the issue of gatherings and protests, the health advice says it puts other Australians' lives at risk, including in particular Indigenous lives. I am sure the Leader of the Opposition would agree with me in saying: 'Do not go to those rallies. You are putting others' lives at risk.' The issue you raised is important, and it is understood and acknowledged, I believe, by all in this chamber. That is a great reflection on this country.
