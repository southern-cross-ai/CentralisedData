        I take the opportunity today to place on the record of this parliament the outstanding personal and career achievements of Lieutenant Commander Peter Johnson, late of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Hydrographic_Service" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Hydrographic Service
        </a>
        . Sadly, Peter passed away in April 2007, but on 16 June this year his work and expertise in lidar hydrography was recognised during an awards ceremony held during an international hydrography seminar. Peter was the recipient of the inaugural 532 Award, given to those who have significantly contributed to the advancement of technology and use of lidar bathymetry and airborne coastal mapping and charting. The award was presented at the Joint Airborne Lidar Bathymetry Technical Centre for Expertise 10
        <sup>
         th
        </sup>
        Annual Airborne Coastal Mapping and Charting Workshop held in Portland, Oregon, with over 80 representatives from government, academia and industry in attendance.
       </p>
       <p>
        Peter’s memory was also honoured during the evening by the creation of the Lieutenant Commander Peter Johnson Best Practices Award, exemplifying Peter’s dedication, professionalism, initiative and commitment to his field. Recipients of this award will have accomplished a complicated and demanding project or field operation within the previous two years and will be awarded at their annual awards night.

        Throughout his career, Peter provided significant professional service to the Australian Hydrographic Service, which is based in my town of Wollongong, and is remembered with fondness and respect by its personnel today. In 2004, Peter was awarded a

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Navy" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Navy
        </a>
        between 1970 and 1989, when he transferred to the Royal Australian Navy. He initially served in

        </a>

        Peter is sadly missed by his many friends and work colleagues, who were very impressed by his professionalism and dedication. I hope that the recognition of this parliament of his outstanding achievements gives even more pride to his wife, Alaniera, and his five children and their children.
