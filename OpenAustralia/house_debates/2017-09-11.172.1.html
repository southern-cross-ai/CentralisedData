       <p>
        In my short time as a member of the House, I've learned that it's incumbent on and important for us to be good listeners and to engage with our local community. We must connect on a regular basis with our constituents. We must walk the streets and talk to our small businesses. It's my willingness to maintain a grassroots approach to my role that led me to create several Fisher councils, which aim to give me snapshot views of the people in Fisher. During the last week of August I held separate meetings of the Fisher business, youth and seniors councils, which prompted robust and honest discussions about issues important to each of these sectors of our community. Our businesspeople told me they're keen to see ongoing investment in infrastructure, more security in employment and reforms in housing affordability. The youth council also had a housing focus, along with industrial relations and tax reforms. The seniors council reflected more on issues of the impact of the cost of living, health insurance premiums, superannuation and of course electricity and gas. The views shared at these meetings provide me with a very clear indication and a greater understanding of the struggles and daily challenges faced by people in our community. I'd like to thank all those members of the three councils for their work and for giving me their great feedback.
