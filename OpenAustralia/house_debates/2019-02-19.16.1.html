        saw another terrorist attack in a region known for its instability, Kashmir. Forty-four Indian paramilitary police were killed when a suicide bomber rammed a car into a bus they were travelling in. This was the deadliest attack in the region for decades. Islamist militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed claimed responsibility for the attack. This attack has been rightly condemned around the world, including by our Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs. I would like to associate myself with comments made by our leaders. This was a horrific and senseless attack, and my deepest condolences go out to the victims, survivors and their families. We must all stand together to defeat terrorism, and our thoughts are with the Indian people at this time.

        My electorate of Bennelong is one of the most multicultural in the country, and as such it has a very large Indian community. This community is particularly well connected with their roots back to their mother country, and I know that events like this affect this community deeply. We're very lucky to have such a strong
