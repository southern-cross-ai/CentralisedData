        have a very clear choice: to support the pro-jobs, pro-infrastructure Baird government or to return to the incompetence of the New South Wales Labor Party, which of course was writ large for all to see over 16 sorry years, and nowhere more so than in the area of infrastructure, where, over a 16-year period, the Labor Party did one of two things: (a) nothing—and that is what happened most of the time—and (b) incompetent construction.
