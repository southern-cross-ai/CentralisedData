       <p>
        As the federal member for Wentworth, I often hear from young people in my electorate who feel disenchanted with the political process. They feel as though their voices are not being heard. I'm keen to fix this. I often say to people that the political system in Australia is only as good as we make it, and the level of engagement, particularly of young people, will materially determine the quality of our elected representatives and the quality of our decisions as well. That is why I am seeking the assistance of young people aged from 14 to 24, living or studying in my electorate of Wentworth, to help me build and to participate in the first Wentworth Youth Advisory Committee. It's my hope that this youth advisory committee will help raise the voices of young people from a variety of backgrounds, a variety of life experiences and a variety of political opinions, and those whose views are not as well represented in the political debate as they should be.
       </p>
       <p>
        As many of us who participated in the Raise Our Voice campaign know, when given the opportunity young people are only too willing and enthusiastic to put their views forward and help shape the political debate, and I want to make sure that that's an ongoing part of my representation. So, if this sounds like you or someone you know, please encourage them or yourself to speak up and be heard. I'd like to know what issues are important to you as a young Australian. What issues would you like me to raise right here in parliament on your behalf? Please reach out to me and share your thoughts.
