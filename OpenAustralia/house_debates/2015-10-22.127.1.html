       <p>
        This morning I want to inform the House about a trial that I am seeking to establish for a Greater Geelong youth council, which would be a forum for constituents living in the electorate of Corio who are aged between 15 and 25. The aim of trying to establish a Greater Geelong youth council is to provide young people with an opportunity to engage on a regular basis with me as their local member of parliament. Unlike other constituent or community organisations, there are few opportunities for young people to voice their concerns and ideas and to lobby their local politicians.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Greater Geelong youth council would comprise two students from each secondary school and two students who are in higher education or employment. This forum would provide an excellent opportunity for students to develop their leadership skills and gain confidence and would give them voice to create positive change in their community. I will be writing to the principals of

        and The Gordon. In doing so, I will be asking them to nominate two students, one to act as a delegate to the Greater Geelong youth council and one as an alternative who lives in the electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Greater Geelong youth council will aim to convene the first meeting of this council in the 2016 calendar school year, with the help of our local principals, a number of whom have expressed their support for this idea of establishing a Greater Geelong youth council as a way to better convey the worrying concerns that local students have about their communities and schools. This council will provide an invaluable perspective of the youth of Corio and will help in bringing the concerns of future generations to the attention of me as a federal parliamentarian. The Greater Geelong youth council and its trial will be organised through my office. We are keen to commit to an initial meeting next year and to hear the views of those local students.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the time remaining to me, I would also like to take the time to wish students currently sitting exams and coming to an end of their secondary education the best of luck. I am sure they will make an outstanding contribution to Geelong and the Greater Corio electorate in their future careers. The

I would like to tell all the students heading into their final exams that, while they are of course very important, life will go on once they are over, no matter what happens. I, as the member for Corio, and indeed the wider community are all supporting you. Good luck.
