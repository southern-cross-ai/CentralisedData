        I am extremely proud of my electorate of Dobell, but unfortunately there is one thing that no-one is proud of. Statistically, the electorate of Dobell has the second highest rate of domestic and family violence in

         New South Wales
        </a>
        . This figure is shocking, saddening, frightening and completely unacceptable. In my role as an elected member, I believe it is my responsibility to bring about change and opportunities that make lifelong positive impacts that involve all members of my electorate. It is my role to be a voice and stand up for those who cannot—namely children.

        Child abuse and neglect is one of Australia's biggest social issues. The
        <i>
         Report on government services
        </i>
        of 2015 reported that during 2013-14 nationally claims that were investigated and substantiated identified 40,844 children between the ages of zero and 17 years who had been abused or neglected. At the end of June 2014, 45,746 children aged zero to 17 years were subject to care and protection orders across Australia, and 43,009 children were placed in out-of-home care. Emotional abuse against Australian children was reported as the highest primary substantiated harm type, with neglect, physical abuse and sexual abuse following in sequential order. These figures are just the reported statistics. As stated by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Institute_of_Health_and_Welfare" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Institute of Health and Welfare
        </a>
        :
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Child protection statistics are the best available indicator of the extent of the problem of child abuse and neglect in Australia. However, they do not reveal with accuracy how many children in the community have been abused or neglected.
       </p>
       <p>
        I hate to imagine what the figure would be if all cases of child abuse were reported.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tragically, this is the reality of child abuse in this country. This issue has no sides, and it does not discriminate. It is found in all societies, communities, demographics and suburbs, and it is one of our most shameful statistics. In Australia, we are fortunate to have such organisations as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Association" rel="nofollow">
         National Association
        </a>

        </a>
        and Neglect, the Australian Childhood Foundation, Bravehearts, and Adults Surviving Child Abuse available to advocate and provide support for the victims of child abuse.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is the National Association for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect that promotes the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play_Your_Part" rel="nofollow">
         Play Your Part
        </a>
        campaign designed to encourage community involvement and play a part in creating a child-friendly community. Research indicates that one of the most effective ways to prevent child abuse and neglect before it starts is by building child-friendly communities that support and value children and families. Too often in our community people find it difficult to stand up for those who are suffering and those who do not have a voice. Often people turn a blind eye to the obvious, whether through denial of the reality that is occurring, fear of legal ramifications or genuine belief in not getting involved in someone else's problems.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given the startling statistics that I shared earlier, this is an issue we need to take responsibility for and openly discuss. We need to stop and think that we could be the only person who could make a difference to a child's life. Many adult survivors of child abuse believe that the continued abuse causes more harm than any action taken to stop the abuse. Community members may think that they are overreacting or mistaken when it comes to actually reporting abuse. They may be worried that they will be seen by others as interfering or breaking up a family. The reality is that families need help when abuse is present in the home. Reporting suspected abuse can be critical in preventing further abuse of the children or young people in that family, and this includes the reporting of domestic or family violence. Reporting abuse can help families receive the support that they require. Reporting suspected child abuse is not dobbing someone in and it is not interfering. Importantly, it is not turning a blind eye to something you know is wrong. Reporting child abuse creates a safer community for our children to live in—and this is a simple fact.
       </p>
       <p>
        Victims of child abuse suffer not only at the time but also into the future. It is the effects on the victims and the community that can never be measured. As stated on the Family Relationships Online website, 'One of the most damaging things about child abuse is that it is usually done by a person whom the child knows and trusts.' Young children who look up to and believe in the adults who are important in their lives will often put up with all sorts of treatment. The effects of child abuse and neglect can be significant and often lead to lifelong problems. In the short term, child abuse can impact on a child's brain development and how they think and feel about themselves. It affects how successful they are at school and it affects their physical development, skills and behaviour. Long-term child abuse can lead to drug and alcohol abuse, mental health issues and complications with developing and maintaining healthy relationships. Alarmingly, in too many cases, the cycle is repeated when the abused becomes the abuser. It is imperative that this cycle of abuse is broken.
       </p>
       <p>
        A recent report commissioned by the Adults Surviving Child Abuse lobby group utilised data from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Bureau of Statistics
        </a>
        to identify that dealing with the widespread effects of child abuse costs Australia $9 billion a year. The report states that addressing child sexual, emotional and physical abuse alone could lead to a potential minimum gain of $6.8 billion for the combined federal, state and territory governments. The report also states that active, timely and comprehensive intervention with appropriate support, resources, services and treatment enable adult survivors to participate more fully and productively in the Australian community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The need for early prevention and intervention is also highlighted by the fact that child abuse can often be a recurring issue in families. The most recent discussions regarding child protection policy and its future in Australia involves the recognition that numbers of child protection notifications and children being placed in care are increasing at a concerning and, most likely, unsustainable rate. Child abuse is a complex and difficult issue that combines a myriad of factors and jurisdictions, but it is our role to ensure that these policies, procedures and programs are as simple as possible so that they can be easily implemented and delivered. Problems with the system currently include, but are not limited to, an increase in the number of notifications placing a greater strain on the system's ability to assess and process them; resources tending to focus on the investigation and assessment phases with less available for prevention and treatment; and children themselves having little input into any decisions made about their involvement in the system.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, in the sadness of child abuse there is also hope. Recently, I met with Greg and Dawn Floyd, a couple in Dobell, who open their hearts and their homes to foster children in need of care. Greg and Dawn operate Cowboy Church at Beulah Ranch in Yarramalong Valley. Here, in this picturesque surrounding, Greg and Dawn tackle firsthand the abuse faced by the children who come to them for respite. Through their patience, kindness and love they are able to provide a sense of trust and security to children in need. Greg and Dawn teach the children, who have been placed in foster care due to abusive situations, how to create trust and bonds with animals on their ranch, which ultimately leads to stronger relationships between the child and the adults who are trying to help them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Greg and Dawn provide the opportunity for children to come to a safe haven, and they encourage them to participate in hands-on activities to create tangible objects whilst taking the time to listen and care for these children who genuinely feel that they have been forgotten. Listening to some of the stories shared by Greg and Dawn, I can honestly say that my heart broke for these children and what they have been subjected to in their young lives. Greg and Dawn have the passion and dedication to turn Beulah Ranch into a fully functional respite centre for foster children who have experienced abuse. It is my aim to help support them in their dream as much as I can.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Central Coast has many dedicated, passionate and devoted community members who deal with issues of child abuse on a daily basis. To them I say: thank you for taking time in a role which I can only imagine challenges even those with the hardest shelled exteriors. I am planning on using my role and responsibility as a federal member to stand up for and speak out in support of those who cannot and to provide assistance to the organisations that encounter child abuse on a daily basis.
       </p>
       <p>
        The issue of child abuse is one that every member of parliament should be continually striving to make a positive difference on. We need to work together to implement cohesive, proven strategies to combat this problem and ensure that perpetrators of child abuse crimes are made appropriately accountable for their actions. As stated in the report on the national framework for protecting Australia's children 2009-2020:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our children must be able to grow up nourished and supported in loving and caring environments. They must have time to be children with all the wonder, happiness and innocence that childhood should bring.
       </p>
       <p>
        All children have the right to be safe and receive loving care and support. The best way to protect children is to prevent child abuse and neglect from occurring in the first place.
