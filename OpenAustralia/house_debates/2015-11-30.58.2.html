        My question is also to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. In a press conference immediately after deposing the member for Warringah, the Minister for Foreign Affairs said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … we've already announced climate targets for Paris in December and I expect those targets to continue.
       </p>

        But
        <i>
         The Australian
        </i>
        reports today that the Prime Minister will tell the Paris conference that there is scope to consider more ambitious targets. Exactly what is the position of the government?

         <p>
          The Prime Minister reiterated, in Paris and to
          <i>
           The Australian
          </i>
          newspaper, that the targets of 26 per cent to 28 per cent will not be negotiated at the Paris climate change conference. I have a mandate from the Australian government that was passed by the cabinet and endorsed by the party room for 26 per cent to 28 per cent. That is our target. That is the target that the Prime Minister was speaking about. He was not changing government policy. Government policy remains the same. Our target is 26 per cent to 28 per cent.
         </p>
         <p>
          What he was referring to—if the member had bothered to read the article—was that it is government policy to look, in 2017, at the question of the use of international units. That has always been our policy. It is also government policy to consider reviews for all countries that sign on to reducing greenhouse gas emissions reductions in five years time. In fact, I said last week, in answer to a question here, that we believe countries should review their targets every five years. If they are not meeting their target they can change their action. If they are exceeding their target they can raise it. It can be calibrated every five years. This has been government policy since August.

           My question is also to the Minister for Foreign Affairs.

How does this compare with other proposed approaches?

            for his question. The government is, as he knows, taking strong and effective action to reduce our contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions. We will meet and, indeed, exceed the existing 2020 target. We have put measures in place to support the uptake of new technologies to improve energy efficiency. We will meet our 2020 target; indeed, as the Minister for the Environment said, we will exceed it. We have committed to reduce emissions by 26 to 28 per cent on 2005 levels by 2030. This compares well to other countries. On a per capita basis our emissions will be reduced by half. It will reduce emissions per unit of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
             GDP
            </a>
            by two-thirds.
           </p>
           <p>
            Australia accounts for just over one per cent of global emissions and, therefore, we should be part of a coordinated global agreement that includes the major emitters, our major trading partners and, indeed, developed and developing countries. Any agreement must set a common basis for all countries to take action to reduce emissions, to provide transparency and accountability—and that is what we will be negotiating in Paris—and to set five-year reviews to monitor global progress.
           </p>
           <p>
            The coalition has adopted a target that is environmentally and economically responsible and one that we are confident we will achieve. The opposition has taken the opposite approach. They have plucked a figure out of the air—a reckless, pie-in-the-sky target of 45 per cent—that will be a huge hit to the Australian economy. The opposition has no idea how they will achieve their target other than through a supercharged carbon tax.

                and wholesale electricity prices would be about 80 per cent higher by 2030. That is what the opposition are proposing. The 45 per cent target that Labor is putting forward would cost Australia's economy billions of dollars. Labor would need a carbon price of $200 a tonne to meet its 45 per cent target—10 times Labor's failed carbon target. The

                 Climate Change
                </a>
                Authority modelling commissioned by Labor itself in 2013 indicates that a target of around 45 per cent would cost the economy over $600 billion. That is Labor's way. Labor's target of 45 per cent is absolutely fanciful. This government is committed to real and effective global action that will reduce emissions with a strong achievable target that will not cost jobs and will not hit the economy with a $600 billion tax.

                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingsford_Smith" rel="nofollow">
                  Kingsford Smith
                 </a>
