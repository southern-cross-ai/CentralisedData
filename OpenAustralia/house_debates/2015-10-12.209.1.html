       <p>
        The first week in October is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_Health" rel="nofollow">
         Mental Health
        </a>
        Awareness Week. I cannot imagine too many people could say they do not know someone who has a mental health issue or who has never experienced any aspect of mental illness. One of the significant events in Shoalhaven is The Big Crack Up musical variety night. Jon Strang, group leader of the committee for the Shoalhaven Mental Health Fellowship, has been instrumental—no pun intended—along with the musical director, Emil Suljic, in co-ordinating the 16th such event. Many of those performing have, at some stage, had to deal with or continue to deal with mental illness. Other performers, from the goodness of their hearts, perform for free at this event.

        Local community groups recognise how important music is for both those who are new performers and those in the audience, so they provide sponsorship. They include the Saint Georges Basin Country Club, the

        and the Shoalhaven Entertainment Centre management. The staff of the entertainment centre were, in Jon's words, 'Just fantastic!' The performers giving their time and talent included Greg and Emil,

        , Maya, Maverick, Virtual Street Corner Band, Edgehogs, Dos Enos, Janine, Tasty Mortals and Jam Tarts, and another group of talented blokes singing original songs, Glen and Warwick, who I know from their day jobs—one is a great manager of parks and gardens and the other a great visual artist. The multi-talent in our community is simply amazing. Of special note were Dos Enos, a group of very skilled young men who stated that they felt honoured to be able to perform in front of such a crowd, and also the Jam Tarts. Well done Deb for all your voice, and the double bass was absolutely soulful.
