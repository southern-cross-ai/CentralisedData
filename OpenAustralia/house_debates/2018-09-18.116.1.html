        There is a devastating drought gripping Central Western New South Wales at the moment, but when times are tough in the bush our country communities come together. One place that this happens is at our country shows. I recently had the pleasure of attending a number of country shows, it being show season in the central west. One of them was the Burraga Sheep Show and Country Fair. It was another resounding success.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was the 59th annual Burraga Sheep Show and Country Fair, and I'd like to acknowledge the hardworking committee that made the day such a success, including president

        —well done, Neil—treasurer Charles Lamburn and secretary Barbara Pearce as well committee members Leon Booth, Ken Stapleton and Chris Francis. The show wouldn't be possible without the help of many volunteers, including Shirley Stapleton, Alex Booth, Kerry Francis, Sandra Stapleton and Ross and Katrina McDonald. A big thank you to Bathurst Citizen of the Year,

        , for opening the show and for her ongoing work with drought relief locally. Congratulations to Rhyannah Larnach for organising the showgirl competition, and to 2018 showgirl Tahlia Milbank. There was a huge array of handicrafts and activities. There was something there for everyone. So I'm looking forward to the 60th Burraga Sheep Show and Country Fair next year.
       </p>

        I also attended the Eugowra Show on the weekend. It was the 105th annual show at Eugowra. It featured ute barrel racing, a demolition derby, dog jumping, and spectacular fireworks. Again, there was something there for everyone. I'd like to congratulate president Tony Toohey, who was awarded a life membership for 40 years of service to the Eugowra Show Society. I also congratulate secretary Sean Haynes, treasurer Kevin Townsend; chief pavilion steward

        Eugowra Show also featured the unveiling of the new Eugowra flag, which was designed by year 6 St Joseph's student Ashton Gates. That flag features

        , which is of course made from Eugowra granite. So there is a very close connection between this place and the wonderful town of Eugowra. I would like to thank all of the folks there at Eugowra for putting on such a wonderful show. I thank all of our hardworking volunteers across our region; they are the fabric of our country communities, bringing us together even when times are tough. The tremendous crowds that have been supporting our country shows have been truly heartening. Long may it continue; you can't beat a country show.
