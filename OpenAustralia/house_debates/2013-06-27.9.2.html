       <p>
        In terms of this motion, the member for Cook has just spoken for 15 minutes on what is a standard procedural resolution: that we deal with the legislation that was before the House last night when the parliament adjourned. When the parliament adjourned, we had had the full suite of speakers from all sides of the House, and the crossbenchers had already contributed to this debate. Indeed, it was one of the longest debates that we have had in the 43rd parliament whereby every member has been given an opportunity to make a contribution. We then had a vote on the second reading and we had that carried. We then had amendments moved by the government and we had a debate on those government amendments and they were carried. We then had a debate about amendments moved by the opposition and they were lost. We even had a debate on amendments moved by the member for the Kennedy and they were also dealt with by the parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        The only section of this bill that remains to be determined by this parliament is the third reading. That is all that is to be determined. In terms of the third reading of the bill, it became clear last night that the member for Cook—in spite of the fact that commitments had been made by the opposition that they would facilitate the suspension of the House at the agreed time—chose himself to say that he had no regard for the agreements that had been stated and agreed to by the opposition.
       </p>
       <p>
        From time to time in this place, agreements are made between the government and the opposition in order to facilitate arrangements. They are done on the basis of common decency and honouring those agreements. This agreement was made last night, just as later this morning, when this is dealt with, the member for Lyne, who is waiting to give his valedictory, will give it in response to a committee report, which is not an unusual circumstance in which a valedictory speech is given.
       </p>
       <p>
        This proposition by the member for Cook is simply designed to, firstly, make the rest of the parliament and the nation endure a 15-minute speech that did not say anything at all; and, secondly, to confirm that in terms of agreements that are reached, those opposite, essentially, want to facilitate a ridiculous filibuster of this legislation. Everyone has had an opportunity to consider this legislation. There is no-one who can argue that this is not bringing something on—
