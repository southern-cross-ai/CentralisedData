        On Tuesday night the federal government continued to demonstrate its commitment to supporting Tasmanian industry, with the announcement of an extension to the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme. The $89.3 million commitment will extend the scheme's assistance to include eligible imported goods that have no Australian-made equivalent. Quite rightly, this is a vote of confidence by the Morrison Government in the Tasmanian freight and logistics sector. Importantly, it will also provide greater assistance for agriculture, forestry, fisheries, manufacturing and mining industries as we continue to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the last year, industry in Tasmania has faced unparalleled challenges, including soaring international freight rates, infrastructure charges and general global disruption in the supply chain models. This is on top of the ever-present challenge that Tasmanian businesses face, which is the increasing cost of shipping across the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_Strait" rel="nofollow">
         Bass Strait
        </a>
        . There is no direct international shipping service into Tasmania. All international shipping is trans-shipped via mainland ports.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to take this opportunity to recognise the resilience and the dogged determination of world-leading businesses and that sector in Tasmania. Their response to the pandemic has demonstrated what Tasmania and its industries are capable of achieving, not only in the last year but also for the future. Led by the resurgent agriculture, forestry, fisheries, advanced manufacturing and mining industries, Tasmania is continuing to lead the way in our economic recovery. Despite all that has been thrown their way, Tasmanians have the most confident business sector in the country.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I also want to specifically recognise Brett Charlton, Chairman of the Tasmanian Logistics Committee, and the work that he has done on behalf of his members to advocate for the extension of the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme. Brett himself said there is a story of sweat and tears that is often lost in these positive outcomes, but I can tell you that no-one has sweated more than Brett Charlton and his team at that committee. In Brett's own words, 'This extension is a moment for the Tasmanian economy that will shape our trading community for many years to come.' I can't agree with him more. Brett said the extension is something that I fiercely advocated for, and he paid tribute to my work in also achieving this goal.
       </p>
       <p>
        The flow of benefits to Tasmania and its economy at the time that we need it most cannot be overstated. This funding will drive Tasmanian industries' bottom line. It will potentially attract new industry and create in the great state of Tasmania increased investment and, crucially, increases in employment opportunities right across the great state.
