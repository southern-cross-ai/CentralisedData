       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Postal_Corporation" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Postal Corporation
        </a>
        and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2024 will strengthen regulatory regimes for domestic and international mail screening, inspection and, where warranted, intervention.
       </p>
       <p>
        The postal sector is in rapid transformation and responding to changes in technology, consumer preferences and markets, including ecommerce driving substantial growth of international parcels.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia's international mail gateways, where incoming and outgoing mail is screened and processed, are being placed under increasing pressure due to rising volumes and growing threats to Australia's biosecurity and national security.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is essential that Australia is well-equipped to mitigate and respond to any risks that arise in the mail stream. This is why the government is ensuring the legislation that governs the security of postal articles continues to be fit for purpose and provides operational flexibility so our border agencies can adapt and lawfully respond to the changing threat environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        In response to these issues and challenges, the bill will make amendments to the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 to improve the operation of the information sharing arrangements between
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Post
        </a>
        and border agencies and the rules for opening and examining of postal articles.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill contains measures that will enhance the disclosure of information and documents in relation to postal articles between Australia Post and government agencies. A new exception will be introduced to the disclosure regime to better facilitate information sharing with Commonwealth, state and territory bodies to assist in the performance of their functions or duties. This will provide greater clarity on the agencies and purposes for which Australia Post is able to share information and documents. Existing exceptions will continue to apply.
       </p>
       <p>
        Information-sharing arrangements will be further enhanced by new provisions that will permit secondary disclosures of information and documents between government agencies, under strict parameters. This will support border protection and law enforcement outcomes and ensure alignment across levels of government.
       </p>
       <p>
        The measures for enhanced information-sharing arrangements have been designed with appropriate privacy safeguards and are reasonable, appropriate and justified.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia Post and border agencies have consistently raised concerns about ambiguities in the current law due to changes in the way technology has been employed to support processing and screening of articles, and evolving risks in the mail stream.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill therefore contains a number of amendments to simplify terminology and legislative processes to provide greater certainty to Australia Post employees, and customs and biosecurity officers, when exercising their legislative powers and functions for the inspection and examination of mail, and ease the burden of compliance.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another key element of the bill is a new measure to ensure that as the threat environment changes, postal articles suspected of containing explosive, dangerous and injurious goods are able to be handled appropriately and safely. The amendments will incorporate these provisions currently contained in Australia Post's terms and conditions into legislation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill will also make minor and technical amendments to clarify the operation of certain provisions of the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989
        <i>
         ,
        </i>
        and minor consequential amendments to the Criminal Code Act 1995for consistency with amendments to the act.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is proposed schedule 1 to the bill would commence on proclamation, but not later than six months after royal assent. This will allow sufficient time for Australia Post and border agencies to prepare for any necessary operational changes.
       </p>
       <p>
        In summary, the proposed amendments will contribute to immediate enhancements to Australia's border protection, biosecurity and national security, and provide greater flexibility for Australia Post and border agencies to lawfully deal with current and emerging security risks in the mail stream. I commend the bill to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
