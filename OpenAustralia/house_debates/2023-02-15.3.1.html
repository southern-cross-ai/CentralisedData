       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) Australia has signed the Global Methane Pledge to reduce methane emissions by 30 per cent by 2030;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) methane is the second most abundant greenhouse gas released into the atmosphere and is over 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a 20 year period;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) the fossil fuel sector accounts for nearly 40 per cent of Australia's methane emissions; and

        That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) notes that every 31 minutes someone in Australia is diagnosed with blood cancer, many of whom will require a lifesaving blood stem cell transplant, with:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) a greater success seen when utilising transplants from the bone marrow of younger donors, particularly men aged 18 to 35 years;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) patients more likely to find a donor match with those who share a similar ethnic background;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) 30 per cent of patients finding a match within their family, and 70 per cent needing to find an unrelated donor through the Australian Donor Registry; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) a shortage of donors, so that 80 per cent of Australian patients will require a donation from an overseas donor;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) acknowledges that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) blood donations are currently the main avenue for individuals to join the blood stem cell donor registry in Australia, while cheek swab testing, primarily used overseas, makes the process quicker, easier, and far less intrusive;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) dependency on foreign donations has halved in nations that utilise cheek swab testing, whereas Australia's dependency has increased;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) cheek swab testing increases the rate of domestic donations, saving countless lives in the process; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) the Australian Bone Marrow Donor Registry's program,
        <i>
         Strength to Give
        </i>
        , demonstrated that cheek swab testing was a viable, cost-effective method of increasing Australia's donor pool; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) calls on the Government to work with organisations, such as the Australian Bone Marrow Donor Registry, to remove the legislative and regulatory impediments that are currently preventing a nationwide rollout of cheek swab-based donor enrolment and to deliver awareness campaigns to assist in increasing the rate of blood stem cell donations, particularly from Australia men aged 18 to 35 years.

        </a>
        ) clauses over the past 30 years in investment treaties and free trade agreements;

        (3) recalls that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) free trade agreement negotiations came to a standstill under the Government of Prime Minister Gillard arising from the refusal to include ISDS clauses in these agreements; and

       <p class="italic">
        (b) it took the re-election of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Coalition Government

        to get Australia's trade policy back on track; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) recognises that the current Government's decision to once again scrap ISDS clauses in new free trade agreements and renegotiate them in existing ones shows that the unions are controlling the Government and putting Australia's trade gains at risk.
