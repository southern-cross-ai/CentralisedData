        Mr Speaker, congratulations on your elevation. Fantastic, jaw dropping, heartwarming and iconicâ€”all words to describe the return of this year's Wynnum Fringe Festival in my electorate of Bonner. I rise tonight to celebrate this festival and its showcase of the arts over six jam-packed days last week. In the weeks leading up to it, there was an incredible buzz in our community. Every corner of the bayside was transformed with pop-up stages, bars, eateries and countless local businesses that offered their spaces to be used as performance venues. Everyone got involved, whether as a volunteer, patron, local business owner or performer. It was a true demonstration of our community spirit. We all embraced this festival and made it a celebration of the bayside. I must take this opportunity to acknowledge festival founder
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Oliver" rel="nofollow">
         Tom Oliver
        </a>
        , who has outdone himself this year with a passion for the local arts scene that is one in a million. The bayside is tremendously lucky to have Tom. I speak on behalf of the community in saying that his vision for this year's festival benefited not just the arts but also local businesses, community groups and our economy. Tom is putting the bayside on the map.
       </p>
       <p>
        We all love the arts. It brings us joy. It has a powerful way of bringing communities together, and it inspires the next generation of talent. The Morrison government is committed to the sector, and secured the return of the Wynnum Fringe Festival as an annual event by delivering $236,000 in funding. It's been another challenging year for our arts and creative sectors, but we're seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, and events like this give us great excitement as we enjoy the simple things that we have really missed.
       </p>

        It was a privilege to attend the Wynnum Fringe Festival's opening ceremony alongside Tom Oliver, Brisbane Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner and the community. What a turnout it was. As part of a special ceremony, the Quandamooka elders presented yana marumba, which means 'walk good'. We started at the shores of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moreton_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Moreton Bay
        </a>
        and walked up to the festival hub on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Terrace" rel="nofollow">
         Bay Terrace
        </a>
        , where we finished the night with a free street party. People of all ages came together for this ceremony, united by our love of the arts.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to take this opportunity to recognise the over 300 artists, performers and musicians that took over the bayside, entertaining locals and visitors alike. There was sell-out show after sell-out show, which speaks volumes of the level of talent that we were so honoured to have in town. We couldn't have been more excited to welcome them to the bayside. The countdown is on to next year's fringe festival, and I can't wait.
