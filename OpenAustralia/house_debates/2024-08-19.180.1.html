        I wish good luck to everyone competing in this weekend's Risdon Cup. The 60th anniversary of the Darling Downs' great rugby competition will take place at Toowoomba Sports Ground this weekend. I bring very sad news: out of the eight teams competing this weekend, there's only one Toowoomba team. In men's A grade, we have Dalby versus Goondiwindi. All the money's on Dalby. But I want to point out the great, the mighty, the fantastic
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toowoomba_Rangers" rel="nofollow">

        . I might've played for them once or twice! They came third this year. It was a great turnout. But there is a great chance for Toowoomba this weekend. The Toowoomba Bears, in the women's final, are playing against St George Roma. This is the first time Downs Rugby have played a 15-a-side season in the women's competition. It's been a great competition, a great show of strength for Downs Rugby. We're growing. We're getting better and better. B grade is the most important for some people. It is Dalby versus Gundyâ€”again, with both teams going for the triple.

        go to C grade, Dalby are playing Gatton. This could be three out of three for Dalby if things go bad for everybody else. But, for Gatton, it's the first time in 11 years they have made the final. It's great to see them back up at the top of the table. I want to thank all of the sponsors, particularly

        , who are getting right behind this event, and everyone who is going to turn up on the day, all the coaches and players, for making this such a wonderful event. I maintain my threat of another run in C grade sometime next year!
