        In the time available in the adjournment debate, on behalf of Rohan Fitzgerald, the Liberal candidate for Gippsland, I present a petition—the
        <i>
         Save our post office!
        </i>
        petition.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The petition read as follows—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives

        We therefore ask the House to: Direct Australia Post to retain postal services, including Billpay and parcel services, at the heritage-listed Post Office in Franklin Street, which is serviced by public transport and easily accessible to the elderly and disabled.

        Petition received.
       </p>
       <p>
        This petition has been signed by 3,821 residents who all share a common view and support the advocacy of Rohan Fitzgerald, the Liberal candidate for Gippsland. It points out that these residents are against the closure of Traralgon’s Franklin Street post office. It draws the attention of this House to this concern and the strong feeling that is held amongst the community about Australia Post canvassing the proposed relocation of postal services from Franklin Street to Church Street, Traralgon. The petitioners ask this parliament, with the support of Rohan Fitzgerald, to direct Australia Post to retain postal services, including Billpay and parcel services at the heritage listed post office in Franklin Street, which is served by public transport and is easily accessible to the elderly and the disabled of the community. Three thousand eight hundred and twenty-one petitioners support the advocacy of principal petitioner Rohan Fitzgerald, the Liberal candidate for Gippsland. I table that petition and ask the House to reflect on the strength of feeling that surrounds this topic.

        recognised that Rohan Fitzgerald, being part of the local community, has an authentic connection to the community and understands firsthand just how important this post office is to the local community. Yesterday there was a rally that brought together many people who have strong feelings about this. This rally also passed a motion. The motion was:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We, the people of Traralgon, call on the Prime Minister, the Hon.

         John Faulkner
        </a>
        , as the Ministers with executive responsibility for postal services to require Australia Post to retain as a fully functioning Post Office the existing Australia Post facility and outward on Franklin Street in Traralgon and stop the unnecessary imposition on our elderly, frail and disabled citizens.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rohan Fitzgerald recognised this concern some two months ago, when, on his own initiative, Rohan Fitzgerald, the Liberal candidate for Gippsland, sought a meeting with Australia Post. He conveyed to the representatives of Australia Post his concern and the heartfelt feeling of many residents in that area about the suggestion that this magnificent heritage listed building would no longer serve its valued purpose in the Traralgon community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rohan Fitzgerald was surprised and, frankly, shocked that the Australia Post representative canvassed the possibility of moving this post office to Church Street. Rohan Fitzgerald made it clear that in his view this was not what the community wanted and he vowed to fight this proposal with everything he had to offer. He has been supported by Harvey Pynt—someone known well to those opposite and in this House—who has respected and admired Rohan Fitzgerald’s endeavour to do everything he can to save this centrally located, well-utilised post office in Traralgon.
       </p>
       <p>
        The message that has come through Rohan Fitzgerald as the advocate and representative of an aggrieved community is that this closure is not something that they want. It is an outcome the community cannot afford to accept. That is why people have rallied around the efforts of Rohan Fitzgerald to bring to the attention of this nation what a concern the potential closure of this post office is. He has reflected on the extra demands it would place on the elderly, frail and disabled of Traralgon. He has highlighted how this facility, long-established as a heritage building, is close to businesses, public transport and parking. Rohan Fitzgerald made the point that it was convenient. It has been there for 100 years and now is not the time to move it. It should stay there and continue to carry out the valued service that it has provided to the Traralgon community. Rohan Fitzgerald recognised the strength of community sentiment and he kicked up a stink. He rallied the people around Traralgon to make it absolutely clear to Australia Post that the relocation of this facility was not acceptable.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have been given a survey that Australia Post is having done on its behalf by the Allen Consulting Group. Let me say to Australia Post: you do not need a survey to understand the strength of feeling. Rohan Fitzgerald has brought this issue to the public attention. He has been an outstanding advocate for an issue that the Traralgon community feel very strongly about. The 3,800-plus petitioners know this is a serious issue and that is why they value and admire the advocacy of Rohan Fitzgerald, the Liberal candidate for Gippsland. You do not need a survey to tell you that this is important: read the petition. For those members opposite, I wonder why Australia Post is asking the question:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia Post is a corporation owned by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Government

        . Is public ownership of Australia Post important to you?
