       <p>
        by leave—I have the honour to present the coalition's fourth investment statement to the parliament, reflecting the critical importance of productive foreign investment to the growth and job creation agenda of the government.
       </p>
       <p>
        The recently released foreign policy white paper described a more interdependent world in which Australia is actively pursuing its economic interests. In this world, remaining open and outward-looking is vital for Australia's strength and future prosperity. The international investment landscape is increasingly competitive and it is important that we maintain Australia's advantage through a dynamic and responsive trade and investment agenda. Openness connects our economy to a larger and often faster-growing marketplace. It enables Australia to benefit from the world's best goods, services, people, capital and ideas to grow our economy and to create more jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_investment" rel="nofollow">
         Foreign investment
        </a>
        is critical in this story. Without it, production, employment and incomes would all be lower. Our modern, comprehensive free trade agreements provide a competitive edge to Australian exporters and lower the prices for Australian consumers. They also promote and facilitate two-way flows of investment by providing certainty about foreign investment policy settings in Australia and in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTA" rel="nofollow">
         FTA
        </a>
        partner countries. Foreign investment is an essential part of Australia's economy, sustaining our regional communities and helping our small- and medium-sized businesses access the capital and opportunities they need to grow.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia's economy is in a strong position, growing significantly faster than many of our global peers over the last five years, averaging 2.8 per cent real
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
         GDP
        </a>
        growth compared with the advanced economy average over the same period of some 1.7 per cent. Treasury forecasts suggest even better days ahead, with real GDP growth expected to rise to three per cent for the year 2018-19. Our open and well-regulated stable economy, underpinned by strong institutions and a talented, highly skilled workforce, ensures Australia remains in an excellent position to continue to attract investment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia's unique advantages and this government's economic and policy credentials saw total foreign investment stocks in Australia rise by $153 billion, or five per cent, to some $3.2 trillion at the end of 2016. In 2016, the quantum of new foreign direct investment, what we call
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FDI" rel="nofollow">
         FDI
        </a>
        , into Australia was some $112.4 billion, showing Australia remains an attractive and trusted investment destination. This data is included in the
        <i>
         International Investment Australia 2016
        </i>
        publication which I'm launching today. I certainly commend this publication to the chamber.
       </p>
       <p>
        Well-regulated, productive foreign investment supplements domestic savings to increase and improve the economic opportunities available to Australians right across the country—from Cairns to Perth, Broome to Hobart. The government is determined to secure the benefits of foreign investment for Australia and to ensure those benefits are shared across the community. This is part of the government's unwavering focus on the creation of more and better-paying jobs, which has seen more than 350,000 Australians find work in the 12 months to October 2017.
       </p>
       <p>
        An open investment policy, however, is a means to an end, not an end in itself. The government's trade and investment agenda is delivering economic prosperity while ensuring we maintain the strengths of our traditional Australian society and our institutions. Over the last year, I have continued speaking with Australians across the country to ensure policy continues to reflect community expectations. We have listened. This government has continued to develop its investment framework, which I'd like to address in a moment. My report today comes in three parts. First is an update on some great examples of the productive foreign investment that's benefiting Australians. Second, I will outline how we're improving our competitiveness to remain an attractive destination in an increasingly competitive international investment environment. And third, I will report on the government's engagement with the Australian community on foreign investment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia has long been a beneficiary of productive foreign investment, helping us to prosper as a nation and to grow our important industries, like manufacturing and mining, which together have received more than 50 per cent of Australia's FDI stock, as well as our services sector, which employs four out of five Australian workers.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_States" rel="nofollow">
         The United States

        remains Australia's largest direct investor by a significant margin, representing more than 24 per cent of our total FDI stock. And

        -affiliated firms in Australia employ more than 335,000 locals, which represents around one in 35 jobs—US firms like Bechtel, one of the world's largest engineering, construction and project management companies, as well as Costco,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExxonMobil" rel="nofollow">
         ExxonMobil
        </a>
        and Boeing, which has invested over $1 billion in Australia. Their investments represent a very significant contribution to our economy and society.
       </p>
       <p>
        For decades, direct investment has been a central pillar of Australia's relationship with Japan. Indeed, this year we celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Australia-Japan agreement on commerce. A Japanese company helped to fund our growth as a minerals and energy superpower, developing some of our largest export industries, with long-term export contracts and associated investment opening up the riches of the Pilbara's iron ore, the Bowen Basin's coal and the North West Shelf's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNG" rel="nofollow">
         LNG
        </a>
        . These investments have driven regional development, creating tens of thousands of local jobs and bringing in export and tax revenue over many decades. This has helped to fund public services like schools, hospitals, roads and ports, through which Australians continue to benefit today. In July this year I launched the report
        <i>
         Japanese investment in Australia: a trusted partnership
        </i>
        . The report demonstrates that interest from Japanese companies in investment in Australia continues to grow, as well as diversifying into areas such as digital technologies, infrastructure and financial services. In the six years to 2016, Japanese FDI stock increased by 78 per cent, to some $90.9 billion, making Japan Australia's second-largest source of foreign direct investment behind the United States.
       </p>
       <p>
        After the United States and Japan, our third-largest source of FDI is the United Kingdom, whose investment increased in 2016 by 4.9 per cent to reach $67.9 billion, while investment from the Netherlands, our fourth largest source of FDI stock, increased by 5.3 per cent, to $50.4 billion. Indeed, direct investment stock from the European Union collectively represents around $164.8 billion, or around 21 per cent of our FDI stock. European interests in Australia remain strong. Investment from Germany, our 10th-largest source of FDI, increased by 15 per cent in 2016 and, as a whole, European Union FDI has increased by 7.1 per cent.
       </p>
       <p>
        Like US, Japanese and European investment before it, Chinese investment is delivering jobs and tax revenues and giving Australian businesses connections to overseas markets. Direct investment stock from China, while not yet at the same scale as that of our more established partners, has grown strongly, from negligible levels in 2005 to $41.9 billion in 2016. China now represents 5.3 per cent of our total FDI stock and is Australia's fifth-largest source of foreign direct investment. As China's economy transitions from investment-led to consumption-driven growth, its investment patterns are also changing, including in Australia. While early Chinese investment was centred largely on minerals and energy, and this remains a dominant sector for Chinese investment, we are now seeing a greater diversification into infrastructure, agriculture and tourism as well as services.
       </p>
       <p>
        In its 2017 report on Chinese investment in Australia, Deloitte Access Economics found that Chinese investment is also contributing significantly to the Australian tourism sector, an industry expected to grow by around 400 per cent by 2033. Tourism also creates significant downstream economic effects. For every dollar that's directly earned by tourism, another 82c is generated in other parts of the economy. Continued investment in the tourism sector will be integral to ensuring we build the hotels and infrastructure we need to ensure this very important sector meets its growth potential.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our many strengths as a nation have driven the establishment of long-term, mutually beneficial investment relationships. Consider the far-sighted people from the Italian confectionery giant Ferrero who chose to invest in Lithgow,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        , in the 1970s. Ferrero has been one of the town's largest employers for decades, with around 100 local staff working at the site producing
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic_Tac" rel="nofollow">
         Tic Tac
        </a>
        and Nutella. In 2013, Ferrero invested a further $70 million into Australia. Ferrero affiliate Agri Australis is planting more than one million hazelnut trees near Narrandera, in the Riverina region of New South Wales. The goal is to develop a large-scale demonstration farm as a showcase of the potential future of hazelnut cultivation and production in Australia. The counterseasonal supply from Australia will provide the Ferrero Group the possibility of accessing fresh hazelnuts all year around. Agri Australis expects to reach full production capability by 2022, creating up to 50 permanent jobs and boosting the economy of regional New South Wales.
       </p>
       <p>
        As well as creating jobs and more opportunities than we could alone, foreign investment brings to Australia new ideas and technology. Japan's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NEC" rel="nofollow">
         NEC
        </a>
        , one of the world's pioneering electronics companies, has been operating and investing in Australia for almost 50 years, with local staff numbers rising from five, when it opened its first office in Mulgrave, Victoria, in 1969, to now more than 1,800 people in 2017. Since 2014, NEC has been setting up offices, including its service centre for Transport for New South Wales, on the University of Wollongong Innovation Campus. NEC is already employing Wollongong locals, and it expects that it will have more than 110 employees in time. NEC's investment brings further benefits. NEC and the University of Wollongong are now working together to support careers for graduates and are exploring new opportunities for research collaboration.
       </p>
       <p>
        Foreign investment flows are an endorsement and recognition of the skills of Australians as well as our culture of innovation. Google employs 1,300 Australians here and another 500 Australians abroad, giving Australians the opportunity to be at the forefront of information technology. Germany's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosch_Group" rel="nofollow">
         Bosch Group
        </a>
        has an investment in The Yield, a Tasmanian agri-tech start-up. That is another example of Australian innovation that's attracting foreign investment. The Yield measures and predicts real-time weather data at farm, field and even plant level. It converts this into crop-specific knowledge, helping to increase farm productivity, increase shelf life of produce and track food safety with flow-on environmental benefits.
       </p>
       <p>
        Investment is also boosting our exports. One of our major export strengths is in medical technologies. The United Kingdom's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstraZeneca" rel="nofollow">
         AstraZeneca
        </a>
        has been investing in Australian manufacturing of pharmaceuticals for around 60 years. Just this year, AstraZeneca announced a further investment of around $100 million in its manufacturing facility in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Macquarie Park
        </a>
        in Sydney, creating new jobs there. From Australia, AstraZeneca is exporting to 15 countries, with exports expected to exceed $2.4 billion over the next four years. The company's technology is a credit to Australian engineering and a world-class local workforce that is increasing productivity to meet rising demand.
       </p>
       <p>
        International investment brings large overseas markets within the reach of small- and medium-sized Australian businesses too. The investment by Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba in their Australian headquarters in Melbourne this year will provide another gateway for Australian small- and medium-sized business exporters.
       </p>
       <p>
        Investors are attracted by Australia's excellent international market access through our 10 FTAs currently in force, including the China, Korea and Japan FTAs that this government has delivered. The value of our FTA network is demonstrated through our longstanding investment relationship with the United States, which I spoke about earlier. Following entry into force of our US FTA in 2005, the stock of direct US investment in Australia rose steeply from $76 billion at the end of 2005 to $195 billion in 2016.
       </p>
       <p>
        In February 2017, the leading US-based
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mead_Johnson_Nutrition" rel="nofollow">
         Mead Johnson Nutrition
        </a>
        company, with whom I met in the US earlier this year, announced a $200 million acquisition of dairy spray drying, finishing and canning capabilities from Bega Cheese Ltd, one of Australia's leading dairy product companies. Bega is able to ensure continuity of supply to its own customers through a 10-year service and access agreement. One of the drivers behind the deal is preferential access afforded by Australia's trifecta of free trade agreements to export Australian dairy to high-growth Asian markets, particularly China. For Bega, according to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        Paul van Heerwaarden, the deal is part of an important strategic relationship and is also about releasing capital which will be used to fund Bega's recent $460 million purchase of Mondelez's Australian grocery business as well as major brands including Vegemite.
       </p>
       <p>
        This deal is a recognition of another important truth about foreign investment. Assets are not 'lost' overseas through foreign investment. Invariably, businesses are built up here in Australia, whether it be improvements to cattle stations, the building of resorts or the development of brands and businesses. In time, those assets often return to Australian hands. Think of how the Vestey cattle empire from Britain has come and gone, or indeed the recent return of Vegemite to an Australian-owned company after many years of American ownership. Foreign capital comes and sometimes goes, but the improvements it generates remain in this country.
       </p>
       <p>
        These examples of investment following trade deals show trade and investment are two sides of the same coin. Together they deliver many benefits: more jobs, new skills and technology, more Australian exports and more Australian business engagement with global value chains. A strong trading relationship typically supports a strong investment relationship. Since the first iteration of the Singapore-Australia FTA was signed in 2003, not only has our bilateral trade relationship grown by more than 80 per cent; our investment relationship with Singapore has grown by around 350 per cent.
       </p>
       <p>
        For these many reasons we can continue to build on this government's strong track record of achievement in delivering FTAs, be it the recent entry into force of major revisions to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAFTA" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Let me turn now to how the government is ensuring Australia maintains its strong reputation as an attractive and strong destination for global investors. Amidst the realities of the global economy, we face intensified international competition for foreign investment and the opportunities that it brings. Global direct capital flows remain below the 2007 peak. We have also seen a marked decrease in the overall level of China's global outbound investments this year. While the impact of these circumstances on Australia is not yet clear, we cannot take the continued availability of capital for granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are getting the settings of our tax system right, which supports our competitiveness and helps to ensure Australia remains an attractive destination for investment. As a government, we're cutting Australia's corporate tax rate—having already secured tax cuts for small and medium businesses, the government is committed to extending the tax cuts to cover all companies in Australia. Tax is not the only thing that matters when it comes to attracting investment; it is, however, one of the most important. Treasury analysis shows the unweighted average company tax rate in advanced economies has fallen from 32 per cent in 2001 to 24 per cent today. With France legislating and Belgium announcing corporate tax cuts, this leaves Germany as the only other advanced economy with a higher company tax rate than Australia. This risks our 30 per cent company tax rate being increasingly out of step with our global competitors. That's why we are urging Labor and the crossbench to help secure Australia's future prosperity by supporting a cut to 25 per cent across the board.
       </p>
       <p>
        Meanwhile, we are continuing to implement microeconomic reforms across competition, innovation, and infrastructure policy. These reforms, our pursuit of new high-quality FTAs and the continued promotion of Australia as a reliable and attractive investment destination will ensure that Australia goes from strength to strength. As Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, I'm actively promoting Australia's investment opportunities and competitive strengths overseas by engaging with investors and by forging strengthened bilateral relationships with key investment partners.
       </p>
       <p>
        Engaging internationally is important. We are actively pursuing a wide-ranging economic and commercial diplomacy agenda at home, as well as abroad. A key focus is to support Australian businesses making their way in the global market and to promote and facilitate investment relationships around the world. Around 90 per cent of our work in foreign investment promotion and attraction falls within the five key priority sectors agreed by federal, state and territory ministers. Those are agribusiness and food, resources and energy, advanced manufacturing, services and technologies, infrastructure, and tourism. These are the sectors of strength for Australia, where we can make excellent use of foreign investment to drive benefits for Australians. However, the investment landscape and our needs are shifting and, as this shifts, the focus within these priority sectors changes too.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our agribusiness and food production is booming. As our output responds to the global demand for Australia's clean, green products, we are looking at technology to drive productivity and enhance innovation and product differentiation. As a minerals and energy superpower, with growing exports a result of recent and substantial investment, we continue to seek investment in our resources and energy sectors, including the coming surge in demand for materials used in electric vehicles, renewable energy generation and storage, such as lithium and cobalt from socially-responsible sources, rare earths and high-purity nickel compounds.
       </p>
       <p>
        In advanced manufacturing, services and technology, we seek investment to introduce innovations in digital technology, advanced manufacturing, medical technologies and defence industry activities in naval and aerospace. A key focus is on investment and collaboration in globally competitive areas of commercial R&amp;D aligned with the National Innovation and Science Agenda.
       </p>
       <p>
        In infrastructure, having successfully attracted many of the world's leading constructors and financiers, we are shifting focus to attract greenfield investment in rail operations and intelligent transport systems as well. For tourism infrastructure, we are encouraging investment beyond our capital cities to grow the supply of high-quality, unique experiences as well as iconic regional destinations. This is supporting small businesses in regional communities with 43c in every tourism dollar being spent in our regions. Just recently, Minister Canavan and I were delighted to co-host the second
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Australia
        </a>
        n Investment Forum in Cairns. The event attracted over 550 delegates, including over 178 executives representing 108 investor companies. I note that the shadow minister attended as well. It was pleasing to see the bipartisan spirit surrounding foreign investment in Northern Australia. The forum showcased investment opportunities and some of Australia's best assets: agriculture and food, resources and energy, and tourism and infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p>
        I acknowledge there are parts of the community who have concerns about some foreign investment. Precisely because foreign investment matters so much to Australia, I encourage all Australians to continue this conversation. Through consultations over the last year, I have found that Australians don't want investors to leave but that some have mixed views concerning the sectors in which we should be attracting investment. Where some Australians are concerned about foreign investment, it is predominantly in real estate, utilities and some elements of agriculture. I have listened. We implemented stronger rules as a government for foreign investors owning Australian housing and improved transparency and screening of foreign investment in Australian agricultural land. As a government, we have proposed legislative measures to strengthen the national security of our critical infrastructure. We tightened our tax rules to crack down on multinational tax avoidance and ensure profits made here are taxed here. But we continue to welcome foreign investment for the many tangible benefits that it delivers and that I've outlined.
       </p>
       <p>
        Experience shows that the best way to respond to change and challenge is to hold fast to the principles upon which Australia's economic success story is founded. Openness to investment and trade is a large part of how we have achieved 26 years of uninterrupted annual economic growth. It is part of how Australian businesses are scaling up and expanding overseas and it is how we are continuing to attract investment to provide opportunities for Australians now and into the future. Foreign investment has made a long-term contribution to our economy. We celebrate this through our annual investment award, which I presented last night at the 55th Australian Export Awards ceremony in Canberra. This year's winner was Japan's NEC Australia, the global technology company that has been in Australia for half a century and, over the past 15 years, has invested more than $200 million locally in R&amp;D and in the

        sector.
       </p>
       <p>
        Across the globe competition for capital is increasing but Australia's economy remains strong and attractive. We have made productive use of foreign investment, generating jobs for Australians, building skills and gaining access into lucrative and growing markets overseas for Australian businesses. We continue to secure the confidence of foreign investors across the globe and they will continue to be an important part of Australia's very promising economic future.

          Foreign investment
         </a>
         is very important to Australia. In many ways, our country is built on it. A lot of the farms that helped Australia ride on the sheep's back were developed with foreign investment through companies like the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Agricultural_Company" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Agricultural Company
         </a>
         , which was founded with investment from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
          UK
         </a>
         and still exists today. The same is true of the resource sector. Companies like
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP" rel="nofollow">
          BHP
         </a>
         are about three-quarters foreign owned. A lot of our manufacturing industry, which still employs almost a million people, wouldn't exist without foreign investment—particularly from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         , the UK, Japan, the Netherlands and China. As the minister has just pointed out, they are the top five sources of foreign investment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Foreign investment creates jobs—jobs that would not exist if that money wasn't injected into our economy. As former Minister for Trade and Investment Andrew Robb said in the second of these statements to the House two years ago, every billion dollars of foreign investment creates 1,000 more jobs here in Australia. So a billion dollars of investment, 1,000 more jobs in Australia. If you pull that money out, it means higher unemployment. It is as simple as that. A lot of people think that you can just get rid of foreign investment and replace it with local funds, local money. It might seem like an easy thing to do, but the answer is you can't do that. The bottom line is we need more money to build businesses and roads and railways and ports and airports—the infrastructure we need—than we have local funds available to pay for those things. In 2016, that gap was about $44 billion. Foreign investment fills that $44 billion gap; it provides that extra money that we need and boosts economic growth as a result, creating more jobs. Without it, fewer things get built and there are fewer jobs, and potentially Australian businesses could go under.
        </p>
        <p>
         Foreign investment doesn't just bring more money into the country, though, and create more jobs. For a lot of Aussie businesses, it can also bring them skills, new expertise, and those companies from overseas that invest here can bring with them
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP" rel="nofollow">
          IP
         </a>
         that can help a company grow. Bigger businesses, more jobs and more economic growth also mean more company tax is paid by that Australian company here in Australia and more income tax is paid by the people who work there, and that helps to pay for the things that are so important—things like better schools and hospitals. It helps to pay the salaries of police officers, nurses and teachers.
        </p>
        <p>
         That doesn't mean, though, that foreign investment is popular. It's not. The minister made this point at the conclusion of his remarks. There are a lot of people in the community who aren't convinced about the merits of foreign investment. You'll often hear conversations in the pub or the club about foreign investment—whether money should be coming in from overseas to invest in certain things. The minister has pointed out some of the things that the government has done. I think the key message that I'd give in my contribution today is that those things are important, but there's still more work that we need to do here.

         , the shadow Assistant Treasurer, recently released another book,
         <i>
          Choosing Openness
         </i>
         . In the book, he says, 'There may be no other issue on which economists and the general public disagree more.' On that point, I think he's right. Members of parliament who have this conversation with our constituents would often see that. Some types of foreign investment are more popular than others. Australians are generally supportive of foreign investment in our manufacturing industry and in finance. They're pretty evenly split when it comes to resources, ports and airports, but you'll find they're pretty strongly opposed to foreign investment in Australian farms and in residential property. I suspect that nothing is going to change the views of people who are deadset against foreign investment, but information here is important so at least Australians who are worried about this know exactly what's going on.

         When it comes to farmland, I think the agricultural land register is useful in this regard. It shows that, as of 30 June this year, 13.6 per cent of Australian farmland is foreign owned—less, I suspect, than most Australians would have thought. It also shows that Britain is the largest foreign investor in Australian agricultural land, with 2.6 per cent, and Chinese companies own 2.5 per cent—again, I think less than most people would think. I'd argue, though, that the land register could go further. Tony Marr, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

         of the Farmers' Federation, has said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         This report is a good, blunt overview of the landmass, but in terms of either control or influence or impact on the supply chain or sector itself, we need more data and numbers to give us a better and fuller picture.
        </p>
        <p>
         When we were last in government, we proposed a foreign ownership register that would allow every Australian to see who has purchased what, where, and for how much—something the coalition promised to match. However, that hasn't eventuated. I share the concerns of my colleague the shadow minister for agriculture that that promise hasn't been kept. So I use this opportunity to encourage the government to have a look at this and to continue to develop this register, to make it more comprehensive, and to keep the promise that they made to make it as transparent as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also look forward to the development of a water register, which is expected to be completed, I think, towards the end of this financial year. The aim of that register, I understand, is to increase transparency about the level of foreign ownership of water entitlements. Again, providing this sort of information and facts to the general community can only be helpful in this debate.

         The way foreign investment in housing works is that foreign investors can invest only in new buildings. The logic behind this is that it helps to add to the number of homes that are available rather than competing with Australians for existing housing. Nevertheless, a lot of Australians—most Australians—think that foreign investment in housing is putting the price of housing up. There are things that we can do here, and the minister has pointed to some of them. Labor has led the fight on a lot of reforms when it comes to housing affordability—things to make it easier for people to buy their first home. That includes changes to negative gearing, changes to capital gains tax concessions and limiting direct borrowing by self-managed super funds to purchase investment properties. If the purpose of allowing foreign investors to invest in new property is to add to supply and increase the number of homes available for people to live in, then it's important that people are actually living in them. That's the point. But it's not always the case. There are plenty of properties that are owned by foreign investors where the lights are off every night. They're not being rented out. So the policy intent created by this parliament to create more stock—more homes for Australians—is being negated by the fact that people can't live in them. It is something we need to fix.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_April" rel="nofollow">
          In April

         this year we proposed a uniform vacant property tax across all major cities. I'm glad to see in the budget that the government followed Labor's lead and introduced a vacant property tax on foreign investors—the purpose being to create an incentive to make sure that Australians can get access to these new properties, that there are more homes for Australians to live in.
        </p>
        <p>
         I note that in August the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_State_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Chinese State Council
         </a>
         issued a new direction on outbound investment. This included formal restrictions on foreign investment in real estate. This has been done to direct foreign investment into other types of infrastructure, but I think as well because of concerns by the state council about the flight of capital by Chinese investors. I guess we'll have to wait and see what the real impact of this will be on the Australian real estate market. However, I note that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
          Reserve Bank
         </a>
         has already indicated that this has led to a decline in Chinese investment in Australian housing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Community concerns also get stoked when foreign investment review processes don't work the way they should. We saw that two years ago with the Darwin Port decision. We saw the same thing last year with the Ausgrid debacle. Companies were originally given the green light by federal government agencies to bid to buy a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         electricity provider. Only after the New South Wales government selected a preferred tenderer were they told that they were ineligible to bid. That's bad process. It's not good process when a company gets told by federal government agencies it can bid, and then after they win they're told they can't bid. It's amateur-hour stuff. It costs companies a lot of money to bid for assets like this—I know from my own experience in the private sector that the bidding process isn't cheap. It also leads to loss of face. The companies in question should have known a lot earlier in the process that they would not be able to buy this asset.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since then, the government has set up the critical infrastructure unit and made changes to the Foreign Investment Review Board. I'm hopeful here that bad process, like we've seen with the Ausgrid decision, won't happen again. I have had the opportunity to receive some briefings from the critical infrastructure unit as well as from people at the Foreign Investment Review Board. I'm hopeful here that the changes that have been made will help to make sure we don't have a repeat of that.
        </p>
        <p>
         Another way to address community concerns is to make sure that multinational companies pay their fair share of tax. The minister pointed to some changes in that area. The fact is it's not always the case that multinational companies pay their fair share of tax. When we were last in government, we passed laws that meant corporate tax entities with a reported total income of $100 million or more had their tax data publicly released. That information is released in December of every year. The last data released, in December of last year, revealed that 36 per cent of large companies pay no tax at all, including a number of multinationals. There are a lot of examples of big companies that make a lot of money in Australia but pay little or no tax. In 2012 we introduced laws to stop cross-border transfer pricing, which is used by multinationals to reduce the tax they pay in Australia. We've seen from a recent Federal Court decision how vital those changes to the law were in making sure that multinational companies can't use transfer pricing to avoid their tax obligations in Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         We've also announced a number of other policies to increase the scrutiny of tax paid by companies here and overseas and helped to make sure that they pay their fair share of tax in Australia. They include tightening debt reduction loopholes used by multinational companies to reduce their tax, which should deliver an extra $4.6 billion in tax revenue over a decade; requiring multinationals operating in Australia to publicly disclose in which countries they pay tax, how much and how many people they employ; establishing a public register of beneficial owners of companies and trusts based in Australia; requiring bidders for government procurement contracts to disclose what countries they pay tax in; and offering whistleblowers protection and rewards for information regarding companies and individuals that evade tax.
        </p>
        <p>
         It's not just tax avoidance, though, that helps to erode public confidence in foreign investment. When big companies misuse the industrial relations system to cut wages and working conditions, it can also have the same result. It makes people angry and it makes people second-guess foreign investment. Unfortunately, we've seen recent evidence of that with sham employment agreements that cut wages and working conditions. The government hasn't done anything yet to fix this, but we will. If we're elected, we'll change the law to make clear that workers who vote on an enterprise agreement must be broadly representative of the workers who may ultimately be covered by the agreement. We will also change the law so that workers and their unions can apply to the Fair Work Commission to renegotiate sham enterprise agreements.
        </p>
        <p>
         I again welcome the minister's statement and thank him for these regular statements. I think presenting information to the House and through the House to the Australian people on an annual basis is an important part of addressing the community concerns that we both share. We both agree on the importance of foreign investment. It is critical, and always has been, to Australia, and it will always be in the future. There's a lot more work we need to do to make sure that we continue to attract the investment we so desperately need in Australia to build the country we want to build, and there's a lot more work we need to do to help build community support for it.
