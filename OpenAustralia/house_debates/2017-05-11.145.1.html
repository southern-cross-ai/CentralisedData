        I welcome the $8.4 billion injection into inland rail in the budget handed down this week. 'Budget bonanza: rail deal rolls on with hefty $8.4 billion' and 'Inland Rail steams ahead' were the headlines in yesterday's
        <i>
         Toowoomba Chronicle
        </i>
        in relation to the Turnbull government's unprecedented infrastructure commitment. I congratulate the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Treasurer and Minister Darren Chester on this commitment. This is a nation-building project that for us will serve to complete what our Mayor Antonio refers to as the trifecta: Toowoomba's second range road crossing; Toowoomba's Wellcamp Airport, developed by the Wagner family; and now inland rail. Together they will render our region the logistics powerhouse of regional Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Across the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darling_Downs" rel="nofollow">
         Darling Downs
        </a>
        we must now finalise the proposed corridor from Yelarbon, near the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        border, to Gowrie, just outside Toowoomba. We have four potential routes under consideration: the so-called base case through the Millmerran, Brookstead and Mt Tyson areas; a proposed diversion from that route past the Wellcamp Airport, which was not in place when the base case was developed; a more easterly route via Karara and then Leyburn and Felton; and, finally, a route further east via Warwick before heading north to Toowoomba. Each of these is being considered by a project reference group appointed by Minister Chester, and the group's report will be considered by him in the coming weeks. I have compiled other issues and concerns from the Southbrook, Mt Tyson and Felton areas for his advice as well, and I know that he will continue to consult with the department and other experts before finalising his decision.
       </p>
       <p>
        There can be no doubt that this significant infrastructure project and others like it in regional and certainly metropolitan areas—such as developing tunnels and freeways in cities—can have impacts on local communities. I have been working and will continue to work diligently with the minister's office to ensure that this project will be based on a route of least impact for landholders, families and businesses in our region, but I acknowledge that the decision is his to make.
       </p>
       <p>
        Everyone in my region supports inland rail. We need to make sure that it has the correct route characteristics required by our community, particularly across the flood plain. There can be no doubt that this project is happening. It is proceeding, and it will enhance the enormous small-business, export and economic development potential for our region and right across the Darling Downs.
