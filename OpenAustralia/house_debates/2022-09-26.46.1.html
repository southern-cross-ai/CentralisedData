       <p>
        I would like to pay tribute to some extraordinary women from my vibrant electorate of Fraser: the dedicated staff and volunteers of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_African" rel="nofollow">
         East African
        </a>
        Women's Foundation. Under the leadership of Fartun Farah, the foundation has provided support for women for over 15 years. Their care has helped women recover from the trauma of war and political upheaval. They run social groups for the newly arrived to counter the isolation as they adjust to life in Australia; they help women establish businesses to start them on their journey to financial independence; they run programs to help young people develop their skills and confidence; and they run forums to improve relationships between the community and police.

        Last week I had the honour of attending one of the many health initiatives they support. For five years, the Western Bulldogs Community Foundation has run the Daughters of the West program, which provides education on mental and physical wellbeing and physical activity and helps women build valuable social networks. Wednesday night's ceremony celebrated the newest Daughters of the West, women from the East African community who completed a pilot program developed in partnership with

        </a>
        and supported by both foundations. It was a joyous occasion with plenty of laughter and guests were treated to a traditional Somali dance. As Fartun said, look after the woman and you look after the family.
