        I rise today to call out the lies being peddled by all levels of the Labor Party in Mandurah, local, state and federal. Labor lie No. 1 is that public education in this nation has seen massive funding cuts. The truth is that, under the coalition government, school funding is increasing by more than $11 billion over the next 10 years. That's more than 31 per cent extra for every kid at a public school in Mandurah over the next three years. Labor lie No. 2 is that the government is cutting hospital funding. The truth is that, under the coalition government, public hospital funding is increasing by more than $30 billion thanks to our new five-year public hospital agreement. Even though WA Labor signed up to this agreement, they have failed to allocate any funding to the Peel Health Campus, the only hospital in Mandurah. It's dishonest and disgraceful, but it's not surprising.

        Now the state member for Mandurah,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Templeman" rel="nofollow">
         David Templeman
        </a>
        , is lying about his commitment to the Lakelands train station. Mr Templeman claims to be in support of the coalition-backed project in his electorate, which is also in the federal electorate of Canning, yet a leaked motion from the WA Labor state executive, motion C.07, shows the Mandurah branch of the Labor Party advocating for a train outside of Mandurah instead. Is Labor for Mandurah or not? This government has put money on the table for better public transport, better schools and better hospitals in our city, but it seems Labor would prefer to play politics. I will always back the people of Mandurah, and this side of the House willâ€”
