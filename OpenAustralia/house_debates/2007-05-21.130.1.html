       <p>
        Tonight I would like to take the opportunity to mark the contribution of, and pay tribute to, the Maylands Railways
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        Sub-branch in my electorate. For as long as I have been the federal member for Perth, the Maylands Railways RSL Sub-branch has met at the Peninsula Community Centre in Maylands and has commemorated both Anzac Day and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Remembrance Day
        </a>
        at the Maylands Memorial, well known to Maylands residents, on the corner of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eighth_Avenue" rel="nofollow">
         Eighth Avenue
        </a>
        and Peninsula Road.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the years, of course, the ranks of the Maylands Railways RSL has thinned and recently the sub-branch determined that it could best make a continuing contribution to the welfare and lives of veterans by formally disbanding and merging with the Bedford-Morley RSL. I think that is an appropriate decision for the Maylands Railways RSL Sub-branch to make, but it does give an opportunity to mark the contribution that that sub-branch has made over a substantial period of time to the lives and welfare of veterans who live in the Maylands area.
       </p>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bedford" rel="nofollow">
         The Bedford
        </a>
        -Morley RSL of course makes its own outstanding contribution to the life and welfare of veterans. The Bedford-Morley RSL meets at the RSL Hall in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Promenade" rel="nofollow">
         Grand Promenade
        </a>
        and commemorates Anzac Day and Remembrance Day at the Salisbury Street Memorial in Inglewood. I am very proud that a couple of years ago the Bedford-Morley RSL Sub-branch asked me to become its first associate member, a new membership category which was opened up to RSL sub-branches in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        , and I proudly wear that badge and associate membership.
       </p>
       <p>
        I mark the contribution that the Maylands Railways RSL Sub-branch has made in a very memorable way to the lives and welfare of RSL veterans in that area and wish those remaining members of the sub-branch all the best for their ongoing activities with the Bedford-Morley RSL.

        Question agreed to.
