        I was delighted on Sunday to have launched the inaugural Reid Community Cup at Timbrell Park in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Dock" rel="nofollow">
         Five Dock
        </a>
        , a five-a-side soccer tournament with eight teams representing Reid's local charities and community groups. And congratulations to the inaugural winners, the Sir Roden and Lady Cutler Foundation, a great local charity whose players put in a gutsy performance to claim the title. The grand final was a contest between the foundation and the

        </a>
        —Settlement Services International—multicultural youth division that came to a five-five draw at the end of regular time, with extra time's golden goal deciding the tournament.
       </p>
       <p>
        The goal of the Reid Community Cup is to promote both the organisations and the excellent work they do in our local area, helping those in need across the areas of community support, refugee and migrant assistance, disability awareness and youth issues. Of course, it was also a great opportunity for the community get together, enjoy a barbecue and some skills. The teams represented charities including FRANS, the Refugee Advice and Casework Service—

        , the Sir Roden and Lady Cutler Foundation, Settlement Services International's multicultural youth division and Communities for Communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each of these organisations do amazing work in their individual areas. FRANS provides supported live-in services, community engagement, day trips, life skills programs and vacation care as well as other services to people living with disability, their families and their carers. The Refugee Advice and Casework Service is the longest-running refugee legal centre in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        and provides free legal advice to financially disadvantaged individuals seeking asylum in the community and immigration detention. Touched by Olivia works to create a more inclusive society by creating play spaces that are accessible for children regardless of any disability. The Burwood PCYC is a charity organisation that works in partnership with the New South Wales police to provide sports and activities for at risk young people in our community. SSI's multicultural youth division is a relatively new advocacy group and support network focusing on the needs of multicultural youth and provides the first steps towards employment and social interaction. Communities for Communities takes groups of volunteers from the inner west to build houses in South-East Asia; they are also big supporters of local groups. And last, but in no way least, the Sir Roden and Lady Cutler Foundation provide free transport for local elderly and less mobile residents to attend medical appointments.
       </p>
       <p>
        These groups tirelessly extend help to others in our community, and the Reid Community Cup is an initiative to recognise the work they do. We raised $1,500 that day, coincidentally, to support them. I would like to say a big thank you to David Tanti in my office who is in charge of outreach and who did most of the legwork on this initiative. We look forward to next year.
