        I rise today to pay my respect and homage to Dr Alice (Alitya) Rigney. I had the great honour last week of going to Adelaide and speaking in Alice's memorial state service. I also want to pay tribute to her three children, who made wonderful speeches at the service: Lester-Irabinna, Eileen and Tracey.

        was there, as was the Governor and many other very significant people. The hall was packed. There were hundreds and hundreds of people.

        Alice Rigney's passing is a loss to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        and the community as a whole.

         If I
        </a>
        say anything I want to make it clear that her greatest legacy is her family. I spoke about that a moment ago. Dr Rigney was a giant on a national cause, that is reconciliation, truth-telling and nation-building. She was an educator. She was the first Indigenous principal at Kaurna Plains School and the first Aboriginal person employed by the department of education. Alice's great belief was that all kids deserve a good education. She was a true educator and believed in the dignity of people. It was a great honour for me to be there, and it is a great honour to stand in this parliament and pay respect to Dr Alice (Alitya) Rigney and her family.
