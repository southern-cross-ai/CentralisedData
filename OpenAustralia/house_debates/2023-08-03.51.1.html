        Last weekend, I had the honour of opening the Majors Road Pump Track at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Halloran_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         O'Halloran Hill
        </a>
        . The pump track has courses and jumps for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMX" rel="nofollow">
         BMX
        </a>
        bikes, skateboards, scooters and skates, for people of all ages and abilities. Even while Mayor Kris Hanna and I were launching the track, we had toddlers through to national BMX competitors using various parts of it. This fantastic facility is a partnership between the

        and the federal government, and it's great to see it being so welcomed by the local community.
       </p>

        A few weeks earlier, I attended two reserve upgrades. The Ballara Park Reserve in Warradale now has a new playground, with an accessible in-ground trampoline, a climbing net, a slide featuring a red-tailed black-cockatoo, native to the local area, and resurfaced courts. This upgrade was a partnership of all three levels of government, and it was great to have the member for Gibson,

        , along for the opening.
       </p>
       <p>
        Later the same day, we launched the upgrade of Weaver Street Reserve in Edwardstown. This previously tired triangle of grass now features a multi-use court, a climbing tower, nature play and playgrounds for older and younger children.

        of Marion is a great partner to work with, and thanks must go to Mayor Kris Hanna, the elected members, the management and, of course, the staff for the three great outcomes for our community.
