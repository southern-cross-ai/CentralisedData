        I am thrilled to be able to display to the chamber this magnificent work of art so that its creator, Indi, can actually say there is some of her work displayed in the nation's parliament. So, this is it—Indi Lea McLean, a great talent. That was a gift provided to me at the opening of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Corner" rel="nofollow">
         The Corner
        </a>
        youth services hub in Mornington. The greatest gift, though, was to get that project finished. This will bring together a single focal point for the northern
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mornington_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
         Mornington Peninsula
        </a>
        for all the youth service providers. Indi's sister was the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MC" rel="nofollow">
         MC
        </a>
        and Indi's other sister was very involved. How do I know this? When I was checking out Indi's details she came up on their phones as 'Indi Poohead'. Isn't that love shared between siblings? And her mum was there as well! Anyway, it is a great project and a great outcome and Indi, whatever her siblings call her, has got a great future ahead of her. The project is now known as The Corner. The Corner is a place where we hope young people who might be experiencing some challenges and who may have some issues and a bit of chaos in their lives can get some guidance, services and support which will help them turn the corner for a better life. It is a single focal point, a safe place, for the Mornington Peninsula Shire Youth Services.

        Headspace—what remarkable work they are doing with young people experiencing emotional health challenges. It is a place where friendships can be built, confidence can be nurtured and capacity can be engineered by bringing together all the knowledge and support of youth service providers in our community so our young people can be their best selves. This is a time of extraordinary opportunities, but sometimes that is so overwhelming—so many choices, so much dynamism. Young people are looking for some pathways and some sure guidance to make a go of their lives, and that is what that centre is about. That is why I was so excited about the opening of that centre.

        Another highlight for me recently was returning to my old school,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey_Secondary_College" rel="nofollow">
         Monterey Secondary College
        </a>
        . In
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankston_North" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        there is the Pines community—great characters, great people—and all the schools in the area came together for the Frankston North Schools Family Fun Day last weekend. Monterey Secondary College, Mahogany Rise Primary School and Aldercourt Primary School brought all of their know-how and their networks together for a great day. There were many different types of events and it was great to see the community coming together. It reminded me of my time at the school—great people. There are so many good things about a community that has so much going for it.
       </p>
       <p>
        I caught up with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Jones" rel="nofollow">
         Stuart Jones
        </a>
        . He is the principal at Monterey Secondary College. He started this year with energy, enthusiasm and a clear sense of the positive difference that the school can make for young people in Frankston North. I keep saying your postcode does not determine your potential. It is a community not without its challenges, but it has got young people with great potential and a great future. Stuart's positivity alongside that of the college council president, Deb Wood, was evident at this function. I also caught up with school captain Caitlyn Barker. She is a very impressive young woman, achieving much this year and looking forward to uni next year. Caitlyn has also been a key contributor to my Stronger Communities Program selection committee, and I wish her all the very best for her future.

        There was face painting, there were rides, you could check out whether your bike was legal and lawful—everything was there for young and old: it was a terrific day.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rotary" rel="nofollow">
         The Rotary
        </a>
        movement was there in strength. It was terrific to see Peninsula Rotaract talking about their programs and activities for 18-30 year olds, their twice-a-month meetings, the networks, the socialisation, the ideas and the activities they are involved in. One program I am particularly proud of is the alternative schoolies program. My old Rotary club is Frankston Long Island. It is still my Rotary club, but I am never there. Hopefully, I will get a leave pass for today. I introduce myself as a visiting Rotarian to my own club because I am so rarely there. But one of their great enduring initiatives is their alternative schoolies program. Rather than going to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        , as lovely as it is, and maybe getting into some mischief, we encourage young people, at the end of their secondary years, to spend a fortnight in Cambodia with our properly qualified people. For the first week, they are tourists. They get to see
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angkor_Wat" rel="nofollow">
         Angkor Wat
        </a>
        , Phnom Penh and all of the great, fascinating and, in some cases, confronting aspects of Cambodia's story as a nation. In the second week, they volunteer at an orphanage. They get to learn that life has challenges and that, whatever our difficulties might be as Australians, we have won life's lotto by being here. This program builds the character of these young people. They are internationally engaged; they get a new perspective. To see Peninsula Rotaract and their leadership—Hayley, Alex, Chris and Olivia—there was great.

        But it went further. On the day, Monteract Rotary Club was there. This is a Rotary activity involving Monterey Secondary College students. I would like to thank Tannon Wood, Ruby Seymour and Aaron Van Den Akker for the energy they displayed in leading this initiative to help the students at Monterey Secondary College be their best selves and reach out for the support and wisdom that is around them. This is about a community coming together to make the very best of the opportunities in their reach. I commend them for that effort and that enterprise.
