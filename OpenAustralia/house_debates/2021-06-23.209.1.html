        I rise to commend and congratulate two members of my electorate named in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Birthday_Honours" rel="nofollow">
         Queen's Birthday Honours
        </a>
        List.
       </p>
       <p>
        First, I'd like to congratulate Mr Noel Beven AM of Campania. Noel was recognised for his significant service to horticulture, to agriculture and to rural youth. Mr Beven has worked as a field officer for Extractas Bioscience, formerly known as Tasmanian Alkaloids, for 30 years, coordinating growers in southern Tasmania to grow poppy crops, which have been so important for medicine worldwide. But it is his time working with Tasmania's rural youth that's had the greatest community impact. He's played a massive role in the development of Rural Youth Tasmania and at our state's flagship event, Agfest, which is proudly held in my electorate every May. Both are staples of regional Tasmania and my electorate in particular, so congratulations to Noel Beven.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to congratulate

         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        for his service to the Longford community and to Rotary. James has served as a Rotary Australia director since 2019, was the district governor of Rotary Tasmania in 2012-13 and has served more than 20 years as secretary with Rotary Longford. James is a popular community member, with strong ties to the Longford events committee and
