        My question is to the Minister for

        and

        </a>
        . Will the minister update the House on the government’s action to tackle climate change and how this has been received, including the response of the so-called ‘people’s revolt’ to the government’s plan?

        <p>
         I would like to thank the member for Chifley for his question. Since the government announced the carbon price framework several weeks ago there has of course been significant debate in relation to it. Today, for example, I was happy to receive a petition from the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACTU" rel="nofollow">
          ACTU
         </a>
         and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wildlife_Fund" rel="nofollow">
          World Wildlife Fund
         </a>
         on the need to take action on climate change. The petition was signed by over 12,000 people and called for the parliament to reduce carbon pollution and move to a clean energy future.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, there are those with opposing views, including those who are part of the so-called ‘people’s revolt’ organised by the Leader of the Opposition. It is perfectly legitimate in a democracy for people to freely express their views and to engage in rallies such as that conducted today. I have been involved in some rallies myself over a period of time. It is appropriate, though, to consider just what organisations are becoming involved in the Leader of the Opposition’s campaign against a carbon price and why they might oppose the government’s climate change plans.
        </p>
        <p>
         The revolt is in fact led by the Menzies House website, which was founded with the help of Liberal Senator Cory Bernardi, who is notorious for his climate change science denial. But there is also a range of other groups involved that do not like the government’s climate change policy. The Consumers and Taxpayers Association, who organised today’s rally,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAP" rel="nofollow">
          AAP
         </a>
         noted a few weeks ago is an association with just three members. You have also got climate sceptics groups, the anti-Semitic Australian League of Rights, and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
          One Nation
         </a>
         . No surprise that they do like the government’s policies.

                    <p>
                     Mr Speaker, those opposite raised the participation of the member for Robertson in the rally. I just wish to alert the House that in fact the member for Robertson issued a press release prior to question time commencing today which said, in part, the following:
                    </p>
                    <p class="italic">
                     Even though I disagree with today’s protest, I wanted

                     residents who have taken the trouble to come down and express their views to know that I value their contribution to our democracy. In the debate over the implementation of a carbon price, we must not allow ourselves to be swept up in fear and misinformation campaigns.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     On that point, one of the other organisations involved in protesting the government’s policies is the Coalition of Law Abiding Sporting Shooters. What do they want, as well as no carbon tax? They want to repeal former

                     , a group which, as one commentator pointed out, warned that the Kyoto protocol was part of a new imperial structure that would relocate Australian sovereignty to Germany. Clearly these are not people who would support action on climate change. The decision by the Leader of the Opposition to associate himself with the placards we saw today, the messages that have been provided and the groups that have participated is unbefitting a leader of a major political party in this country—and you should disassociate yourself.
