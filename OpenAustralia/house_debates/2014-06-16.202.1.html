       <p>
        Recently here in parliament, during our sitting weeks, I have had the pleasure of welcoming groups of students from our local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_schools" rel="nofollow">
         Catholic schools
        </a>
        . The first students I wish to acknowledge are the year 6 students of St Ambrose's primary school in Woodend and the second group are from the Bendigo Catholic secondary college.
       </p>
       <p>
        The primary school students were keen to engage and asked me to pass on a few words to the House about what they would like to see from their government. They have said what they would like is less homework. They have also said they would like more funding for sports and arts programs in their school. The students also had some fantastic ideas about what the government could do in their community. What they want to see is increased funding for the Buffalo Sports Stadium and the Gilbert Gordon Oval. They would like to be able to play football all year round, which would require floodlights for their particular oval.
       </p>
       <p>
        They would also like to do is see the rock protected.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanging_Rock" rel="nofollow">
         Hanging Rock
        </a>
        is part of their community and they want to see local, state and federal governments work together to protect this site; they would like to see it with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage" rel="nofollow">
         World Heritage
        </a>
        status.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Bendigo Catholic secondary students raised the issue of refugees. They wanted to see the government adopt a compassionate approach towards refugees and believe that asylum seekers should be processed onshore. They also called on the government to recognise same-sex marriage. They believe that who you love should not be prescribed by your gender. They want to see the government adopt a more compassionate approach and see a situation of equity before the law. These are the views of the Catholic students from my electorate.
