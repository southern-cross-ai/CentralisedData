       <p>
        There are a number of Lions clubs across Cowan. They do great work, raising funds for not only Lions clubs’ national and international causes, but also locally for individuals in need. As with all Lions clubs they do not do it for the thanks and they do not do it for profile or credit in the community. They do it because they believe in making a difference, with a positive impact on the community. As the federal member for Cowan I am proud that there are four clubs within Cowan—Ballajura, Girradoola, Kingsley-Woodvale and Wanneroo. These clubs do outstanding work in the community. However, I would like to refer in particular to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Lions Club
        </a>
        of Ballajura that has just been named the champion club by the district governor of 201W1 district.
       </p>
       <p>
        I understand that the clubs are assessed with regard to their activities in the categories of service, fundraising and membership growth. The decision comes down to the emphasis applied by the district governor for those categories. Ballajura was named the champion club in 2009 and the title is well and truly justified. The club in Ballajura, with around 23 members, raises about $20,000 each year. The members are often seen working hard at the Bunnings sausage sizzle, running their iconic local prize wheel at community events such as fairs, as well as raising funds through the famous Lions Christmas cakes and Lions mints sales. The proceeds of these fundraisings are distributed to traditional Lions and other well-known causes such as the Perth Lions Eye Institute, the Lions Cord Blood Bank, the Childhood Cancer Research Appeal, the Breast Cancer Foundation, the

        </a>
        , the

         Australian Red Cross
        </a>
        , Foodbank towards the Lions and Rotary Rice Bowl appeal, the Ruby Benjamin Foundation to assist pensioners with the cost of sterilising pets, the annual Lions Walk for Sight at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry_Lakes" rel="nofollow">
         Perry Lakes
        </a>
        and this year towards the Lions Victorian bushfire and Queensland flood appeals.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition I note their local work in the last financial year where they assisted with the purchase of a small gopher for a Ballajura girl, the purchase of a wheelchair hoist-fitted van for a Marangaroo boy, the purchase of a walker for a Wanneroo woman, the purchase of an oxygen machine for a Ballajura woman and to pay for travel expenses for a Marangaroo boy with disabilities to attend a table tennis tournament in Victoria. They also donated towards Quad Dreamers, a group that has organised quad bikes that have been adapted for the use of disabled children in a safe environment in Wanneroo.
       </p>
       <p>
        They have conducted a Christmas dinner and bus ride for Ballajura seniors to visit the city and see the Christmas lights on decorated homes. They also purchased sporting and art supplies for the local scouts to present to the Derby cubs during a visit, assisted a Vietnamese girl attend the Blind Institute and donated towards the purchase of loan computers for the institute. They have for several years conducted an award at the three state primary schools in Ballajura providing $500 to each school for students attending
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballajura_Community_College" rel="nofollow">
         Ballajura Community College
        </a>
        the following year. The Lions Club also sponsors two or three children in the annual Lions Children of Courage awards for children who have persevered and overcome adversity in their lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        These activities are typical of the Ballajura Lions. I will take this opportunity to thank all the members of the club but will especially mention President Les Harvey, First Vice-President Kaye Scandrett, Second Vice-President Jill Middlemass, Secretary Philip Gaunt and Treasurer Bonnie Hull. I will also mention Sue MacDonald, whom has been a very positive force in Ballajura.
