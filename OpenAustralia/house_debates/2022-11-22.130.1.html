        I rise to acknowledge all things local. In this instance, I acknowledge the achievements of a favourite and adored community event in my electorate of Pearce, the annual Wanneroo Agricultural show, which took place over the weekend. The show is a much-loved event and is highly regarded. It began in 1909 and showcases all things local, such as local produce and land that was worked from our pioneering spirit many years ago, land that is now becoming one of the fastest and largest growing areas in Australia. With that, the growers and the horticulture are now known as the best growers on the land. My community of Pearce is very, very proud of them and incredibly protective.

        The industries which contribute significantly to our economy in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the nation are often local, arising from local business, local passion and local commitment. I would like to acknowledge what Western Australia's largest regional agricultural show gives back to the community, and that is a lot of entertainment over a few days and what they donate to local organisations. The local Wanneroo volunteer fire brigade was the recipient of a grant donation arising from the Wanneroo show. This is just an example. There's also Riding for the Disabled Capricorn Wanneroo, another local organisation that provides opportunities for those with a disability to get to know horses and ride horses. All of these things that the Wanneroo Agricultural show provides for local communities are exemplary. They have many different organisations, whether it's the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_Society" rel="nofollow">
         Historical Society
        </a>
        , whether it's the local schools where they dance, and their bands play. Everybody works towards the annual show. It's something that is a showcase of everybody's achievements over the year.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge President Michael Aspinall and his hard work on the Wanneroo Agricultural Society committee. They worked incredibly hard from day 1, right the way through to the show. They cleaned, they tidied, and then they started organising for the next show. This dedication and commitment really convey that community spirit and is something that those in my electorate of Pearce are incredibly proud of. It underpins the values of our pioneers, those who worked incredibly hard to work the land and showcase it. That pride is something that I can't emphasise enough. I'm probably being a little bit repetitive in my comments, but it is wholeheartedly and resoundingly successful around the community. I stand here in support of everything they do, and I wish them continued success. Thank you wholeheartedly to all of the committee and all of the volunteers who worked really hard to ensure that this is brought to our community for everybody's enjoyment.
