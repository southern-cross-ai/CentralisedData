       <p>
        Earlier this week the honourable member for Chifley raised a matter of privilege alleging that the failure of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Post
        </a>
        to deliver certain items of mail from his office may amount to an improper interference with the free performance of his duties as a member. I have carefully examined the matters raised by the honourable member and I have looked at the documentation he has provided. Improper interference with the ability of members to freely communicate with their constituents would be regarded as a serious matter. In the particular circumstances raised by the honourable member, while I appreciate that the apparent failure of Australia Post to deliver mail items to his constituents would be a matter of concern for him, I have not been presented with detailed evidence that there may have been any improper interference with the performance of the memberâ€™s duties as a member. I note that the member for Chifley has written to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Federal Police
        </a>
        about this matter. If further information comes to hand that relates to possible improper interference, I would consider the matter again, but at this stage I am not prepared to give precedence to a motion to refer the matter to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_of_Privileges" rel="nofollow">
         Committee of Privileges
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Also, yesterday the honourable member for Canning raised a matter of privilege. The matter concerned a dispute between the honourable member and an officer of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Taxation_Office" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Taxation Office
        </a>
        . The honourable member for Canning said that the officer had sent him a copy of a submission the officer had made to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Joint Committee
        </a>
        of Public Accounts and Audit. The essence of the dispute appears to be a conflict between statements the honourable member has made in a submission to the committee and statements the officer has made to the committee. In accordance with past practice, this matter should be considered by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, and I will ask the committee to consider the matter.
