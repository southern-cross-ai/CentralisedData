        In light of the ill-informed and belated attacks on the policies of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts with regard to the

        by one of the shadow Treasurers in waiting—and, if the House is not clear who that is, that is the member for Moncrieff, to be precise—there is sensible information on the topic of the Aust-ralian National Academy of Music which needs to be added to the discussion about the Rudd government’s ongoing support for elite-level classical music training.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 18 November, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts announced that Australian government funding of up to $2.5 million annually will be provided for revitalised elite-level classical music performance and the training centre operating in conjunction with the

        . The new centre will retain the Australian National Academy of Music, ANAM, name in order to build upon the artistic achievements of ANAM and will commence training—

           <p>
            Despite the inaccurate and misleading reports to the contrary by the member for Moncrieff, the Rudd government is committed to ensuring continuity of training for students in the interim. On Friday last, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts announced additional funding of half a million dollars to boost performance training during the transition to the new program. In addition, a working group, comprising representatives from ANAM, the University of Melbourne and the Australian government, will continue to work to develop the transition.
           </p>
           <p>
            If Australia is to remain internationally competitive, a strong multidisciplinary and comprehensive program is needed, linked to an academic environment and integrated into a professional arts precinct. Accordingly, the university has appointed a professional advisory board comprising leading international authorities on elite music training to develop a truly world-class training program. The advisory board includes international representatives from the leading conservatories of Paris, London, the

            To meet the professional requirements of Australia’s orchestras the revitalised ANAM program will for the first time—the ‘first’ time I stress to the member for Moncrieff—offer a national professional performance program across the full range of instruments, including voice, integrally linked to the real world of professional orchestras and opera through internships and mentoring relationships. Training will be provided flexibly for a broad range of orchestral roles, including concertmaster and orchestra section principal, and will include accredited and non-accredited training individually tailored to meet the needs of students. In addition to the international class teaching and access to visiting artists, students will have access to the resources of the University of Melbourne’s new school of music and to the university’s support services and facilities. Importantly, students will not be required to pay university tuition fees and will be able to access travel and living bursaries determined on a needs basis. This will particularly assist those students who need to move from outside the Melbourne region to participate in ANAM programs. While the university works towards the formal opening of the revitalised ANAM in July 2009, transition arrangements will include the offer of a range of degree and non-degree training opportunities for students who would otherwise have expected to enrol in the ANAM program in 2009.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is important to put these developments on the record in light of some of the myths and filibuster which emerged during the adjournment debate from the member for Moncrieff. The university is working to individually tailor the best training options for each student during the transition period. As at 27 November more than half of the 2009 ANAM intake had approached the university regarding their training options for 2009. With regard to the future for current ANAM staff, the university is ready to offer placements to the three musical teaching staff and has confirmed that ANAM administrative staff will be considered as part of the regular recruitment process.

            if required. The Rudd government understands and respects the views of those who are concerned about its decisions relating to the delivery of elite-level classical music training in Australia. It should be clear that the decisions have stemmed from the need to implement a number of reforms recommended in two independent reviews undertaken between 2005 and 2006. These issues included the need for ANAM to enhance national leadership and improve collaboration across the elite music training sector, to improve the national reach of its training program and to implement a rational approach to bursaries and travel scholarships. The Rudd government believes that the revitalised
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_National_Academy_of_Music" rel="nofollow">
             Australian National Academy of Music
            </a>
            will deliver comprehensive elite-level, professional performance training programs that respond flexibly to the training needs of our most talented young musicians and connect strongly to orchestras and the Australian classical music sector.
