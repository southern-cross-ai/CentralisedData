        I rise today to pay tribute and bid farewell to one of my constituents and a very hardworking member of the

        , Paula Keyes. Sadly, she passed away on Thursday, 30 July this year. Paula was a young woman dedicated to helping others. Whether through local schools, church groups or community organisations or indeed through her political involvement, Paula was always and constantly advocating for those less fortunateâ€”for abused children, victims of domestic violence and families living with disabilities. She mounted a campaign to prevent the closure of a community based library so it could continue to provide educational programs and assistance to children from disadvantaged backgrounds.

        You could always count on Paula to take a stand. She was a woman of high principles, a very religious woman devoted to her church, serving on the council of the Good Shepherd Catholic parish in

        . But Paula was also the vice-president of the Hinchinbrook branch of the Labor Party. Paula always made her presence felt. She was a tireless campaigner for the Labor Party. During elections she would work day and night to support the Labor team. Day after day she would volunteer in the party's office, working in the phone bank. Paula was the first volunteer to make 1,000 calls to residents on behalf of the campaign, and she went on to make many thousands more. The member for Greenway and I were just two of the MPs who benefited from Paula's dedication, commitment and unshakable belief in the Labor cause.
       </p>

        In 2013 Paula received the coveted McKell Award. This reward is reserved for those in the Labor Party who have made a long and distinguished contribution. We were then, and remain now, very proud of our friend. Paula was an extremely dedicated teacher, as well as being a passionate advocate for women and children in need. She took it upon herself only last year to organise and host a domestic violence forum in Liverpool, involving police, local community leaders and a cross-section of our community. Paula was a remarkable young woman. She will be sorely missed by everybody who knew her. I offer my sincere condolences to Paula's family, particularly her mother, Patricia. May she rest in peace.
