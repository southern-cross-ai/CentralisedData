        On 14 December, the Vietnam Veterans Federation of

        's new home, in the heart of my electorate, will officially be opened. I recently joined President Mal Thiele, Vice-President Bob Ellis
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">

        , members and guests for a sneak preview of their purpose-built headquarters and for their first barbecue there. The Vietnam vets had to find a new home as a result of the long-awaited Oaklands Crossing grade separation project. I worked very hard with Mal, Bob and the federation members to secure their new facilities. I think that, together, we made a very formidable team.
       </p>
       <p>
        The federation is now co-located with the Marion
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and I thank President Trevor Chapman and the RSL members for their support. It has been wonderful to see how both groups have worked together. It has been a time of friendship, healing and great activity. We now have the RSL, Vietnam vets, the Marion RSL bowling club and many community groups using the building and the war memorial, gardens and fabulous playground that I was able to support with the federal government's Stronger Communities grant. I'm delighted that the Vietnam vets have been able to remain headquartered in our community where they do so much for so many people. On behalf of our community in Boothby, I would like to thank the Vietnam vets for the support and care they provide to so many people locally and across South Australia. I congratulate the Vietnam Veterans Federation on the opening of their new building, and I look forward to creating many new memories with them at their home in the coming months and years.
