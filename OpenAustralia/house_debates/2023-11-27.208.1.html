        I rise to speak on behalf of Edgar Stirling, aged 14, who wrote this speech. Edgar is not a seasoned politician but a student, and he wrote this important speech with regard to mental illness because he knows that, as it is part of his own family and part of his schoolmate's, it is a battle that many people face. He says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our mental health system needs urgent attention. In Australia, adults access care easier than teenagers, despite 1 in 7 adolescents facing mental illness. The youth are resolute in demanding reform. We must allocate resources, enact meaningful policies, and bring about tangible change in our system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        So, what steps are vital to fix these issues across states and territories?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Firstly, we must support gradually deteriorating patients who aren't in a critical state. Funds for respite recovery programs will offer them much needed care. Proactive interventions before disaster can prevent future crises.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Improving mental health clinics is also vital. Funding for infrastructure will reduce the wait time for clinic beds, which can currently be days.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our schools deserve attention as well. Mental health resources and counsellors should be available in government schools, to provide students with strategies to deal with problems.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Within our mental health system, inaction is not an option. Let's act now, for the sake of future generations who deserve a safer childhood.
       </p>
       <p>
        Edgar, I say to you: thank you for your advocacy and thank you for your words. We must continue to improve the mental health of all Australians, especially our young people.
       </p>
