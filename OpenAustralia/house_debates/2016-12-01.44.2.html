        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Energy_Agency" rel="nofollow">
         International Energy Agency
        </a>
        Tenancy Fit-Out.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade proposes to undertake the base building refurbishment and an integrated fit-out of the area leased by the International Energy Agency within the Australian chancery complex in Paris. The Australian chancery in Paris accommodates the permanent missions to France, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.
       </p>
       <p>
        Built in 1977 the chancery has approximately 11,215 square metres of net lettable area of which 5,650 square metres is being utilised to accommodate Australian government operations and functions. The surplus space of 5,565 square metres has been leased to the International Energy Agency since 1996.
       </p>
       <p>
        The International Energy Agency lease is due to expire in April 2017, and a new lease for their future office accommodation needs is being negotiated on commercial market terms for a further 12 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        A precondition of the International Energy Agency's future occupation of the tenancy in the chancery is a refurbishment of base building services and an integrated fit-out of their tenancy. The proposed works include base building refurbishment and fit-out of the International Energy Agency leased area to provide an efficient, modern and functional accommodation that includes office facilities, an auditorium, conference rooms and improved amenities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project is valued at an estimated $27.73 million and includes all costs associated with the fit-out such as builders' costs, consultant fees, furniture, fittings and equipment, contingencies, and escalation allowance. Subject to parliamentary approval of the project, the fit-out works is expected to commence in mid-2017, with completion expected by mid-2019. I commend the motion to the House.

       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade proposes to construct a new Australian Embassy in Washington
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DC" rel="nofollow">
         DC
        </a>
        in order to maintain a presence in the heart of the Washington diplomatic precinct. This proposal will provide a contemporary chancery that distinctly defines and showcases Australia's physical presence in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_DC" rel="nofollow">
         Washington DC
        </a>
        . It will provide for the Australian government's existing operational requirements as well as for future foreign policy, defence and security, intelligence, development, trade and economic cooperation objectives and needs. The new
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_embassy" rel="nofollow">
         Australian embassy
        </a>
        will be purpose-built and will showcase Australian architecture and engineering design. The building will provide a contemporary facility incorporating ecological sustainable designs and conform with appropriate work, health and safety regulations.
       </p>
       <p>
        The existing embassy was constructed in 1967 and the building and services are at the end of their useable life. The general running of the embassy is subject to significant business continuity risks that could compromise critical core functions for the Australian government. The proposed works include a fit-out of a temporary chancery, the demolition of the existing chancery and the construction of a new chancery. The project is valued at an estimated $236.9 million and includes fit-out of temporary office accommodation, demolition, construction of the works and all other related elements such as design consultant fees, project management, supervision and site office expenses.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subject to parliamentary approval of the project and following design development, the temporary accommodation fit-out works is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2018, with completion and occupation expected by the first quarter of 2019. Demolition followed by construction of the new chancery is expected to commence in the second quarter of 2019 and be completed and occupied in the first half of 2022. I commend the motion to the House.

       <p>
        The Department of Immigration and Border Protection proposes to undertake a fit-out and refurbishment of new and existing leased premises at 5 and 6 Chan Street and 45 Benjamin Way, Belconnen, and at 3 Molonglo Drive, Canberra Airport Precinct, in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Capital Territory
        </a>
        . The project is driven by the expiration of current leases, targeted Commonwealth efficiencies and the need for appropriate accommodation designed to enhance Immigration's capability across all areas of business. The new fit-outs will give Immigration a new work place that is innovative and fit-for-purpose.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Immigration and Border Protection has a substantial presence in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        and this will continue when the department is consolidated from 12 buildings into four buildings. Immigration will substantially reduce the amount of office space it holds in the ACT by approximately 14,000 square metres. The proposed works include new workstations, offices and meeting areas, specialist operations areas, new security systems, advanced technology in conference rooms, training and video conferencing facilities, including the Australian Border Force College, and new multiuse, non-denominational rooms and amenity areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        The estimated cost of the fit-out is $257.39 million, excluding
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST

        , and covers all costs associated with the delivery of the project, including provision for contingencies, cost escalation and professional fees. Subject to parliamentary approval, the fit-out is expected to begin in early 2017 with staged completion scheduled from mid 2018 to early 2021. I commend the motion to the House.

        currently have a substantial presence in the regional centre of Geelong and are currently located in a number of buildings across the city. The proposal will deliver considerable operational efficiencies for both agencies through the co-location of staff and the consolidation and rationalisation of leases. Operational savings will also be achieved through the implementation of high-energy efficient technologies in the new building. The development of the building will have a positive impact on the local community, providing commercial lettable space as well as office accommodation, increasing employment opportunities in the region and stimulating business activity.

        The Department of Immigration and Border Protection proposes to undertake construction works and upgrades to the Melbourne Immigration Transit Accommodation facility in Broadmeadows, Victoria. The proposed works will provide a level of amenity consistent with the features of existing Australian immigration detention centres that accommodate high-risk detainees. The proposed works include 140 high-security beds, adequate amenities, capacity to separate cohorts within compounds, and sophisticated and suitable security infrastructure. The estimated cost of the construction works is $29.07 million, excluding GST, which covers all costs associated with the delivery of the project, including associated decommissioning, civil works, in-ground services, information and communication technology, fencing, lighting, security, landscaping, preliminaries, consultant fees and contingency. Subject to parliamentary approval of the project, construction is expected to commence in March 2017 and be completed by October 2017.

        The Department of Immigration and Border Protection proposes to upgrade the Yongah Hill Immigration Detention Centre facility located in Northam, Western Australia, to make it suitable for increased numbers of high-risk detainees. The Yongah Hill facility is not fit for purpose to manage high-risk detainees, as it was largely designed to accommodate a low- to medium-risk case load. The proposed upgrades will provide a level of amenity consistent with the features of existing Australian immigration detention centres that accommodate high-risk detainees. The upgrade includes 120 high-security beds, adequate amenities, capacity to separate cohorts within compounds, necessary civil works and suitable security infrastructure. The estimated cost of the construction works is $27.43 million, excluding GST, which covers all costs associated with the delivery of the upgrades. Subject to parliamentary approval of the project, construction is expected to be undertaken in two phases commencing in March 2017, with completion expected by March 2018.
