        Last Sunday I saw a prime example of why I am so honoured to represent the seat of Chifley. Last Sunday, some of Western Sydney's community turned out en masse to dig deep for people most of them had never met, hundreds of thousands left homeless and hungry after becoming the innocent victims of Super Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines on 8 November.

        The '

        , We Care' day, which was hosted by the member for McMahon, the member for Greenway and myself, was one that brought the community together. There were a lot of performances and activities for the kids, all with the solemn purpose of raising funds for people in great need. It was held on the grounds of the Arnott's factory at Huntingwood, grounds not before opened to the public. I want to particularly thank the plant manager, Trevor Campbell, who was willing to do anything and everything to make the day a success, and a great deal of thanks to all his staff as well.

        'The Philippines, We Care' fundraiser saw many faces of the Australian-Filipino community out, along with members of other ethnic communities, who wanted to do whatever they could to help the people of the Philippines. The efforts of fellow Western Sydneysiders is not lost on them. The funds, which have passed the $15,000 mark, are being donated to

        to help people on the ground in the affected areas within the Philippines. I am sure that those affected would be asking us all to please not give up on giving.
