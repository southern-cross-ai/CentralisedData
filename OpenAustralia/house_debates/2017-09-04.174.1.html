         You might be eligible for this one day! The CTAP announcement was made at a company called Globaltech in Forrestfield. CTAP is part of this government's $110 million mature-age employment package announced in the 2017-18 budget, creating opportunities for mature-aged Australians to re-skill.

         You might need this, member for Perth. It is a program which is recognising the skills and experience older Australians are able to offer and giving them the confidence to get back into the workforce. The government has recognised that there are many older Australians looking for work. They may be looking for a new occupation or have struggled to find work after spending decades in industries that are now in decline. The program is designed to ensure that mature-age Australians can retrain and integrate back into the workforce and is currently to be trialled in five locations across Australia from 1 July next year. It will deliver short, intensive courses consisting of skill assessments, exploring suitable occupations and teaching resilience strategies.

         We met
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Howard" rel="nofollow">
          Alan Howard
         </a>
         , from Globaltech, who has re-entered the workforce at the age of 56 and is working with the company to manufacture devices for mining and drilling applications. Alan is unique, as he travels five hours every day just to get to his new employment. Alan is thoroughly enjoying his new job and has a new lease on life with the work he's doing. I'd like to thank the minister for coming to Swan and congratulate her on the work she's put into this great program.
