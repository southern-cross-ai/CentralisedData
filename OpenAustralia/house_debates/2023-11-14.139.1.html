        Before I go on to my own comments, I want to respond very briefly to those comments. We know that farmers are some of the best land managers around, and one of the things that our government takes pride in is working hand in hand with private landholders on really important conservation, including managing weeds on their property and dealing with feral animals: goats, pigs, cats and so on. One of the ways that we could drive even more investment into that private land management is by having your support for the Nature Repair Market, so I'll look forward to that.

        It's no secret that one of my very favourite parts of being a local member is visiting our fantastic schools in Sydney and seeing what the students, the staff and the community are up to. I recently went, just last week, to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Park_Community_School" rel="nofollow">
         Alexandria Park Community School
        </a>
        , which has just had a total rebuild, and it was just stunning. The school leaders showed me around their beautiful new facilities, including their open-plan learning areas. The students are learning Dharawal language, which is fantastic. I met the wonderful new principal, Debra Lade, and members of the school executive. The students particularly wanted to show me the Maani, which is their rooftop garden, and the school chicken coop. I got to meet the chickens, and we found a potato. The kindergarten students showed me the work they were doing there. They are really exciting learning opportunities for the kids.

        As well as that, recently, I went to Gardeners Road Public School. I went to a fantastic assembly one Friday morning in August. We were handing out environmental awards to some of the students that had shown real environmental leadership at the school. I want to acknowledge that Gardeners Road Public School will soon be celebrating its 140th anniversary. It is a wonderful school. As you go in the gates of the school, you see the beautiful sculpture of the cricket players on the school gates there. We're also very lucky to welcome many schools to parliament throughout the year. Question time is nothing without these students watching on passionately and inquisitively. I've had visits from Newtown Public School, Gardeners Road, Erskineville Public School and Ultimo Public School.

        Of course, our government believes that every child in every school deserves the best possible education, and that's why we're upgrading facilities, including in my area. We've announced funding for six schools: Yudi Gunyi, Glebe Public School,

        . I want to thank all of the hardworking staff of these schools. I want to thank the parents and carers who look after the kids and, most particularly, the kidsâ€”who are always our hope for the future.
