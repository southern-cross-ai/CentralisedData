        On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Capital" rel="nofollow">
         National Capital
        </a>
        and External Territories, I present the committee's delegation report to the Antarctic Parliamentarians Assembly, London, United Kingdom, 1 to 4 December 2019.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased to present the report of the delegation from the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories to the Antarctic Parliamentarians Assembly. The inaugural Antarctic Parliamentarians Assembly took place in London on 2 and 3 December 2019. The assembly was conceived and convened by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        parliament's All-Party Parliamentary Group for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_Regions" rel="nofollow">
         Polar Regions
        </a>
        . I represented the committee at the assembly, along with the then committee chair, the member for Hinkler, now Minister for Resources, Water and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Australia
        </a>
        , Minister Pitt. The concept for the assembly was modelled to some extent on the Conference of Parliamentarians of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_Region" rel="nofollow">
         Arctic Region
        </a>
        , which has been in operation since 1993.
       </p>
       <p>
        The assembly was attended by 19 parliamentarians from 13 countries, along with officials from a number of other Antarctic treaty parties and an impressive range of Antarctic experts from various disciplines. Participants heard and discussed a range of high-quality presentations on matters including the success to date of current challenges facing the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Treaty_System" rel="nofollow">
         Antarctic Treaty System
        </a>
        , the very significant impact of climate and environmental changes on the health and sustainability of Antarctica, its living species and surrounding ocean, the importance of Antarctica as a place of scientific research, the costs and benefits of the growth of Antarctic tourism and the need to ensure its sustainability into the future, and economic and geopolitical interests in Antarctica and how these might impact international debates about governance of the continent. Importantly, the assembly provided an opportunity for us to express our shared support, as parliamentarians, for the preservation of Antarctica as a natural reserve devoted to peace and science.
       </p>
       <p>
        The participants in the assembly issued a statement reinforcing key principles, which was issued publicly and is included in the delegation's report, which I've now tabled. Participants at the assembly agreed that the gathering had value and should become a recurring event, aiming to meet every two years and to alternate between the northern and southern hemispheres. There was strong support for Australia and/or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        to offer to host the next assembly, in 2021. Our delegation considered that there would be value in this parliament hosting the next Antarctic Parliamentarians Assembly in either Hobart or Canberra. We recognise the need for more detailed consideration before such a commitment could be made, so in its report, Mr Speaker, the delegation proposed that this option be further considered by the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, subject to your views and those of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Senate" rel="nofollow">
         President of the Senate
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the committee, I thank you, Mr Speaker, and your compatriot the President of the Senate for supporting our participation in the assembly. I also recognise the contribution of my co-delegate and the very capable former chair of the committee the member for Hinkler, now Minister Pitt. We were able to work seamlessly together and speak with one voice in representing Australia's achievements and perspectives on this important issue. We also, of course, extend our great appreciation to all those who assisted with arranging, hosting and supporting our visit, including the staff of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_High_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian High Commission
        </a>
        in London. But I particularly want to acknowledge Professor Steven Chown, from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monash_University" rel="nofollow">
         Monash University
        </a>
        , and Professor Tim Naish, from New Zealand's Antarctic Research Centre, for their professional advice, support and expertise during the assembly. I'd also like to thank, importantly, the committee secretary, Shennia Spillane, for all her work in helping us along the way, for organising the trip and for her support and friendship. I commend the report to the House.
