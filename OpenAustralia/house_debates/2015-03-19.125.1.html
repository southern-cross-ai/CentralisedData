        Getting back to the electorate for a week wedged between a set of two sitting fortnights helps put a reality flavour back into the work of being in politics. My first Saturday began with an

        breakfast hosted by the Zonta Club of Berry—as always great company and great women. That night was a mental health ice awareness forum, where Julie Danser had galvanised friends, bands and professionals from the medical, legal and correctional services to give their insights into the effects of ice in our community. This was another follow-up activity resulting from the first forum I arranged last November to keep the problem of ice high on the local agenda. Also, we have a parents support group and a local resource pamphlet is in the development phase. We simply cannot let this disgusting, addictive drug go under the radar.
       </p>
       <p>
        There was the official opening of a transformed derelict space near the local car park. The

        created a colourful rest and play area for the community. There were clowns, a band, a

        sausage sizzle and children everywhere. About six weeks ago, on a hot 34-degree day, Susan Tracey from the council, Bonnie Marshall from my office and I painted giant jelly beans on the large electricity box to theme the park, so the children really could relate to this terrific space.
       </p>
       <p>
        But I think the extraordinary highlight happened when I had the privilege of visiting two schools in my electorate. While I consider every school in my electorate to be important, these two were very special to me this week. At Shoalhaven Heads Public School, at the invitation of the principal,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Henderson" rel="nofollow">
         Ian Henderson
        </a>
        , I witnessed a very interesting adaptation of a parliamentary school assembly. I was able to take the props—the serjeant's garb, lace collar, cuffs and mace—and talk a little about the real parliament in Canberra. I was greeted by two prime ministers, Kysha Thomson and Kai Creary, and two deputy ministers, Josie Maddinson and Ned Simister. They were fascinated to hear that question time really is not the main activity while we are in the House. I actually wondered who had the more real parliament! The students were putting fair dinkum, directly relevant ideas forward for balanced discussion. The students were confident and curious, asking many questions. Their process was very interactive and it clearly encouraged them to think about their school community while learning about the Australian parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        I had the opportunity to watch their ministers: Jamie Griffin for sport, Alex Holland for health and safety, Lawson Penn for technology, Chloe Hinkley for functions, charities and media, Jack Bath for library and Jena Dodd, the Assistant Minister for Library, all part of the debate on important issues in their school.
       </p>
       <p>
        The process included questions asked by members from the floor—that is, the other school students. One example of this was the costings and locations involved in a new bubbler rack for the students. While this issue may seem minor to us, the students took the matter very seriously, with one student rejecting the need for a new bubbler and insisting that students simply make the 30-second walk to the current bubbler location. Watching these young members of my electorate embrace leadership in their school community was very rewarding.
       </p>
       <p>
        At Barrack Heights Public School, under the guidance of their principal, Sarah Rudling, they have two prime ministers, Jay Irvine-Pronk and Ruby McPhillips, as well as two shadow prime ministers, Hunter Debnam and Poppi-Rose Roach—a unique interpretation, but equally special. The remaining year 6 students were the ministers. The pride of the parents as they stood behind their young children now given the badges and recognition of school leadership was palpable. Many of us in the audience could feel that wondrous sharing of new respect, pride and expectation. The school captains from Warilla High and Oak Flats High were great role models for these newly inducted school leaders. They spoke well and their words were inspirational. These two visits gave me a great sense of joy and optimism about the young people in Gilmore. It was a reminder that we as politicians hold what should be an honoured position in our own communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the electorate of Gilmore there are approximately 500 more primary school children enrolled in the region than there were ten years ago. The region is thriving with families, and these young leaders are learning to take responsibility for their schools and their fellow students. They are working to improve their own place. At the same time they are developing critical thinking skills in negotiation and debate. They are also learning how to speak with confidence and conviction on issues that concern their peers and how to represent their school.
       </p>
       <p>
        Perhaps we could learn a thing or two from them, for amongst these young people are our next generation of lawyers, police men and women, teachers, paramedics, nurses, web designers,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT" rel="nofollow">
         IT
        </a>
        experts, doctors, plumbers, social workers, councillors, builders, bakers, managers, scientists or community representatives—even federal members. We simply do not know where their futures may go, as there is so much technology and change in front of us. We can only praise these young leaders for the potential they are building in their roles at school. This truly was a great week of reconnection with the real side of being a politician.
