        I start with the words: 'I sat down and watched the news and thought: 'My cousin runs up and down there. Just a split second and everyone's life changes.' This is a statement from the cousin of one of the police officers who was tragically killed in the line of duty in Victoria. I've chosen this statement because I think it puts in perspective the inherent dangers of everyday policing and the significant personal toll that it can have on families of police officers.
       </p>
       <p>
        National Police Remembrance Day will be observed on 27 September this year. It is one of the most significant days in the national police calendar. As a nation, we pause to remember the police officers who have lost their lives in the execution of their duty and to honour the courage, commitment and dedication of all police members who have sworn to protect their communities. Policing comes with a high degree of risk and danger that thankfully most of us will never have to face. It truly takes a special type of person with a special type of courage to wear the police uniform, and we are forever indebted to those fine men and women who choose to do so and recognise their commitment in ensuring the peace and safety of our communities, a duty of which they are sworn to uphold. Our safety and that of our families and the security of our homes, our businesses and, indeed, our democracy are all reliant on the enforcement of our laws—a task which primarily falls to our police.
       </p>
       <p>
        This Police Remembrance Day, as we fight off the global coronavirus pandemic, I would like to take the opportunity to also recognise the multi-faceted role undertaken by our police officers who have been serving on the front line across the nation. They continue to put their lives at risk to ensure the safety and wellbeing of our communities during these most challenging times.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year's service will see the total number of names of police officers listed on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Police_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
         National Police Memorial
        </a>
        wall regrettably rise again. This year we recognise the tragic loss of four members of the Victorian police force, namely Leading Senior Constable Lynette Taylor, Senior Constable
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_King" rel="nofollow">
         Kevin King
        </a>
        , Constable Glen Humphris and Constable Joshua Prestney. These four members of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Victoria Police
        </a>
        tragically lost their lives in a multi-vehicle collision on Melbourne's Eastern Freeway when a truck ploughed into them as they were responding to a speeding incident on that highway. This incident clearly saddened Victoria and, indeed, the nation, with this being the single biggest loss of police life in Victoria's history.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to take the opportunity to pay tribute to our police friends in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        and the family of Constable Matthew Dennis Hunt of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand_Police" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand Police
        </a>
        , who tragically lost his life in the line of duty earlier this year. It was a devastating incident in which I understand another police officer was also shot and a member of the public was injured as part of a routine police stop. The death of these police officers highlights the inherent danger involved in police work—not knowing what they are likely to face every time they commit to go on duty.
       </p>
       <p>
        National Police Remembrance Day is also a time for us to reflect on the loved ones who have been left behind, the families and friends whose lives have forever been affected. While we mourn with them, we thank and honour all police families, whose unconditional support allows these fine men and women to serve our community. We owe it—

          As I was saying, we owe it to the fallen to look after their families, which by the way is the work of Police Legacy, which is particularly important and deserving of our support. As a matter of fact, later this month there will be the police Wall to Wall Ride for Remembrance. It has been largely curtailed this year because of the pandemic. It is an opportunity for all police forces to come together with members to raise money for Police Legacy to look after the families of the fallen. To the four members of the Victorian police force who tragically lost their lives, to all police officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice and to all our past and current members of the police force, we honour you and we profoundly thank you for your service.

            I thank the member for Fowler for moving this important motion today. I acknowledge as we pause for National Police Remembrance Day the enormous contribution made by so many Australian men and women, who are at the forefront of our thoughts every day as they go about their duties. I am humbled to speak on behalf of the people of Kooyong in this place, acknowledging the crucial role that police officers play across our nation, their risk and their sacrifice in the performance of their duties.

            's leading senior constable Shane Hafner encapsulated the collective grief of the policing community nationwide when he wrote:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            We leave our families to protect your home and you,
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            And we do it because we care about what we do.
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            We do it to serve you and protect you as best as we can,

           <p class="italic">
            We do it even knowing what risks are at hand.
           </p>
           <p>
            It takes very special people to put on the blue uniform each day and go to work not knowing what lies ahead. For those police officers and their families, we say a big thanks. We obviously mourn with the families of those who have been lost.
           </p>

            In the COVID environment, which was silhouetting the April tragedy, our nation has not been able to gather to commemorate the sacrifice of these four heroes as we normally would, but in the days, weeks and months ahead we have been moved by our community's solidarity with Victoria Police and with the families of the fallen. While due to restrictions we have painfully not been able to yet farewell Lynette, Kevin, Joshua and Glen with the full honours they deserve, we remember the memorials that shone throughout the nation as hues of blue adorned Victorian parliament,

            The work of benevolent organisations like the Victoria Police Legacy and its counterparts play a vital role in supporting the grieving families of fallen heroes. In the moments after such unspeakable tragedies, legacy organisations stand resolutely in support of their families and loved ones, providing practical care at difficult times. This year, more than ever, National Police Remembrance Day and Blue Ribbon Day is a chance for our nation to express our gratitude to those who protect and serve our community and ensure that those who have fallen are never forgotten.
           </p>
           <p>
            2020 has been a difficult year for Victoria Police in my home state. The loss of Lynette, Kevin, Joshua and Glen in April and the tireless frontline efforts in response to devastating bushfires and the fight against coronavirus have each posed unique challenges for police members. Just as Joshua Prestney's father, Andrew Prestney, urged us all with such grace to not focus on the negativity that surrounds the tragic loss of life, we should commit each day to honour our police heroes by acknowledging and thanking them for their daily courage and bravery. As Andrew said, 'We can thank our guardians in blue with a smile and a nod.'
           </p>
           <p>
            I've been honoured to rise today to commemorate the sacrifice of Lynette, Joshua, Glen and Kevin on behalf of my community and to remember all police officers who have died in the line of duty. May they rest in peace. While we cannot imagine their grief, may the families of our fallen police draw comfort in our nation's respect. We will remember them. Hasten the dawn.

I note that the member for Kooyong is present here and that his community was also affected. Those Victorian officers joined Constable Timothy Proctor, from the Liverpool area command, who lost his life in a car accident last year. I know that the Liverpool command still feel that loss.

             National Police Remembrance Day acknowledges the crucial role that police officers play across Australia. Whether it's in our local communities at social events or assisting with national disasters or global pandemics, the police force are here to serve. 29 September is one of the most significant days in the national police calendar. As a nation we pause to remember the police officers who lost their lives while fulfilling their duty to protect the community. This day is an opportunity to honour the courage and commitment of all police members. Undoubtedly this year's commemorations will be very different because of the pandemic, but I know they will be no less heartfelt and solemn.
            </p>
            <p>
             The trust the community places in our police should never be underestimated. The risks faced by police officers every day in the variety of roles and responsibilities they take on are recognised and deeply respected by the community. Police officers are often called upon when people are facing some of the most distressing times in their lives. Situations such as this require calm, clear and focused voices. Police officers around the country provide the confidence and leadership that is required to support and care for people in need. Many officers have had to face these circumstances on several occasions and conduct themselves with the utmost professionalism.
            </p>
            <p>
             The logistics support during this pandemic delivered by the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
              New South Wales
             </a>
             Police Force, not only those in command but the officers on the ground, was essential to ensure the safety of our community. Throughout the changing landscape over the last 12 months, officers did not get complacent. They continued to keep the communities safe. I acknowledge and thank Liverpool city area commander Superintendent Adam Whyte for the great work he and his officers have performed in the electorate over the last 12 months. He and his command continue to provide a high level of professionalism and they have been providing resource and logistics support during the pandemic. Whether assisting with hotel quarantine, border surveillance or continuing to investigate crime and make arrests, they have been making our community proud.
            </p>
            <p>
             On a personal note, I thank Commander Whyte for always being available to me with advice and support, which has been indispensable. Not only is he great to chat to, he provided crucial guidance and direction during the pandemic's early days when their health orders were changing so rapidly. This made it much easier to properly coordinate my office so I could correctly and effectively provide advice for questions raised by constituents. The way in which officers approach their duty day in, day out should be an example to all of us. There's no such thing as a normal day at the office for a police officer. Their important role and their willingness to take on whatever comes makes them some of the finest members of their community.
            </p>
            <p>
             I'm extremely proud of the police, particularly in my community of Werriwa, and I thank all officers, all over Australia, for their service to our community. I pay tribute to the families and friends of the officers who've been killed in the line of duty. I commend the valuable work of Police Legacy, who look after the loved ones when police officers have fallen. I support the nation's police officers. I honour their courage, commitment and dedication to ensuring the peace and safety of our communities.

              I rise to speak about National Police Remembrance Day. As we approach National Police Remembrance Day, on 27 September, it is important that we acknowledge the crucial role that police officers serve in our communities and pay tribute to those officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the course of their duty.
             </p>

              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Freeway" rel="nofollow">
               Eastern Freeway
              </a>
              . I would like to extend my condolences to the families and friends of Leading Senior Constable Lynette Rosemary Taylor, Senior Constable Kevin Neil King, Constable Glen Andrew Humphris and Constable Joshua Andrew Prestney. We acknowledge the sacrifices they have made and all the police make to ensure our communities are a place of peace and safety.
             </p>
             <p>
              I also want to take this opportunity to commend the valuable work of Police Legacy, who look after the loved ones of police officers who have fallen in their line of duty. Being a member of the police force comes with an incredible physical and psychological risk, and this can also be experienced by the love ones in their extended police family. I know this because, as a psychologist, I would see police officers who had been exposed to traumatic events, which, unfortunately, increases their risk to post-traumatic stress disorder. Police Legacy develop lasting relationships with families who have lost loved ones in the line of duty and ensures their needs are being met. This may mean covering the cost of their children's education, providing referrals to bereavement counselling and other social services, or introducing them to other Police Legacy families who have also gone through the same grief.
             </p>
             <p>
              I would like to take this opportunity to affirm our nation's support for our police officers. I want to especially thank the commander of Burwood Police Area Command, Detective Superintendent Paul Delaney, and the commander of Auburn police Area Command, Acting Superintendent Peter Glynn. I want to thank them for taking the time to meet with me recently and to explain the challenges that police in my area have faced, especially in the recent months during the coronavirus pandemic. The scope of work they have had to take on due to the coronavirus, alongside their regular duties, is quite remarkable. They have been assisting and overseeing social distancing restrictions, border restrictions and even management of

              quarantine hotel operations. I thank our police officers, ADF personnel and first responders for the work they are doing in the community to help control the spread of coronavirus. It is yet another example of the many ways our police force steps up to make sure that our community is safe. I speak on behalf of those in Reid when I thank our police officers for their service and for their commitment to our communities, and I remember those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty.

               I also rise today to speak in support of the motion by the member for Fowler. I'd like to acknowledge the member for his ongoing dedication to this important day of police remembrance and his continued advocacy in all areas of policing. I also acknowledge the contribution of all other members here today. I note the motion reaffirms our support for the nation's police officers and honours their courage, commitment and dedication in ensuring the peace and safety of our communities. Of course, this is even more so the case now with the added duties our police are undertaking due to COVID-19 health restrictions across the nation. I'd like to acknowledge the additional challenges that those police are facing and commend them for all they are doing to keep us and our communities safe.

I'd like to thank and acknowledge the officers serving in the commands on the New South Wales North Coast, also specifically for their ongoing efforts during the COVID-19 crisis. I know firsthand the outstanding work that they are doing in these incredibly challenging times. Each police officer plays a vital role towards ensuring our local communities are safe. I acknowledge the great risk and personal sacrifice that comes with such duty.

               This year marks the 31st anniversary of Police Remembrance Day. It's a time when we pause to honour the lives and memories the police who've had their lives tragically cut short in their work protecting us. It is a very solemn and important day for police officers, their loved ones and the wider police family. It's also an important day for our community to reflect on the role of our police as they serve, protect and uphold the laws. In particular, we pay tribute to the men and women in the police service who've made the ultimate sacrifice. Together, we must ensure their legacies are preserved. This year, we specifically pay tribute to Leading Senior Constable Lynette Taylor, Constable Glen Humphris, Senior Constable
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_King" rel="nofollow">
                Kevin King
               </a>
               and Constable Joshua Prestney, all of whom tragically lost their lives in a multiple vehicle collision on Melbourne's

               on 22 April this year. I wish to extend my deepest sympathies to their family, friends and colleagues. It's in these difficult times that wider support is incredibly essential.
              </p>
              <p>
               On that note, I wish to pay tribute to the very enduring work of Police Legacy. Police Legacy is a remarkable organisation providing services to police legatees and members of the wider police family. In New South Wales, Police Legacy provides support services and advocacy to around 1,000 police legatees, and, for more than 30 years,
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
                NSW
               </a>
               Police Legacy has been providing both financial assistance and, indeed, support for our police families. Also, as a former general duties police officer myself, I've seen firsthand some of the situations and complexities that police officers face, day-in and day-out, whilst serving their communities in the execution of their duties. It's important to acknowledge that, again, these individuals are out there working hard for us and they sometimes have to face difficult, confronting and, indeed, very dangerous situations. It's during these times that police are sometimes faced with fatal incidents and horrific tragedies. It's often the same police who then have to deliver very heartbreaking news to the families that a loved one has died. So I'd like to commend the police for their empathy, strength and professionalism in performing such work. I also would like to acknowledge the post-traumatic stress disorders that some officers may carry as a direct result of their police experience.
              </p>
              <p>
               Recognising and responding to the issues, pressures and challenges that our police face is, indeed, essential and we must raise the public's awareness of the realities that police officers face in their duties. In fact, there are many specific challenges in policing in regional areas as well, like mine on the New South Wales North Coast. I have commented many times on this and continue to call for more staff and associated resources for regional communities like mine on the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_North_Coast" rel="nofollow">
                Far North Coast
               </a>
               of New South Wales. I encourage locals in my area and across the country to take a moment to think about the role that police officers play within our community, in our area and, indeed, right throughout the country. Particularly during the COVID-19 crisis, we need to think about the extra workload that police have and work with them. It is a very challenging time and they are doing a remarkable job as we move through this pandemic. I congratulate them on the work they're doing and commend them for their work, and I ask the community to work with them. I would like to say to the police in my local area and indeed throughout the nation: thank you for service. National Police Remembrance Day is a very important occasion. It's an occasion for us all to come together and recognise our police services, and I certainly encourage everyone in the community to do that on National Police Remembrance Day.

                Last year, to mark Police Remembrance Day, I spoke at a ceremony held by Benalla Police Service Area at the St Peter's World War I memorial church in Kinglake. It was a privilege to speak beside Reverend Eden Nicholls, police chaplain from Benalla police, and Sergeant Matthew Wheeler, from the Kinglake police. The church was rebuilt after the 2009 fires, and the backdrop to the altar was a wall of glass, giving view to the most magnificent mountain and valley scenery. No stained glass could replicate the beauty, nor could it act as a starker reminder of the force of nature that had swept upon that town.

                This year, like so many things, Police Remembrance Day will be marked differently. There will likely be no public gatherings in towns across Victoria, only quiet moments of reflection as we contemplate and mark our gratitude for the service and for the sacrifice of the people who keep our communities safe. And yet, sadly, this year we have much to remember. Fresh in our minds in Victoria is the immense tragedy of the incident on the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Freeway" rel="nofollow">
                 Eastern Freeway
                </a>
                on 22 April, where four officers died in the course of undertaking their duty. The Eastern Freeway tragedy took the lives of Senior Constable
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_King" rel="nofollow">
                 Kevin King
                </a>
                , Leading Senior Constable Lynette Taylor, Constable Joshua Prestney and Constable Glen Humphris. I'd like to add my voice and the voice of the people of Indi to those before me in expressing my sadness and condolences to their families, colleagues and friends.
               </p>
               <p>
                Motor vehicle incidents have claimed the lives of Indi police officers too, including Senior Constable Rennie Page in 2005 and Senior Constable Anne Brimblecombe in 2006. To their families, friends, colleagues and the communities that they protected: we remember. I'd also like to take this opportunity to thank some of the wonderful police officers in Indi, who do so much to keep our community safe. Country policing is hard business. Our men and women in blue are often called to car crashes, scenes of domestic violence and other traumas. They're there for us in bushfires and in floods. And in a small community, when tragedy strikes, there's a fair chance that the country police officer knows the people involved.

                There are people like Bruce Colval from Alexandra, who retired on 1 July, after a 43-year career as a police officer. Bruce joined the force at 17 and spent 30 years working in the Alexandra, Eildon, Marysville, Taggerty and Yarck areas. When he retired, Bruce told the

                 The Alexandra Standard
                </i>

                And there's Laurie Bould, a former senior sergeant of Chiltern. He arrived in the town in 1975 and raised his four kids with his wife, Anne, who nursed at the bush nursing hospital. When Laurie retired a few years ago, he kept serving his community. He got stuck right in to leading an array of community groups, including the community emergency response team, the cemetery trust and the Chiltern fishing club. Laurie's a talented pianist and can be regularly found smashing out the tunes with flute player Mary-Anne O'Connor in a duo that Laurie aptly named The Bold and the Beautiful.
