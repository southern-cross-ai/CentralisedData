         Order! The minister will just pause for a moment. The question is going to be read again, and it will be heard in silence. If anyone interjects, they won't remain here. I don't know how more clear I can make this: if they want to interject once the minister is answering, that's a members choice, but not during a question! I hope everyone understands that now.

           I thank the member for Adelaide very much for the question. This government is absolutely committed to delivering the infrastructure Australia needs, creating jobs and growing the economy while not increasing pressure on inflation.

            Order! The minister will pause. The member for Gippsland will leave the chamber under 94(a) and take whatever he's got with him—and not leave it behind! The minister is in continuation and will be heard in silence.

            <p>
             Thank you very much. It's not unsurprising that it's the National Party blokes who are making the most noise on this issue—not surprising at all! The Labor government is absolutely committed to delivering the infrastructure Australia needs to create our jobs and grow the economy whilst not increasing pressure on inflation. The simple truth is that those opposite failed to manage the Infrastructure Investment Program during their wasted decade. They set the nation on a path to $33 billion of cost blowouts and an inability to add any new projects to the pipeline until 2033. That is the legacy of those opposite.
            </p>
            <p>
             The economic mismanagement of those opposite in announcing projects they knew did not have enough money and which couldn't be delivered is, frankly, breathtaking. It let down every single one of those in communities who believed in their false promises.
            </p>
            <p>
             Today I have announced the outcomes of the Independent Strategic Review of the Infrastructure Investment Program. The review made 15 recommendations, all of which the government has agreed to or agreed to in principle. No funding has been cut from the $120 billion pipeline, and all states—every single state—have maintained the same amount of funding in the pipeline that they previously had.
            </p>
            <p>
             Over the next 10 years, more than 400 nation-building projects are expected to be completed or substantially developed. When we say we're going to deliver a project, the community can have faith that we will do so. We are delivering the north-south corridor Torrens to Darlington project in Adelaide; we proposed an additional $2.7 billion. For the Logan to

             is to start imminently. For METRONET on the west coast, we proposed an additional $1 billion. The Tanami, a favourite project of mine in

             in Tasmania, long awaited by Tasmanians. These are important projects across the nation. The Albanese Labor government is delivering the infrastructure that Australia needs to build a better future.
