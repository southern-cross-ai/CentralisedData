       <p class="italic">
        (a) the Global Gag Rule (

        ), as implemented by the United States, will prove detrimental to millions of women and girls around the world;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the GGR has expanded to an unprecedented degree, applying to 15 times more funding as a consequence of its extension into all global health funding, which will result in roughly $9.5 billion dollars in global health funding being affected;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) the GGR will result in the targeting of some of the most effective health organisations in the world, operating in 60 low and middle income countries;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) a study by researchers at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University" rel="nofollow">
         Stanford University
        </a>
        found that after the GGR came into effect in 2001, the abortion rate increased sharply in sub-Saharan African countries that had been dependent on such funding;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) the funding cuts will likely prevent many global health organisations from offering HIV prevention and treatment services, maternal health care and even Zika virus prevention; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) it is possible that as many as 21,700 maternal deaths could occur in the next four years as a consequence of this executive order, which is in addition to 6.5 million unintended pregnancies and 2.1 million unsafe abortions from 2017 to 2020, according to

        (2) notes that:

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) under the Coalition, development assistance is now just 0.23 per cent of national income, the lowest level since comparable records began in the 1970s, and well below the

        (b) the Premier:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) in his election platform stated: 'More young people are turning to a life of crime. Crime has increased every year. Courts and prison systems are under huge pressure'; and

        (ii) took only one promise to that election in regards to law and order—$148.6 million to free up some of the 400 officers who supervise prisoners in holding cells;

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Victorian Government
        </a>
        has seen prison riots, millions of dollars in damage to prison facilities, and a total loss of control over the justice system;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) when the Premier was elected, the crime rate was 7,869 offences per 100,000 Victorians, and Victoria's crime rate two years later is now 8,975 offences per 100,000 Victorians;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) between October 2015 and September 2016 this crime rate includes 12.6 per cent more assaults, 21.5 per cent more robberies, 13.7 per cent more burglaries and break and enters, 17.5 per cent more thefts, and 75.3 per cent more justice procedures;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) the Victorian Government is unable to control the criminals in prison let alone the criminals on the streets of Victoria; and

       <p class="italic">
        (g) under the Victorian Government, Victorians are just less safe;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) further notes that the Australian Government supports the fight against crime in Victoria more broadly and specifically in the electoral division of Dunkley through measures such as $925,150 from the Safer Streets Programme (

        (4) condemns the Victorian Government for a lack of action on law and order and failing to protect Victorians.

       <p class="italic">
        (e) the Deloitte 2017 Millennial Survey suggests that young people struggle to engage with major political parties—not having a Youth Minister acts as a clear signal that engagement with young people is not a priority for this Government; and

       <p class="italic">
        (f) Australia's youth unemployment and underemployment are an increasingly systemic concern, with the current youth unemployment rate sitting at 13.3 per cent and the youth underemployment rate sitting at 18.3 per cent; and
