       <p>
        It always gives me great joy to send birthday wishes to my constituents in my electorate for their milestone birthdays. This weekend I will be together with my family, celebrating a very special milestone birthday, the 80th birthday of my beautiful mum.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mum was born in Melbourne of migrant heritage to parents who struggled financially and with all that went with being a new migrant. She was the middle child of three and the only girl. Despite the fact that both Mum's brothers—one older and one younger—became doctors, Mum was denied an education to meet her dreams and aspirations to become a nurse. 'Never give up and always be financially independent,' was Mum's mantra. It was an inspiration to me and I'm sure to many other women. She worked throughout her life in an age where it was considered a status symbol for many women to not have to work. Mum has always valued and treasured the power of women's friendship and was always the one to ensure that we knew what was important in life: family, good health, happiness, love and respect for all.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mum's focus on ensuring that my brother and I had exactly the same opportunities, despite all that historical context in her life, has inspired in me my focus on gender and cultural equality and always helping those in need. Mum, you are the greatest role model, an inspiration, and always will be. I love you with all my heart. Happy 80th birthday.
