       <p>
        Just before members leave, I want to address the House on something. I note that the member for Warringah isn't in the chamber, but hopefully she's listening from her office.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Thursday" rel="nofollow">
         Last Thursday
        </a>
        the member for Warringah raised an issue with me relating to the length of last Wednesday's sitting, which ran through Wednesday night and into the early hours of Thursday morning. The matter was also raised with me by the member for Chifley. As members know, the meeting and adjournment times of the House of Representatives are set out in the standing orders and a matter for the House to determine. On those occasions when the House sits longer hours to deal with specific legislation, a decision of the House is required. I understand this often occurs following discussions between the government and the opposition, and I am not involved in any way in those discussions. While sitting until 5 am is certainly not desirable, and I'm sure we all hope it is a rare occurrence, those who work in this building know it is always a possibility that longer hours of sitting may occur from time to time. However, I understand the member's concern about the House sitting through the night and finally adjourning just after 5 am, and I note recommendations of the Jenkins review aimed at balancing wellbeing with the business of the parliamentâ€”particularly recommendation 27, which addresses the parliamentary sitting calendar and the order of business. I expect matters such as this one raised by the member for Warringah will form part of the consideration of those recommendations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the parliamentary staff who worked through the night last Wednesday to ensure the business of the House was able to be completed.
