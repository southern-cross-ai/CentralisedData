       <p>
        I want to share with you today, Deputy Speaker and the House more broadly, a transformative vision for our nation's future—a vision grounded in support for our families, our small businesses, health care more broadly, building infrastructure and educating our people, whether they be the tiniest of tots or those who want to turn their hand to a trade later in life. It is all so vital to making our economy more productive.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the heart of this vision is a commitment to easing the financial burdens that we know Australians are feeling at the moment, and that starts with a good budget and, importantly, meaningful tax cuts. On 1 July this year, the Albanese Labor government will deliver a tax cut for every Australian taxpayer. I just want to say that again. The Albanese government, on 1 July this year, will deliver a tax cut for every Australian taxpayer. If you pay tax, it will be cut. In my seat of Paterson, that means 75,000 hardworking Australians are going to get, on average, around $1,500 tax back. That is such an exciting prospect, and I know that, for everyone who's ever had to do a family budget or a personal budget, let alone a budget for a nation, every dollar counts. That's why the Albanese government wants to make sure you get every dollar you can for your hard work in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        It also means that 65,000 people in my electorate, around 87 per cent of the electorate, are going to be better off under Labor's plans because we had the courage to revisit the tax. That's what we've done, and that's going to be the rub for all people who are earning and paying tax in Patterson.
       </p>
       <p>
        We know our small businesses are the backbone of our economy, employing 5.2 million Australians across the nation and contributing more than $500 million annually. In Paterson, we've got 10,238 small businesses—give or take a few, thanks to the statistics of the day. They're driving local prosperity. Their owners are getting up early, they're going to bed late, they're doing their paperwork, they're employing other Australians and, apart from those things, they're making our local communities such vibrant places. People come up with the most brilliant ideas for small business these days and they're working hard to make those ideas a reality. I want to personally thank them for that.
       </p>
       <p>
        We're implementing several key initiatives for small business, including energy bill relief. Starting on 1 July the Commonwealth will deliver rebates of $325 to approximately one million eligible small businesses—it's a small amount but it's an important amount, and we know that every dollar counts in small business too—through the Energy Bill Relief Fund. This will significantly reduce operational costs for many businesses in Paterson. Regarding the Small Business Debt Helpline, we're committing $3.1 million to extend support through the Small Business Debt Helpline, which assisted 1,232 small businesses in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        last year, offering vital guidance and relief. In relation to mental health support, we know having a small business can really be something that you worry about day and night. We're investing $7.7 million to continue the NewAccess for Small Business Owners mental health program, supporting small business operators with free, specialised help. In 2023, 520 small business operators in New South Wales benefited from this program. It's things like this that are just so vitally important across the nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        We're also making historic investments to ensure the wellbeing and connectivity of our communities, and this goes to the heart of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        . Our $2.4 billion investment in the NBN has significantly improved internet speeds. In Paterson, we're going to be able to offer better speeds for over 35,000 businesses and households, and they'll have the ability to have access to full fibre. That's a game changer for business, as is this budget for our nation. I couldn't be prouder.

        <p>
         Budgets are about the here and now. They're about addressing urgent priorities. Those urgent priorities are extremely clear—putting downward pressure on inflation and providing support to those who urgently need it. On inflation, I am significantly concerned that the budget did not deliver this. But budgets are also about the long-term future, about setting up the country over time and ensuring we are good ancestors for future generations.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is on the longer term I would like to focus today. What is that future vision of Australia? Australia is a wonderful country. We have a diverse and largely cohesive society, we are prosperous and we offer opportunities to many. We have, on the whole, good public services and we are blessed with wonderful natural resources. We have largely managed to balance competing interests, walking our own path between the breathtaking dynamism, but punishing inequality of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         , and the strong public services but, at times, sclerotic environments of Europe.
        </p>
        <p>
         When I think of that vision for the future of Australia, I think about building on those strong foundations with six key principles. Firstly, we want Australia to be the best place in the world to start and grow a business. Secondly, we want to be a place where all people and generations who work hard and make a contribution can build a comfortable life. Thirdly, we want to be a place where there's help at hand when you fall on hard times. Fourthly, we want to be a place which protects our natural environment whilst benefiting responsibly from its abundance. Fifthly, we want to be a place where everyone is valued and welcomed, and where our differences and diversity enrich our society. Finally, we want to be a secure country which can chart our own course free of coercion. We're not very far away from those aspirations, but I recognise that these are very difficult times approaching us and this is a constantly dynamic environment. I believe we do need to take different actions to ensure that we continue to deliver on this vision of Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let me outline some of the areas where I think we should be focused. Firstly, we should be focusing on housing and intergenerational inequity. Crippling housing costs are Australia's economic cancer. They infect opportunities for our children, they prevent essential workers from living near where they work and they are devastating the lives of those who deserve better. I had a call recently with a senior teacher in my electorate—a deputy principal, no less—and she broke down in tears because of the cost of housing and how difficult she was finding it to make ends meet. It shouldn't be this way. Though many levers sit with the states, the Commonwealth must and can do more on housing, including providing stronger incentives for states to change planning laws and protect renters, reviewing our tax system in relation to housing in terms of both stamp duty and CGT, and supporting social housing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Secondly, if we want to fund the public services we all desire, we need to make it easier to start and grow a business here in Australia. That means cutting red tape, ensuring that public procurement supports innovative Australian companies, simplifying the industrial relations system and restoring competitiveness to our tax system. Thirdly, there needs to be more focus on public sector productivity. That means measuring what actually works, properly assessing the costs and benefits of big infrastructure projects and adopting a more customer-centric approach to government services. Fourth is transitioning to net zero at the lowest cost and as fast as possible, which means putting people and households at the centre and properly funding environmental protection. Fifth is investing for inclusiveness by sharing the caring, empowering women and ensuring that those who want to have a job have the resources and support to succeed at the interview. Finally, we need to be realistic about the strategic and defence environment we face.
        </p>
        <p>
         Where does this differ between the government and the opposition? With both, I support elements of their agendas, but I see both as significantly wanting. The government, I believe, must do more on business productivity and accountability. I support steps forward on the F
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IR" rel="nofollow">
          IR
         </a>
         B and the removal of nuisance tariffs, for example, but I don't see the drive to support businesses, and their IR agenda has made it harder. On public sector productivity, there's not enough rigour on public spending and analysis, particularly for infrastructure, and it is absolutely critical that we get this right. The government's moving on housing, but not fast enough.
        </p>
        <p>
         The coalition 's agenda is less clear at the moment, and, while I agree with them on things like industrial relations and reducing red tape, their responses to net zero transition, intergenerational inequity and supporting inclusiveness do not address the significant challenges we face. There is a different way to pursue a positive future, and we must do better.

         </small>
         <p>
          I thank the member for Paterson for moving this motion on the first sitting Monday we've had since the Treasurer handed down the Albanese Labor government's third budget—one that delivers for millions of Australians and delivers for my electorate of Spence. It was a budget that was calibrated to ease cost-of-living pressures faced by Australians in a measured and responsible way while not unduly adding to inflationary pressures at the same time.
         </p>
         <p>
          Whilst we're in the process of transferring from those opposite the intellectual property rights to the use of 'responsible economic managers' and the rights to the resale of the 'back in black' coffee mugs, we are ready to deliver the first back-to-back consecutive budget surpluses in just shy of 20 years, which is no mean feat—unless you happen to occupy the benches on the other side of the chamber, where you can get away with simultaneously making the claims that we are not doing enough in cost-of-living relief and that the cost-of-living relief measures are going to cause inflation to skyrocket. These are the very same people who praised the previous government's spending during the pandemic yet feel as if they are absolved of the sins of both the rising inflation and the rising interest rates that followed them.
         </p>
         <p>
          This is a budget that delivers a tax cut for every single Australian taxpayer—all 13.6 million taxpayers. This contrasts with the plan of those opposite, who preferred to keep the bulk of their tax relief to just a select few near the top, excluding taxpayers near the bottom from any benefit from their tax plan entirely. Many of those forgotten by those opposite live in my electorate of Spence. In fact, 74,000 taxpayers in Spence will be receiving a tax cut. On average, this equates to a tax cut of over $1,217. Because they elected an Albanese Labor government, 91 per cent of taxpayers in Spence will be better off than if the coalition's tax plan had been allowed to remain in effect. If that were the case, each taxpayer in Spence would have been, on average, almost $500 worse off.
         </p>
         <p>
          This is coupled with the $3.5 billion our government has put toward much-needed energy bill relief. Over 10 million households and one million small businesses across Australia will receive a rebate of $300 and $325 respectively.
         </p>
         <p>
          This budget also looks to strengthen Medicare, making a trip to the doctor and a trip to the chemist cheaper. At the same time, this budget is making sure that pathology services for many common tests remain bulk-billed. Pathology services that were accessed in Spence just shy of 175,000 times last year will remain bulk-billed under this budget and under an Albanese Labor government. This is also the case for four
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRI" rel="nofollow">
           MRI
          </a>
          machines in Spence that will now have Medicare coverage, meaning that your ability to afford an MRI test shouldn't impact your ability to have one—the way it should be, where your Medicare card matters more than your credit card.
         </p>
         <p>
          Our government is expanding Medicare urgent care clinics to an additional 29 locations across the country. Not only does this mean that Australians are more likely to see a doctor when they need to, but this will help draw pressure from emergency rooms across the country. Australians will walk into the Medicare urgent care clinic and walk out after being bulk-billed. In my electorate of Spence, since the opening of the Elizabeth Medicare Urgent Care Clinic, they've seen 4,685 visits through their doors, and that number continues to climb with each passing week. One visit was in fact mine. When I needed to see a doctor after falling ill, I was able to walk in and see a doctor after a relatively short wait and get the care I needed.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Albanese Labor government's third budget doesn't just ease cost-of-living pressures for millions of Australians but also sets them up for well-paying jobs in the future. Nine out of 10 new jobs over the next decade will require post-school qualifications, with 50 per cent of those requiring at least a bachelor's degree and 44 per cent requiring
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VET" rel="nofollow">
           VET
          </a>
          qualifications. Apprentices will be eligible for $5,000 to assist with supporting them to finish their training, a policy that will help nearly 2,000 apprentices in the northern suburbs of Spence. There are many policies our government has introduced in this budget in response to the Australian Universities Accord final report—policies like fee-free uni-ready courses to enable a pathway for tens of thousands of Australians to help them take that next step toward higher education all the way to our changes to the way
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HELP" rel="nofollow">
           HELP
          </a>
          debt indexation is calculated. We have wiped $3 billion in student debt instantly, assisting 19,000 people in Spence with a HELP debt.
         </p>
         <p>
          As you can see, this is a budget that we can all be proud of—a Labor budget that delivers for all Australians.

          <p>
           I listened closely to the member for Wentworth talking about small business in her contribution. I note that just now the Fair Work Commission has awarded a 3.75 per cent pay rise to 2.6 million minimum wage and award-reliant workers. The cost of business is getting harder for those small business operators, for those employers, right across the country. In its annual wage decision, the full bench of the commission, headed by Adam Hatcher, the president, said that the increase factored in cost-of-living pressures felt by households.
          </p>

           We know, right across this parliament and right across this nation, that there is a cost-of-living crisis. We know that Labor became aware of the cost-of-living crisis and started talking about it, moreover, on Monday 16 October last year. That was the first sitting day after the Voice—after the referendum which divided the nation. You didn't hear about a cost-of-living crisis whilst the Voice referendum was being debated across this country. Labor didn't want to know about it, and, if they did know about it, they weren't talking about it. But, all of a sudden, when the Voice was lost, Labor started to pretend it cared. We know Labor does not care about the cost-of-living pressures on households and on small businesses. All Labor cares about is getting re-elected. All Labor cares about is payback to their union puppet masters. That's the Labor way.
          </p>

           I respect the member for Paterson. I do. We do some great work together as co-chairs of the Parliamentary Friends of Soil. Those members who aren't in it should be.
          </p>
          <p>
           A government member: Tell us more!
          </p>
          <p>
           In another contribution I certainly will tell you more! But I will say that people across this wide brown land are now poorer thanks to Labor and now feel less safe thanks to Labor; that is certainly the case. The cost of health has risen by nine per cent. The cost of food—every time you go to the supermarket, it's costing you 10 per cent more; you're getting less in the grocery trolley than you were previously when there was a coalition government. The cost of education is up 11 per cent. The cost of housing is up 12 per cent, and we've got construction companies across the nation going bankrupt, going out of business, just shutting up shop. It's hard to get a tradie. It's hard to get the supplies to build a house, yet Labor continues with getting more migrants in—and I'm not against that, but we need to do it in moderation. We need to do it sensibly. We need to do it such that there isn't the pressure on urban housing demand, because heaven knows they're not coming to the regions where, in many cases, most cases or all cases, they would be welcome and there are jobs for them—and, indeed, cheaper rent and cheaper housing. The cost of public transport is up 13 per cent. The cost of electricity has seen an 18 per cent increase since the coalition lost office. The cost of gas is up 25 per cent—we know those opposite don't like gas anyway—and the cost of insurance is up 26 per cent. That is hurting each and every individual, each and every small business, right across the nation.
          </p>
          <p>
           And what do we get in the budget? We get a public servant led recovery—36,000 more public servants. I'm not against public servants; they do a great job. I've been a minister in many portfolios and I've seen the great work they do. But when these decisions cost $24.4 billion over the four-year forward estimates to increase the amount of public servants, to increase the amount of bureaucracy, it hurts. It hurts taxpayers right across the nation. It hurts people who are already being told to pull their belts in, to make sure they rein in their expenses, yet they see in this great capital city of ours—and it is a great capital city—the beautiful roads and the increasing number of public servants, and they wonder why they are having to foot the bill. They're footing the bill because Labor is in power. They're footing the bill because Labor doesn't know how to govern properly for all Australians, and that is a terrific shame.

           <p>
            Addressing the cost of living is the federal Labor government's No. 1 priority. The 2024-25 federal budget demonstrates this. Our budget is about helping to ease the cost of living for every Australian no matter where they live, no matter who they are, no matter how much they earn. We understand that many Australians are under pressure up and down the income scale, and that is why the most recent budget is delivering cost-of-living measures that will make a real difference to every Australian.
           </p>
           <p>
            A signature component of our budget is Labor's tax cuts. Every Australian taxpayer will receive a tax cut from 1 July, including the 66,000 taxpayers in the electorate of Robertson who will receive this tax cut. On average this represents $1,580 per year, which will significantly help Australians on the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
             Central Coast
            </a>
            with the cost of living. In addition the Treasurer also announced energy bill rebates for every household and eligible small businesses. The government understands energy costs can be considerable on households and small businesses. That is why, come 1 July, every household will receive a $300 energy rebate and eligible small businesses will receive a $325 energy rebate. On the Central Coast this relief will assist the 12,810 small businesses within the electorate of Robertson. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy and play a tremendous role in employing hundreds of thousands of Australians across the country, and the Central Coast is no exception to this. We have a thriving small-business community, and I am pleased that our government is helping eligible small businesses with their overheads.
           </p>
           <p>
            For several months, constituents in my electorate have been corresponding with my office about the unfair rate of indexation in relation to
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HECS" rel="nofollow">
             HECS
            </a>
            debts. In 2023 the rate of indexation rose with inflation and saw HECS debts increase markedly. This issue continues to be a considerable concern in my community. I welcome the news that our government will change the way indexation is applied to HECS debts and will backdate this change to 1 June 2023, wiping $3 billion in HECS debts for hundreds of thousands of Australians across the country. This measure will make HECS fairer and ensure the large indexation increases that were recorded last year do not occur again. Across my community, that's just over 15,000 people who will see their HECS debts slashed, and there is a similar number in Dobell. So, in the Central Coast region, we're talking upwards of 30,000 people who will benefit from Labor's HECS changes.
           </p>
           <p>
            On the topic of education, and speaking as a health professional, I'm very excited about the government's announcement in the budget that will create the Commonwealth prac payment for teaching, nursing, midwifery and social work students. This essentially means that students undertaking a degree in nursing, for example, will be paid to complete their mandatory prac placements, helping with living costs during quite a challenging period of their studies. This support will help assist more students complete their degrees, which will ensure that there are more workers in critical care sectors like health care, education and the care economy—sectors that are experiencing skills shortages and require more workers.
           </p>
           <p>
            A component of the budget that has not received as much reporting recently is our government's commitment to delivering a better future for our defence personnel, our veterans, and their families. After a decade of neglect by those in the Liberal and National parties, it has taken a Labor government to address the inadequate funding of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Veterans'_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
             Department of Veterans' Affairs
            </a>
            . I'm pleased that we will invest an additional $477 million to increase our support to the more than 340,000 veterans and dependants accessing services through
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVA" rel="nofollow">
             DVA
            </a>
            across Australia. Following our successful employment of an additional 500 frontline staff at DVA to eliminate veterans' compensation backlogs, we will employ an extra 141 staff to ensure backlogs like those that accumulated under the coalition do not re-emerge and make claims processes faster. This is historic. It's an investment that increases funding for veterans' services to its highest level in over three decades. This support will also directly assist the 3,480 veterans and their families living in my electorate of Robertson.
           </p>
           <p>
            We are a government that is working every day to help every Australian reach their full potential, and we are a government that is delivering a better future.

            <p>
             I rise today to speak about the disastrous Albanese Labor government's budget. This is bad for Australians, it's bad for rural and regional Australians and it's particularly bad for my people in my electorate of Dawson. Just before the budget came out, there was an announcement that it was going to be a budget for the Bruce. For those who don't know, the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Highway" rel="nofollow">
              Bruce Highway
             </a>
             basically connects Brisbane to Cairns and Queensland. It's how all the farmers up north get their produce down to market. It's how people get their supplies up from the city. And it's how families get around and keep themselves safe. It's also how the tourists and the grey nomads travel up and down the coast, particularly in the wintertime. Right in the middle of it is Dawson, my electorate. From Mackay up to Townsville, right in the middle section of the Bruce Highway, is where my people live. There have been two reports put out recently. One of them had to be required under freedom of information, and it gives star ratings, which go up to a five-star rating. That particular section of the Bruce Highway in my electorate of Dawson only gets to a two. It needs a lot of work. There is another report which shows it's one of the most dangerous sections of all of the Bruce Highway. So where would you think the money would go? Where would you prioritise? How much did the electorate of Dawson get for my section of the Bruce Highway—for my people's section of the Bruce Highway? A doughnut: absolutely nothing! It's unbelievable!
            </p>
            <p>
             Let's explore where the money did go. The money went to a bloated bureaucracy, to increase more bureaucrats in Canberra—36,000 more bureaucrats in Canberra at a cost of over $24 billion over the forwards. I have a little bit for those opposite about how the real world works if you have a project—say that you want to fill a pothole. In my electorate of Dawson, there's no shortage of potholes that need filling on the Bruce Highway. You have the boss, the middle management, the foreman and then the labourer who actually fills the pothole. But after a couple of days with the pothole not getting filled, what's Labor's answer? 'We need more bureaucracy; we need to add another layer to the four lines. Then we have the boss, senior management, middle management, the foreman and then the labourer. What happens? Everything just goes round and round and round in circles, and nothing actually happens. It all gets chewed up in the internal bureaucracy.

               But what do they do? What would the Nationals do? What do they do in private enterprise? This would be good for the member for Bruce to hear: they actually cut one of the layers out so that then the boss tells the foreman to tell the labourer, 'Mate, you need to fill that pothole.' That's how you get things done. You don't get things done by sending internal emails going round and round and round in circles.
              </p>
              <p>
               Don't worry, I understand what you do—I understand what those opposite do. They flatten everyone's tyres—they flatten every Australian's tyres and then they say, 'We'll give you a little bit of air for it and you'll be grateful.' That's exactly what they've done with electricity prices. Say that your tyre is 35 psi. Let the tyres down one day and then turn up the next day with a little compression and say: 'Oh, five or 10 psi. That'll be enough to get them by.' That's exactly what they've done with electricity prices. For most of the people in my area, electricity has gone up by over $1,000 a year—$1,000 a year!—and what have they done? Given them $300 and expected them to be grateful. How fantastic is that? Absolutely amazing!

                   Thank you very much, Deputy Speaker Andrews, and it's great to see you in the chair! I rise proudly to speak on this motion because this is a responsible, restrained budget which eases cost-of-living pressures and invests in a future made in Australia. This is a budget that the opposition failed to deliver in their nine years of government. After all the bluster, billowing and flat tyres from over there, after nine years in government, they couldn't fill a pothole. But they could fill it with the press releases that they were going to do something, but never actually did.

                     Have a drink out of your 'back in black' mug! Remember that: 'back in black'? This was their budget, with the 'back in black mugs' and the slick videos with Scottie and Josh parading smugly down the corridors. But what did they deliver? The highest-ever deficits, highest-ever debt and nothing to pay for it.

                    <p>
                     This is a government that's actually delivering back-to-back surpluses. Remember the famous calls of the former Liberal government, 'We will deliver a budget surplus in our first year and each and every year.'

                       None from nine! Fair dinkum, they left the statisticians having a cup of tea because they didn't deliver a thing except for debt and deficit. And they still try to claim they're the great economic managers. This budget will provide essential cost-of-living relief: more homes for Australians, reforms to universities, a strengthened Medicare and the care economy, and broader opportunities for our society. That's how we're delivering cost-of-living relief. Our government has a plan. We're enacting positive policies that help every Australian. What do those opposite have? Nothing except rubbish about nuclear reactors and cutting the Public Service. When they talk about the Public Service they should think about our veterans. They love to wrap their flags around themselves and say they love veterans, but they want to slash support for veterans, keeping them in pain longer while they wait to have their claims heard.

                      <p>
                       The only word that consistently comes from those opposite is 'no'. They've already said no to cheaper medicines, no to energy bill relief and no to cost-of-living tax cuts. They like to talk about Australians doing it tough, but they're shedding crocodile tears. How can they sit there and do that when they present no viable alternatives. Senator Hume let the cat out of the bag: 'We're the Liberal Party; we don't have policies.'

                      <p>
                       The continued disingenuity of the coalition is ridiculous. They've backflipped on things like the new vehicle efficiency standard to try to make political points. Let's remember the energy price hikes when they were in power. They went to the election with the good old member for Hume,
                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus_Taylor" rel="nofollow">
                        Angus Taylor
                       </a>
                       , signing off on a 20 per cent increase in power prices but changing the law so that no-one knew about it till after the election. That was their great policy. Of their 23 energy policies, they delivered none. They have the audacity to complain about energy prices when they in fact deliberately—willingly and knowingly—hid these price rises from the Australian public. As Angus Taylor would say to himself: 'Fantastic! Good job! Well done, Angus!' But the Australian people are suffering because of that terrible, deliberately deceitful action.

                      <p>
                       Their continued negativity is no substitute for economic and policy credibility. We're getting on with the job of rolling out billions of dollars in cost-of-living relief that will take the edge off some of the pressures. The member for Petrie sits in here each and every day and cries because he's not getting a $10,000 tax cut. He's upset because he's getting a tax cut on his $250,000, but he doesn't want anyone who's on under $60,000 getting a tax cut. That's the mindset those over there have. You've got to wonder what goes through their heads when they sit down and think about these policies. No wonder the good ones are leaving! From 1 July, 76,000 taxpayers in the electorate of

                       </a>
                       , every single one of them, will receive a tax cut: $1,583, on average, a year. There will be cost-of-living relief for 13.6 million Australians. Under the coalition, only the top end would have received a tax cut this year.
                      </p>
                      <p>
                       We are providing energy relief, and we're doing that directly to make sure that we do not put pressure on inflation. This is relief that those opposite previously voted against—the electricity prices, as I said. We understand family budgets are tight and the impacts are being felt around the kitchen table. That's why we're doing the things we're doing. There will be $6.5 billion going to veterans over the next five years. The government is fixing up claims processing through increased staffing levels, resulting in our veterans having their claims heard and paid out a lot quicker. You would have thought the member for Riverina, who has in his electorate Kapooka, our biggest Army base, would have supported that, but he comes in here and says that, no, he doesn't support it. It's absolutely amazing! The legacy of the Morrison government is so many people left behind. We won't do that.
