        It gives me great pleasure to congratulate the Camden Chamber of Commerce and Industry on supporting Light Up Camden as well as the event organisers and Camden residents for a wonderful Christmas celebration. Light Up Camden marks the beginning of the festive season in Camden and has become a major annual event on the community calendar. It is an event that sparks a lively atmosphere and sense of camaraderie across Camden and surrounding suburbs, fostering a stronger, happier and active communityâ€”something I am very proud of and honoured to be a part of.
       </p>
       <p>
        Once again the festival drew large crowds this year, and these crowds were treated to a wide variety of activities and attractions. These included a visit from Santa, exciting rides, lively Zumba demonstrations, great food stalls, a sideshow alley and a fireworks display. Residents were also lucky enough to be entertained by a wide range of community acts and school performances, which showcased the talented people and energetic community spirit we have in the Macarthur region.
       </p>
       <p>
        Entertainment included performances by Ali's Angels, Dynamic Rhythms Music Centre, Utopia Music school, Macarthur School of

        and Isabel Estephan. Numerous local primary and high schools also provided entertainment, which included

       </p>
       <p>
        Towards the end of the evening, there was an electric atmosphere as the community gathered around the town centre to count down to the lighting of the town Christmas tree and view the spectacular firework display. It was a perfect conclusion to the wonderful event. Not only were local residents given the chance to celebrate together as a community but it also provided a wonderful opportunity for local businesses to display their products and services to the fast-growing Macarthur area.

        I would also like to recognise that outstanding events like Light Up Camden do not happen by themselves or

        overnight. Planning of the festival begins in January each year and would not be possible without the hundreds of hours the Light Up Camden committee volunteers put in each year. I congratulate this year's committee including: chairperson, Kerry Shepard; vice chairperson, David Lewry; Miriam Roberts; Jeramie Winsor; Deb Vardy; Nada Mihajlovic; Susan Hadfield; Eliaine Arriguettia and Christine Millman.

        I would also like to recognise the following businesses for their generous support in partnering and sponsoring this community event. Thank you to Camden chamber of commerce,

        The support from these committee volunteers and local businesses, as well as various other church groups, schools, charities and service clubs, contribute to making Light Up Camden the success it is. It is events such as these that help pull together local residents from all walks of life and build a strong sense of community, and this makes me proud to represent the people of Macarthur.
