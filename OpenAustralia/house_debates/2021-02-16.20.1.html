        Fifty kilometres to the north-west of Shepparton is a little town called Tongala. With a population of around 2,000 people, it is a small town but it has always punched well above its weight. Given recent planning developments, the town's manufacturing and agriculture sectors appear to be in for a very bright future.
       </p>

        In recent weeks it has emerged that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        company Manning Valley Fresh is in negotiations with Nestle to purchase its Tongala factory with a view to manufacturing baby formula in the future. Manning Valley Fresh's Steven Elvidge hopes to finalise the purchase soon and hopes the investment will see an increase in employee numbers.
       </p>
       <p>
        There has also been a recent expansion of Sunrice's Coprice business. Coprice operates a stock feed manufacturing facility at Tongala, and a recent acquisition by a parent company will result in production being ramped up at that site as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just last week I had the opportunity to visit
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HW" rel="nofollow">
         HW
        </a>
        Greenham &amp; Sons to learn more about their $55 million expansion plan. Greenham's been operating a meat-processing plant at Tongala since 1993 and now plans to significantly modernise that site. The upgrade would secure an additional 200 jobs, and that will put them in a very good place for the next 20 or 30 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        I look forward to working with all three companies, and I'm confident that Tongala will play a huge role in helping the federal government reach its aim of agriculture being a $100 billion industry by 2030.
