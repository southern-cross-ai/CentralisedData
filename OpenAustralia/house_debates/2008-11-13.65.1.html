         I thank the member for

         for his question. The Australian government is very deeply concerned about the recent outbreak of violence and fighting in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic" rel="nofollow">
          Democratic Republic
         </a>
         of the Congo. Regrettably, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo" rel="nofollow">
          Democratic Republic of the Congo
         </a>
         is a country with a terrible recent history of conflict and suffering. Its people have suffered two civil wars between 1996 and 2003 and it is estimated that those wars have claimed over five million lives as a result of violence and consequent disease and starvation.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo" rel="nofollow">
          The Democratic Republic of the Congo
         </a>
         in conjunction with the international community, including the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations
         </a>
         , has made considerable efforts in recent times to restore stability and rebuild national unity. Since 2000 a United Nations peacekeeping organisation has been present in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and over the years Australia has given substantial and strong support to that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         peacekeeping organisation, contributing over $30 million.
        </p>
        <p>
         Very regrettably, as members would be aware, we have recently seen conflict break out again. In October the forces of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Nkunda" rel="nofollow">
          General Nkunda
         </a>
         moved through
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Kivu" rel="nofollow">
          North Kivu
         </a>
         province in the east, defying not just government forces but also those UN peacekeepers. There have been alarming reports of targeted violence against civilians, including lootings and killings and the use of rape as an instrument of war. There have been intense international community efforts to seek to resolve the crisis. I refer to the efforts of Foreign Secretary Miliband and French Foreign Minister Kouchner, who flew to the region to meet with President Kagame of Rwanda and President Kabila of the Republic. In early November the UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon held in Nairobi an emergency meeting of African heads of states. The secretary-general has called for an immediate ceasefire, the establishment of aid corridors to allow urgent delivery of humanitarian assistance, reinforcement of the UN peacekeeping mission and implementation of peace agreements previously signed. The government very much welcomes the recent announcement by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SADC" rel="nofollow">
          SADC
         </a>
         —the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_African_Development_Community" rel="nofollow">
          Southern African Development Community
         </a>
         —to provide not just support of those sentiments expressed by the secretary-general but also immediate military and humanitarian aid. Australia stands alongside the secretary-general in his efforts to see a resolution to this crisis.
        </p>
        <p>
         Whilst it is appropriate for Australia to make a contribution to peacekeeping through its contribution to the United Nations, it is not, in the government’s view, appropriate to make a military or a peacekeeping contribution in terms of boots on the ground. But it is important for Australia to consider the need for urgent humanitarian aid and assistance. Early in November, in response to the crisis, I announced that we would apply $1 million emergency humanitarian assistance, enabling us to give consideration to further humanitarian assistance on the basis of the United Nations assessment. I am able to advise the House today that Australia will make, all up, a contribution of $5 million for humanitarian assistance in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It comprises the $4 million that I am announcing today, $3 million of which will go to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to deal with nearly 250,000 displaced people, to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNICEF" rel="nofollow">
          UNICEF
         </a>
         and to the UN Office of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. One million dollars will go to Australian
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGO" rel="nofollow">
          NGO
         </a>
         s who have a presence in Africa. Of the $1 million previously announced, as I have indicated before, half a million dollars will go to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
          World Health Organisation
         </a>
         and half a million dollars will go to UNICEF. The funding of these agencies will allow for the immediate needs for those adversely affected by the violence—in particular food, health, water and the protection of women.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australia’s desire to assist is not just a reflection of our desire to be a good international citizen but also a reflection of the government’s view that Australia needs to increase and enhance its commitment to the countries of Africa and to engage with the countries of Africa. Australia needs to forge broader and deeper relations with the countries of Africa and build on the people-to-people and commercial links which have burgeoned in recent years. We welcome the increasingly strong voice of African nation states and we look forward to playing our part in the peace and security of the continent of Africa, including—and in particular—the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
