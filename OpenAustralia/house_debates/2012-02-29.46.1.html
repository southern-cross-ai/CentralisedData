         There are people over there laughing, but let me tell you a true story. This is a letter from a 13-year old girl:
        </p>
        <p>
         My name is Emma Norton. I was born with a disability—

         </a>

        </p>
        <p>
         You might laugh about it but you should be quiet—
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I speak for all people with a disability. I believe we are people who have feelings and dreams. We all have the right to help and support in Australia. Thanks for listening to me.
        </p>
        <p>
         The minister was able to meet with all local people with disabilities—

         <a class="glossary" href="/glossary/?gl=1" title="An interjection is when a member of parliament says something that can be...">

        </p>
        <p>
         Laughing about it just shows how terrible you lot really are. The minister was able to meet with many people with disabilities, their families and carers, and local service providers and advocacy groups to discuss the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
          NDIS
         </a>
         and the process so far. The Leader of the Opposition says that the NDIS is an aspiration and puts it on the never-never timetable. This Labor government is getting on with the job of building an NDIS and it is time the Leader of the Opposition—
        </p>
        <p>
         Opposition members
         <a class="glossary" href="/glossary/?gl=1" title="An interjection is when a member of parliament says something that can be...">

        </p>
        <p>
         and those heckling over there while we talk about disabilities got on board with the Gillard government. We are genuinely committed to an NDIS. The Leader of the Oppositions needs to decide whether he is going to support it or whether he is just going to sit there and say no.
