        SHORTEN (â€”) (): In Australia we're witnessing communities enduring catastrophic flooding far too often. Just weeks ago my own electorate of Maribyrnong, which I've represented for 14 years, and the neighbouring electorate of Fraser were one of these communities. I visited flood affected areas of Maribyrnong and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonee_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Moonee Valley
        </a>
        on the day the river peaked and was shocked by what I saw. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maribyrnong_River" rel="nofollow">
         Maribyrnong River
        </a>
        , usually the heartbeat of our community, a place for people to gather for picnics and plays and park runs, had threatened homes, lives and livelihoods. Many flood affected residents I spoke to on that day and the next day were overwhelmed by the losses that they could not even begin to calculate, yet they still managed to think of others. People put everything aside to help neighbours.
       </p>
       <p>
        I heard stories of elderly residents being unsure and reluctant to abandon their homes because of the rapidly rising river, the homes where they'd raised their families and which hold their memories. It was these older community members whom neighbours rallied around and rescued. Older Australians who may not have know there was government support were collected by neighbours and driven to the emergency centre where a Services Australia team had been swiftly deployed to help flood victims.
       </p>
       <p>
        Then there was Darren Syrmington and his family who, with nowhere to live, were victims of a callous act of looting in the subsequent days. Their accounts were drained and credit cards maxed out. Everything that could go wrong unfortunately did go wrong. Darren reached out to my office for help, and we helped. He rang my office just today to say he was appreciative of the good work of my staff at a time when his brain was mush. We were able to at least alleviate some of the stress. And I want to give a shoutout to remarkable Moonee Ponds West Primary School teacher
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kim_Simmons" rel="nofollow">
         Kim Simmons
        </a>
        for bringing Darren's story to my attention so we could have the opportunity to help.
       </p>
       <p>
        The list of people I wish to acknowledge is far too long for the brief time allocated today, but I want to mention the Victorian State Emergency Service, who did at least 60 rescues; Maribyrnong City Council, led by their mayor, Anthony Tran, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        , Celia Haddock; Moonee Valley City Council and their CEO, Helen Sui, and Councillor Rose Iser, in particular; Victorian government staff; the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Police" rel="nofollow">

        ; and; of course; all the volunteers. I also want to acknowledge the council workers, the unsung heroes, who've been doing the work on that day and ever since. I acknowledge the federal member for Fraser, Daniel Mulino, who's been remarkably diligent; state members

        , Ben Carroll and Danny Pearson; and, because floodwaters don't respect electoral boundaries, the wonderful people in my Maribyrnong office, who have fielded hundreds of calls and helped anyone who needed assistance regardless of their address. But my biggest thanks are reserved for the people of the Maribyrnong River corridor. I love our neighbourhood. I admire their spirit and resilience, and their willingness to put their own needs aside to help others. It has just been humbling.
