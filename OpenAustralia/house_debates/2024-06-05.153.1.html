        My electorate of Capricornia is mourning the passing of an Australian sporting icon, Ken 'Reggie' Tucker
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Born and bred in Rockhampton, Reggie was a true local. His father was a cyclist who inspired Reggie to take up the sport at a young age, and his family now celebrates four generations of cycling athletes. Reggie soon became a track cycling coach who coached hundreds of Rockhampton locals, including some of the region's finest athletes, for over 50 years. In 2021, Reggie finally hung up his stopwatch at the ripe old age of 85. His teaching has led to success in both Commonwealth and

        , as well as in various state- and national-level competitions.
       </p>

        Cycling has long been a very important part of the Rockhampton region. This status is in large part due to Reggie Tucker's persistence in crafting world-class cyclists. It was Reggie's three sons—Kenrick, Russell and Byron—who were responsible for his start in coaching. He has been quoted as saying that he had no official training as a coach but drew on his own experience as a cyclist and studied the opposition very, very closely. It proved to be a winning formula, with his three sons all going on to be Australian champions, as did Kenrick's daughters Brooke and Lara. So many of his proteges went on to enjoy success and achieve their goals, something that made him incredibly satisfied. Through his style of coaching, Reggie's son Kenrick participated in two
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games" rel="nofollow">
         Commonwealth Games
        </a>
        , coming home with consecutive gold medals for the men's 1,000-metre match sprint. Kenrick also participated in two Olympic Games: the 1980 Moscow games and the 1984
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles" rel="nofollow">

        games. Reggie's skilled coaching was also passed on to the next generation of cyclists. The famous Meares sisters, Kerrie and Anna, collectively went on to win consecutive gold medals at both Olympic and Commonwealth games. Both sisters remain icons not just in the Rockhampton region but for all aspiring cyclists.

        The Kenrick Tucker Velodrome, named after Reggie's son, is a key piece of cycling infrastructure in the region. For much of Rockhampton's cycling history, it has been the birthplace for the careers of many of our local and national champions. Reggie was instrumental in the establishment of the velodrome. Reggie Tucker's service to the region is truly commendable. He transformed regional cycling into a force to be reckoned with for urban areas. Armed with significantly less funding than his Brisbane counterparts, and against all odds, Reggie fought a

        battle and won.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sporting is a source of immense national pride. To represent a region that produces so many talented athletes is a true honour. I want to send my condolences to the Tucker family for their loss. Reggie Tucker was not only a great sporting legend and community leader but also a father and grandfather. I have no doubt that the Tucker family are proud of the mark that Reggie has made on the Rockhampton region, as well as on the lives of so many of us in the community.
