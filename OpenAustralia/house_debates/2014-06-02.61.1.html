        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development. Will the minister update the House on what new projects, not funded by the previous government, will be funded through the $50 billion infrastructure investment announced in the recent budget?

         I thank the member for Barton for his question. He will be watching with great interest and enthusiasm as he sees the benefits of the coalition government's $50 billion infrastructure expenditure rollout in his own electorate through projects like WestConnex, an $11 billion project and perhaps the biggest infrastructure project that our country has seen.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have noticed that members opposite are not so enthusiastic about this roads program. Some members opposite have claimed that we are not really providing much more money than Labor had intended to spend or, in the case of the member for Grayndler, there are only two extra projects that we are funding above what Labor had intended. The reality is that the member for Grayndler got that wrong as well. The reality is that we have a $16 billion commitment above what Labor had committed to roads and infrastructure prior to coming to office. The reality is that we are getting on with the job of a substantially boosted road infrastructure program that will make a real difference for Australia. So, on top of the two projects that the member for Grayndler was referring to, let me mention the East West Link, a $3 billion commitment in Melbourne; Adelaide's north-south corridor, an extra $394 million; the Perth freight link, $866 million; the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         roads project, $77 million; the Toowoomba range crossing; and the WestConnex project. Of course, he completely forgot the whole of the $2.9 billion commitment to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
          Western Sydney
         </a>
         —all forgotten—along with the Roads to Recovery program investment, which Labor is voting against in the House of Representatives, the national highway upgrade program for $229 million and $300 million for the new bridges program.
        </p>
        <p>
         When you look at what Labor actually promised to do, the reality is that there were often so many conditions attached that they knew it would not happen. Yes, they were prepared to fund the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_Motorway" rel="nofollow">
          Gateway Motorway
         </a>
         in Brisbane, but only if it was tolled; they would fund the WestConnex, but only if it was not tolled; they would fund
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Road" rel="nofollow">
          South Road
         </a>
         in Adelaide, but only one end; and they would never go near the Toowoomba range. What about the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Highway" rel="nofollow">
          Pacific Highway
         </a>
         ? Yes, they would do something there but only if
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         paid half, something they never asked when Labor was the state government in New South Wales. The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Highway" rel="nofollow">
          Bruce Highway
         </a>
         ? Again, only if Queensland paid half, and even then there are 27 projects that we are funding on the Bruce Highway that Labor would not go near. This government is getting on with the business of building the infrastructure of the 21st century; Labor only talks.
