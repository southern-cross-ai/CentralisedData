        My question is to the Minister for Health and Aged Care. I support consumer access to cheaper medicines. However, many of my Mayo pharmacists are genuinely worried that 60-day dispensing without adequate compensation will leave them to lay off staff, reduce services or close. I ask the minister: what modelling has been done on the impacts on regional pharmacies? Will the minister assure the House that no pharmacy will be forced to lay off staff or close as a result?

         I thank the member for Mayo for her question, and for her engagement in a number of discussions about the impact of this policy on community pharmacies in her electorate in the

         We went to the last election promising cheaper medicines, and we're very proud of the record of delivery we already have on making that happen in 12 short months. But we recognise there is more to do, which is why, unashamedly, we accepted the advice of the

          Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee

         in the budget to move to a 60-day dispensing limit for certain common medicines that are used for chronic disease. This is a common practice around the world and recognises the changing nature of patient profiles. Thirty-day dispensing makes eminent sense in a patient profile which sees people get single bouts of an infectious disease, a single dispensing of a prescription and then they're better. It doesn't make as much sense when people are on the same medicines for years or even decades.
        </p>
        <p>
         Most obviously, this is going to be good for the hip pockets of patients—six million patients across the country. It's also going to be very good for their health, because we know from evidence overseas that in other countries which have adopted this, the most likely time people go off their medicines is at script renewal time. In those jurisdictions that have adopted 60- or even 90-day dispensing—

               consults, there's also the improved convenience for people who live in rural communities. I live within about 100 metres of a pharmacy, but people who live in rural Australia have to travel vast distances to reach their pharmacy. That's why this measure has been supported by the College of Rural and Remote Medicine, the Rural Doctors Association and the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Rural_Health_Alliance" rel="nofollow">
                National Rural Health Alliance

               .
              </p>
              <p>
               To the last part of the member's question: of course we are committed to the viability of the community pharmacy sector, which is why we have committed to fully reinvest all of the savings that we make here. The most substantial focus of us in designing that reinvestment package is the impact, particularly, on small rural pharmacies. We've had a couple of good discussions on this, the member for Mayo and I. We are doubling the rural maintenance allowance, which is, essentially, a payment that rural pharmacies receive simply to stay open. That will have differential impacts, depending on which part of rural Australia they live in—like the member for Maranoa, for example. There are areas where pharmacies will receive an increase from $40,000 in their allowance to $90,000—a 120 per cent increase in the payments they receive simply to remain open. We're still consulting about the final design of the package and I look forward to further discussions.
