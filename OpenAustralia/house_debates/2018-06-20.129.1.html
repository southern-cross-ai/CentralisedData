        Mr Speaker, in 1891

        </a>
        , spoke of Australia becoming one people with one destiny. Parkes, who is now known as the father of federation, was speaking about the movement in the 1880s and 1890s to federate the colonies, an event that finally brought about the

        </a>
        in 1901. Australia is founded on the idea that we are one people with one destiny. It was the catchphrase of the federation movement of the era. It was the toast of the great gatherings in aid of that cause.
       </p>
       <p>
        Becoming and remaining one people with one destiny is an ongoing endeavour. In an era of identity politics, it is important that we recall that we are one people with one destiny. It was for this reason that I chose

        last evening. As I surveyed the policy challenges of the past three decades, it struck me how much the task of nation building is a work in progress. Hence the final chapter, 'The task ahead for the lucky country '.The challenges of population, participation and productivity—identified, as you will recall, in the first
        <i>
         Intergenerational r
        </i>
        <i>
         eport
        </i>
        remain today. The challenges of an ageing population, declining productivity and inadequate participation in the economic activity of the nation remain significant for many people. The issue of population, including the inadequacy of infrastructure, the price of housing and the amenity of our suburbs is a major concern for many people. The ageing of the population and profound changes to employment because of new technologies require greater attention, and raising our low productivity is one of the most important yet least appreciated issues facing Australia today.
       </p>
       <p>
        But there are also other challenges that Australia faces. In the style of the intergenerational reports, these concerns can be described as society, security and sustainability. We have been fortunate in Australia to have inherited a civilisation with cultural values that have fostered human dignity and liberty, supported democracy and the rule of law, enhanced social cohesion and sustained economic progress. Social cohesion is the bond that unites families, communities and the nation. It falls to every generation to transmit to the next, whether born here or overseas, the cultural values that underpin Western civilisation. No culture is perfect, but the West has accorded greater freedoms, more justice and enhanced prosperity for more individuals than any other civilisation known to history. We should celebrate our civilisation. In particular, the foundations and the story of Western civilisation should be taught in our schools and, dare I say it, in our universities. And where elements of it are under attack—whether our freedoms or our democratic system—they need to be defended and strengthened.
       </p>
       <p>
        The primary role of the Commonwealth government is the security of the nation. We live in increasingly uncertain times. The rise of China, the aggression of Russia, the continuing menace of Islamic terrorism, and even the threats that are not yet dimmed from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea" rel="nofollow">
         North Korea
        </a>
        and the risk of a failed state in our region, all pose challenges to Australia's national interests, including our international trade and prosperity. Most importantly, we must intensify our efforts to cooperate with our allies and regional partners and hasten the interoperability that flows from these arrangements.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thirdly, a sustainable economic future depends on the continued availability and use of our vast energy resources. Australia cannot afford to neglect this economic advantage and condemn future generations to higher costs, unreliable energy supplies and a lower standard of living. Energy sustainability requires ongoing investment in the use of our plentiful resources, such as coal and gas. Renewables will not replace traditional fuels. Future policies should reflect this reality, minimise subsidies, work for the mutual benefit of landowners and producers, and provide long-term security for the necessary investments, including the continued development of clean coal technology, gas exploration and production, and the storage of renewable energy.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are many specific policies required to meet our future challenges, but these six areas—population, participation, productivity, society, security and sustainability—are the foundations of national prosperity and cohesion.
