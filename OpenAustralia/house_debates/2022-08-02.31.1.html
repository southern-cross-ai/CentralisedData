        We can and must do more to support our kids by increasing early intervention services on the ground in communities where young people need them and then ensuring we are focusing on implementing evidence-based platforms of care in our communities. Like many of the challenges currently facing us in Australia, having spoken to a number of people across our country, I'm confident that it is not the case that we don't know what we should be doing. Rather, up until this point in time, we've lacked the political nuance to drive solutions here.

        Ultimately, to all the students out there, I say to you: good luck. You've got this. Hold your heads high and know that, no matter what the results, we are proud of you, and you are part of an extraordinary generation that does have the capacity to reshape our world for the better.
