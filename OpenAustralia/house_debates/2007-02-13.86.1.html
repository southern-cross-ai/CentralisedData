       <p>
        Recently bushfires have taken an enormous toll on many communities in the Pearce electorate, especially in this last couple of weeks, and none has been more devastating than the fire in Toodyay recently which sadly caused the loss of the life of a young schoolteacher, Michelle Mack. I did not know Michelle Mack personally but I know that she is greatly mourned by the Toodyay community and particularly by the Toodyay school community. I extend my deepest sympathy to Michelle Mack’s family and to the community of Toodyay and particularly to the Toodyay school. I spoke to the principal the other evening and I know that they are all in deep mourning and are shocked at Michelle’s death.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just after the fires broke out I spoke to the President of Toodyay Shire and volunteer firefighter from Toodyay, Charlie Wroth, who had been fighting fires with other volunteers almost nonstop for over a week. I would like to pay tribute to all the volunteer firefighters, particularly in Pearce. Those who know the Pearce electorate know of its particular vulnerability to fire and the brave men and women who volunteer to go out at any time of the day and night to fight fires. They are truly the genuine heroes and heroines of our community. They put their own businesses and lives on hold for hours if not days at a time to attend to the call of volunteer duties, and they put their lives at risk to save the lives of others.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fighting fires is a very dangerous and exhausting business and I cannot speak highly enough of those who undertake this very vital service to their community. We are all grateful for their commitment to community service in fighting fires to protect property and lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        Volunteer firefighters do fantastic work in other areas as well. They provide firebreaks, they contain hazardous material spills, they do a lot of rescue work on road crashes in rural areas and they provide community fire safety education—all very vital services to rural and regional communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the past few days, I have been speaking on the phone to farmers in Pearce, some of whom have lost up to 95 per cent of their property infrastructure, including fences, silos, stock, remnant bush land and some 150-year-old trees. It has turned the properties into dust bowls, because there is no vegetation left on some of these properties—nothing; it is just a moonscape.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite the heartbreak, these farmers remain positive and every one of them has spoken very highly of the volunteer firefighters and the tremendous work they did—in particular, the Toodyay, York, Northam,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Grass Valley
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakers_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Bakers Hill
        </a>
        volunteers, who on this occasion attended fires in Toodyay and in Grass Valley. Both were very serious fires. Unfortunately these fires were caused, they think, by old infrastructure, old power poles which have not been replaced by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Power" rel="nofollow">
         Western Power
        </a>
        . That is a tragedy, because it is preventable and affordable. I will certainly be writing to Western Power to ask for a brief and to find out when these poles will be changed over. It was only in 2003 that we saw fires in Tenterden in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        and the loss of the lives of two women. It is very sad that these were preventable.
       </p>
       <p>
        In October last year the Pingelly Volunteer Fire and Rescue Service was presented with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAC" rel="nofollow">
         RAC
        </a>
        Fire Fighting Award for 2006. Pingelly was one of 31 nominations over five categories and won the Volunteer Fire and Rescue Award. Pingelly’s nomination read:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Your nomination reflects the high regard that both your community and your peers have for your efforts. It is a credit to you that your outstanding contribution is considered worthy of acknowledgment and recognition.
       </p>
       <p>
        This could be applied to all the services in Pearce, whether they are in the hills, in the country towns or at the coast. All make an incredible commitment to looking after the communities they serve. I pay tribute to them and place on record my appreciation for the services they provide. Again, to Michelle Mack’s family, her friends and the Toodyay community, I extend my heartfelt sympathy.
