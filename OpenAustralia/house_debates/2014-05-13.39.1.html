        Madam Speaker, on indulgence, I wish to acknowledge the passing of Paul Ramsay, the founder of the Ramsay Healthcare Group. Paul Ramsay founded a mighty business empire, but he never lost his soul. Fifty years ago, Paul Ramsay bought a small hospital in Mossman, in my electorate. Today the Ramsay Healthcare Group employs some 30,000 people in five countries and it treats almost 1½ million patients a year. Paul Ramsay was, in the words of our former

         Prime Minister John Howard
        </a>
        at his funeral last week, was the very embodiment of ethical capitalism. He tried never to do a deal such that the person on the other side of the table would not want to come back for another one.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was lucky enough to meet Paul Ramsay some 41 years ago. He was a friend of mine and a friend to many in this House on both sides of the chamber. Paul Ramsay was generous to many good causes, some very dear to my heart. But above all else he was generous to this nation of ours. His bequest of his shares in the Ramsay group to a charitable foundation is by far the biggest charitable gift in our country's history—almost $3½ billion given in perpetuity for good causes. This is philanthropy on an epic scale. I hope we see more of it in the years and the decades ahead.
       </p>
       <p>
        To his brother, Peter, to his twin sister, Anne, to his brother-in-law, Brian, and to their families, on behalf of the government I offer deepest condolences. He will be missed, but the good that he did will live on, and I hope that his example will live on as an inspiration to many others.

         On indulgence, I wish to place on record the condolences of this side of the House to the friends and members of the family of Paul Ramsay AO, who passed away earlier this month. Mr Ramsay was born in Sydney. In 1964 he founded one of Sydney's first private psychiatric hospitals. Fifty years later, as the founder of Ramsay Healthcare, his name is synonymous with health care in Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mr Ramsay's contribution to Australia was not solely focused on health care. He served as the chairman of the Prime media group for 30 years and later in life was the chairman of the

          Sydney Football Club
         </a>
         . Friends of Mr Ramsay talk about his huge heart. This is evident by his long relationship with charitable organisations. It was indeed his philanthropic work that played a major part in his being made an

         , in 2002. Paul Ramsay was a great Australian businessman, a philanthropist and a member of our community. He will be missed by many. May he rest in peace.

          In respect of the memory of Paul Ramsay, I would like to associate my own remarks with those of both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. Paul Ramsay is a man I knew for many decades, a man who was always a man of grace, a gentleman, and someone who genuinely cared about his fellow citizens. As a mark of respect to the memory of Paul Ramsay AO, I invite honourable members to rise in their places.
