       <p>
        I rise to talk about the unsustainability of the National Disability Insurance Scheme. It started off as a great scheme, in theory, created because the previous disability support scheme that was run state-by-state was failing. The Gillard government at the time put together a deal—an incredibly generous, open-ended deal—with the states to sign them on. It was a noble but very unsustainable financial model.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2011, when it was first proposed, there were going to be 460,000 participants and the sum cost was to be, at the top end, $13.5 billion, with contributions of state budgets into the pool and the Commonwealth topping that up. Today, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        is way over those numbers, with 610,000 people. As to what it costs the taxpayers, it's not $13.5 billion. They got the numbers wrong. So, when you add another 200,000, you might get up to $26 billion if it's at that pay rate. But no—it costs $35 billion annually, and it's growing. And that's from the NDIS review figures. The amazing thing is: that same review identified that there are 145,000 children under nine who are now participants. I didn't know that we had that many children who are so severely disabled that they need to go on the NDIS. The same review sets out that, by 2032-33, if the current policy settings remain, it will cost $92 billion a year. At the moment, it costs more than Medicare rebates for 25½ million people; Medicare itself was in that same price range. There is something wrong here.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know that the disability ministers have got together, even though the states have abandoned their historical and constitutional involvement in it. And the ministers have committed to getting more non-NDIS services—the traditional community support that states delivered, that they seem to have totally abandoned—or foundational supports available outside the NDIS.
       </p>
       <p>
        Looking at the details in the report of the review and the recommendations, it's just moving the costs of an incredibly expensive, unsustainable system into a different column. Part of the reason it has run this far is that it is an open-ended system, a so-called demand-driven system. But there is a huge industry that's grown up around it. When you look at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIA" rel="nofollow">
         NDIA
        </a>
        charge out rates by NDIA providers, you can see why it's having huge effects on other care industries.
       </p>
       <p>
        People in my electorate have come to me over this issue. I've had to visit day-care centres, newly built centres, that can't staff their childcare centres. They've actually got rooms in mothballs because their workers have gone to be personal-care workers, earning considerably more than what they get after having done a childcare certificate

        , III or

        </a>
        course. We've got a shortage of nurses and personal-care workers in the aged-care system. It's the same thing: a lot of them are going over to work in the new—they're popping up all the time—NDIS service providers. I have had people being brought out to Australia from the Pacific island labour scheme to work in abattoirs, and after a month—and all these people had done heaps of work to get them out and get them housed—most of the 20-odd workers had ended up getting jobs in the NDIA. So there are people that lose a lot of, or have a shortage of, workers in the semiskilled space. All this work is now costing more, but all the people in it have moved over to the NDIS, and clearly it's unsustainable.
       </p>
       <p>
        They need to do more. They need to cap the cost of it now and then start working out a way to make it more efficient. There are way too many people applying to get on it. Yet, at the same time, there are too many on—
