       <p>
        I rise today to speak about the hundreds and hundreds of new jobs which have been created across the Corangamite region because of our government's policies and investments. We have finalised three free trade agreements, got rid of the carbon tax and just today, of course, passed our small business budget measures, which are so important for jobs of the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Geelong Region Innovation and Investment Fund has created some 750 jobs. The full $15 million of Commonwealth money has been delivered by our governmentâ€”not a cent from the previous Labour government. There are a whole range of other job creation programs, such as the Next Generation Manufacturing Investment Program. I am very proud of our $1.8 million Geelong Employment Connections program, for which I have fought so hard. It is now helping to fund local grassroots programs to help get people into work, particularly those who have lost their job in the manufacturing sector.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am very pleased that one of these initiatives is the Jobs4Geelong jobs fair, which is to be held this Friday and Saturday starting at 10 o'clock at
