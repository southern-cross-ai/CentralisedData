       <p>
        Colleagues, I would like to welcome to this wonderful place students from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Heart" rel="nofollow">
         Sacred Heart
        </a>
        secondary college in Yarrawonga and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FCJ" rel="nofollow">
         FCJ
        </a>
        college in Benalla—welcome—and their principals Joanne Rock and Lew Nagle. I would like to take the opportunity to acknowledge the young people, particularly in rural Victoria, who take a leadership role within our schools. They make such a difference to the calibre of our communities. They participate in the student representative council, in sport, in arts, in theatre and in community work, and I know these particular students have such a compassion for social justice. They care about marriage equality. They care about refugees. They care about the poor people in our communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to take the opportunity today to do a shout-out on behalf of all of us members of parliament to acknowledge the leadership that young people play in our schools. We really appreciate it. I particularly want to say to the year 12s, getting underway to do their final exams, who have played leadership role as well as studying, 'Thank you for your work.' We really do appreciate it and we know what a difference it has made to the whole calibre, the community and the culture of our schools. Young people step up and take on those leadership roles. Thank you very much everybody.
       </p>
