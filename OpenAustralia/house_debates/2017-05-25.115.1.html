        It may be early in Canberra—just before 10 am—but, when it comes to whisky, it is always the right time! This Sunday marks 25 years to the day that Bill and Lyn Lark were awarded a licence to distil whisky in Tasmania—the first after the industry was outlawed in my state in 1838.

        are the pioneers of a distilling industry that has grown like barley, has matured beautifully and is now world renowned. Bill, whose peat bogs are in my electorate, was in Canberra yesterday to help host a whisky-tasting event here at

        . It was a preview to Whisky Live—an international gathering to be held in Canberra this weekend. I am sorry to say there will not be many Tasmanian whiskies featured for the simple reason that there is not enough stock. It is flying off the shelves, and our distillers simply cannot keep up with burgeoning international and local demand.
       </p>

        I caught up with Bill this morning. He is always brilliant company. He told me that after the tasting in the parliament he had gone out for dinner, and who should he see leaving the restaurant but

        —a great Tasmanian—who changed the law to allow the establishment of distilling in Tasmania. It is fair to say that, without the persistence, effort and vision of those three men—Bill Lark, Barry Jones and Duncan Kerr—Tasmania's superb whisky industry would not exist today.

        Tasmanian whisky is or should be on everyone's tongue all the time. There are now more than 20 distilleries across my state—a good number of them in Lyons. There is Wilmot Hills Distillery, Adams Distillery, Belgrove Distillery, which is the only biofuel-powered distillery in the world, Redlands Distillery, Shene Estate &amp; Distillery, Nonesuch Distillery, where the company of Rex and Annette is as smooth as the spirits, Spring Bay Distillery, McHenry Distillery, Nant Distilling Company and more. Between them, they employ around 100 people and they support many more in associated tourism. August 4 to 13 is Tasmanian Whisky Week, and I urge you to come down and enjoy all we have to offer. It is going to be a fantastic week. It is recommended that you book early, and the details will be on my Facebook page.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the Australian spirits industry to reach its full potential—and I include in this our beautiful botanical gin—we need to take a serious look at the reform of excise laws. Tax on Australian spirits is around $25 a bottle, and they compete internationally with American spirits that have just $2.50 tax on their bottles, so there is a big disparity. The potential for growth in regional distilleries—both in Tasmania and around the country—with the skilled jobs they require and associated tourism is enormous. I remain hopeful that this parliament can learn from the vision of Barry Jones, Duncan Kerr and Bill Lark.
