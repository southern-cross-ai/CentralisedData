           On 9 February this year,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Ryan" rel="nofollow">
            Patrick Ryan
           </a>
           , called Paddy, was out having a great time with his mates, when it seemed like a good idea to the rest of his crew, and he joined in, to huff the gas out of a nine-kilogram
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPG" rel="nofollow">
            LPG
           </a>
           bottle. It killed him. Quite frankly, there's no other way to put it. You can imagine the challenge this has been for his family. It's just the worst nightmare of any family, to have your kid going out having a good time and then their life cut off for no good reason.
          </p>
          <p>
           There has been a committee formed in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Lincoln" rel="nofollow">
            Port Lincoln
           </a>
           by Paddy's father, Adrian, and friends to try to bring about some change, to warn on the bottles that this is a very dangerous exercise. At the moment, I don't think people had even thought of it before. But the idea that there is no warning on the bottle that if inhaled it may kill youâ€”it's an inflammable gas; you shouldn't light it in an enclosed space; we've got all that stuff. There is a whole range of different things that they can tick off on the bottles, but it doesn't actually warn you that if you inhale it it may kill you.
          </p>
          <p>
           Whether or not that would have stopped the kids that night we don't know, but it would have given them a fighting chance of actually making the right decision. I have spoken to a high school counsellor in Port Lincoln who has seen over 90 students since this time, coming from the same school, and only four of them denied ever having done the same. We are given to believe that there is more widespread use throughout Australia. I quote from Adrian's letter to the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            South Australia
           </a>
           n government: 'One in six children in Australia 16 and under will have tried inhaling aerosols or LPG products. America has 1,500 to 1,600 children a year that die from huffing, and it is thought that about 200 a year die from inhaling LPG products. In the period from 2002 to 2014,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
            New Zealand
           </a>
           had 60 children die from LPG abuse.' I also point out that Adrian pointed out in his letter that he found an article dated 2007 of exactly the same death of a 15-year-old in the northern suburbs of Adelaideâ€”just one breath.
          </p>
          <p>
           I thank Connie Bonaros from SA-

           . She has brought the issue to the

            South Australian
           </a>

            House of Assembly
           </a>
           , though, at this stage has elected to defer it for some time. I've spoken to the Premier, and he believes, and I believe, and Gas Energy Australia believe that it would be better if we had a national approach on this particular issue, so that when your caravan goes over the border it's not carrying the wrong labelling. We don't want states going off willy-nilly all over the place doing their own thing.
          </p>
          <p>
           I have spoken to the Attorney-General and have advice from him that he doesn't believe that he has the ability to legislate this at federal level. I accept that advice. But he does say to me that he would be minded to take a leadership role at the next meeting of Commonwealth, state and territory ministers on industrial relations and work health and safety to raise the issue and advocate for reform. I thank him for doing so.
          </p>
          <p>
           In the view of the people of Port Lincoln, in the view of Paddy's family, in my view, something needs to be done and it needs to be done urgently before we lose one more young Australian. As I said, it may not fix the issue. We can put all kinds of warnings on all kinds of things and it doesn't necessarily change the behaviour as we would hope. But, as I argued when we dealt with country-of-origin food labelling, if you don't have the information you can't make a sensible decision. If we have the information on the bottle, then at least people know it is a dangerous substance to be inhaled. It could be as simple as requiring every retailer in Australia, when they sell the bottle or when they refill the bottleâ€”this is where it comes a little more complex, of courseâ€”that they have a pile of stickers and they just have to make sure that a legible sticker goes on that bottle when it is returned for refill or swap and go or whatever it might be. I think the answer can be simple. Maybe the path to get there is difficult, but I want this looked at the highest level

           </small>
           <p>
            I rise to support my good friend and colleague the member for Grey and his private member's motion. I congratulate him on his speech and his passion to ensure that we don't see further cases of loss like that of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Ryan" rel="nofollow">
             Patrick Ryan
            </a>
            . I support this because it does come on the back of the tragic loss of Patrick Ryan, a 16-year-old from
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Lincoln" rel="nofollow">
             Port Lincoln
            </a>
            in the member for Grey's electorate. Patrick, by all accounts, was a talented young man with a passion for footy and basketball. He could be just like any young lad of his age. He had his whole life in front of him. As a parliament, we must do all we can to prevent this tragedy from occurring to another family.
           </p>
           <p>
            The proposal today is effectively to make mandatory labelling outlining the dangers of inhaling
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPG" rel="nofollow">
             LPG
            </a>
            gas. I'm prepared to concede in this place that I didn't even realise this was a thing until Patrick's circumstance came to my attention. Labelling of this nature is standard across a range of other gas and aerosol products to prevent other forms of hazing or gas inhalation. Current regulations regarding the wholesale distribution of LPG have similar warnings, but there's a gap in the current regulations when LPG gas is sold in small amounts for domestic use, like gas cylinders for barbecues. Although LPG may have a pictorial showing that it is a flammable liquid and it contains gas under pressure, it doesn't require information about the dangers of inhaling the substance. In my view, this is a regulatory gap and it must be fixed because Patrick is by no means the only casualty of inhaling LPG. I'm advised and verily believe that roughly one in six people under the age of 16 have tried inhaling an aerosol of some form or an LPG gas protect. Looking internationally to countries that have collected statistics, Patrick's family also suggests the situation is dire.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_America" rel="nofollow">
             In America
            </a>
            , it is estimated that 200 children a year die from directly inhaling LPG. Closer to home, in
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
             New Zealand
            </a>
            , between 2002 and 2014, 60 lives were taken from LPG gas misuse. If labelling changes are needed to prevent these practices, then I fully support those regulatory amendments.
           </p>
           <p>
            This also impacts my electorate, as, I expect, it impacts across all our electorates. This is a phenomenon that is sneaking up on us as young people and their behaviours change. Patrick intended to have a fun night out after having a barbecue with friends. He attended a friend's party. Patrick made a mistake. If he were aware of the risks, I'd like to think, and indeed I believe, he would have made a different choice. But, to be quite frank, he wasn't aware of those risks. As you've heard from the member for Grey, one huff, as they call it, can be enough to extinguish a life. This regulatory change would give young people the information they need to rethink this dangerous situationâ€”at least stop and reflect before it's perhaps too late. Preventing avoidable death is why these labelling changes are important.
           </p>
           <p>
            Patrick's uncle and his father, Adrian, have so far fought hard and I commend them for their fight. I am proud to support their efforts by supporting these changes. They lost a beloved family member, which can never be undone. Patrick's family are now pursuing these changes to prevent this tragedy affecting another family and another community like Port Lincoln. In my view, we should do all we can to ensure that this grief is not visited on another young person or their family and we need to act before it's too late. I want to conclude by commending Adrian and Andrew for their campaign and pass on my family's condolences to Patrick's family. I genuinely pray with all my heart that I don't have to give a speech on this topic in this place again.

            <p>
             Is there a better way to do things? Can we help in some way? Could we save a life? In this place, we must always ask these questions. I commend the member for Grey's motion as it is indicative of this approach. As a paediatrician and someone who has worked in public health my entire career, I've always fought for there not to be an ambulance at the bottom of the cliff but for measures taken to go to the top of the cliff to prevent people falling off in the first place. This is often very hard to do, and that's why I recommend this motion, because it's all about prevention.

             who died in February from huffing liquid petroleum gas from a backyard gas bottle, the member for Grey endeavoured to take action. This is sadly all too common an issue that is costing young lives. The school counsellor at Patrick's school has noticed that the practice is widespread. Unlike other misused substances, they are readily available and easily accessible and there is no warning label. The member for Grey's motion is not a silver bullet to addressing this devastating problem; however, if it would save one life, it is something worth doing.

             Those watching at home may not know what huffing is. It's a form of volatile substance abuse involving inhaling solvents or other household chemicals to get high. Inhalants are central nerve system depressantsâ€”meaning they can slow the workings of the brain, particularly breathing and heart muscles. It is necessary to understand that the short- and long-term impacts of huffing can both be devastating. People who are regular or heavy huffers can find it difficult to concentrate on everyday activities, even when they're not inhaling. They may experience nose bleeds, have bloodshot eyes, a frequent cough, constant tiredness, bad breath and sores on, in and around their nose and mouth. Often the person is very weak and unable to think clearly. They lose weight and may become aggressive or feel paranoid. Huffing has also been known to cause brain damage and sudden death, as has occurred in the case we have just discussed.
            </p>
            <p>
             Which members of our community are most affected by huffing? International research has identified inhalant use as a problem with prevalence among young people but particularly amongst those from lower-

              SES
             </a>
             and Indigenous groups. The highest rates of use have been identified in the

              US
             </a>
             , the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
              UK
             </a>
             and Australia. Australian studies have identified that prevalence peaks early compared to other drug use and is possibly a gateway drug. It is highest amongst 12- to 14-year-olds, probably because of its ease of accessibility and its cheapness. In fact, for many it is just free. It diminishes afterwards but then these children can go onto other forms of drug-taking.
            </p>
            <p>
             Studies of school-aged cohorts indicate that a significant minority is involved, but this data is quite chilling. In 2002, 21 per cent of Australian 12- to 17-year-old students surveyed reported having used inhalants, compared with 25 per cent reporting having used cannabis. As a paediatrician, I know of these case reports. I have four young kids between the ages of 16 and 24 and they tell me that, in schoolies, this is what kids do.
            </p>
            <p>
             So what needs to be done? Deodorant and other aerosol cans containing butane have the dangers of inhaling gas clearly marked on them, including highlighting the possibility of death.
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPG" rel="nofollow">
              LPG
             </a>
             bottles have no such warning. The member for Grey's motion calls for the relevant minister to establish an inquiry to investigate the circumstances of such deaths; to develop recommendations to ensure that LPG bottles are required to display a warning label which explains that the gas is poisonous and the dangers of inhalation; and to consider the recommendations and urgently bring forward legislation that, if passed, will ensure all LPG cylinders in Australia carry the recommended warnings. As I have said, this is not the whole solution, but it's an important first step. Is there a better way to do things? Can we help in some way? Could we save a life? Yes, yes and yes. It is high time that we took this issue seriously, and I thank the member for Grey for his important motion.

              I'd like to commend the member for Grey on putting up this motion. This is a really critical, sad and emotionally draining issue for so many people. As we have learned from the other speakers, it is, unfortunately, not an isolated problem. The tragic story of
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Ryan" rel="nofollow">
               Patrick Ryan
              </a>
              and the mission that his poor father, family and uncle are carrying on is to be really commended.
             </p>
             <p>
              Unfortunately, it's not just
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LPG" rel="nofollow">
               LPG
              </a>
              that causes the damage. LPG should have labels on it and we should be educating young people on the dangers of it, but it's not just LPG. Glue sniffing is a common teenage pastimeâ€”petrol sniffing as well. It's also called snuffing, huffing, chroming and hazing, and is seen as something cool. I did, for one period of my life, work in a brain damage unit where we saw people who'd drunk with alcohol, their brain, their balance and their nerves away. But you can do it express with cans of deodorant, with paint cans and, like I said, by glue sniffing. All the solvents go into your lungs and immediately they're displacing oxygen, which is pretty important for your brain, your body and your lungs. It can not only reduce oxygen, it can replace all the oxygen in your lungs. And then it goes into your bloodstream and it has the propensity to go into fatty tissue. Up here in your brain and in your nerves, you've got lots of lipids and fats, and it just dissolves it. In fact, the best description I've ever seen was by an academic who was talking about it being like melting plastic. That is what these solvents do to your brain and to your nerves. Unfortunately, I've seen young kids who didn't die but, almost worse, they're trapped in an uncoordinated, brain-damaged, simple body because of glue sniffing.
             </p>
             <p>
              We really do need to get on board with an education program, because it's young people who are doing this. By the time we get to our age, we work out, 'This is not such a good thing,' But it's cool amongst the kids: 'Let's go round the back and get something out of the cupboard or out of the shed.' Next thing you know, there's a tragedy. So paediatric teenager-level education as well as parental educationâ€”because most parents wouldn't know about this. It is all under the radar, and it is a really tragic story. So, whether it's the states that have to label it or whether it's us to drag them to the table to regulate and label it, I thoroughly agree. I don't care who does it; we just want it done. I totally support the member for Grey.
             </p>
             <p>
              It would be so simple to get a label done. We've got people and organisations like Healthy Harold going around, and all these other organisations that get involved in early adulthood support and education. A lot of people at that adolescent stage do crazy things. We've all done crazy things. In fact, I think of all the crazy things we did, but they were nothing like this. I was too scared to do drugs. I don't know, I must have had a sensible gene from my great grandfather or something. But, going through adolescence is a really dangerous period of a person's life, and some of these things happen because of peer pressure, some of them get sucked into doing it, some have depression and anxiety, and getting out of it by glue sniffing becomes habitual. So it doesn't happen in a big bang, like it happened with poor Patrick Ryan; it can be gradual and very progressive and the next thing you know is they're hooked. They're a brain damaged person and their life isn't what it should be.
             </p>
             <p>
              We've seen the figures in America. It's mind-boggling, and that's just with LPG deaths. There are probably more than 1,600, and a greater figure for damaged ones. So I do support any minister anywhere, whether it's a federal minister going to

              </a>
              encouraging his state colleagues to do it or we have to pass some sort of regulation, I don't care. We just need to do it, because it's really important and we don't want to have other young people suffering the same fate.

               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patty_Ryan" rel="nofollow">
                Patty Ryan
               </a>
               , aged just 16 years, who died after inhaling liquefied petroleum gas, LPG, from a nine-kilogram

              </p>
              <p>
               Adrian understandably wants no other parent to go through what he and his wife have gone through in losing their son. He is looking for safety labelling to be introduced to discourage kids from thinking it's just a bit of fun but not too serious. Adrian says that too many children have died from what is called huffing for decades, and yet labelling has been inadequate and there appears a strange lack of conviction on the part of the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                South Australia

               n state government to act to rectify this. It begs the question as to whether it is appropriate and timely to investigate a national inquiry and legislation.
              </p>
              <p>
               Adrian wrote that one in six children in Australia 16 years and under will have tried inhaling aerosols or LPG products. America has 1,500 to 1,600 children a year die from huffing, and it is thought about 200 a year die from inhaling LPG products. In a period from 2002-14

                New Zealand

               had 60 children die from LPG misuse. Aerosol cans such as deodorant, which contain butane, have the dangers clearly labelled, including the highlighting of possible death. LPG bottles have no such warnings.
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standards_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                Standards Australia

               says LPG is considered to be both a dangerous good and a hazardous chemical. Inhaling LPG can cause dizziness, coughing, nausea, vomiting, skin irritation, fever, numbness and death. There are strict state legislation and rules about labelling of LPG which apply to manufacturers, transporters and suppliers. Once LPG is supplied in small amounts for domestic use, however, the rules are less clear.
              </p>
              <p>
               There is also no nationally consistent approach to the regulation of LPG cylinders in Australia. In South Australia, where Paddy tragically lost his life, the Dangerous Substances (General) Regulations 2017 regulate the labelling of any LPG cylinder being stored by a person in South Australia. These laws require the appliance to which the gas bottle is attached to have a warning label. In addition it should include a pictogram which indicates that LPG is a flammable liquid and a pictogram that the gas bottle contains gas under pressure. However, there is no clear regulation that requires information about LPG as a possible asphyxiant. I understand the Attorney-General is interested in raising this issue with his state and territory counterparts to advocate for reform in this space. I encourage the Attorney-General to do so. I would recommend the adoption of a nationally consistent approach to the labelling of LPG cylinders to improve the communication of health risks and to prevent further tragedies from occurring.
              </p>
              <p>
               The inhalation of LPG follows a worrying trend that is damaging the health and safety of young people in our communities. Other inhalation trends include paint huffing and chroming as well as nitrous oxide, or nangs. These practices are viewed as cheap ways to achieve a quick high but are hugely dangerous and can lead to death, just like the inhalation of LPG.
