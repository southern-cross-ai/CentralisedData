        Every man needs a shed. In fact, every shed probably needs a man. Who knows? But our local men's sheds are becoming essential meeting places for blokes in our community right across the north-west, the west coast and

        in the electorate of Braddon. So it's only right to say that the Morrison government continues to back them in.

        Congratulations to the Mount Black Men's Shed in Rosebery on their successful application for funding under the National Shed Development Program. I received a letter only the other day from Kevin Dogrusever, the president of the shed. Kevin told me that the members were delighted to hear the great news that their application had been successful. One of their first jobs on the list is to fix the leaky roof and then to build a dividing wall to separate the workshop from the meeting room. This will make the shed a lot more welcoming, and safer and easier for meetings to take place. Kevin went on to say the Mount Black Men's Shed is relatively new, but it's already serving the Rosebery and Tullah regions and communities well. He can see real improvement in the way that members relate to each other, and there's real community spirit coming from within the shed. At the end of the day, that's what it's all about. So well done to the Mount Black Men's Shed.
