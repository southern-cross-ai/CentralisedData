        These people are all very worthy Australians who have made important and valuable contributions to our community. I am very fortunate to represent in this place a community with many kind-hearted and generous people. I pay tribute to all of those who give up their time to continue the tradition of community service in Higgins. Not all are recognised in the Australia Day honours, so I want to take the opportunity to recognise their contribution today. I also host regular morning teas to recognise those people in our community who work so hard for us and I want to place on record our thanks.
