        Over the last few months, I have had the opportunity to conduct local community surveys and mobile offices across the electorate of Reid to hear from residents about the issues that matter to them most. On a local level, residents living in my electorate frequently raise concerns about the traffic that flows through Reid. Calls for congestion-busting infrastructure have been the No. 1 response in our Reid community survey. Over 50 per cent of our constituents in Reid get to work by car or by bus, so congestion busting has been greatly needed. Not only is there local traffic, but, because we are the gateway from the eastern and western CBD, we get a lot of traffic coming through from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_CBD" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney CBD
        </a>
        , heading towards Parramatta. We have worked alongside the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        government to deliver new road infrastructure through WestConnex. Earlier this year the first stage of WestConnex opened in Reid and it's made a big difference to the people of Reid because we can get home quickly and safely. The WestConnex M4 tunnels allow motorists to bypass up to 22 sets of traffic lights and divert trucks and large vehicles off busy
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parramatta_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Parramatta Road
        </a>
        . This new infrastructure has reduced traffic at the notorious pinch point at the end of the M4 at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Strathfield" rel="nofollow">
         North Strathfield
        </a>
        , which was previously one of Sydney's worst traffic congestion spots. This is stage 1 of a larger project which will better connect
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">

        to the eastern CBD and the airport.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to WestConnex, the Morrison government has committed to delivering new congestion-busting infrastructure across other traffic hotspots in our electorate. $50 million has been dedicated to upgrade Homebush Bay Drive, including investigating options to improve traffic flow at the intersection of Australia Avenue and Underwood Road. These upgrades will improve road safety, reduce travel times and improve accessibility to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Olympic_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney Olympic Park
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wentworth_Point" rel="nofollow">
         Wentworth Point
        </a>
        . I'm looking forward to keeping the community up to date on this project.
       </p>
       <p>
        We're also working with our local councils to eliminate high-risk accident areas on our roads through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Spot_Program" rel="nofollow">
         Black Spot Program
        </a>
        . As a result, new roundabouts, traffic signals and traffic-calming devices like speed bumps, have been implemented across Reid. Traffic hazard hotspots across Strathfield, Homebush, Burwood, Concord, Croydon, Lidcombe and Sydney Olympic Park have received upgrades to make our streets safer. I always welcome more suggestions from the community about road black spots near their homes which could be improved. So I encourage constituents to keep speaking to me about these issues.

        Many residents of Reid are interested in seeing practical and responsible solutions to climate change. While tackling climate change requires a coordinated global solution, we are taking steps as a nation to play our role in reducing emissions. We're taking real and meaningful action to reduce global emissions with our $3.5 billion Climate Solutions Package that will allow us to meet our 2030 Paris target. On a national scale, we recognise the need to invest in renewable energy. Under our government, we've seen an unprecedented wave of investment in the renewable energy sector, in projects such as solar, wind and hydro. We have invested $1.38 billion in Snowy 2.0, which will be the world's second-largest renewable hydropower station. We are supporting Tasmania's Battery of the Nation project with a $56 million investment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most recently the Morrison government are taking the next steps to become global pioneers for a sustainable and commercial hydrogen industry through our National Hydrogen Strategy. This is an incredible opportunity for Australia. We are meeting consumer and system needs through reliable and innovative energy generation. Hydrogen can play a role in Australia's future energy mix, to decrease energy prices, improve energy security and reduce emissions. Importantly, it will create jobs, strengthen our economy and position Australia as a leader in a global hydrogen industry. This is only the beginning of our government's responsible and innovative initiative to protect our environment while strengthening Australia's energy supply and economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Reid, I have been working with grassroots organisations in order to make sure our local environment is being well managed and well cared for. We are funding renewable energy generation at a local level. Most recently, the 2nd Abbotsford Sea Scouts received $9,400 through a Stronger Communities grant for the implementation of solar panels on their scout hall, which is used by the sea scouts as well as other local organisations. Mike Zeederberg, chairperson of the 2nd Abbotsford Sea Scouts support committee, has expressed the positive impact of the project. It has reduced emissions and also reduced the running costs of the hall.

        A number of local community groups will also receive funding through the Morrison government's Communities Environment Program to see better waste management, flora and fauna rejuvenation and the preservation of endangered species in our electorate. Groups such as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_Volunteers_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        has received—

       <p>
        A number of local community groups will also receive funding through the Morrison government's Communities Environment Program to see better waste management, flora and fauna rejuvenation and the preservation of endangered species in our electorate. Groups such as Conservation Volunteers Australia have received $18,900 of federal funding to work with Sydney Olympic Park to restore local ecosystems and participate in community education events to promote frog habitat conservation and rehabilitation. I often jog through this beautiful part of Reid and I'm so pleased that we can support the local ecosystem in the area. Other groups, such as Bushcare, are working alongside Canada Bay Council in Concord to rejuvenate Queen Elizabeth Park's native flora and fauna, with a $20,000 federal grant. This program supports many other small-scale on-the-ground projects that aim to conserve, protect and manage our local environment. Climate change needs a global, national and local response. There is still much to be done to address the challenge of climate change but I am confident that sensible and practical solutions will have a real impact at every level.

        The majority of constituents who have completed the Reid community survey have highlighted stronger investment into hospital and health outcomes as a key priority for Reid. As a psychologist, this is an area I'm particularly passionate about. Only through a strong economy can we provide a sustainable, effective health system. We've put affordable medicines on the PBS and we are investing in medical research and technology through the government's Medical Research Future Fund. The Morrison government has spent more on mental health than any other government before it. We are committed to creating an accessible, equitable and integrated mental health system that has the capacity to provide targeted assistance to priority population groups facing significant challenges in mental health and for those at risk of suicide. The government has provided $736 million for mental health funding to facilitate the development of an evidence based mental health system. We want to collaborate with workplaces, community groups, health professionals and organisations. As the government, we want to continue practical steps to improve the mental health and wellbeing of all Australians by working with employers, health professionals, carers, families and individuals. It is an area I want to continue to work in and strongly advocate for.
       </p>
       <p>
        Residents of Reid have also expressed concerns about the impact of the drought on rural and regional communities across Australia. The impact of the drought on our farmers and regional communities has been devastating. We know that this Christmas many of our farmers will be struggling during a particularly dry summer season ahead. When our regional communities suffer, the whole country suffers with them and, for this reason, the drought is the Morrison government's top priority. We will continue to deliver additional drought support. Most recently with two-year interest-free loans for farmers and small businesses that are reliant on agriculture, and $709 million has been allocated to focus on financial support for farmers, additional investments into regional infrastructure projects and providing a boost to our drought-affected rural communities with new funds for local roads, schools, early learning centres and community projects.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are looking ahead with projects to ensure future water security so that, when it rains, we will be ready. Our government is providing $3.3 billion to build dams, weirs and pipelines. At this stage we are funding 21 water infrastructure projects, many of which are already underway. We are taking action to respond to the drought while also planning ahead to strengthen our nation's resilience and water security. I look forward to hearing more from constituents about their concerns on matters that they raise through community surveys and mobile offices, and I look forward to representing them ongoing in the future.
