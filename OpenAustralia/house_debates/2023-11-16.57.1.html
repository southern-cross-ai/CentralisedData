        Today I rise to acknowledge
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        nurse Dr Jennie King, who has been named a 2023 finalist for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
         NSW
        </a>
        Health's Judith Meppem Lifetime Achievement Award. This award recognises the contribution of an outstanding nurse or midwife who, throughout their career, has had a positive and sustained influence on patients, the health system and their profession.
       </p>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dr_King" rel="nofollow">
         Dr King
        </a>
        has been a nurse for 40 years, and 20 of those have been with the Central Coast Local Health District. Dr King has also spent some time in the United Kingdom working for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHS" rel="nofollow">
         NHS
        </a>
        . She received her fellowship at the

        </a>
        in nursing research. During her time with the Central Coast Local Health District, Dr King has worked in research with a focus on type 1 diabetes and improving patient care as well as outcomes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dr King is a phenomenal healthcare professional, and I congratulate her on this recognition. Her commitment to health care and research highlights her dedication to her community and to the nation. I recently spoke with Dr King to commend her on her work, and she let me know that she loves every part of her nursing career, which has opened so many pathways throughout her life.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our healthcare professionals are truly amazing Australians and have demonstrated their strength through the COVID-19 pandemic and the demands that it placed on our healthcare system. I wish to thank all of our nurses, all of our doctors, all of our allied health professionals and medical support staff who assist our community, not just on the Central Coast but right across Australia.
