        My question is to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is giving a $50 billion handout to big business and a tax cut for millionaires on 1 July, while supporting pay cuts for nearly 700,000 Australians.

So far from what I have heard, he has referred to events—I was trying to listen through what was loud interjections on both sides. Let me assist the House by saying this: there was a statement made in answer to one of the questions last week which on reflection I felt I should have asked to be withdrawn. I have asked other things to be withdrawn since. It would assist me if members do not interject in such a fashion that I am prevented from hearing. I want to keep hearing the Prime Minister and I am listening very closely. The Prime Minister knows that he cannot reflect on members.

                   </a>
                   in Victoria half a million dollars while workers were laid off at the Spotswood glass manufacturing plant. The AWU invoiced the payments as paid education leave, but the payments were used to pay off a union loan on its premises. And what about Chiquita Mushrooms? That is a very famous one. It paid the AWU $24,000. Again, the AWU did not trouble their members with any details of these payments from big business. What was that invoiced as? Again, paid education leave. You have to hand it to the AWU—they are absolutely committed to education, at least on all those dodgy invoices. What about Unibilt, who made a campaign donation of $32,000 to the member for Maribyrnong in 2007, when he was running for parliament, at the same time as the company was negotiating an enterprise agreement with the union of which he was the national secretary?

                   We are not going to take lectures from the Labor Party about dealings with big business. They say they are proud of the Leader of the Opposition's record as a union leader. It is one secret payment after another. If he was so proud of those payments, why doesn't he tell the world? Why doesn't he tell us what they were really for? We know they were not for the matters set out on the invoices. Let him tell us the story. He has a great barrister there, the member for Isaacs. He says he is especially proud of the Leader of the Opposition. He could get him to make a case, powerful advocate that he is. He could sell anything. We do not care who presents the facts, but it is about time that Labor told the truth about these secret payments from big business.

                    My question is to the Minister for Defence Industry representing the Minister for Employment. Will the minister inform the House why it is important to outlaw secret payments between big unions and big business? Is the minister aware of any examples where the integrity of enterprise bargaining agreements has been undermined by the behaviour of unions and some businesses?

                     I thank the member for Fisher for his question. He, like every member on this side of the House, knows that we must end the corrupting benefits in the industrial relations system that have been infecting the relationship between business and the unions for decades. That was identified by the Heydon royal commission. This government is implementing the recommendation to outlaw corrupting benefits and to make the payment of them a criminal act. I know that the member for Fisher is very keen on industrial relations reform. He, like every member on this side of the House, wants to see that change come about.

                     He asked me for a few examples. There are a few examples. The Prime Minister went through a few just then.

                     in 40 secret payments, while they were negotiating six enterprise business agreements with the AWU. The Leader of the Opposition was the secretary at the time, national then state. Alcoa—$90,000 to the AWU across eight secret payments while they were negotiating five enterprise business agreements. Sugar Australia—$16½ thousand to the AWU while they were negotiating three enterprise business agreements. It goes on and on—business after business negotiating enterprise business agreements with the AWU while the Leader of the Opposition was the state or national secretary.

                     The Leader of the Opposition would have us believe that this was all the most amazing coincidence, the most remarkable coincidence, and there was no connection between the workers' rights being sold down the river under enterprise business agreements while secret payments were being made by those businesses to the

You can just imagine the Alcoa executives at the Bamboo House in Little Bourke Street—we have been there many times—enjoying themselves between their shark fin soup and their duck pancakes, discussing their enterprise business agreements and their relationship with the union, and who should come into the restaurant?
