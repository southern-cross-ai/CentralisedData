        My question is to the Prime Minister. Hobart is the most bushfire vulnerable capital city in Australia, and there is still the possibility of dangerous bushfires this summer and autumn. Indeed, the University of Tasmania's Professor of Pyrogeography and Fire Science David Bowman has likened Hobart's fire threat to playing Russian roulette with a half-loaded chamber. Prime Minister, can you assure my community that the federal government has adopted a forward-leaning approach, is liaising with the Tasmanian government and has Commonwealth resources positioned and ready to respond? Moreover, will the federal government seize the opportunity for an apolitical climate change policy reset and allow the coalition a free vote on the member for Warringah's climate change bill?

         I thank the member for his question. I can assure him, yes, we have adopted a forward posture when it comes to the bushfire risk in Tasmania. I particularly want to take this opportunity to put on record my great thanks to the former Premier,

        </p>
        <p>
         I can assure the member that the commissioners and chief officers of the strategic committee and the emergency meetings have met on nine occasions. It's brought together by the Director-General of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Management_Australia" rel="nofollow">

         I can also advise that the

          South Australia
         </a>
         on 3 January 2020. It was then responsible for deploying personnel in response to the compulsory call-up, the first ever in response to a national bushfire crisis that has been implemented by a federal government.

         1111 is based on South Australia and Tasmania's 9th Brigade, and a reserve unit was spread across both states, commanded by Brigadier Damian Cantwell. An ADF emergency support force was stood up in Tasmania, responding to

        </p>
        <p>
         On 9 January the commander visited Tasmania to conduct reconnaissance and brief the Tasmanian Premier on ADF capabilities available to support. A proactive and forward-leaning ADF posture was adopted in this state. The 17th

         formed a force support team based on the 2nd Force Support Battalion and augmented with medical and communications staff from the 1st Close Health Battalion and the 145th Signal Squadron to provide the major logistics, assets and personnel to support a Tasmanian based response. The 145th Signal Squadron undertook state-wide communications checksâ€”

           It's on relevance. The community would be keen to hear the Prime Minister's response to the second part of the question about whether or not he will allow a free vote on the climate change bill.

            This is the problem when you have a long preamble. As you acknowledged, you asked two questions. The Prime Minister is entitled to address it. If the member for Clark wants a more precise answer to his second question, I suggest that he just ask that next time. The Prime Minister has the call.

             The government's response on a forward posture has been quite significant. The ADF teams conducted a route analysis of likely evacuation locations, including an amphibious landing zone, which obviously proved so critical in the evacuations that were taking place out of Victoria. Briefings on ADF capabilities available to state authorities were provided by the commanding officer of the 12th and 40th
