        There is one thing coming up in

        that is dividing us—the Senate election—but there is another thing in Western Australia that does unite us, and that is sport. We have just heard an amazing speech from the member for Perth, which we could refer to as 'Alannah in Wonderland', talking about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">

        . Both the member for Perth and I attended a community cricket match on the weekend, so it was good to see that we were united in that area.

        The

        Football League kicked off on the weekend. As I am the patron of the

        , which is in my electorate, I thought I would attend their first game. I must admit that Perth have been rather starved of success over the last 20 or 30 years, but it is great to announce that Perth Football Club are on top of the ladder. It is the first time they have been on top of the ladder after round one since 2002, so they have broken a 12-year drought. Some were saying that we should call the season to an end right now. I saw the member for Fremantle make a contribution earlier, and the
