        Well, 13.6 million Australians woke up today to find out that they will be receiving a bigger tax cut on 1 July because the Senate passed Labor's tax cuts last night. Eighty-four per cent of Australians woke up this morning to find out they will be receiving a bigger tax cut on 1 July because of the events of last night and because the Albanese Labor government wants them to earn more and keep more of what they earn. This is the case in my electorate of Spence as well, with 91 per cent, or around 67,000 people, receiving a bigger, better tax cut under Labor than they would under the Liberals. No matter where you are in Australia, 100 per cent of taxpayers will receive a tax cut under our plan. Under the former Liberal government's plan, if you earned less than $45,000 you wouldn't receive any tax cut at all. I guess those opposite thought Australians didn't deserve one if they earned below $45,000. Australians know that the Liberal and National party had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, to support tax cuts for low- and middle-income Australians doing it tough. We had to do that because we knew they would never stand up for Australians that need a government in their corner the most. All that the Liberal Party want to see is Australians work longer and earn less.
