         I thank the member for Lowe for his question. This is a very exciting program which is delivering important community infrastructure projects right around the nation. Indeed, my attention has been drawn to comments about Mirrabooka Regional Centre in Perth. The comments include:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City" rel="nofollow">
          The City
         </a>
         of Stirling is seeking $5.1 million in funding from the federal Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program for strategic projects to assist with building new infrastructure around the Mirrabooka Regional Centre. The project will see significant economic benefits flow through to the immediate and surrounding communities.
        </p>
        <p>
         That is a worthy statement. It goes on to say:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Implementation of the project is projected to provide 870 jobs and support 1,800 jobs long term.
        </p>
        <p>
         This person goes on to say:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I strongly urge the government to provide funding of at least $5.1 million towards the Mirrabooka Regional Centre.
        </p>
        <p>
         The council only wants $5.1 million, but
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Keenan" rel="nofollow">
          Michael Keenan
         </a>
         , the member for Stirling, wants at least $5.1 million for this program. I table the progress report from the member for Stirling campaigning in his electorate for funding for this project. Indeed, he is pretty hands-on. The member for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
          North Sydney
         </a>
         has said that if you have voted against projects you are morally obliged to not show up and say that you support them. But the member for Stirling does not have that view. He turned up to applaud the opening of the project just last week.

          There it is—the Nation Building Program sign and all in the background—and he is applauding that project. But the member for Stirling goes a step further. The member for Stirling wants to build the project himself. He is out there with the hammer building the project himself, putting a hammer through the credibility of the arguments of those opposite. And, if a hammer is not enough, he has a jackhammer.

            Better than using a sickle, Albo. In any event, Mr Speaker, you yourself have ruled that photographs should be at the very most incidental to an answer to a question. I would say that the minister has transgressed the good taste of the House and your tolerance, and I would ask you to call him to order.

              I will put the other photos up on the website. They will all be there because they are terrific photos. What this illustrates is the serious point that those opposite say one thing in their electorates. Last week they were out there—the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer—saying that this was all wasteful, that the stimulus should be withdrawn, but when they go into their seats they are arguing for extra funding. I was in the electorates of coalition members last week at the invitation of coalition members, asking them to look at projects for the next round. They have a view that they can get away with arguing one thing in here but another thing in their electorates. They will not get away with it.
