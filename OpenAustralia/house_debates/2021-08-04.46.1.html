        The 1st Dural Scout Group recently had their annual awards presentation, an opportunity to acknowledge the hard work of their scouts throughout the year. This year I had the privilege of presenting the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_Wolf_Award" rel="nofollow">
         Grey Wolf Award
        </a>
        and the Warren Payne Award—the Bear Award.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Grey Wolf Award is the peak award a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cub_Scout" rel="nofollow">
         Cub Scout
        </a>
        can earn, and is the culmination of more than three years of activity. To earn this award, the cub needs to demonstrate planning and leadership skills amongst their peers; they need to learn, perform and teach others a range of outdoor competencies; and they must design and complete a number of personal development projects. To complete their award, the Cub Scout must also independently plan a challenging outdoor activity and then lead a team of their peers on this activity. Congratulations to the four recipients of the Grey Wolf Award in the Cubs section: James Waterson, Elijah Dawson, Bridgette Zapletal and Christian Zapletal.

        This year, I also had the privilege of awarding the very first Warren Payne awards—the Bear awards. Warren Payne is a man who has dedicated almost 25 years to 1st Dural Scouts since he followed his wife and son into the group. He became ill six years ago, and 1st Dural wanted to honour the contribution he has made and continues to make in a way that would ensure perpetual recognition of his worth. The award went to one scout from each of the four sections. Congratulations to this year's awardees, Jack O'Kane in Joeys, Angus Smith in Cubs, Mak Kuntze in Scouts and Tegan Edwards in Venturers. Congratulations to all of the Dural Scouts awardees. Congratulations on the work that you do, on the skills that you learn and on the activities of a great troop.
