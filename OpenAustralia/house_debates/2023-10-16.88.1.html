        . How is the Albanese Labor government working to take the pressure off Australian families through targeted cost-of-living relief, and what obstacles has the government had to overcome to provide this relief?

        <p>
         I'd like to thank the member for Paterson for her question. Since coming to government, Labor has been working for the Australian people every single day. We know that many people are facing challenges with the cost of living, and that's why we've taken action to help relieve that pressure—it has been our top priority. In the May budget we announced our extensive cost-of-living plan to provide support to help millions of Australians doing it tough, but, of course, without adding to inflation. That support is now flowing and making a difference.
        </p>
        <p>
         In my portfolio of social services, since the House last sat I'm pleased to advise that, from 20 September, we've seen many income support payments boosted, and they've started to flow to people's pockets. We have lifted payment rates for single parents, renters, older Australians and those who are unemployed or studying. For older Australians now eligible for the higher rate of JobSeeker, they've seen an increase of $109 a fortnight. For the 60,000 single parents who have moved from JobSeeker to the parenting payment as a result of this government's decision to expand access, they are now receiving at least an additional $197 a fortnight. And, of course, we've now introduced the largest increase in Commonwealth rental assistance in the last 30 years. For those on the base rate of JobSeeker, this has meant an increase of $56 a fortnight.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Treasurer has aptly outlined all of those initiatives that those opposite have tried to block, but he did miss the fact that those opposite also tried to block the increase to the base rate of the JobSeeker, in the Senate. They wanted to deny those most vulnerable an increase to their base payment. This is just another example of the Leader of the Opposition always saying no. His endless negativity, if he were successful, would have denied support to those who need it the most.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, we have a plan across government to ease the cost-of-living pressures. Our election commitment to expand eligibility to the Commonwealth seniors health card means that 20,500 more retirees have this card and have access to cheaper health care. We've delivered enhanced and more flexible paid parental leave—soon to legislate the scheme to 26 weeks. We've provided energy bill relief, reduced the cost of medicines and tripled bulk-billing incentives. It is our government that is firmly focused on cost-of-living pressures for Australians, and we will keep delivering.
