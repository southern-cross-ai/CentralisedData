        Today I would like to report to the chamber that the work skills voucher initiative is being taken up with a great deal of enthusiasm by many residents in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McPherson" rel="nofollow">
         McPherson
        </a>
        . Work skills vouchers worth up to $3,000 are available to interested Australians aged 25 and over who do not have a year 12 or a certificate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        qualification. The vouchers will improve, no doubt, the basic skills of Australians currently in the workforce or looking for work who have no formal qualifications. Improvements in basic skills will help people who are already in employment to move into higher level positions and assist those who are looking for work to find jobs.

        My electorate office is on the same block as the Mackintosh International College, one of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        ’s largest private vocational training colleges. On a daily basis my staff talk to people who are applying for the work skills vouchers and, in fact, assist them with the statutory declaration that has to be signed to undertake studying with the voucher. The people’s ages and backgrounds are extremely diverse but they are certainly united in their support of this program and their opportunity to upgrade their skills. They are determined to get a vocational qualification and improve their confidence before either re-entering the workforce, looking to increase from casual to part-time or full-time employment, or retraining themselves to market themselves as a better job seeker.

        In my own electorate, a lot of young mums are taking up this initiative and it is enabling them to get back into the workforce. It is giving them a pathway back into that workforce. Julie Leeding is one of those mums. She is from Currumbin Waters and she is a student who is now benefiting from the work skills program. She is currently studying for a certificate II in business at Mackintosh College. Julie admitted she was a little apprehensive about studying; however, once she attended a class, those fears disappeared and she is now thoroughly enjoying the course and believes that it is offering everything she expected and more. In fact, Julie has told staff at the college that, as well as knowledge gained, there are hidden benefits. Her motivation has improved, she is excited about job prospects, she has renewed confidence in herself, and overall she is just a happier person. In fact, her daughter has told my staff that she is a much happier person to live with.
       </p>

        Julie hopes that the work skills program will continue so that others can benefit and gain the necessary skills to re-enter the workforce. Mackintosh College founder Darren Mackintosh said that, although the program only started on 1 January this year, the public are well informed about the program and the marketing of the program, and he is putting through student after student. I commend Darren and Mackintosh College for the part they are playing in reskilling people to re-enter the workforce or upgrade their skills for better jobs into the future. I commend the federal government for this great initiative.
