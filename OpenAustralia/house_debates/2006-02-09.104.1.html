        Today I wish to inform the House of the achievements of

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Stein" rel="nofollow">
         Bob Stein
        </a>
        died in January this year and in this, the first sitting week of the year, I want to inform the House of Bob’s achievements and pay tribute to him. Bob was born in 1928 into a family of Smithfield pioneers. Even in 1928 his family was one of our area’s longstanding institutions, having been major players in the local wine industry, which is now extinct but which was one of our area’s major industries in its early years.
       </p>
       <p>
        He attended Smithfield Public School, which incidentally was the same primary school I attended approximately 40 years later. In 1951 Bob married Lorna, and soon Andrew and Megan were born. Both Andrew and Megan still live in our area. In 1970 Bob and Lorna started Smithfield Hire, which became an institution in its own right. Smithfield Hire was not only used heavily by local businesses, but many Smithfield families used to go down to Smithfield Hire to rent various essentials for parties and family get-togethers. As well, many local community groups—

        </p>
       </b>
       <p>
        As I was saying, many local community groups came to rely on Smithfield Hire for their functions. A non-profit group could be sure to find a sympathetic ear in Bob when they needed chairs, tables or any other variety of equipment for their charity activities. Bob joined what was then called the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        of Smithfield and was later awarded a Paul Harris Fellowship, the most significant award that Rotary has. The Stein family tradition carries on with Bob’s son, Andrew’s, involvement in Smithfield Rotary Club’s successor, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wetherill_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Wetherill Park
        </a>
        club.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1981 Bob suggested to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfield_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Fairfield City Council
        </a>
        that the former council chambers on Horsley Drive at Smithfield be purchased and turned into the Fairfield City Museum and Gallery. Council wisely accepted Bob’s suggestion, and the Fairfield museum is a wonderful facility that many residents and visitors to the city have utilised. His family name is honoured at the museum by the Stein Gallery. Bob of course became the first president of the museum. His wife, Lorna, and he were involved for many years in the museum. In 1991 Bob was declared Fairfield Citizen of the Year, an achievement that has not fallen to many.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1986 Bob and Lorna revived the family’s tradition of winegrowing by opening the Robert Stein Vineyard at Mudgee. The vineyard took Bob and Lorna to Mudgee, but their hearts were always in Smithfield. They were to be regularly seen at community events. I personally remember Bob being very proud of his heritage at the 150th anniversary celebrations of our old school, Smithfield Public, in the year 2000. Bob cared deeply about his community. I dare say that the only thing he cared more about than his community was his family: Lorna, Drew, Megan and grandchildren.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bob Stein was not a passenger in life. He believed in making a difference. His life can be an inspiration. His deeds, of course, will not die with him; they will live on. In some ways Bob Stein will be alive while ever the Fairfield museum continues to exist. In some ways he will always be alive while ever people remember his kindness and humanity. His legacy will certainly live for as long as his family continues his tradition of service. I express my sympathy in the House, as I have done privately, to his family. May Bob Stein rest in peace.
