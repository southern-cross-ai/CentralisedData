        Earlier this month I was given the wonderful opportunity to launch Artober in Daylesford, a beautiful town within my electorate of Ballarat. Since being launched in 2014, this arts program has stood as a centrepiece of the Daylesford region's busy arts calendar. The events of Artober are a truly unique opportunity to experience art in all of its forms and in different environments. Throughout Artober, you can not only attend large-scale events such as the Daylesford Art Show, which is still going strong in its 33rd year and showing many works from over 100 local artists, but also enjoy smaller experiences, such as visiting workshops, open studios or community events. It is hard to enter any of these sites, look at the work produced by some of the most talented within our community and emerge without having been inspired by their artistic creations. It is experiences like this that bring thousands back to Daylesford and this event each year.

        In just the short time I've been able to spend at Artober so far, I've been able to enjoy the works of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Nash" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the words of Warren Maloney at their exhibition, Villages of Hepburn. These two men from the local area have been engaged in a project visiting the small towns and villages dotted around Hepburn to paint the landscapes and write down the stories of this wonderful place. For anybody who has had the joy of visiting this region, they will know just how beautiful it is. Brian and Warren have truly done these towns justice with their paintings and beautiful words.
       </p>

        Once again, the Artober event is being run as a not-for-profit, meaning that not only do visitors get to enjoy the works on display but we can do so knowing that all funds raised will support the region, the community and beyond. We know that it is events like this which bring together our local artists in a cooperative effort that ensures regional artistic communities both survive and thrive. I want to congratulate all of the artists who have been involved in Artober. I particularly acknowledge the work of the volunteers and the service community who put on the art show and have been doing so for a long period of time, ensuring its continuity. Daylesford and the Hepburn shire is an incredibly beautiful part of the world. I would encourage members to visit.

        Artober is nearly finished as we head out of the month of October, but I want to thank the artists, the volunteers and the organising committee for again putting on such a terrific event. We know that tourism is a vital part of the economy in our part of the world, and certainly this event contributes substantially to the many, many suites of events that are available across the calendar year and makes sure that our economy continues to thrive both through the Hepburn shire and the
