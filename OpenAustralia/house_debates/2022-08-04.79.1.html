        It is a true privilege to be back to this place and be returned as the member for Wills. To the people of Wills, I thank you for re-electing me as your representative to be your voice in this place. To the people of Hadfield, Fawkner, Glenroy, Brunswick,

        , thank you. Thank you to everyone who supported my campaign. To everyone who voted for another candidate, a short message: I am here to work for you as well and I want to hear about issues that matter to you, regardless of who you voted for. No matter who you voted for, I'm here to serve you and our community.

        This is the first time I stand in this place as a member of the government and I know now, after a few weeks, firsthand the power of government to change the lives of people for the better. It was
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_government" rel="nofollow">

        s that gave my migrant family a home and allowed me to get access to a quality education, and to help me contribute as an MP. In the first fortnight of this parliament, we are getting straight to work, delivering a better future for all Australians. We have already taken real action on delivering the first real action plan on climate in nearly a decade, reforming aged care, abolishing the cashless debit card and introducing domestic violence leave. This is the power of government, and I am so grateful to the people of Wills for placing their trust in me for a third term. I will keep working for you, for real action that makes a positive difference to your lives.
