       <p>
        Cancer has touched so many Australians either directly or indirectly. As patron of a local charity in my electorate of Mackellar, Fight on the Beaches, it was my privilege to attend the second annual
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_in_July" rel="nofollow">

        ball to raise money for Cure Cancer Australia. Each and every day, around 330 Australians will be diagnosed with cancer, and, as we all know, research is vital to the fight against this insidious disease. That is why a group of northern beaches women in my electorate established the Fight on the Beaches charity only last year.
       </p>
       <p>
        In hosting the first annual ball last year, they raised $100,000 for Cure Cancer Australia, and it was used towards supporting the work and research of Dr Christine Napier, of the

        </a>
        , on a project she hopes will lead to clinical trials for less toxic anticancer drugs. This year, the Fight on the Beaches charity ball was bigger and better than ever, with the dinner sold out and raising more than $200,000—well above their $150,000 target—which will go to funding two equally important research grants through Cure Cancer Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fight on the Beaches was supported by many individuals and business sponsors, who gave generously to ensure the night's success. I would like to acknowledge the executive committee,

        -Armstrong, Meghann Parker, Rebecca Coulson, Stacey Mitchell, Lisa Routledge, Colleen Camelin, Carol Chaffer, Danielle Hobbs and all the other volunteers who assisted on the night, without whose hard work the success of the ball would not have been achieved and the money not raised for this very important work.
