        My question is to the Prime Minister. Official data released today shows emissions have just gone up by two per cent under your government, but the independent Climate Targets Panel has determined that, for Australia to meet the Glasgow Climate Pact requirement to keep global warming below 1½ degrees, emissions must be cut by at least 74 per cent by 2030. Given Australia will be required to update our targets in Egypt next year, will you take a 75 per cent by 2030 target to the next election, or is the only way we are going to get science based climate targets to kick your terrible government out and put the Greens in balance of power?

         I thank the shadow deputy leader of the opposition in what he hopes to be a Green-Labor government after the next election. That's what they hope for. They're calling themselves shadow ministers down there in the Greens. I tell you what: they'll never be in an alignment with this government. There never will be and there never has been a Liberal-Nationals-Green government, but I do know that the Labor Party in government did a deal with the Greens to bring in the carbon tax. I know they formed an alliance with the Greens the last time they were in government. I remember the photo. It was almost as shameless as the photo we saw with the former Leader of the Opposition, with all the hubris, measuring up the curtains before the last election. There they are, getting ready and thinking the Greens and Labor are going to walk onto the Treasury bench of this country.

                I note that the Leader of the Opposition takes exception to the suggestion that the Greens and Labor would actually form a coalition. Where would I get that idea from? They actually did it when they were last in government. I remember many years ago—I think it was before the 2004 election—when
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsay_Tanner" rel="nofollow">
                 Lindsay Tanner
                </a>
                , a former member for Melbourne, said: 'If it's a close election, we might have to do some of the crazy things the Greens want us to do.' That's what the former member for Melbourne said, and now a Greens member sits in that former Labor seat just as a Greens leader would seek to sit in a Labor government.
               </p>
               <p>
                I can tell the member that, under our government, emissions have fallen by over 20 per cent. I can tell you that we have a target for 2030 which we took to the Australian people at the last election and which we will meet and beat, and we will see emissions fall by 35 per cent by 2030. The Labor-Greens target is not set yet. They still haven't told you what they want to do in 2030. There is no plan by 2030. There is no plan by 2050. We've been very clear that we will do this through technology, not taxes, but Labor, forced by the Greens, will tax you on that issue.
