          <p>
           Labor have been so desperate to reclaim some ground on their major weakness—economic management—that they have tried to find something, anything, upon which they can criticise the previous government. They have again and again misrepresented the economic history of this country. We have had the Treasurer saying inflation has been on the march for two years, when we know that in the middle of last year the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
            Reserve Bank
           </a>
           itself said that inflation was coming down, far from being on the march. We have had the absurdity of the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
            Local Government
           </a>
           , the member for Grayndler, saying that the Reserve Bank had given 20 warnings that there should be a coordinating authority for national infrastructure. Where were they to be found? He has just made that up.
          </p>
          <p>
           The 20 warnings spoken about by the government are nothing of the sort. They do not mention a skills crisis, let alone a chronic skills crisis. They do not say infrastructure bottlenecks are driving up inflation. In fact, one of the so-called Reserve Bank warnings that the government have misrepresented, from June last year, sees the Governor of the Reserve Bank saying that the way in which the labour market is operating to allow those areas with highest demand to see higher wages and other parts of the economy to pick up without causing overall wage inflation is, and I quote, ‘a textbook case of adjustment’.
          </p>
          <p>
           The government have talked down this economy again and again and attributed all of our economic prosperity to good luck, not good management. Let me say that, when it comes to economic management, appealing to luck only gets you so far. That lesson was learnt the last time Labor was in office.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Keating" rel="nofollow">
            Paul Keating
           </a>
           ’s ‘recession we had to have’ did not occur as a result of bad luck. We did not have 17-plus per cent interest rates as a result of bad luck. We did not have double digit unemployment rates as a result of bad luck. We did not destroy the job prospects of an entire generation of young Australians as a result of bad luck. We did not have real wage stagnation as a result of bad luck. And we did not have $96 billion in government debt as a result of bad luck. All of those horrors occurred as a result of deliberate policy choices of poor economic management. A party that cannot recognise good economic management when it sees it is doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past, and that is what Labor now risks doing.
          </p>
          <p>
           In December last year the Treasurer said he ‘didn’t intend to be one of those first-term Treasurers who only ever talks about the evils of his predecessors’. Well, he has blamed the previous government—and we stopped counting a month ago—more than 110 times. For almost four months now the coalition has been urging the Treasurer to stop talking down the economy. Ever since he has taken on that job, he has been more concerned with trashing the economic legacy of the previous government than focusing on his job to keep the economy strong. The
           <i>
            Australian
           </i>
           summed it up very succinctly in an editorial only a week ago, when it said we are paying the price for Labor’s attempts to blacken the reputation of the Howard government, because, in doing so, they are fuelling inflationary expectations.
          </p>
          <p>
           Expectations are everything when it comes to the economy, when it comes to business, when it comes to consumer confidence. That is why I have said to the Treasurer that we are operating in a very volatile global economic environment—unpredictably volatile. So be cautious. Be accurate. Be moderate. Be objective. Speak like a Treasurer should—like the previous Treasurer did—not like somebody who thinks he is still in opposition, trying to bring down a government. The election is over. The Treasurer has to start doing his job, not the job he had a year ago. A Treasurer’s comments can enormously influence economic expectations and confidence. We all remember the effect Paul Keating’s infamous ‘banana republic’ remark had—probably the only remark by a Treasurer on the same level of imprudence as the remark by this Treasurer that ‘the inflation genie’ was ‘out of the bottle’ in Australia, said the day before the Reserve Bank met to consider a change in monetary policy.
          </p>
          <p>
           The Reserve Bank says again and again, as I quoted in question time earlier, that the key to managing inflation is managing expectations. If people think inflation is going to go up, it will go up. You have to be careful what you wish for. So we have had a Treasurer who hit the headlines all around the world, as he hit the economic future of Australia, when he said, ‘The inflation genie is out of the bottle.’ That was a signal to the world that, in his view—in the view of the Treasurer, the man responsible for managing our $1.1 trillion economy—inflation was out of control. It was a message to the Reserve Bank: ‘Put those interest rates up.’ So, instead of having a Treasurer who urged caution and moderation, we had a Treasurer who was urging the Reserve Bank to put interest rates up.
          </p>
          <p>
           And we have had this confusion among the economic ministers. We have had, as I said, the Treasurer who says inflation has been on the march for two years—completely and utterly false, self-evidently false, because inflation was perceived, not just by the Reserve Bank but by the Treasury, to be coming down. Indeed, in the middle of last year the Reserve Bank Governor was telling the whole world that inflation was moderating, the interest rate rises of 2006 were doing their job, inflation was coming down—all would be well. And then it picked up later in the year. So the central bank has been responding to that.
          </p>
          <p>
           We had the Minister for Finance and Deregulation on ABC Radio in Melbourne on 5 February saying the evidence of a serious inflation problem has only begun to mount over the last six months or so. He was right. That is why he is chairing the

           </a>
           —because he is competent and the Treasurer is incompetent.

           <p>
            Well, relatively competent—I am corrected by my colleagues. The Assistant Treasurer said at a press conference on 22 January:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            ... inflation has been low in Australia over the last few years ...
           </p>
           <p>
            So the government’s economic team have three different opinions on the recent history of the inflation situation in this country.
           </p>
           <p>
            What we have at the moment is a country strongly situated in economic terms, with strong growth, low unemployment and inflation in manageable parameters, but we have a government which is exacerbating our economic challenges, worsening inflation and heightening inflationary expectations. Is it any wonder that business confidence is plummeting? That is the report card on the Rudd government.

                  <p>
                   I am speaking against the suspension of standing orders—about why standing orders should not be suspended and the further business of the House deferred. That should not happen, because this is just a stunt. This is a stunt from an opposition that has clearly lost its way. You have the Leader of the Opposition sitting there, the bloke behind him is the person who wants to be the Leader of the Opposition, and all we are seeing is that being played out in front of the nation. That is all this is about.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   There was no basis for this. I sat in tactics committees for a few years, and let me tell you that one thing that we did not do in opposition during those years was move a suspension without any lead-up, without any momentum, on the floor of the House of Representatives. You had nothing today—nothing. You got slaughtered by the Treasurer, by the Minister for Ageing, by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, by the Deputy Prime Minister and by the Prime Minister. Question after question that you asked got batted straight over the boundary for six. The most absurd question was from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the small business question—we are still trying to work out what that was about.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Seriously, you ran out of questions at about five or six and then you moved a suspension of standing orders on that basis. But I am not surprised, because this is an opposition that has clearly lost its way. Not only does it not have any ideas about what it stands for, not only does it have no plans for the future; it actually does not even know what its name will be in 12 months time. The fact is that normally when people stand for parliament they stand on the basis of what their party stands for—what they are about. We on this side of the House are elected proudly as Labor Party members—a tradition 117 years long, a tradition of building the nation, a tradition of building equity and a fair go through the Australian system. But I note that Senator

                            The only reason this suspension has been moved is relevance deprivation syndrome of the person who has moved it, because he did not get enough questions this week. That is what it is about—it is about the leadership of the Liberal Party. We have a plan here, exposed by Senator

                              I am referring to the motion before the House. It is whether standing orders should be suspended. Be very clear: that is the motion before the House. The reason why this is occurring is that this is a distraction from a party and a coalition at war with itself—unclear about what it stands for. If you look at the debate that is going on on their side of the House—on this side of the House you see 117 years of proud tradition and history—they do not even know what their political party will stand for. The member for Hinkler over there made a contribution to

                              ’s suggestion. It was this:

                             <p class="italic">
                              It’s a good idea from Barnaby, with one proviso: that you get the best three names and present them to marketing experts.

                             <p>
                              We think, as Labor members, that ‘Labor’ reflects what we stand for. We know ‘Liberal’ does not reflect what they stand for. We know that ‘National’ does not reflect what they stand for. So what name would they come up with? ‘Tail Waggers’ has already been taken by the pet food company up on the north coast that does not produce any pet food. It is extraordinary that, as one of the two big parties in this nation, they have been reduced to this sort of activity. They have even proposed a prize. Senator Joyce said:
                             </p>
                             <p class="italic">
                              There would have to be a prize, but I’m not sure what it would be. It would have to be something of relevance.

Have the courage to challenge and sort out your leadership difficulties. You are already proclaiming in your local paper that you are going to sort it out, but it is a question of when. That is what it is about. Here we have a political party having a prize for submitting a suggestion for what the name of the political party will be!

                                  Madam Deputy Speaker, this is a suspension of standing orders on the basis that consumer confidence is at an all-time low and that the government has been talking down the economy. That is the substantive issue, and the minister at the table should not demean the parliament by avoiding the topic.

They do not even know what they will be called.

                                               We have just heard about why it is so important that the House agrees to this motion. The government have absolutely no idea of the serious circumstances they now find themselves in, and they have absolutely no idea about how serious the consequences are for the course of action that they have chosen in talking down the Australian economy. By talking down the Australian economy, the Treasurer and the Labor Party are misleading the Australian people and they are damaging the future of Australia’s prosperity.
                                              </p>

                                               The reality—and everyone in this House knows it—is that this government inherited the strongest economy of any incoming government in the history of Australia. Labor inherited a strong economy, and it is now creating the expectation of what will happen if that economy falters.

They have no idea of the consequences for Australia’s families, and they have no idea of the consequences of talking down the Australian economy.

The seconder of the motion is moving into the substantive matters that are the subject of the motion sought unsuccessfully to be moved by the member for Wentworth. He should return to the content of the motion before the House, which is a suspension motion.

                                                        Madam Deputy Speaker, I am making the case as to why it is urgent that this House suspend standing orders. It is urgent because this government is pursuing a course of action that is damaging the interests of the Australian people. It is urgent that we suspend standing orders because there has been a collapse in consumer and business confidence. That is why this is urgent: because the government has a political strategy that is damaging the interests of the Australian people. So it is urgent that this House suspend standing orders to address the problems with the government’s approach. It is urgent that we suspend standing orders because last month’s Sensis business index revealed that support for the new government’s policies has plummeted 34 percentage points, for a net balance of negative five per cent.
