        I was fortunate enough to attend the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        of Beenleigh's 70th birthday celebrations earlier this month. It was outstanding evening, listening to some of the coverage of the history of the achievements of the Rotary Club over the past 70 yearsâ€”there are too many to name in this place today. On 3 March 1953 the Rotary Club of Beenleigh received its charter and became a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_International" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary International
        </a>
        family.
       </p>
       <p>
        I take this opportunity to acknowledge the tireless efforts and work of John Mulraney, a stalwart of the club over many years, for his terrific job of emceeing the night and going through the history of the club. More recently it's been run under the able tutelage of Janee Hong. John ensured that the Rotary Club of Beenleigh remained an active member of the community for many years leading up to today. It has involved itself in numerous projects, programs and activities. In John's words, numerous members have come and gone from Rotary, but each and every one of those members, past and present, has contributed in some way in shaping how Beenleigh Rotary is today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many community organisations across our electorates represent the wonderful values we so admire in this great country, and the Beenleigh Rotary Club is just one of those. Congratulations to all involved. I wish you every success for the next 70 years.
