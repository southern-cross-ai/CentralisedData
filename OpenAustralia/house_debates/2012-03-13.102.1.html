        , to finally open the last stage in what has been called the waterfront revitalisation project in Burnie. Burnie has reinvented itself from the 1990s, invested in itself and is now known as the place of makers. It has always had a history of manufacturing, particularly papermaking and it has revitalised itself. Through the Better Regions Program—a program totalling $176 million—the government have contributed to this revitalisation, particularly $3 million, which was used for two parts of the revitalisation process. One million dollars was spent on the Makers' Workshop, a fantastic, innovative building, which tells the story of Burnie, its surrounds and its makers' history. Two million dollars was spent to complete the physical revitalisation, the amenity-creating revitalisation, of the waterfront precinct, particularly that related to the surf life saving club and the facilities that go with it.
       </p>
       <p>
        The revitalisation project has seen the redevelopment of the Burnie surf club, which I know, Mr Deputy Speaker Adams, you have visited on a number of occasions; the rejuvenation of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Terrace" rel="nofollow">

        into a one-way street; the creation of a pedestrian-friendly precinct off North Terrace; the construction of a new tourism and visitors centre to amalgamate the Pioneer Village Museum, Creative Paper Tasmania and the existing visitor centre into an innovative attraction aimed at future tourism growth markets, particularly through the Makers' Workshop; the erection of a new seawall; the construction of decking, an events lawn, paved areas incorporating artworks, public barbeques, shelters and play equipment, which will expand the seawall area and connect the

        precinct; and the connection of the waterfront and the West Park cultural precinct, with decking towards the Makers' Workshop from the waterfront precinct.
       </p>
       <p>
        On top of the $3 million, we have also invested $4.6 million into the regional local council infrastructure project to bring together this revitalisation to support Burnie in its reinvestment in itself, its amenities and most especially its people. I was very proud to join Simon Crean in these endeavours and to congratulate the

        and the whole of that community in what is an exciting, innovative and fantastic project.
