        Twelve Ryan schools benefited yet again from very strong local representation by me as member for Ryan and, of course, by the Howard government’s commitment to education in our country. On Friday and this morning, I was pleased to contact the principals of some 12 schools in my electorate to promote the Investing in Our Schools program, which is providing over $700 million of taxpayers’ money to all kinds of wonderful and worthy projects in various schools. I was pleased to talk to Helen Kenworthy, Principal of Brookfield State School, to inform her that her school will receive over $93,000 of taxpayers’ money to contribute to improved library resources. I was delighted to speak to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Morris" rel="nofollow">
         Richard Morris
        </a>
        , the Principal of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centenary_State_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Centenary State High School
        </a>
        , to inform him that his school had received a commitment of $150,000 of taxpayers’ money. They are going to build a portable classroom. This sort of thing should be the responsibility of state governments, and I call on the Queensland state government to get its act together and show a commitment to capital works programs in the schools of Ryan, just as the Howard government is doing for the schools of Ryan from here in Canberra.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, as the federal member I have the great honour of representing the Ryan community and will continue to do that. I will continue to engage with the students and parents of Ryan schools throughout the wonderful electorate of Ryan. I say to them: never before have they had stronger representation in the Australian parliament.
