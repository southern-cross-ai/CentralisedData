        we are witnessing the devastating impact of methamphetamine or ice. Ice usage can cause psychosis, out-of-control aggression, and lead to long-term psychological issues. It has been linked to road fatalities, robberies and violent criminal acts against innocent citizens including health and law enforcement personnel.
       </p>
       <p>
        Methamphetamine and ice usage on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        has increased by 112 per cent over the past two years. This frightening statistic highlighted the need for urgent action on addressing the ice epidemic. Recently I facilitated the Central Coast Ice Summit. The Central Coast Ice Summit was attended by over 350 community members from a diverse range of backgrounds and each brought their own personal story about the impact of ice. From speaking with local health professionals and local residents, I have heard first-hand the effects caused by this despicable drug, ice. Its presence is wreaking havoc on our community. Families are being torn apart, lives are being lost and futures destroyed. I found no shortage of concern amongst my community.
       </p>
       <p>
        From my conversations with local law enforcement agencies, health professionals, community organisations and members of our community, the need to take action and address the issues stemming from ice use was identified. By working together on a local level, we had the opportunity to develop a coordinated strategic approach to begin tackling the devastating consequences associated with ice usage.
       </p>
       <p>
        Addressing the Central Coast Ice Summit were a range of front-line experts with first-hand experience of the impact of ice use. Following the ice summit, I received feedback from those who had attended and liaised further with our expert panel as to how best address the ice epidemic. From this feedback, three key recommendations were identified to assist the Central Coast in combating the ice epidemic.
       </p>
       <p>
        Firstly, rehabilitation centres are essential in breaking the cycle of ice usage. Unfortunately on the Central Coast, these essential services are in short supply. We need to look at maximising the effectiveness of current providers and direct funding to effective programs delivering proven outcomes. It is also crucial that there is a mixture of rehabilitation styles offered to accommodate the varying needs of the individuals and community. A comprehensive analysis of current rehabilitation centres on the Central Coast should be undertaken to identify what is currently working, what is not working and what gaps exist in the current system. Only then can a baseline be identified and appropriate funding and service allocation speed developed and implemented.
       </p>
       <p>
        Second is the need for a drug court on the Central Coast. Currently in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        there are only three specialised courts which deal with the issue of drug offences. Specialist drug courts require non-violent offenders to plead guilty and enter into treatment as an alternative to incarceration. The extension of the specialised court program should be extended into the Central Coast region for those deemed suitable. More discussions are needed with the New South Wales government in regard to this particular recommendation. With a 112-per cent increase in the use of methamphetamine on the Central Coast, the implementation of a specialised drug court would ensure eligible community members are referred and receive the rehabilitation help that they need.
       </p>
       <p>
        The third recommendation relates to the need for early education and intervention in schools. Students should be taught about the realities of illegal drugs, especially ice. While there is a current aware-not-scare focus on educating children from primary school level to make the correct health choices in life, thought must be given to the actuality of situations on the Central Coast where, tragically, some young children are exposed to illegal drug taking as a norm. A specific primary education campaign should be developed and implemented in all schools, especially those identified as at risk areas to begin the awareness process from an early age. Analysis needs to be completed in regards to the effectiveness of the aware-not-scare education focus against a realistic and transparent campaign regarding the drug ice and the effect on the user.
       </p>
       <p>
        Community consultation is only the start of the process to stop the scourge of this insidious drug. The complexity of the ice epidemic knows no bounds. The Central Coast submission is a small snapshot of the thoughts, ideas and suggestions of the Central Coast community. These views have formed the basis of our submission to the National Ice Task Force. I vow to continue working with my community to tackle the insidious ice epidemic.
