        HOGAN (â€”) (): The then opposition, now the government, when in opposition, were very much running on the theme of having transparency and trust in government. Nearly 12 months in, haven't we seen how deceived the Australian public have been by this new Labor government? They're starting to wake up to the fact that they were deceived by the Labor opposition, now the government, after seeing what they were saying before the election and what they're now doing after the election.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, I'll run you through a couple of examples. Let's start with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IR" rel="nofollow">
         IR
        </a>
        laws. The IR laws that they passed in the first few months of being in government were never mentioned during the campaign. I'll quote the now Treasurer, Mr Chalmers. Before the election, Mr Chalmers said that Labor's industrial relations policies had been announced and multi-employer agreements were 'not part of our policy'. Well, that changed after the election. Again, they were deceived.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now, last week, what did we see? Last week, again, we saw the deception of what was said before the election and then what happened after the election. The now Prime Minister Albanese said on 2 May 2022: 'We've said we have no intention to make any super changes.' Again, this is deception from the government. We've seen a promise of lower electricity bills broken. We've seen a promise of cheaper mortgages broken. So, again, there was one thing before the election and another after. The public is starting to work this mob out.
