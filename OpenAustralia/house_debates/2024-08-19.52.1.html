        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        is home to many veterans and their families, who have given so much for their country in often the most unimaginable of circumstances. Today, I again reaffirm my commitment to them, as I did in my first speech in this place, and I thank our veterans for their service.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each year on 18 August we pause to remember all those Australians who fought and fell on foreign soil during the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" rel="nofollow">
         Vietnam War
        </a>
        . Almost 60,000 Australians served during the 10 years of our involvement in the Vietnam War. Tragically, 523 died and more than 3,000 were wounded. Tragically still, many returned home either ill or injured, and many still today carry the scars, physical and emotional, that they gained through their time in the war.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year, I joined with Vietnam veterans at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burleigh_Heads" rel="nofollow">
         Burleigh Heads
        </a>
        to commemorate their service and show my respect. It was, again, a very moving service, led this year by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        Burleigh Heads sub-branch president, Graham Mowbray. I'd like to thank Graham and also the former president of the Burleigh Heads sub-branch, George Karsai, for their service to our nation and to our local community. To Lyn Glass, who has been secretary for about seven years now: I thank you for helping make the day a success and for your enormous contribution to the sub-branch. My thanks also go to the executive and members of the sub-branch for their service. Lest we forget.
