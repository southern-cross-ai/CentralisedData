        Mr Speaker, I make a statement to the House on indulgence concerning the death of an Australian soldier. This has been a tragic week for Australia and for the

         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        . I was deeply saddened to learn last night that an Australian soldier was killed yesterday in Afghanistan, the second to fall in a week. His loss will be deeply felt across the nation. This brave and courageous soldier died while attempting to make safe an improvised explosive device in order to protect his mates. In order to protect his mates—let’s reflect on that.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the Australian government and the Australian people, I extend my most heartfelt condolences to this brave soldier’s family, his friends and his fellow soldiers. This has been a sad week for all Australians. The loss of two proud and respected soldiers is felt by all Australians. As a result of this incident yesterday, 10 Australian soldiers have now been killed in Afghanistan fighting the fight against terrorism. Oruzgan, like the rest of Afghanistan, remains a difficult and dangerous place. Our mission in Afghanistan is important for Australia because we remain committed to fighting terrorism at its source. We must never forget those terrorists who have killed over a hundred Australians in major attacks since 2000 and found sanctuary in Afghanistan and its border regions with Pakistan.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia will not falter in our efforts to bring greater security and stability to Afghanistan. We cannot allow Afghanistan to yet again become another safe haven for terrorists who then present a threat to the security of people everywhere, including Australians at home and abroad. The implications of this would extend well beyond Afghanistan itself to our wider region and possibly to our own shores. This government and the nation will not allow this to happen. Today our nation grieves with this man’s family, and we are again reminded of the ultimate sacrifice that some are called upon to make in the service of our nation. His sacrifice and the sacrifice of those who have fallen before him will never be forgotten by this House, by this parliament, by this government or by this nation.
       </p>

         Mr Speaker, on indulgence: for the second time this week we in the opposition join with the government and all Australians as we mourn the loss of one of our finest. Overnight came the dreadful news that one of our bomb disposal experts in Afghanistan lost his life while attempting to clear a safe path for his mates. He gave his life trying to protect the lives of others. His courage and self-sacrifice will forever be remembered by us.

          The Chief
         </a>
         of the Defence Force last night paid tribute to this soldier as one of the experts in this field. Explosive ordnance disposal technicians are among the bravest of the brave. They walk straight into danger zones to clear the way of mines, roadside bombs and other suspect items that our enemies strew in our path. They keep safe their comrades in arms. They provide reassurance to the people of Afghanistan that they can go to their local market without the fear of setting off a landmine on the road and being destroyed by it. These men and women, these explosive ordnance disposal technicians, are chosen for their calm, their skill, their mental discipline and, above all, their nerves of steel. They expose themselves not only to the danger of the explosive device itself but also to direct enemy fire. They are part of a dedicated, selfless and courageous group that say to their comrades in arms: keep your head down and let me clear a safe way for you. The prayers and thoughts of the Australian people today are with this soldier’s family and friends.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is the 10th fatality in Australia’s Afghanistan campaign. It is a heavy toll for the nation to bear. It represents an incalculable sacrifice by 10 soldiers and their families and loved ones. The nation mourns their loss and honours their sacrifice but remains committed to the cause, their cause—the cause for which they gave up their lives. The freedom they have fought for is the freedom the Taliban seek to deny the people of Afghanistan. The terrorism these Australian soldiers seek to destroy in our name is the same brand of terror that we must defeat around the globe and be ever vigilant against on our home soil as well. We cannot resile from this task despite the heavy cost. We honour the fallen by recommitting to the task of liberating the people of Afghanistan and ridding the world of the scourge of terrorism.
