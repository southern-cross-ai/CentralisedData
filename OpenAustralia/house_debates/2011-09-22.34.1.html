        As I have done in previous years, last Monday I met with five Latter Day Saint young adults—Perona Ho,

        Wright—who were visiting
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        as part of the annual Latter Day Saints young leaders visit to Canberra. The young people I met raised with me their concerns about some of the critical social challenges facing people around the world, including here in Australia, and asked how they could help. They were particularly concerned about drug abuse amongst young people and talked about what they could do to assist local community drug prevention programs.

        Having often visited the Modbury
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter_Day_Saints" rel="nofollow">
         Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints
        </a>
        , having attended Latter Day Saints events and knowing many of the church leaders, I am familiar with much of the good work the Latter Day Saints church community is doing within my own local community and abroad. I therefore know of the sincere desire of the young people I met with to assist others in need and their preparedness to make their own sacrifices in order to assist others. I also commend the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for its commitment and support in preparing young people for future leadership roles and for organising the annual visits to Canberra. The young people I met with were impressive Latter Day Saints ambassadors. It was heartening to meet with emerging young future leaders who are driven by their values and sense of social justice.
