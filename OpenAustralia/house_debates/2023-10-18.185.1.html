        All of us are passing through a time on Earth, and we don't know how long that will be. When you look at the blocks of time that we have and when you take out sleep and work, and travel to and from work, we have very precious spare time. So when I look at those in my community who give that precious time as volunteers I'm so grateful to them, because it's an important asset that they have, and it's finite, but they give it in the service of others.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm grateful to the Manningham Council, who acknowledged many of the volunteers and people in our community who make it a better place to live. I'm going to read out the nominees, because often we focus on the winnersâ€”and I'll also do that, but just to be nominated is a significant thing, and I want their names to be recorded on

        of the Year was Dennis Clarke, and I know Dennis well. He volunteers so much of his time at the Doncaster

        . He's a proud Vietnam veteran, and you'll see him selling during Anzac and poppy appeals in November and April every year. I want to thank you, Dennis, for your service to our country and to our community.

        The Doreen Stoves Volunteer of the Year award went to Frank Johnston. Frank has been volunteering for Manningham organisations for over 30 years. There's a long list through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniting_Church" rel="nofollow">
         Uniting Church
        </a>
        , LinC, MannaCare, and Outback Links. But whenever I go to citizenship ceremonies, Frank, you are sitting there ready to help new citizens become part of our community, and I know many look up to you as a leader.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Sports Volunteer of the Year is Caroline Clarkson, who has devoted her energy to the committee of Doncaster Dolphins Masters Swimming Club in various roles.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Community Organisation of the Year went to LinC Manningham. This is a wonderful organisation. It provides house cleaning and social support to new migrants and women affected by domestic violence. It does so many things, including home cooked meals.
       </p>
       <p>
        The young citizen of the year went to Shin Thant 'Berry' Eain. Berry stood on the stage. I have no doubt that Berry might be in this place one day. They are a wonderful community leader. They are a student with a very bright future ahead of them. Finally, the sports volunteer award went to Caroline Clarkson. I thank all the winners.
