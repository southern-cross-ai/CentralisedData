        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Macquarie" rel="nofollow">
         Lake Macquarie
        </a>
        . Fifteen sports are offered in the targeted sports program and there are 31 external coaches. As well as the coaching provided by the excellent teachers at that school, they draw on the expertise of external coaches and 21 internal teachers and coordinators, all with those specialised sporting skills.
       </p>
       <p>
        There were 181 Hunter sports representatives in 2012: 35

        representatives in 2012 and 19 Australian representatives in 2012. There were 396 government schools competing in state knock-out competitions, and Hunter sports high had three state championship teams in 2012. A further 10 teams finished second, third and fourth, making a total of 13 of the teams at Hunter sports high finishing in the top four of the state competitions. That is an absolutely outstanding record, and it also shows the dedication of all those teachers and other people involved at the school.

        A number of Hunter Sports High School sports stars of the future were identified on the night. Kyle Schneider was a 2011-12
