        sprang to notice, first qualifying for the Pan Pac's team as a 14-year-old. Ironically, it will again be South Australia that hosts his trials comeback. This is the first time that the Australian Olympic trials have been held outside Sydney since 1992. Ian Thorpe,

        The pool's first event was the Australian Age Championships, which were held between 18 and 23 April 2011. They were an outstanding success and had more than 1,500 competitors. I was able to go to the South Australian Short Course Championships on Friday night, which were opened by the Governor. Future confirmed events include the Australian Short Course Championships from 1 to 3 July 2011. This will be the first televised event from the new swimming centre. The

        I would like to pay tribute to several people without whom this facility would not have been built.

        kept working on this vision for more than a decade and put together the submission to federal government in 2006.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Kemp" rel="nofollow">
         Rod Kemp
        </a>
        as federal minister for sport ensured that $15 million was delivered to the City of Marion in 2006 for this facility. It sat in the City of Marion's bank account for five years and by the time it paid for the project it was almost $20 million. I want to pay tribute to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Wright" rel="nofollow">
         Michael Wright
        </a>
        , who was the then South Australian sports minister. He made a commitment that if the federal government put in $15 million he would match it, and he did that. I would like to pay tribute to Alex Candetti, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Chairman" rel="nofollow">
         Executive Chairman
        </a>
        of Candetti Constructions, who demonstrated that a local builder could deliver a major project like this. All the people who were involved in the South West Indoor Aquatic Centre, a community group which sprang up more than a decade ago and started campaigning for an indoor pool in the south-western suburbs, by getting the local government, state government and federal government all involved, now have one of the best facilities in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_Cube" rel="nofollow">
         Water Cube
        </a>
        in Beijing. This is the culmination of a dream for a lot of people. It is an outstanding facility that will really do a lot for the sport of swimming at the grassroots level and at the elite level in South Australia. We look forward to hosting the Australian Olympic and Paralympic trials in 2012.
