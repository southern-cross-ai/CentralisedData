       <p>
        I would like to bring to the attention of the chamber today the chronic problem within the Shortland electorate caused by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        shortage. Yesterday it was reinforced to me yet again when one of my staff members contacted me down here and told me the story of an elderly gentleman who is very ill but cannot access a doctor within the Belmont-Swansea area. This gentleman lives alone and has to travel well outside the area to see a doctor. He is not on his own. Over the last 18 months the shortage of doctors within Shortland electorate has grown. All the doctors between Swansea and Belmont have closed their books in an area with a population of around 15,000 people. This situation may not be important to the government, but it is so important to the people in that area, particularly the elderly people—and a number of elderly people live in the area—and those people who are stuck in their homes and are unable to go and see a doctor.
       </p>
       <p>
        This crisis was also brought home to me today when my office forwarded to me today’s Newcastle
        <i>
         Herald
        </i>
        . The ‘Health crisis emerging’ article on page 7 said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Hunter hospitals are struggling to cope with growing pressure on their emergency departments, with patient numbers increasing by an average of 10 per cent in the past 12 months.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would argue that a big catalyst for this 10 per cent increase is the simple fact that there are no doctors for people to see in their local areas and the only option for people is to visit their local emergency department.
       </p>
       <p>
        On another matter, I would like to implore the government to reopen the Belmont Medicare office. Elderly people from Swansea, Belmont,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nords_Wharf" rel="nofollow">
         Nords Wharf
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_Hill_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Catherine Hill Bay
        </a>
        have to travel to Charlestown to access a Medicare office. They have a shortage of doctors, they have doctors that do not bulk-bill and then they have to travel a long way to get reimbursed for the cost of their medical expenses.
       </p>
       <p>
        On a final note, I would like to refer to the previous speaker from our side, the member for Hindmarsh, who acknowledged that today is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_No_Tobacco_Day" rel="nofollow">
         World No Tobacco Day
        </a>
        and told us that it is three years since he gave up smoking. I am going to boast a little more than that.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_September" rel="nofollow">
         In September
        </a>
        this year it will be 28 years since I gave up smoking. It was one of the best health decisions I have made in my life. I join with him in encouraging all other members of this chamber to give up smoking.
