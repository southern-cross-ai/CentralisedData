        I rise today to congratulate those in my electorate of Macarthur who received
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        citizenship awards for their outstanding contribution to our community. I would like to give special mention to my close mate Keith Maddock, President of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Lions Club
        </a>
        in Camden, who has been recognised for being instrumental in implementing an organ donor awareness program through the Lions Club of Australia. I would also like to acknowledge
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Wilton" rel="nofollow">
         Jack Wilton
        </a>
        , a worthy recipient of the Wollondilly Australia Day Citizen of the Year Award, who has an incredible record of volunteering and community service dating back to 1963, which is a great testament to Jack's commitment and compassion for the Wollondilly community. Keith and Jack have worked tirelessly for their community for many years and are incredibly deserving of their awards.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge all the other Australia Day winners in Macarthur: Brandon Cotter, Kirilly White, Josh Porteous and Team Coshi—all young students who have been recognised for the contribution to the community—and Braydon Hawes, Mark Szalajko, Janine Mladin, Gabrielle Plain and Judith Rigg for their respective achievements in sport.

        It is fantastic to see so many people from all walks of like helping others and dedicating their lives to some very important issues in Macarthur. Congratulations again to all the winners. You are what makes Macarthur a great place to live, work, play and raise a family.
