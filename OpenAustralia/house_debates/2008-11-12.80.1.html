       <p>
        I understand that in the next two sitting weeks we will have before us a number of pieces of legislation that relate to the Building Australia Fund. On 4 August 2008, I wrote to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government
        </a>
        about the urgent need for improved public transport access for residents across the northern suburbs of Perth, especially in my electorate of Cowan. One month later the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government mentioned my request here. While I thank him for highlighting my strong advocacy for my constituents, I have not as yet seen any actual written response to my original letter.
       </p>
       <p>
        I now wish to advise the House of other critical infrastructure and community projects that are very important in Cowan. With regard to roads, the following projects are very important for the people of Cowan in terms of safety, improved traffic flow rates and therefore ultimately fewer emissions. We need an overpass at the intersection of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Reid Highway
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Drive" rel="nofollow">
         Alexander Drive
        </a>
        . We also need an overpass at the intersection of Reid Highway and Malaga Drive. Also, in the future we will need an overpass at the intersection of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanneroo_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Wanneroo Road
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_Reef_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Ocean Reef Road
        </a>
        . Alexander Drive also needs to be extended north to Neaves Road from its current intersection at Gnangara Road. There is also the need for the construction of a dual carriageway along Gnangara Road for reasons of road safety. I would also like to see the construction of a dual carriageway on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hepburn_Avenue" rel="nofollow">
         Hepburn Avenue
        </a>
        from Giralt Road in Marangaroo to Reid Highway in Beechboro. The construction of a dual carriageway on Wanneroo Road from the Ashby-Sinagra area up to Flynn Drive in Carramar is also desirable from a safety perspective in the north of Cowan.
       </p>
       <p>
        In relation to public transport, and in addition to the points raised in my 4 August 2008 letter, there is also a great need for increased capacity in parking infrastructure at the train stations at Warwick, Greenwood and Whitfords. I therefore ask the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government for action in this area.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are four other areas where the local communities of Cowan would benefit from federal government support. These include the provision of funding for the Kingsway sporting complex to assist the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Wanneroo" rel="nofollow">
         City of Wanneroo
        </a>
        to implement all stages of the redevelopment. Also included is additional funding for the Woodvale stadium, a project of the Woodvale Senior High School. Unfortunately, the project now needs $21 million to achieve the desired results for the local community, local sporting groups and, of course, the high school itself. The general practitioner superclinic in Wanneroo has not made any discernible progress and the people of the suburb of Wanneroo and the nearby suburbs in Cowan wish for quick action in regards to the clinic. There is also the need for a youth drop-in centre in Ballajura.
       </p>
       <p>
        As part of my plans for a stronger and safer community, I also ask for the following support from the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government: the provision of $240,000 for 60 moveable metal speed humps; the provision of 50 moveable
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCTV" rel="nofollow">
         CCTV
        </a>
        cameras and supporting infrastructure; and support for the government of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        to allow the rapid recreation of the graffiti task force for the benefit of all Western Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also say to the minister that some of these projects were election promises—of both sides but definitely of the new government—of more than 12 months ago, yet there has been no action on any of them. Once again, I call on the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, as the federal minister responsible, to support all these proposals through funding from the Building Australia Fund.
       </p>
       <p>
        Before I conclude tonight, I would also remind the House that in the minister’s 13 May media release he outlined uses for the $20 billion fund. Those uses included projects like the national broadband network. I know that many are waiting for the grand promises of the national broadband network to be realised, particularly in the electorate of Cowan. There are still plenty of areas where the problems with pair gains and exchange issues mean that ordinary residents of Cowan and also businesses within Cowan struggle to get access to broadband.
