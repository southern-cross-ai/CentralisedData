        What a privilege it was on 11 November this year to attend commemorative services around my electorate for the centenary of Armistice. I spent the day firstly down at Huonville, at a very sombre service, talking to locals as we commemorated the loss in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
         World War I
        </a>
        of many Tasmanians and talked about the impact that had had on history and on many families in Tasmania. I then had the real privilege of unveiling a memorial at the Waverley Flora Park in my electorate. This memorial has been crafted by a local craftsman, and the memorial walk lists all the locals who served and died during World War I. For their families, the Armistice was very significant indeed. It was a very lovely service. Many locals attended, and it was interesting to hear local family members talk about the impact on their family of their ancestor going off to World War I. It was a remarkable ceremony, and I was very pleased to be part of it, through the Armistice Centenary Grants Program. I thank the

        , who organised the memorial. I thank the locals and the artists involved for creating a remarkable memorial. I particularly thank the locals and the families who were involved in the unveiling. I also want to thank the council for their application.
