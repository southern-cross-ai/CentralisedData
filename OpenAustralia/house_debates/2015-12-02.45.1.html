       <p>
        by leaveâ€”On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the committee's 10th and final report for 2015. This report deals with three projects for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Defence
        </a>
        , referred to the committee in August and September. The first project concerns facilities required to support 10 new

        </a>
        Base Amberley. The proposed works will include training system facilities such as classrooms and a flight simulator, and operational facilities including hangars, workshops and an aircraft apron. In order to construct the new facilities, some existing facilities will be removed or relocated, including the fire station, court house, transit accommodation and

        cadet buildings. The committee is satisfied that the project has merit in terms of need, scope and cost and recommends that it proceed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The next project concerns facilities to support 12 new Growler aircraft, to be operated from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF_Base_Amberley" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF Base Amberley
        </a>
        . Works will include an aircraft apron, storage and refuelling facilities, as well as a flight simulator. Upgrades to base services and infrastructure are also proposed, along with constructing a multistorey car park. Facilities to support a mobile threat training emitter system are also required at the Army Aviation Centre in Oakey, Queensland and the Delamere Air Weapons Range in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        . Due to the scale and phased approach of the project, the committee requires that Defence provide it with a status report, on completion of the design phase. The committee is satisfied that the project has merit in terms of need, scope and cost and recommends that it proceed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The final project concerns redevelopment works at Delamere Air Weapons Range. A review in 2012 identified major deficiencies in the site's boundary fences, infrastructure and roads. It also noted that existing facilities are located within weapons danger areas, thus limiting the space available for training activities. Therefore, the proposed works will include improving boundary security, upgrading infrastructure and relocating facilities to increase space for target and weapons training. The committee is, again, satisfied that the project has merit in terms of need, scope and cost and recommends that it proceed. I commend this report to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        In concluding, I note that 2015 has been an extremely busy year for the Public Works Committee. During the year, the committee has reported on 22 separate projects and tabled 10 reports and an annual report. Eleven of the projects, with a combined value of over $2.6 billion, have been for Defence involving works at various Defence bases across the country. I note that at RAAF Base Amberley we looked at three separate projects over the course of the last two years. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Brigadier Noel Beutel and Mrs Andrea Barrett from Defence's Capital Facilities and Infrastructure division for their cooperation and efforts to facilitate the work of the committee. I would also like to thank the committee secretariat and other members of the committee on behalf of the chair, Senator Dean Smith.
