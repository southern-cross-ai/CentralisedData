        Just in the spirit of the football contribution of the member for Gellibrand, can I add for this weekend's fixture on Sunday: go the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richmond_Tigers" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        As our nation embarks on commemorative events to mark the centenary of our brave Anzacs, I reflect upon those whose contributions, to this day, continue to stand as a beacon to all. One such individual in my own community was Mr Les Kennedy
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        . Les sadly passed away on 7 July aged 89. Having lived a full life and achieving more than many would in two lifetimes, Les is remembered as a man whose dedication extended well beyond expectation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Born in Ararat in 1925, Les joined the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Navy
        </a>
        in October 1942 as a 17-year-old. While Les himself was spared captivity in the prisoner of war camps, he did serve on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
         HMAS
        </a>
        <i>
         Manoora
        </i>
        . At the end of World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
         II
        </a>
        the HMAS
        <i>
         Manoora
        </i>
        and her crew were sent to Japan and to Singapore to bring home our broken boys. As a young man, Les saw the horrors of war etched on the faces of many.
       </p>
       <p>
        Discharged before his 21st birthday in 1946, he returned home, like so many, forever a changed man. Les returned to the district, married his beautiful wife Flora and then settled to raise their daughter Josephine. Always community minded, Les set about making a difference in the Ballarat community, firstly by running for local council and becoming mayor in 1966.
       </p>
       <p>
        After seven years as a councillor Les moved on to other pursuits but his brothers in arms were never far from his thoughts. As a result, Les took up the mantle and worked tirelessly towards the establishment of a unique monumentâ€”a monument which stands today as a testament to the steadfast determination in ensuring not one single prisoner of war was ever forgotten.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2004, the dream finally became a reality with the unveiling of the Australian Ex-Prisoners of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
         War Memorial
        </a>
        in Ballarat's Botanical Gardens. This impressive memorial hosts more than 35,000 Australian ex-service men and women's names who had been prisoners of war in conflicts dating back as far as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boer_War" rel="nofollow">
         Boer War
        </a>
        . Under Les's stewardship, the Ballarat memorial committee tirelessly campaigned for the development of this memorial. It has been a very important part of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POW" rel="nofollow">
         POW
        </a>
        story.
       </p>
       <p>
        The list of memberships and achievements attributed to Les is a long one. As a tireless advocate for our veterans, he also achieved so much. In 2005, Les was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Australia_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Order of Australia Medal
        </a>
        for his services to the Ballarat community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The ultimate passage of legislation in 2008 recognising the Australian Ex-Prisoners of War Memorial in Ballarat as a national memorial was news Les Kennedy and the veteran community had long waited to hear. It is now recognised as the first national memorial outside of Canberra. It is a fitting tribute to our military heroes.
       </p>
       <p>
        I very much want to say vale to you Les Kennedy. You will long be remembered in our community and beyond as a loving family man, a community leader and a driving force behind the Australian Ex-Prisoners of War Memorial. Lest we forget.
