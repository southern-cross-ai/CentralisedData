       <p>
        I wish to congratulate Mathew Harper from Maroubra Surf Life Saving Club, who was recently named the New South Wales Surf Lifesaver of the Year. I have known Matt for many years. He has been a member of Maroubra since he was a nipper. Although he's now only 24 years old, he's obtained nearly every single surf lifesaving accreditation and award, including the gold medallion.
       </p>
       <p>
        Matt doesn't just do patrols. He also volunteers for the offshore rescue boat and surf rescue radio, and he's involved in many district and training activities. Matt's an Australian champion lifesaver, a medallist, a trainer, an assessor and a coach. And as club captain of Maroubra Surf Life Saving Club he's seen a record number of patrolling members achieve their 100 per cent patrol efficiencyâ€”that's a whole season without missing one hour of patrols. His award is great recognition for his hard work and dedication to our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the eve of the surf season beginning, I'd like to also thank all of those thousands of volunteers that will don the red and yellow caps to keep us safe at the beach this season. The message is always: swim between the red and yellow flags. Congratulations to Matt. Our community is very proud of you.
