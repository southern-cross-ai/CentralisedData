        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Will the minister advise the House of the Australian government’s approach to developments in Tibet?

         I thank the honourable member for her question. The Australian government remains deeply concerned about developments in Tibet and neighbouring areas. The government greatly regrets the violence and deeply regrets the loss of life. These are significant developments, and they have been the subject of comment not just by Australia but by the international community. I reiterate the call I made on Saturday, 15 March: that Australia of course recognises China’s sovereignty over Tibet—that is not in question—but China should act with restraint in these matters and should deal with protesters peacefully and peaceably and should allow the peaceful expression of dissent. The Australian government again calls for restraint—indeed, restraint from all parties—and calls for the violence to end quickly and without further casualties.
        </p>
        <p>
         I raised the Australian government’s concerns about human rights, including human rights in Tibet, directly with the Chinese foreign minister, Mr Yang, during his visit to Australia on 5 February. Australia regularly raises these issues with China, including through its regular human rights forum dialogues—the next of which is proposed for later this year.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian government believe that China’s best interests are served by implementing policies that will foster an environment of greater respect and tolerance. We remain concerned about serious inadequacies in the protection of Tibetans’ civil and political rights. Australian officials, both in Canberra and in Beijing, have discussed these developments with Chinese officials, both in Canberra and in Beijing, in recent days. That discussion will continue. I said that not only Australia but also the international community had made public remarks. In recent days the French foreign minister, Mr Kouchner, said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We asked for restraint on the part of the Chinese authorities. We asked for human rights to be respected.
        </p>
        <p>
         The United States Secretary of State,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condoleezza_Rice" rel="nofollow">
          Condoleezza Rice

         , has called for dialogue and for all sides to refrain from violence.

         foreign minister, Mr Miliband, said that he believes there are two important messages:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         One is the need for restraint on all sides, but secondly that substantive dialogue is the only way forward. We obviously see that there are real strains there but they need to be addressed in a way that balances restraint and dialogue.
        </p>
        <p>
         I very strongly agree with the sentiment of that remark; it reflects the Australian government’s position. Members would be concerned to be assured about the welfare and safety of Australians in the area, particularly in Lhasa. My most recent advice is that some 14 Australians were in Lhasa or thereabouts. They have all been contacted by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
         </a>
         . They are all safe and arrangements are being made for some of them to exit the area. The department’s travel advice for China was updated overnight, on 17 March. It continues to advise Australians to reconsider their need to travel to Lhasa and advises Australians to exercise a high degree of caution in the rest of Tibet, particularly in areas adjoining provinces bordering Tibet, following demonstrations there. I conclude where I started: the Australian government remains deeply concerned about developments in Tibet, and I am sure that concern is reflected by all members of the House.
