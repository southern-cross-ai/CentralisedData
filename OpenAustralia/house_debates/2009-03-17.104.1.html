       <p>
        During election campaigns, good things happen and concerning things happen. We currently have a state election campaign going on in Queensland and, in the last week, there have been some terrific announcements for Townsville. I am very pleased that today the opposition announced a $10 million contribution to the Jezzine Barracks upgrade, and that will attract a further $10 million of Australian government funding. This is a terrific outcome. We have also announced $18.9 million to upgrade the Townsville Mall, and that is very welcome in our local community. Further, on the weekend, the Leader of the Opposition announced $80 million for a new subacute facility for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townsville_Hospital" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        —something that is long, long overdue.
       </p>
       <p>
        But some concerning things have been announced as well. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Premier" rel="nofollow">
         Queensland Premier
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Bligh" rel="nofollow">
         Anna Bligh
        </a>
        , as part of her jobs summit in Townsville, announced that extra jobs would be created and sustained in roadworks projects in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         North Queensland
        </a>
        . In particular, she announced the duplication of the Douglas arterial, the construction of stage 2 of the Townsville port access road and the Cardwell Range project. This has been well received. But, unfortunately, I learnt today that there is no money from the state government to go with that promise. The federal government, through its nation-building program, has provided the money for each of those projects. How much money has the state government provided? None. Queensland Main Roads Department must be beside themselves. How do they start projects with no commitment to financial support from their own state government? How do they do that? How can Anna Bligh get up in front of Townsville people and say, ‘I’m going to do these road projects and I’m going to create a whole lot of extra jobs; this will be terrific in North Queensland,’ when the promise is worth nothing? It is worth nothing because the projects cannot start without matching state government funding. This is not good enough.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some people will think that I am just being part of the state election. I am the local member. I want to see the roads built, and I am just stating the facts to the parliament. I want these roads built. I want to see the state government provide the money. I do not care whether it is the Labor Party or the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        , as long as my community gets the money. But it is not going to get it from the Labor Party. The people of Townsville ought to know that. The people of Townsville ought to mark down Anna Bligh when she is not prepared to support the north yet she can build a stadium in the south.
