        ( I stand before you today to highlight the amazing work that the countless community groups in Mackellar are doing every single day. In the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Beaches" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , we do not wait around for others to fix problems. We come together as a community and we act. That being said, the Turnbull government's message is clear: if you are putting others first, if you get together and make your community a better place, we will support you. Our Stronger Communities Program has seen many recipients of well-deserved funds. The

        dedicate countless hours and energy to one goal: to help others and strengthen their community. To support their ongoing service they have received $25,000 to fund, among other things, a station extension.

        I am proud that this government is supporting the Life Education Centre, with close to $10,000 in funding to help provide preventive drug and health education. I speak not only for myself but for the parents of the Northern Beaches in thanking you for your work.

        Living in one of the most beautiful parts of the world we are so lucky to be surrounded by water—beaches, bays and lagoons. The

        It would be remiss of me not to thank the thousands of locals, young and old, who take it upon themselves to patrol our 18 beaches every summer we can. Our surf life saving clubs not only keep our beaches safe, but are a place for the community to gather for leadership, for mentorship and, most importantly, for friendship. I am immensely proud that, under the Stronger Communities Program, we have announced close to $35,000 to upgrade the facilities of surf life saving clubs at Avalon, Collaroy and

        The Australian Outrigger Canoe Racing Association of New South Wales is a cornerstone group for the numerous paddlers in our community. They will now be able to invest in their
