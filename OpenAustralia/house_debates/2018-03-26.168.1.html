        I rise today to acknowledge the passing of a great Australian and somebody who was a selfless volunteer in the community of Bradfield. Lady Angela Carrick AO was at one stage

        , mother to Diane, Jane and Fiona and had five grandchildren and six great-grandchildren when she passed away peacefully on 2 February 2018.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lady Angela Carrick was married to Sir John Carrick, the former Liberal senator for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        in the Fraser government, who served variously as the Minister for Education, Minister for National Development and Energy and Leader of the Government in the Senate. He was one of the most distinguished figures in Australian political history in the last 80 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Carricks lived in Killara for many years, and Lady Angela Carrick was an active member of the community. She was president of the Killara women's branch of the Liberal Party and was a very, very active member of the party for many decades. Her involvement in the Girl Guides began in 1960, when her daughters joined the Brownies. She saw a need and she became a volunteer. It was her strong belief that 'girls in Guiding gain so much and receive so many opportunities to extend their knowledge and potential'. Over the years, Lady Angela Carrick held a wide range of appointments within the Girl Guides, including division commissioner, deputy state commissioner for New South Wales, assistant chief commissioner for Australia, and chief commissioner for Australia from 1983 to 1988. She was also vice-president of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_Guides_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Girl Guides Australia
        </a>
        . Her passion for Girl Guides was also reflected in the international Girl Guides community. She was a member of the Australian guide delegation to four world conferences, in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USA" rel="nofollow">
         USA
        </a>
        , in Kenya, in Singapore and in Denmark. In 1988, Lady Angela Carrick was made an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Officer_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Officer of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        for her dedicated work in Guiding.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lady Angela Carrick was a well-known and much-loved figure in my electorate of Bradfield and more broadly, including particularly in the Girl Guides movement. She made a very substantial contribution to the Girl Guides in Australia throughout her life. She also made a substantial contribution in my electorate. She was the much-loved wife of the very distinguished figure Sir John Carrick. I express my consolations to her husband, Sir John, to her daughters, Diane, Jane and Fiona, and to her extended family, and I thank her for all that she has done.
