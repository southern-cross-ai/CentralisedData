        I bring excellent news to the House. I would like to shine a light on the incredible youth talent of a young athlete in my electorate. Local track star—superstar—Riley Day, has continued her run of success. The Australian flag-bearer took silver in the girls' 100 metres before a winning surge in the final propelled the Beaudesert schoolgirl to a gold medal in the girls' 200 metres event at the

        recently in the Bahamas. Riley will now make her senior international debut at the world championships in London. What a feat! Riley Day has continued as a community member, and we could not be more proud of her for the work she is doing. We wish her the best of luck.

        Also in my electorate, I want to congratulate the recent

Judah, you followed your dreams and you are an inspiration to all young people. I look forward to following your singing success.

        Finally, congratulations to seven students and two teachers from Tamborine Mountain College who successfully completed the recent Kokoda Challenge under the most trying of conditions. I would encourage any members of this House who are looking to burn a couple of kilos that the
