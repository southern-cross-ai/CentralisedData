        The life of a politician certainly is not dull and you know you are in for a big week when you look at the calendar and an event says, 'Ann must wear Velcro.' So looking at the diary, among the village visits, school presentations, helping people with personal road blocks, emails, letters and running the media gauntlet, those words raised some degree of wariness. The event was the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCYC" rel="nofollow">

        Time4Kids at Nowra Golf Club, a community fundraiser. I have been involved in this for three years. The reason I am to wear Velcro is that I will be having tennis balls thrown at me by those who would like to pay for the privilege. It is safe to say I will do almost anything for this particular group. For the young people, many of whom are just now engaging in positive activities for the first time, the PCYC is a great catalyst.

        The Shoalhaven Police Citizens Youth Club plays an important role in our community, engaging youth in after-school sport and building a strong relationship between police and young people, using a fantastic mix of activities including boxing, fitness, archery, sports competitions and the like. The PCYC are very good friends of mine. In fact, I have even been to jail for them, not once but twice. Last year they constructed a special jail in the car park of Stocklands Nowra where, in full prison stripes, I spent time behind bars. Some people offered to pay to keep me there. I said that they needed to pay double. It is a great place to meet other community leaders from business and defence. Thank you Andrew Flint, Rebecca, Nathan and Stephen for all the work you do. Was I blessed this time? The event was postponed as gumboots would have been required, but the Velcro event is still to come.
