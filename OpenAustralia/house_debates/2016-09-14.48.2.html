       <p>
        I extend my congratulations to the member for Calare. It is with sadness that I speak after the passing of Dr Abdul Haq of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassall_Grove" rel="nofollow">
         Hassall Grove
        </a>
        . Dr Haq, a Bangladeshi, was one of the great community builders in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . He left us suddenly in late August at age 68. His passing came as a great shock to the Australian-Bangladeshi community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dr Haq was a great fundraiser for charity and people in need. He was described as a shining example of a community worker tirelessly advancing voluntary works. Through his involvement in the local community organisation Good Morning Bangladesh he joined with others to raise $150,000 for the Cancer Council of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        over 15 years. Recent events at Blacktown, Lakemba, Mascot and Campbelltown raised $22,000. In the last four years Dr Haq helped raise $150,000 for a cancer hospital in Dhaka, Bangladesh with Rotary Australia World Community Service. He ran an educational coaching school for selective and

        </a>
        students and he was involved in the establishment of the Quakers Hill Mosque.
       </p>
       <p>
        Being a kidney organ donor recipient 32 years ago, he did not let that stop him from making an enormous and lasting contribution here and overseas. He leaves an enormous legacy of community service and vital charity work that his family and friends will continue to expand upon. He leaves behind his supporting wife, Laila; his son, Ashfaqul Haq; and his daughter, Rubaiyat Haq. Thank you for your service, Dr Haq. May you rest in peace.
