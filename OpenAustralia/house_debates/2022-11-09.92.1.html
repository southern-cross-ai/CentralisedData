        My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. What consultation with the business community has the minister and his department engaged in as part of the development of the secure jobs, better pay legislation?

         I want to thank two Western Australians. I want to thank the member for Swan and I want to thank Senator Cash. Senator Cash, in an interview on Sky News with Kieran Gilbert, was asked specifically about consultation with business. She set this test for the government: 'If the government were listening, they would have consulted with the job creators in this country before they introduced the legislation.' That was the test. I thought, 'Let's just go back through and work out what consultation was done with business prior to the introduction of the bill.' Senator Cash and some of those opposite in the debate have said absolutely nothing. I guess it's a bit like the old thing with the Romans: absolutely nothingâ€”except for!
        </p>
        <p>
         There was consultation with the

           Consultation included alliances such as Migrant Women in Business, the Harmony Alliance: Migrant and Refugee Women for Change, the National Rural Women's Coalition, Woman with Disabilities Australia and the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YWCA" rel="nofollow">
            YWCA
           </a>
           Canberra.
          </p>
          <p>
           Then, for introduction, we had the committee on industrial legislation, including the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Council_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Business Council of Australia
           </a>
           , the Housing Industry Association, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Farmers_Federation" rel="nofollow">
            National Farmers Federation
           </a>
           , the Master Builders, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Industry_Group" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Industry Group
           </a>
           and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. I will acknowledge that Steve Knott from
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMMA" rel="nofollow">
            AMMA
           </a>
           was not there at that meeting, but he was invited and didn't turn up.
          </p>
          <p>
           We then had the consultation which has occurred since the introduction of the bill, which I've spoken about publicly before, including with the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCA" rel="nofollow">
            BCA
           </a>
           , Ai Group, COSBOA,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCI" rel="nofollow">
            ACCI
           </a>
           and individual employers, again, including Woolworths. We then have the process that continues with the Senate inquiry. Those opposite have been critical of the Senate inquiry process, which is more thorough than what happened for the Fair Work Amendment (Supporting Australia's Jobs and Economic Recovery) Bill 2021. It's more thorough, in fact, than any legislation, and I've got the list here: their respect at work bill; their registered organisations, ensuring integrity bill; their proper use of worker benefits bill; their casual conversion bill; their pay protection bill; their four-yearly reviews and other measures; their corrupting benefits billâ€”the list goes on. It is the most consultative process that has happened for a decade.
          </p>
          <p>
           Those opposite simply have to acknowledge, in every criticism they have, that what they did was less. So except for all the consultation that happened before introduction, all the consultation that's happened since introduction and all the consultation that will continueâ€”apart from all that, absolutely nothing.
