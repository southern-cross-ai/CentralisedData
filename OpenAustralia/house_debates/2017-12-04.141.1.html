       <p>
        We have had some very hot weather recently in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        , which has reminded everyone who lives in and around the Mitcham Hills, as I do, that it is now bushfire season. Tonight I want to acknowledge the incredible
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFS" rel="nofollow">
         CFS
        </a>
        volunteers in my electorate and the selfless work these hardworking volunteers do to keep us safe over summer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our community is looked after by the Sturt CFS Group, led by Group Officer Dale Thompson and Deputy Group Officer David Simms. I thank David and Dale for being so active and willing to provide information to our community throughout the year, including briefings for me, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Mitcham" rel="nofollow">
         City of Mitcham
        </a>
        and state members of parliament. Dale and David work with a large group of volunteers. The Sturt CFS Group is made up of five individual brigades, 12 fire appliances and approximately 108 volunteer firefighters. Brigades within the group respond to around 260 emergency incidents each year. I would like to recognise the work of Captain Darren Cock and the Blackwood CFS; Captain Mark Brooks and the Belair CFS; Captain Neil Gloyn and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Hills" rel="nofollow">
         Eden Hills
        </a>
        CFS; Captain Rowan Clark and the Coromandel Valley CFS; and Captain Brian Sims and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_Gardens" rel="nofollow">
         Cherry Gardens
        </a>
        CFS. We are all reliant on them for protection and assistance over summer.
       </p>
       <p>
        The mixture of suburban housing and native vegetation within the Sturt group's region represents an area that is among the highest risk of bushfire in South Australia. That's why it is so important for the entire community to support the work that the CFS does for us. The CFS relies on community donations and backing to secure essential equipment and infrastructure, provide training services, increase public awareness and support firefighters and their families. Every little bit of financial assistance helps, and I was delighted to secure an election commitment to provide solar panels for brigades in Blackwood, Belair and Eden Hills so that they can reduce their power bills and instead put money raised towards vital equipment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Helping raise funds is why the mayor of Mitcham, Glenn Spear, local Liberal representatives Sam Duluk and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Murray" rel="nofollow">
         Steve Murray
        </a>
        and I held our second annual fundraising barbecue for the CFS on 25 November. I was pleased that we again raised over $1,000 for our local group and volunteers. Thanks to Blackwood Coles and the Freemason lodges of Blackwood and Sir Samuel Way, who made generous contributions on the day. So many clubs in our community give to the CFS—such as the Blackwood Rotary Club, who I know do a lot for the Eden Hills CFS brigade, for example. Seeing these groups and the public come together to support the CFS shows us the immense respect my community has for these volunteers.
       </p>
       <p>
        But the barbecue wasn't just a fundraiser. The attendance of CFS volunteers provided a chance for local residents to talk to the CFS about fire safety—which brings me to my most important point. Each and every household in Boothby in a high fire danger area needs to have a bushfire plan. They need to know exactly what they will do on high fire danger days. They need to know what they will do in the event of an actual fire, which we pray never occurs. Each and every household needs to prepare, act and survive. There's nothing more important than having a bushfire plan in place and I will continue to remind my residents of this in the bushfire season ahead.
       </p>
       <p>
        Information is easy to find. The CFS has a great website, cfs.sa.gov.au, and it produces a lot printed guides and materials. Mitcham council also provides excellent information and advice. I thank Mayor Glenn Spear and the council staff for all they do in bushfire prevention and education. I encourage all residents to get a copy of South Australia's
        <i>
         Your Guide to Bushfire Safety
        </i>
        booklet. And I urge residents in Boothby and in particular suburbs like Mitcham,

        </a>
        to make sure they have their bushfire survival plan in place now. Being bushfire ready could save lives. Each and every household needs to prepare, act and survive. When each and every household does their part to prepare we make it easier for our wonderful CFS volunteers to do their job in keeping us safe.
       </p>
       <p>
        In closing, I again thank the Sturt CFS Group, led by Group Officer Dale Thomson and Deputy Group Officer David Sims, and all the CFS brigades in and around Boothby and the Mitcham Hills—from Belair, Blackwood and Eden Hills, Coromandel Valley and Cherry Gardens—for the incredible work they do for our community over summer and in keeping us all safe. Thank you.
