       <p>
        Last Friday, I had the enormous honour of attending a ceremony marking the transfer of land from Boral back to the traditional owners, the Wathaurong people. It was an incredibly moving and humbling experience that marked the first time land has been returned to the Wathaurong. This parcel of land, almost four hectares, has a significant role in the lives of the Wathaurong.
       </p>
       <p>
        Local Wathaurong leader Corrina Eccles brought a tear to everyone's eye when she spoke with such passion about the land's torrid history. It was heartbreaking to hear. In 1861, the land was reserved for what was described as 'Aboriginal purposes'. Its location in modern-day
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waurn_Ponds" rel="nofollow">
         Waurn Ponds
        </a>
        was deliberately chosen to make it difficult for the Wathaurong to visit their heartland in Geelong. Unsurprisingly, the stories and accounts of the Aboriginal people who lived there are heartbreaking. For many, the land was a place of despair and anguish. The legal title for the 3.6 hectare property will now be transferred back to the Wadawurrung Traditional Owners Aboriginal Corporation.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's not every day that we get the opportunity to help heal the past. On Saturday night, I was at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midnight_Oil" rel="nofollow">
         Midnight Oil
        </a>
        concert only kilometres from where the parcel of land is located. Wathaurong man Barry Gilson addressed the 13,000-strong crowd about the land's history. In his welcome to country he described how colonists had enslaved and murdered his ancestors. 'This is a true story up around here,' he said, 'but things are slowly changing.' There is still a long way to go on Australia's reconciliation journey. We cannot pretend that handing back one parcel of land is enough to make up for centuries of injustice. But we must acknowledge that this is a significant act, a worthy first step in recognising the Wathaurong people as the original custodians of the land, and that this land was never ceded. I congratulate Boral on this groundbreaking gesture. I hope this decision inspires other companies to do the sameâ€”to move towards reconciliation and transfer land back to the traditional custodians. As a nation, we can heal only by recognising our past and the hurt and sacrifices of our

        people.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Monday I stood in this place and spoke about the potential renaming of my electorate as Tucker, after Aboriginal activist
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Margaret_Tucker" rel="nofollow">
         Margaret Tucker
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Honourable members: Hear, hear!
       </p>
       <p>
        I wholeheartedly welcome the change. Of the 151 electorates in this place, only seven are named after First Nations leaders. I'm proud that the renaming of Corangamite, my electorate, will be a shining beacon, hopefully one of many electorate name changes to honour women and our Indigenous leaders. Only through such recognition will we move forward on a voice in the Constitution, treaty and makarrata.
