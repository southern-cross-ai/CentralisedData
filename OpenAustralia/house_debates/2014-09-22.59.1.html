        Townsville's North Queensland Cowboys lost on Friday night. Enough said!

        is a professional sport and players go where the money is. They have their contracts cancelled through injury or poor form, or they can just be collateral damage. They say that footballers cannot get too close to a community, because they can be gone next week, but that cannot stop us in the community really loving some of these players.

        The image I will keep of him though is that of a doting father and husband. This man who has captained Fiji and played for the Broncos, St George and the Cowboys, frames everything he does around his family. He spoke of the Townsville fires trophy night last year. He said he not only loved the game of basketball but also was proud to take his children to see strong, talented, intelligent female role models to whom his daughter could aspire. I do not claim to know him well at all, but I am a huge fan of the way he plays the game and the way he carries himself. I speak on behalf of a great city and a grateful Rugby League community when I say that he will be genuinely missed. I wish him and his family all the very best for the future.
