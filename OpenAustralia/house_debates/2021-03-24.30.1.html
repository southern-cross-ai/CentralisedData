       <p>
        I want to say a very special thank you to a member of my team who is retiring next Tuesday. John Frederick Dyett is now 75 years young and has been an electorate officer serving the constituents of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_Ports" rel="nofollow">
         Melbourne Ports
        </a>
        and Macnamara for more than 10 years. He returned to public life after a career as a lawyer and living in New York City, spending the last decade doing what he loves most: serving the people and serving the Labor cause.
       </p>
       <p>
        He worked for my predecessor,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Danby" rel="nofollow">
         Michael Danby
        </a>
        , and has helped countless constituents with all kinds of matters, from visa and immigration issues to Centrelink and issues with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        , and so many more. He has also been a friend and has given an ear not just to his colleagues but to many of the hundreds and thousands of locals who have dropped into the office or given him a call. When John takes up the case, he gives it absolutely everything he's got to try to help the person before him, because John has given his time to people and he always does. He always gives his time, and that's why we have so much time for him.
       </p>
       <p>
        He has been a devoted member, volunteer and true believer in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        over the last five decades, and still loves attending the Elwood branch meetings. John has overcome some pretty serious health challenges in recent years, but he's never once wanted to miss a day of work; he loves doing it. On behalf of the people of Melbourne Ports, Macnamara, my predecessor, Michael Danby, and the Australian Labor Party to my friend John Dyett: thanks for all your work, mate.
