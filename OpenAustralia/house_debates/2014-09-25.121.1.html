        Every one of these students should be very proud of their achievements. I also congratulate the schools, their principals and their staff, who work so very hard in order to ensure that their students receive the very best education. I would also like to congratulate the

        , who have had students—though not constituents of Higgins—who received Australian Student Prizes. These schools, of course, are leading schools in my electorate of Higgins. I also acknowledge the families and friends of these students, whose patience and understanding helped them achieve their best. To this end I have invited each of the students, their families and their principals to a morning tea in my electorate office, in order to personally congratulate them on their exceptional achievements.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am firmly of the belief that the recognition of the pursuit of excellence is vital, as it illustrates the importance of endeavour and the transformative power of education and inspires all of us to achieve the very best in our chosen pursuits in life. I remember the impact that it had on me when I was a student and I received my Australian Student Prize. I know it might be bit of a shock to some of the parents out there, but they too could find that those students who received that prize might find themselves in the national parliament of Australia.
