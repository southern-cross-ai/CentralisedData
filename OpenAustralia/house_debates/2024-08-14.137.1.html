        I recently visited Goodstart Canning Vale in my electorate of Tangney. The team of early learning professionals there strive to provide the best care for every child. This early childhood education and care setting also reflects the diversity of Tangney. Nineteen different languages are spoken at the centre, and the educators work hard to promote cultural awareness and understanding. In speaking some of the many languages of Tangney all under one roof, the educators promote multiculturalism and harmony daily. The team of 28 early childhood educators have formed relationships with local businesses and community organisations to ensure that they are inclusive to all families—for example, using a local butcher to provide halal meals. They are welcoming to all families, and they shape and change lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        Early childhood educators have one of the most important jobs. The Albanese Labor government's 15 per cent pay rise for early childhood educators will make a real difference to all the highly skilled professionals who care for, nurture and educate our youngest Australians. This wage increase will phase in over two years—a 10 per cent increase from December 2024 and a further five per cent increase from December 2025. A typical ECEC educator who is paid at award rate will receive a pay rise of at least $103 per week, and it will increase to $155 per week in 2025.
       </p>
       <p>
        At Goodstart Canning Vale, I saw the relationship created between the educators and every child, and I saw the trust between the families and the educators. This relationship can be seen in early childhood settings across all of Tangney. I see it as a grandfather. My grandson has grown up so much since he started attending early childhood education and care. He was only one year old then. Now he is 1½ years old. He has become more cheerful, more confident, more active and, of course, more cheeky! As a proud grandfather, I am impressed by everything he has learned since he started his early childhood education. This is in large part due to all the hard work all the incredible educators have done.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Albanese Labor government's cheaper childcare policies have helped many families in Tangney with increased subsidies. These changes have made early childhood education and care more affordable, and now this long-deserved wage increase will help all the early childhood educators in the nation. Thank you to all the early childhood educators at Goodstart Canning Vale for showing me the important work that you do.
