       <p>
        Last week I was at the Woodleigh School's Minimbah campus, where the incredibly impressive Millie, Tilly and Mia interviewed me for a podcast. One of the questions they asked me on that podcast is: what is leadership to you? I talked about the ability to listen, understand, motivate, make hard decisions and model behaviour and standards you ask others to uphold. What I didn't talk about but has occurred to me I should have said is that leadership involves an ability to give of yourself for the benefit of others. That is a quality that two Dunkley residents, who received King's Birthday honours this week, show in abundance. Neil Kinsey and Jackie Galloway give of themselves for the benefit of others because they know it's the right thing to do.
       </p>
       <p>
        Neil is the long-serving president of the committee of management of the Langwarrin Community Centre and one of the fine voices of the Australian Welsh Male Choir. Jackie is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of the Peninsula Community Legal Centre and is on the board of Community Support Frankston, and, quite frankly, there isn't a not-for-profit or social welfare group that hasn't benefited from her assistance. It's not only the leadership shown in places like parliament that matters; sometimes it's the leadership in the communities that really matters.
