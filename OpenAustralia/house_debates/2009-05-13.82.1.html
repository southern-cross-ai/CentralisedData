       <p>
        There are three amendments to the Tax Laws Amendment (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Business" rel="nofollow">
         Small Business
        </a>
        and General Business Tax Break) Bill 2009. Amendment (2) provides a major boost for small businesses by increasing the bonus deduction to 50 per cent, as announced by the Treasurer last night. Small businesses will now be able to claim a bonus tax deduction of 50 per cent, up from 30 per cent previously, of the cost of eligible assets acquired between 13 December 2008 and 31 December 2009 and installed by 31 December 2010. I think most honourable members would acknowledge that small businesses are the backbone of the economy, employing millions of Australians, but many have faced some tough times during this global recession. The increased tax break provides small businesses with an even greater incentive to invest in new capital items such as computer hardware and business vehicles and to make capital improvements to existing machinery and equipment. The remaining amendments are technical in nature. In its current form, the bill precludes a taxpayer from claiming the 30 per cent deduction on a batch or set of eligible assets. A similar issue arises when an asset is jointly held by multiple taxpayers. This was not the intended outcome.
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendment (2) also ensures that taxpayers can claim a deduction at the rate intended. Amendment (1) ensures that taxpayers are not precluded from a tax break merely because they have a debt forgiven or replace an asset that was subject to an involuntary disposal, even if the cost of the asset is reduced to zero for depreciation purposes. Amendments (3) and (4) clarify the meaning of the term ‘start to construct’ in the bill for taxpayers who construct their own assets.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a very important bill. It is an important measure not only to assist small business but also to stimulate investment in the economy. I commend the amendments to the House.
