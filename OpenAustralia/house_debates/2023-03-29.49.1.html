       <p>
        As all my colleagues in this House would well know, one of the great joys of going around our electorates is visiting our local sporting clubs. I've got 50-odd great sporting clubs right across the electorate of Forde. As we move from the summer sports of cricket and baseball, we move into the winter sports of football. In the past couple of weeks I've had the pleasure of attending the

        season launch and seeing some of our great football clubs, like Logan Lightning and the Bethania Rams, start their season. Logan Lightning have had a lightning start to the season and sit on top of the table after four rounds.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was also great to catch up recently with my sporting club presidents at some drinks I held for them in my office to hear the challenges that they're seeing across their various clubs, whether it be netball, baseball, our local motocross club or our local equestrian club. All of these clubs have different challenges but provide a great contribution to our community. I see the Treasurer has wandered into the House. We both attended the Souths Logan Magpies season launch. It was a great event, and he was presented with the No. 1 jersey, so congratulations to the Treasurer!

        say all of the clubs, to the presidents, to their committees, to all the volunteers that make these clubs operate every year: congratulations and have a wonderful season.
