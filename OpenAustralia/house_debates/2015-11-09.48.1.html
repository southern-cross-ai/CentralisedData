       <p>
        Vale, Maestro Joeâ€”Joseph D'Onofrio, a great friend, and a great community member, has sadly succumbed to motor neurone disease. I want to pay my respects to him and pass on my deep sadness to his family and the extended community, particularly the fencing community. You do not hear too much about fencing in this country, but Joseph was a passionate fencer. He fenced for over 64 years, and he brought that passion for fencing from Italy to Australia. He set up the Fioretto Fencing Club in my electorate. He worked tirelessly to promote the sport. Indeed, when his home club was closed because it was no longer safe to operate in, he worked tirelessly to find a new home, in my area, within the eastern suburbs, so kids could still learn this sport and have the passion he did.
       </p>
       <p>
        Inspirational quotes have been flooding in about this amazing man who gave to this sport and our community so much over many years. He was a justice of the peace for in excess of 35 years. He was passionate about the migrant community and helped many migrants to successfully settle into our community. He was certainly passionate about his family. He was dedicated to his wife and daughters and grandchildren. He was an exceptional human being. He was honoured, in that role, with the Order of Australia, and as a senior Victorian. But it was his tireless dedication to a sport, that most people would not consider as a sport, was just outstanding. I will miss him greatly, most particularly his outstanding moustache.
