       <p>
        My question is again to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. I refer the minister to last night’s statement by a spokeswoman for the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, Mr Truss, that the 2004 confidential report from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_Export_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         Wheat Export Authority
        </a>
        to Mr Truss contained details of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWB" rel="nofollow">
         AWB
        </a>
        payments of transport fees to a Jordanian trucking company. Given this statement, why did the minister tell the House on 8 December last year in response to a question about freight costs paid by AWB in Iraq:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        ... those confidential reports to the minister for agriculture ... do not contain the sort of information implied in the honourable member’s question.
       </p>
       <p>
        Minister, why did you mislead the House?

         I thank the honourable member for his question. I did not mislead the House. I believe the answer to his question lies in the letter from the Chairman of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WEA" rel="nofollow">
          WEA
         </a>
         to Senator Heffernan, as Chairman of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Estimates Committee, which is dated 7 February:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         When questioned specifically by WEA staff over the provision of “kickbacks” in Iraq
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWB" rel="nofollow">
          AWB
         </a>
         (I) denied any wrong. AWB(I) staff pointed to the unique circumstances of Iraq sales (eg: that sales were to include delivery of wheat over land and payment is not made until the wheat is delivered) to explain why it was necessary to pay a Jordanian trucking company and why prices may appear above global benchmarks.

          Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. It goes to relevance. The question referred to his quote, which said that those confidential reports ‘do not contain the sort of information implied in the honourable member’s question’. That was about transport fees.

              , they look at land transport costs to free on board, because they are costs borne by wheat growers—in other words, they are a cost to the national pool. But in the normal course of events they do not look at land transport costs offshore because of the assurances they have received in the past that they are borne by the customer and therefore are not a draw on the national pool and are not within their charter. But they made an exception. To their full credit, they made an exception to this practice and to these responsibilities when in August 2004, on the basis of public newspaper reports, they made inquiries about land transport costs in the event that those costs were being borne by wheat growers. So it is a very simple thing. Let us talk about last night. Last night this was the smoking gun. This morning, the Leader of the Opposition says there is no smoking gun.

                    The corruption would be continuing undiscovered if the Labor Party had had its way. Let me just make that point. It was the work of the coalition provisional authority, it was the work that was done to expose what

                    ’s regime had been doing through access to the documents of that regime and interviews with people in that regime that made it possible to establish the corruption in the oil for food program. There was the establishment of the Volcker committee and its report and ultimately the establishment in this country of the Cole commission.

                       The second point is that the opposition—the Leader of the Opposition in particular—has accused the Prime Minister, ministers, officials of various government departments and diplomats in the

                             What is interesting is that, as we come to the end of this parliamentary week, no evidence has been produced at all to support these extraordinary, extremist and hyperbolic assertions. Last week the Leader of the Opposition said to the

                                My question is to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. We will get back to uncovering this scandal. I refer to the statement from the minister’s office last night that the 2004 confidential report from the
                                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_Export_Authority" rel="nofollow">

                                to him contained details of

                                payments of transport fees to a Jordanian trucking company. I also refer to the fact that the minister’s statement contradicts the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry’s answer to the House on 8 December last year:
                               </p>
                               <p class="italic">
                                ... those confidential reports to the minister for agriculture ... do not contain the sort of information implied in the honourable member’s question.
                               </p>
                               <p>
                                Why didn’t the minister take steps under the ministerial code of conduct to correct this mislead as soon as possible? Why did he turn a blind eye?

                                 There is absolutely no difference between the comments that have been made by me and the comments made by the new minister for agriculture. What the minister for agriculture has clearly pointed out is that the
                                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheat_Export_Authority" rel="nofollow">

                                 exercised its legislative responsibility to investigate allegations that were in the public domain. It reported on these matters in the confidential report to the minister, which I received in October 2004. Whilst the report is confidential, Mr Besley, the chairman of the authority, has said a couple of things about what was in that report. The first the minister for agriculture commented about a couple of minutes ago in his letter to Senator Heffernan in which he made the comment and referred to his statements in front of the Senate estimates committee that nothing untoward emerged from that check. To quote from Mr Besley, in the newspaper today, he said:
                                </p>
                                <p class="italic">
                                 The information given to the minister—
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                 and in this instance it was me—
                                </p>
                                <p class="italic">
                                 contained no evidence of wrongdoing. Instead, the minister was told the

                                 had given

                                 a “clean bill of health”.

                                 So the advice given by the WEA to the minister was that the AWB had a clean bill of health on these issues. I believe the response that was made at that time was entirely appropriate. It dealt with the complaints, it dealt with the allegations and advised the minister that the AWB had a clean bill of health.
