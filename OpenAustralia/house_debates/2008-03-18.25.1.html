             Work Choices

            laws that he supports operate. Let me explain to him the way those laws operate. An employer can make a greenfields collective agreement and just impose it on people unilaterally. That can happen under the laws that he supports. An employer can present an employee with a take-it-or-leave-it

            which strips away basic award conditions for no compensation or no proper compensation. They are the laws that he supports. People can make collective agreements under Work Choices and, because the benchmark for those collective agreements is the so-called flawed fairness test, which the member for

                 . For a collective agreement under Work Choices, the benchmark is the so-called ‘protected’ award conditions, which means that things can be lost without any proper compensation. I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that, if she is aware of anyone who has a complaint about a collective agreement-making process, they should refer that matter to the Workplace Ombudsman. But I also say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition that what they will find when they go to the Workplace Ombudsman is that the Workplace Ombudsman will say to them, ‘All I can do is apply the laws’—and the laws allow working families to be ripped off. The Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">

                   <p>
                    Let me just say again that the
                    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_Choices" rel="nofollow">
                     Work Choices
                    </a>
                    laws that were supported by the Liberal Party—the party of Work Choices—allowed people to be ripped off. In respect of the matters that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has raised in her question, can I just say that the opposition have not got one fact right today. I am not accepting that the so-called facts in her question are anywhere near accurate, because everything they have said today has been wrong. But I would say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and to people in the Australian community generally that, if they do have a complaint about a collective agreement-making process, they should raise that matter with the Workplace Ombudsman. If the Workplace Ombudsman says to them, ‘I’m really sorry, but you can be ripped off because of Work Choices,’ they should ring the Leader of the Opposition or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition about it.
