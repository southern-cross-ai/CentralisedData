       <p>
        Earlier today—mere hours ago—back in my electorate of Spence, one of my staff was assaulted in a disturbing attack not too far from my office. Fortunately, that member of my staff is fine despite having taken multiple blows to the head and having been threatened with a knife. Nevertheless, such behaviour is not isolated in my community. I constantly read reports of crime happening in the north, and it's simply not good enough. My community deserves to feel safe. No-one in the north or anywhere else should have to worry about their safety simply because they live in our local area, and yet they do. Just off the top of my head, there have been two shootings reported in my electorate in the past four days. Further still, a molotov attack was reported in Craigmore last week.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, when perpetrators of these offences are caught and convicted, they tend to remain in our community without rehabilitation or reprimand. For example, a man in Direk with a history of violent crime was recently convicted of possessing multiple explosives at his residence. He has since been returned to his home after receiving a suspended sentence, without any rehabilitation or punishment for his actions.
       </p>
       <p>
        I call on our state government, our Attorney-General and our police minister to work with the courts of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and find ways to ensure the safety of my community. Currently, things are not simply not good enough up in the north.
