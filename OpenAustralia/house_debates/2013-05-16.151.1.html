        I rise today to talk about a visit to Kalgoorlie recently by the Australian Ausdrill Hockeyroos and Jillaroos side. They visited Kalgoorlie last Thursday, Friday and Saturday. I would like to congratulate the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Goldfields" rel="nofollow">
         Eastern Goldfields
        </a>
        Hockey Association, particularly Andrew Hoare as president of the association, for the outstanding job they did in getting the Hockeyroos to Kalgoorlie-Boulder and also for the great event they put on when the players were there. They also played a game against a Goldfields all-star team made up of men and women. My congratulation to Mel Woods, who was the goalie. Although the Hockeyroos won 8-0, as you would expect, our Goldfields side put up an outstanding fight against them. Mel Woods, our goalie, was adjudged best on field for the Goldfields side, which was no mean feat; considering the Hockeyroos kept firing shot after shot, it was an outstanding effort from her. Young Nicolas Lavery, an outstanding Goldfields player, was another prominent player for us. Congratulations to Holly Creedan, a 14-year-old girl who made the side, and also to Sarah Zapelli, who was the oldest memberâ€”and I will not declare Sarah's age in the chamber!
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to sincerely thank Ausdrill for facilitating the trip. Peter Chisholm and Brad Loane from Ausdrill went all out in ensuring that it was a great visit. The Hockeyroos and Jillaroos held school clinics, umpiring clinics, hockey clinics, and clinics for general fitness and wellbeing. I had the pleasure of attending a civic reception put on by the City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder on Thursday night where we got to meet all the girls and the support staff. It was a particular pleasure to meet a young lady called Tennille Attard, who has endured three knee reconstructions and is still an integral member of the Australian Hockeyroos side. It is testament not only to her resilience but to the resilience of the Hockeyroos. The Hockeyroos are arguably one of Australia's most outstanding sporting teams. They are a credit to Australia, they are a credit to their sport and they are a credit to women.
       </p>

        On the Friday night of the game, over 1,000 people attended the Eastern Goldfields hockey stadium. Entry was by a gold coin donation to the Breast Cancer Foundation. I have got no idea what they raised but it was an outstanding evening. As I said, the score was 8-0 but our Goldfields side put in an outstanding effort.
       </p>
       <p>
        In closing, I once again congratulate Andrew Hoare and his committee from the Eastern Goldfields Hockey Association for the outstanding event and the wonderful opportunity for the Goldfields people to see elite sport at its very best. I sincerely thank the Australian Ausdrill Hockeyroos.
