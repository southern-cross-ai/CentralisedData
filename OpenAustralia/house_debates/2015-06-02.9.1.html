        Recently I had the pleasure of officially opening the Better Buddies Bench at Brook Avenue Public School. I am a strong supporter of the Better Buddies program and am pleased to be able support this great initiative within Dobell schools. Some children's first year of school can be daunting and difficult. Making friends is not always easy, and being away from the home environment can be challenging. Without adequate support, this anxiety can lead to school becoming a negative element of a child's life and result in long-term personal, educational and social issues. Better Buddies helps students entering the first year of primary school to feel safe, valued and connected to the school community. The program provides students with a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Bear" rel="nofollow">
         Buddy Bear
        </a>
        , which is a little purple friend with whom they can share stories and secrets. Now, with a Better Buddies bench, made possible thanks to a donation from Mr Paul Beech, the manager of Cresthaven IGA, students have somewhere to sit and talk with their Buddy Bears. It was rewarding to see children flock to the bench, join with their Buddy Bears and feel at ease within their school community.
       </p>

        I would like to especially thank Principal Kerry Wellham and Instructional Leader Karen Evans for their support of this great program and their commitment to our local students. Over the next few months, we would like to see the Better Buddies program rolled out through more schools, especially in particular areas of Dobell where there are a lot of children who come from troubled backgrounds. The Buddy Bear has proven very successful in helping these young children fit into school and enjoy their school years.
