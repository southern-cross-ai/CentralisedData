       <p>
        Last Thursday I held a community meeting at Lynwood Village Shopping Centre to discuss security concerns that have been raised with my office by businesses and residents.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the last few weeks concerned locals told me about problems at the centre, including persistent antisocial behaviour during the day and trouble at night. One business owner, who told me his staff had been abused, said many of his shoppers routinely ask to be escorted back to their cars due to the antisocial behaviour. After surveying the community it was clear that many others felt this way, with well over 200 responses expressing concerns in my community survey so far.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lynwood Village is a very important local shopping centre for the residents of Lynwood and Ferndale. The natural barrier of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canning_River" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the distance from Carousel shopping centre means that it is difficult for local residents to get to other shopping centres. As such, Lynwood Village is highly valued by the local community and it is therefore important both for businesses and residents that any issues of security be addressed. There was a good turn-out at the community meeting, and I would like to thank centre manager Guy Tristram, from Mair and Co., for addressing those who attended. Residents were able to state their concerns, and business owners had the opportunity to share theirs.

        security patrols also attended to show their support, and within two minutes they were dealing with an issue outside the liquor store. I am pleased to say that the shopping centre managers announced at the meeting they will be installing security guards and looking at

        </a>
        . The police and City of Canning patrols have pledged to step up patrols as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank everyone who attended, and I am sure the shopping centre will now become a safe environment for the community.
