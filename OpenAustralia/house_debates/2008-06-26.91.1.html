       <p>
        Can there be a more worthwhile use of federal funding than looking after our children? I would argue not, and it is for this reason that I would like to take this opportunity to inform the House of a recent funding commitment made by this government to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Giles" rel="nofollow">
         St Giles
        </a>
        Society in my electorate of Bass. I value enormously, and the Rudd government values enormously, the role which the St Giles Society plays in northern Tasmania. When I first became aware that funding for its speech pathology services and family support services was due to expire at the end of this month, I took it upon myself to secure ongoing funding for the wonderful work to continue. These services are quite simply vital. That is why I was very pleased that, earlier this week, the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs informed me and the St Giles Society that $341,932 had been secured for the 2008-09 financial year. That money will be provided under the Vital Early Years and Family Support program and will be used to provide speech pathology services to children, from birth to five years of age, who are demonstrating, or are at risk of developing, specific difficulties in receptive and expressive language and auditory processing.
       </p>
       <p>
        The program also provides for a family support coordinator to assist parents in their day-to-day role and provides support and counselling around broader issues. As a parent myself, I understand that the importance of this support cannot be overstated. There is a critical link in services liaising with various organisations to achieve the best outcomes for children and their families. The program also provides a psychologist to help parents in their day-to-day role and provides behavioural management strategies and support.

        I was fortunate enough earlier this month to be taken on a tour of the St Giles facility in Launceston by the societyâ€™s chief executive, Michael Sertori. The work which the society does is absolutely amazing. The commitment of the staff there is selfless and complete, and I would like to take this opportunity to make it quite clear how deeply the Rudd government values the role that the St Giles Society plays in Bass. I personally will continue to work hard on behalf of the people of Bass to ensure that organisations like the St Giles Society can continue to make their incredible contribution to children and their families throughout northern Tasmania. Community groups play an incredibly important role in our local communities, and I will continue to passionately represent the interests of the people of Bass in protecting and furthering the good work of organisations like the St Giles Society.
