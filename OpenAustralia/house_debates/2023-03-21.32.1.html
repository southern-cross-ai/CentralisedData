        We celebrate 10 months of the Labor government today, and, as a new MP, here are the top 10 issues that I raised in my first speech last year. I spoke of integrity and standards of behaviour, and we have established the National Anti-Corruption Commission Act. I spoke of the Uluru Statement from the Heart, and this week we will see proposed legislation on a referendum for a Voice to Parliament debated in the parliament, and a referendum will be held this year. I spoke of the criminalisation of people receiving legitimate government benefits, and the stories coming to light through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Commission
        </a>
        into the Robodebt Scheme are an indictment of the former government. I spoke of the environment and climate change, and I'm proud to be passing legislation and taking actions to meet targets with the safeguard mechanism. I spoke of veterans, and finally they can access the services and support that they deserve and need through a simple legal framework. I spoke of the needs of seniors, and this is the government that is implementing the recommendations of the aged-care royal commissionâ€”no more secret files.
       </p>
       <p>
        I spoke of supporting green economic growth, and, with programs like the National Reconstruction Fund, our manufacturing and industry sector will be booming. I spoke of housing, and the government has introduced bold measures like the National Housing Accord and the $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund to address our housing shortfall Moreover, I spoke of stability and seriousness, and we now have a stable government led by a respected prime minister and we are once again a serious country that is taken seriously. With agreements like AUKUS, we are now a country that our region turns to help with serious problems, creating stability in our region.
