        I want to pay tribute to my constituent Con Mavraganis, who recently passed away. Con was a stalwart of the local Greek community in Broadmeadows, and he made a significant contribution to our local community throughout his entire life. His passing has been very deeply felt by all who knew him.
       </p>
       <p>
        Con was only 16 when he migrated to Australia from Manna, in Corinth. Initially settling in Richmond, he then moved to Broadmeadows in the early seventies. It was during this time that he got together with other locals to become one of the founding members of the Greek Community of Broadmeadows. He would then go on to dedicate the rest of his life to building the community's infrastructure and to serving the community. Con was instrumental in the negotiations that led to attaining land on Camp Road and the building that then became the home of the Greek community's education, sporting, cultural and recreational life. From a small portable to a fully functioning reception centre, the premises adjacent to the Jack Roper Reserve in Broadmeadows would be where the local Greek community promoted is cultural heritage and educational heritage, including Greek language classes, dance classes and a very successful soccer team. Con's dedication was such that he would often offer his garage to the young kids who wanted to do Greek dancing well before they acquired their hall. He was always on call and always available. He genuinely loved Australia for the life it gave him, his family and his community. He loved his Greek heritage and promoted it at all opportunities through his work at the Greek Community of Broadmeadows and the PanCorinthian Association of Melbourne.
