       <p>
        I have spoken in this chamber before about the incredible contribution being made within our local communities by the thousands of people who volunteer to help others every year. It is occasionally easy to think that, in our busy cities, we have become a more impersonal society, yet I see the opposite across my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most of those who volunteer do so not expecting acknowledgements or accolades. Nonetheless, it is important we acknowledge those who really are the glue that holds our communities together. It is why later this year I am organising the North Sydney Community Awards. Those awards, which were established by my predecessor
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Hockey" rel="nofollow">
         Joe Hockey
        </a>
        , are an opportunity for us to say thanks to those who are volunteering or working in my electorate to help others. Nominations for the awards close on Friday, 11 August 2017, and nomination forms can be obtained by calling my office.
       </p>
       <p>
        Through the awards, we will acknowledge the efforts of those working with local community organisations, be they community service providers, our emergency services, those working to protect our environment and heritage or people supporting our schools and sporting clubs. As part of the awards, we will recognise the role of local community groups and older volunteers. There is also a specific category for younger residents, as one of the most inspiring aspects of my job as an MP is meeting the many young Australians—including schoolchildren—who give back to their local area.
       </p>
       <p>
        I encourage local residents to think about nominating someone who is making a difference to our community so they can be recognised at the awards ceremony on Friday, 15 September.
