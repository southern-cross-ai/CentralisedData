        National Police Remembrance Day is observed annually on 29 September, the feast of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Michael" rel="nofollow">
         St Michael
        </a>
        , the patron saint of law enforcement and, according to Christian tradition, the protector of good over evil. Since 1989, this has been one of the most significant days in the national police calendar. As a nation, we pause on this day to remember those officers who have lost their life in the execution of their duty and to honour the courage and commitment of all police members who are sworn to protect our communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Policing, as we know, comes with a high degree of risk and danger that, thankfully, most of us will never have to face. It really does take a special type of person with a special type of courage to wear a police uniform. We are forever indebted to those fine men and women who have chosen to do so, and we recognise their commitment to ensuring the peace and security of our communities, a duty we should never take for granted. National Police Remembrance Day is therefore a significant occasion not only for police but also for the wider community. It provides us with the opportunity to reflect upon the invaluable service that our police give and to express our gratitude for their contribution. Our safety and that of our families, the security of our homes and businesses and, indeed, our democracy are all reliant on the enforcement of our laws, a task which falls largely to our police.
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Police_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
         National Police Memorial
        </a>
        in Canberra, which was completed in 2006, currently carries the names of 775 police officers from across the nation who have lost their life during the course of their duty. This year, the service will see the total number of police officers listed on this memorial rise by one as we recognise the tragic loss of Senior Constable Brett Forte, of the Queensland Police Service. Senior Constable Forte was shot and killed in the Lockyer Valley on 29 May this year during a police operation with the Toowoomba Tactical Crime Squad.
       </p>
       <p>
        An officer with over 15 years experience, Senior Constable Forte, I'm told, was born to be a cop, with his closest friends describing the Queensland Police Service as his passion and saying they could not imagine him doing anything else. Senior Constable Forte came from a family of police officers. His father is a retired cop, his wife, Susan, and his brother-in-law are both serving officers. The death of Senior Constable Forte highlights the inherent dangers in police work. Not knowing what they are likely to face day in and day out, police officers are prepared to put their lives on the line every time they go on shift. Senior Constable Forte tragically leaves behind his wife, Susan, and three children, Brodie, Samuel and Emma.
       </p>
       <p>
        National Police Remembrance Day is also a time to think about the loved ones who have been left behind and the families and friends whose lives are now forever affected. While we mourn with them, we thank and honour all police families whose unconditional support has allowed these fine men and women to serve our communities. We owe it to the fallen to look after their families, which is why the work of Police Legacy is of particular importance and deserving of our support. In this regard, I will begin participating in the police Wall to Wall Ride for Remembrance. I've been to some events earlier this year, albeit on four wheels rather than two. I will join this year with more than 2Â½ thousand police officers and friends to raise much-needed funds towards assisting the work of Police Legacy.
       </p>
       <p>
        To Senior Constable Forte and to all those police officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice, as well as all past and current serving members of the police forces around the country: we honour you, and we profoundly thank you for the service that you have given.

          <p>
           As we heard, National Police Remembrance Day, 29 September, is the day that serving police officers and we as the broader community remember their fallen colleagues. The men and women of the police force are vital to each and every community, protecting 24 million of us every day. That's what they do. There are over 6Â½ thousand officers in WA, and they put their lives at risk every single day.
          </p>
          <p>
           Since the turn of the millennium, eight police officers have tragically lost their lives in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Western Australia
           </a>
           , and that's eight too many. They've left behind friends, families and colleagues who loved and cared for them. I acknowledge the officers who've lost their lives: Constable Mark Loohuys, Detective Senior Constable Michael Jenkins, Constable Gavin Capes, First Class Constable David Dewar, Senior Constable Donald Everett, Senior Constable Phillip Ruland and Constable Damian Murphy.
          </p>
          <p>
           I want to also talk about the fact that we lost 29-year-old Senior Constable Jamie Pearson, who was driving an unmarked police car along the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bussell_Highway" rel="nofollow">
            Bussell Highway
           </a>
           near Capel in 2004. His car collided with another vehicle and, tragically, he lost his life. Senior Constable Pearson only ever wanted to be a police officer. He took pride in his job. He was very well respected by his peers, particularly his senior colleagues, and of course he was greatly loved by his parents, Gary and Kathleen. He joined the force as a cadet in 1993 and graduated in 1995. He was posted to Bunbury
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Station" rel="nofollow">
            Police Station
           </a>
           in 2002. At the end of last year's Police Remembrance Day ceremony in Bunbury the conference room of the South West Police Complex was officially named the Pearson Room in memory and honour of Jamie.
          </p>
          <p>
           I also want to talk about the police officers who suffer physical and emotional trauma while doing their job to protect us. In Harvey, Sergeant Laurie Morley suffered serious and debilitating injuries after he was assaulted by several youths. At the time, he was protecting a member of the public. He was off duty, and he was in Harvey. He saw some young person being attacked by four or five adults. He intervened to help protect the young man but was punched, shoved and choked. It was his 40 years of experience that enabled him to get all of them to the police station in Harvey, but then the group attacked the youth again. In trying to stop this attack, Sergeant Morley was attacked by the group. They had him in a headlock, they hip-and-shouldered him, and it is believed he was also hit by a hammer. He was king hit at one point and lost a tooth. The damage was so severe he needed to have 46 weeks off work. He's had four surgeries to date and several medical injection procedures. Another surgery on his wrist is coming up. Laurie could have died on that day. Attending officers at the scene found the hammer and a 13-inch knife in the garden bed where the incident occurred. The impact on Laurie, on his wife, Jo, on his colleagues and on the people of Harvey community is severe.
          </p>
          <p>
           I really want to thank all of the Laurie Morleys, every policeman and policewoman who faces this, as we know, every single day in the jobs they do to keep us safe. I really want to thank Laurie particularly. When you're the police officer and the sergeant in a small community, everybody knows you and everybody generally respects the work that's done. We all rely on Laurie and we rely on the police officers in our small communities to keep us all safe. We can't do without these amazing people, and I want to acknowledge the trauma for people like Laurie Morley, the trauma for his wife, Jo, and even the fact there's so much that he can't do that he used to do and the impact that that has on physical and mental health. He will carry the results of this right throughout his life now, and he would be typical of police officers right around Australia.
          </p>
          <p>
           So, in thanking the member for this private member's motion, I want to pay my great respects and honour and thank every single police officer right around Australia for the work that they do every single day, whether it's in a small community like mine or in a major metropolitan centre, and the way that they protect us and make our communities safe. I just want to thank them all, and I have great respect for what they do.

            I'm very honoured to rise and speak today in support of the motion on National Police Remembrance Day moved by the member for Fowler. I wish to commend the member for his dedication to this important day of remembrance and his continued advocacy in the area of policing. I also commend my other colleagues speaking today on this motion, who I know all share a very deep commitment to highlighting the significant role undertaken by police officers right across Australia. This is an acknowledgement of the important role that police play in our local communities and the great risk and sacrifice that come with their duty.
           </p>
           <p>
            As we know, National Police Remembrance Day is observed every year on 29 September and is a solemn occasion for police and the community to gather and reflect on the invaluable service rendered by our very brave policemen and policewomen. This is a time when we pause to honour the lives and memory of all the fine men and women who in serving and protecting our community have had their lives tragically cut short.

            This year one such life was that of Senior Constable Brett Forte of the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Police_Service" rel="nofollow">
             Queensland Police Service
            </a>
            , who was shot and killed in the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockyer_Valley" rel="nofollow">
             Lockyer Valley
            </a>
            on 29 May. On the afternoon of Monday, 29 May 2017, Senior Constable Brett Forte was performing duties as a member of the Darling Downs District Tactical Crimes Squad, Toowoomba. In company with his partner, Senior Constable Forte was driving a police vehicle that was following a known violent and wanted offender along the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrego_Highway" rel="nofollow">
             Warrego Highway
            </a>
            and then on to Wallers Road, Ringwood. It was at that point in time that the offender got out of his vehicle and opened fire with an automatic weapon on the police vehicle. Senior Constable Forte was struck a number of times and, although he was able to reverse his car from immediate danger, his injuries proved fatal. The offender, having fled to a bushland location, refused to surrender and instead later confronted specialist response officers with gunfire. The offender was subsequently shot and killed as he fired at police. Senior Constable Forte was known as a loving son, brother, husband and father but also a great cop. He was posthumously awarded the Queensland Police Service Valour Award for his actions in protecting his colleagues and community on the day of his death. I want to take the moment to extend my greatest sympathies to Brett's wife, Susan, to their children and to all of his family, and also to his colleagues.
           </p>
           <p>
            As a former general duties police officer myself, having served with the Queensland Police Service, I've seen firsthand some of the situations and complexities that police officers face day in and day out while serving their communities in the execution of their duties. It's important to acknowledge that these individuals who wear the blue uniform are out there working hard to keep our communities safe. And often, during these times, police are faced with terrible tragediesâevents that are so often a part of everyday life. These are the tragedies, fatal accidents or family losses that we so often hear about. It's police that are often the ones to break the news to the parents, the children and the partners when such terrible incidents occur.
           </p>
           <p>
            It's also essential to acknowledge the impact upon police from exposure to such terrible situations. This of course leads me to highlight the very significant and important role of Police Legacy. Police Legacy branches, like police forces, are individually state based, but the commonality is that they all perform the same vital function. Whilst primarily established to support the families of officers killed on duty, their roles have expanded.
           </p>
           <p>
            New South Wales Police Legacy states that while it was:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Initially founded to support bereaved families following the loss of their loved one, our support now extends to include police officers and their families experiencing challenging times in their lives. Our police family has grown to include not only families suffering from loss and grief, but those experiencing misfortune that require extra support.
           </p>
           <p>
            What wonderful work these organisations do for police families and loved ones. I commend them especially for this important work.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is also important to state that this motion also states that we reaffirm our support for the nation's police officers and honour their courage, commitment and dedication to ensuring the peace and safety of our communities. Although on National Police Remembrance Day we remember all police across all those jurisdictions across Australia, I would like to finally and personally thank all those brave and dedicated officers who gallantly and bravely serve in my electorate of Richmond on the New South Wales
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Coast" rel="nofollow">
             North Coast
            </a>
            . I would like to salute their dedication to our wonderful region and to the protection and safety of our North Coast community. I would like to thank you on behalf of our community and acknowledge your service in keeping us all safe all of the time. You do an outstanding job. So on 29 September, on National Police Remembrance Day, let us all reflect and remember those brave police officers. I commend the motion to the House.

             region. He served for three years just south of my electorate in Caboolture. This year, he gave his life bravely in seeking to keep Queenslanders safe from a dangerous criminal. His death has affected many in my community and throughout Australia. It is a reminder to all of us to honour the service of our police officers and their sacrifices made on our behalf.
            </p>
            <p>
             I want to speak today about how we might honour that sacrifice by supporting those officers who continue to live with the personal consequences of their work. Mercifully, the number of police officers who are killed in the line of duty is small, though every death is a tragedy. However, hundreds of police officers retire from their service having experienced and seen some of the worst that humanity is capable of. Many of our police officers see the effects of serious violence and encounter domestic abuse. Many are assaulted themselves or suffer threats and attempts at intimidation. Many speak to the victims of terrible sexual crimes and come face to face with their suffering. For a minority, working on child sex offences, antiterrorism or organised crime, the psychological consequences of their experiences is hard to fathom. We must honour and remember those police officers who have died protecting the public, but we must also remember their fellow officers who go on living with the impact of their service. In recent weeks, one senior officer has helped remind us of this important duty.

             Commander Grant Edwards is an exceptionally strong person in every sense of the word. He has trained police in Afghanistan, supervised airport security for world leaders, managed all Australia's policing in the Americas and in 1999 was named

             . There are few people who can say that they have single-handedly moved a 200-tonne locomotive with their bare hands, but Commander Edwards can. I note he recently moved a C-130 aircraft as well.

             Commander Edwards is an exceptionally strong person, but in recent weeks he has revealed that his strength was no protection from the onset of post-traumatic stress disorder, or

             . The consequences of his exposure to images of serious child sexual exploitation and his experiences in Afghanistan left Commander Edwards struggling with his mental health and suicidal thoughts. He now receives treatment and continues to be a valuable leader in the

             âin particular, with dealing with the psychological impact of their experiences in theatre. In my own electorate of Fisher I hope to play a part in the creation at the Thompson institute of a treatment and research program into PTSD for our returned servicemen.
            </p>
            <p>
             The government should be commended for its unprecedented focus on this area. We've committed $37.9 million to extend funded treatment for all mental health conditions to all serving and former members of the ADF through the white health card and Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service. The government has also provided funding to continue suicide prevention training for members of the ex-service community.
            </p>
            <p>
             National Police Remembrance Day reminds us, however, that there are others also serving our community who may benefit from similar help. When we remember Senior Constable Forte, we must also remember the officers who were by his side when he was shot and who sought to provide him with first aid and

              CPR
             </a>
             . We must remember both those who have given their lives and those who are living with the consequences of their service. I congratulate the government on the action we have taken to date to improve veterans' mental health and I for one will continue to push for more on this important issue, but I wish to encourage the Minister for Justice also to look, in collaboration with his

              'Born to be a hero'âthat's how Stuart Forte described his son, Senior Constable Brett Forte, after he was shot in the line of duty earlier this year. And a hero he was. Later this month is National Police Remembrance Day, but I rise today to recognise the risks they take and the sacrifices that our police make to protect our country. They are all heroes. I would like to honour those who made the ultimate sacrifice in the course of their duty and to reflect on their lives and memories.
             </p>
             <p>
              This year in Queensland and in Longman we specifically reflect on the life of Senior Constable Brett Forte. Though he was working in the Tactical Crime Squad at the Toowoomba
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Station" rel="nofollow">
               Police Station

              Complex when he tragically fell, Brett actually grew up in the

               Moreton Bay

              region. He went to school not far down the road at
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clontarf_Beach_State_High_School" rel="nofollow">
               Clontarf Beach State High School
              </a>
              and joined the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Police_Service" rel="nofollow">
               Queensland Police Service
              </a>
              . Not long after he found himself working in the region at the Caboolture Police Station. This made him a third-generation police officer in his family. Caboolture Police Station is just down the road from my office, and so I have heard firsthand the memories that many of his former colleagues have of just what a wonderful man he was. His former team leader, Sergeant Pete Thompson, said it was a privilege to have worked with him. Though Brett worked at the Caboolture station from 2009 to 2012, he forged some truly meaningful relationships there. A number of the officers at the Caboolture station told me that they even had attended his wedding. That's how close they became working together. They were really a very tight-knit family at the Caboolture Police Station.
             </p>
             <p>
              Police officers like Brett, who are outstanding members of society and who serve and protect our communities, should be recognised, and those who fall must be honoured and remembered and their families supported. And so I must take this moment to commend the work of Police Legacy, a charitable organisation which offers this support and assistance to the loved ones of police officers who have been killed on duty or who have died as a result of their duties. As at July 2017, Queensland Police Legacy was supporting 55 Queensland Police Service families just like Brett's. It's supporting partners just like Brett'sâhis wife, Susan, is also a police officer out in Toowoombaâand children just like Brett'sâhis children are Emma, Brodie and Sam, and they have lost their father.
             </p>
             <p>
              I stand here and express my unwavering support for the nation's police officers, particularly those in my home state of Queensland. As the member for Morayfield, the state seat that is located inside the electorate of Longman, we have the Hon.

              . He is the member there, but he is also Minister for Police, Fire and
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Services" rel="nofollow">
               Emergency Services
              </a>
              and Minister for Corrective Services. In speaking to him and his office, I can see just how much the Queensland state Labor government is putting into supporting its Police Service.
             </p>
             <p>
              Just last week, last Wednesday actually, we had the officer of the year awards at Caboolture, at the function centre. They were hosted by the Caboolture and Morayfield Combined Services Club. I saw and heard firsthand of the quality of our local officers, both in their roles in the service and as members of their local community. They spoke about the work that they do when they take the uniform off. They are coaches at the local football club; they belong to their local service organisations; they go above and beyond just being members of the Police Service. They truly are members of their communities and their families' communities as well.
             </p>
             <p>
              These men and womenâthe men and women in Caboolture, the men and women in Queensland and the men and women right across Australiaâwho make up the nation's police service deserve our respect and, when it's needed, they deserve our support. So this year, on 29 September, National Police Remembrance Day, I urge all Australians to take a moment and reflect upon those people who have made the ultimate sacrifice to protect us allâpeople like Senior Constable Brett Forte.

               In the spirit of the motion, I would like to not only continue the sentiment about paying homage and giving recognition to those police officers who have served our community and paid the ultimate sacrifice but also recognise the service of every other serving police officer. The sole purpose they have committed themselves to in their professional lives, and the word we should use is 'service', is to protect our community. Everybody in this chamber shares the sentiments and the spirit of the motion and, in particular, the acknowledgement and recognition of that service. What they do is not only for the immediate community and those they are charged to protect but also for the Australian community. They bind us and provide us with the safety and security on a daily basis whichâlet's face itâwe too often take for granted but which is foundational to our freedom and having a country that we can all feel safe and confident in. That doesn't mean that we should discard in any way the very real challenges and threats and perils that police put themselves in and the situations that they face. Everybody here understands that you cannot have a safe and free society without people who are prepared to serve the community and, if necessary, to make the ultimate sacrifice.
              </p>
              <p>
               The hope is always that there has been a significant reduction in the number of police deaths that have occurred in this country. Over a long time frame you can actually say that that is occurring, but that should never diminish the memory of those people who have died in the service of our community. In researching this motion, I looked at some of the research data that has been available as a consequence of police deaths and what has been driving those deaths in the past. It also partly informs what we should be doing to address it and tackle it to make sure it doesn't occur into the future. The data is basically showing that there has been a decline, particularly in accidental deaths. This has particularly been driven by a change in motor vehicle safety, which is a very important thing, as well as the use and power of technology. But we should always be mindful that while we can increase safety, and technology can play an important part in making sure that we continue to reduce police deaths, there will never truly be an environment where we are risk free, and so we must take action appropriately to support the police. Since 1997, there have been 11 deaths of
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Police" rel="nofollow">
                Victoria Police
               </a>
               officers in the great state of Victoria. Nationally, that figure is 61. It's still too highâtragically highâand we again acknowledge very much the sacrifice that people have made in pursuit of our safety in these difficult circumstances.
              </p>
              <p>
               It goes to the heart of the concern that many people have around crime and safety, because we know full well that, when there are deaths related to the police, it's because of an issue of unrest which has escalated to the point of people's deaths. We've seen too many incidents around the country where police officers, as well as the general community, have been placed in a severe position of risk. Within the Goldstein community, we had an event earlier this year, the Brighton siege, where there was an individual who decided to take an extreme act inspired by his mad ideology. This led to one civilian death of a young man working in a local hotel. In the end, to arrest and tackle the person who was responsible, the police were compelled to put themselves in harm's way in front of a gunman. Thankfully no police died on this occasion, but it does show you that no matter where you are in the country, even in a community as wonderful as Goldstein, sometimes you have these problems and that we all have a collective responsibility as representatives of the state to support and resource police so that they can make sure they can do anything. I know that's not just my very strong view but the view of the state parliamentary colleagues who I share the Goldstein community with, David Southwick,
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louise_Asher" rel="nofollow">

               , and also those people who seek to replace them, James Newbury, Brad Rowswell and, in the case of the Bentleigh community, Asher Judah, who all place community safety and, in consequence, police safety at the heart of one of the key motivators that have led them to seek political office.
              </p>
              <p>
               It's when we work together on these issues that we can have the most important and powerful voice for change and for making sure we secure that future. That's why I'd like to pay recognition to the motion and the spirit in which it was introduced and also, particularly, to say thanks to the Victoria Police and all police officers serving around our great nation. You have our thanks for your service to our community and to our country.

                I rise to speak on this motion by the member for Fowler and acknowledge the work that police do in our communities every day, and especially the risks that they take when called to assist and to ensure that those communities are better places to live. A lot is asked of our police, and it's no small feat working day in and day out in what can be a highly unpredictable environment where your safety is not always guaranteed. The dedication and commitment displayed by police officers see them putting their own safety second to the safety of others. Invariably it is the police who are the first people we call in times of crisis, and they are first on the scene. They are our front line. Whether it is because of violence, natural disaster or something else, they are most likely to be there. They will be the first to render assistance. They see us at our best and, unfortunately, they also see our suburbs and people at our worst.
               </p>
               <p>
                Police officers are not only there for everyone's safety; they also ensure our communities continue harmoniously by working across local groups and supporting programs that build relationships. In fact, just as I came to give this speech, I was sent photos of my grandchildren dressed up because the police were at their day care today. Mind you, it's a beautiful, cute photograph, but this is what builds confidence in our police among our young people.
               </p>
               <p>
                In too many situations, police officers are killed in the line of duty, making the ultimate sacrifice in service to their community. I acknowledge the family and friends who have endured loss of a loved one through their service. To them, I also pay my deepest respect. The

                in Canberra recognises and commemorates those police who have made this sacrifice. At the time of the National Police Remembrance Day last year, there were 775 names on the memorial and the honour roll, and these are officers who died as a consequence of their duties, Tragically, since then another name has been added to the list. I note the tragic circumstances in which Senior Constable Brett Forte was killed in Queensland earlier this year. I know that the space left with friends and family by those so dedicated to their work is particularly strong, especially in smaller communities, and that void can be so difficult to fill. It's heartening to see the community rally and support this family after such loss, and I wish to include my expression of condolences to Constable Forte's family, colleagues and friends.

Tomorrow night is the Liverpool and Green Valley Police Officer of the Year awards. These recognise the distinguished service of police working across these local areas. The awards are organised by Rotary in conjunction with other community organisations, business and council, and acknowledge outstanding acts of dedication to duty, community involvement, caring for victims, inspiring people and investigative abilities. The sheer quality of the past recipients and the nominees for this year demonstrate the calibre of the officers working in many of the communities that I represent. The proceeds of the night will be donated to

                The role of community organisations like NSW Police Legacy is that they are there to support families of police who are killed in the line of duty. This support is central and very much needed for their children to have an education, for the mental health of the officers that are supporting them and for the wives and loved ones that are in their families. The continuing support that they provide for families in trauma cannot be overstated. I would like to extend my congratulations to all the nominees and recipients, as well as to everyone involved in organising this event which acknowledges many of our local heroesâwho should be acknowledged every single day.

                 I want to thank the honourable member for Fowler for moving this motion today to recognise the upcoming National Police Remembrance Day. I've been moved by the speeches already given on this very important day and I appreciate the opportunity to share the vital work police officers are doing in my electorate. I would also like to talk about my own experiences, seeing firsthand the difference that local police make every day.
                </p>
                <p>
                 I would first like to acknowledge Senior Constable Brett Forte of the

                 who was so senselessly and tragically taken from us earlier this year. It was a stark reminder of the very real risk that police officers face while on the job. The outpouring of love and support from the community in the aftermath of this tragedy has been heartening. Our thoughts are with his family and loved ones. Last month the Queensland Police Service Rugby League Association hosted a charity rugby league game in my electorate to raise funds for the Brett Forte Remembrance Fund. There was a great turnout by the public. This event's success is just one of the examples of the strong support my constituents have for our local police, and deservedly so.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In life before politics I was a small business owner, and I enjoyed a close relationship with local law enforcement. There was no issue that they couldn't help me with. To this day I've been fortunate to maintain this good relationship. I can't speak highly enough about the great help they've been in addressing local crime and safety concerns for my constituents. Just recently, a number of my constituents had contacted me, worried about crime in the electorateâparticularly in the Gumdale-Wakerley area. I conducted a community safety survey to find out more, and the results showed that the main issues of concern were break-and-enters and hooning. I set up a meeting with Acting Inspector Mark Norrish and Acting Senior Sergeant Carolyn Cox from the Wynnum-Manly police service to discuss these concerns. I then hosted a 'coffee with a cop' in
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manly_West" rel="nofollow">
                  Manly West
                 </a>
                 to give residents the opportunity to get to know their local police officers, to discuss with them their experiences with crime and to seek advice on protecting their homes and properties from lawbreakers.
                </p>
                <p>
                 It's been a pleasure working with local police on this pressing local issue, and I continue to be impressed by the genuine care that they put into their work. I look forward to working more with law enforcement in my electorate to improve safety in the community. Mark Norrish, especially, is doing an outstanding job.
                </p>
                <p>
                 On a side note, I want to thank the state member for Chatsworth, the Hon. Steve Minnikin, for also taking up the issue of crime and safety in the Gumdale and Wakerley area. It was great to attend his crime forum last week alongside hardworking members of the Wynnum/Manly district crime prevention unit. I've heard some eye-opening stories from local police over the years. My sister Pauline works in police intelligence and my brother-in-law Scott is a detective, while my brother and father were prosecutors. They have given me insight into the dangers police officers encounter every day. It is very important to recognise their sacrifices. I'm proud that we have set aside a day to observe the work of our nation's officers and to honour those who have been killed in the line of duty. I'm proud to support our local police, and I must say that they are doing a terrific job under very, very difficult circumstances.

                  I rise now with a heavy heart as my community of Groom is still mourning the loss of one of its own. This year's National Police Remembrance Day on 29 September will be a sad day for the people of our community. It honours the lives and memories of those police officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. This year, the hurt in my community is still raw. As other members have reflected already, on 29 May Senior Constable Brett Forte was shot and killed in the line of duty just east of our city of Toowoomba. News bulletins were my initial source of information about that incident. I then contacted members of the police force in my community to gain a better understanding of what had happened that afternoon. Here in Canberra the Prime Minister passed on this parliament's condolences to Brett's family. The
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
                   Premier of Queensland
                  </a>
                  did the same, as did Mayor Paul Antonio. It's an incident our community will never forget.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  Brett's funeral was one of the largest ever seen in my community. Thousands attended the service. It was a sea of blue outside the Clive Berghofer Recreation Centre at the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Southern_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
                   University of Southern Queensland
                  </a>
                  . His wife, Susan, also a serving police officer, was supported by her police family and the wider community. This support will continue, as the upcoming National Police Remembrance Day will be a testing day for her and her family. Brett's daughter, Emma, said at the funeral, 'To the world you were one person but to our family you were the world.' To me, that was extremely poignant. And that's just it. Brett Forte was a husband, father, son, brother, colleague and friend. He could be any one of us.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  When you strip away the uniform, when officers are in their civvies among the community, they serve in the local P&amp;C, they play in the local footy clubs and you see them pushing their shopping carts alongside the rest of us. They are just ordinary women and men like the rest of us. Yet they are called upon in their profession as police officers when it's not just a job. Each day, these men and women willingly place themselves in potential danger to make our community a safer place. Enforcing the law is their primary contact with the community, but I think it's part of a greater effort of ensuring our daily lives run smoothly. They protect our rights as individuals and, in many cases, they work with various community members to resolve and contain incidents or social problems before they spread or impact on those around us. They do this through their training, their compassion and their understanding of the communities they serve.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  know my community appreciates them. We live in a wonderful, caring, peaceful community due in part to the wonderful work our police officers do each and every day. It's a community that will stand beside Brett Forte's family, first and foremost, but also his colleagues, especially those who rendered him assistance on that tragic day, because they need our support as we approach this coming remembrance day. Therefore, today I again take the opportunity to thank each and every member of the

                   On 29 September, a little more than three weeks away, Australia will commemorate National Police Remembrance Day. Sixteen years ago the
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Police_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
                    National Police Memorial
                   </a>
                   was built in Canberra to pay tribute to Australian police officers killed on duty or who died as a result of their duties. It also recognises the unique nature of police service and the dangers police members face in their jobs. The memorial and remembrance day are small ways that we can recognise the sacrifice of police members and their families for our community.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   In Tasmania we are thankful that we have not lost any serving officers over the past year or indeed in recent years. But we too pause to reflect on the losses felt by communities in other states and indeed other countries. Constable Ty Bennett was 23 years old in 1999 when he died in the service of his duty in Tasmania. He was the last Tasmanian officer to lose his life on the job, and we remain hopeful that he will be the last ever. Nationally, an officer died in 2016 and another this year. The tragedy for those officers and their families and friends cannot be understated. But it says something about the Australian culture and the expert training that our officers receive that the fatalities in a nation of 25 million are so relatively low. Other nations could learn from our example.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Last week I held a community safety forum in Bridgewater, which was well attended by community leaders. Heading up the forum was Inspector George Cretu, of the local station, and he did an amazing job presenting facts, figures and the local strategy that he has for making the Bridgewater community safer and stronger. He provided a context of how modern policing methods are being used in our area and explained how policing's first priority is community safety, including the safety of young people who might well end up in police sights.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   There's no doubt that we expect much of today's police officers. They are better trained and more equipped to deal with a multitude of issues than ever before. These are officers who spend time working directly with the community and with community groups to provide education and guidance within the broader police force. They build relationships through schools and, of course,
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCYC" rel="nofollow">
                    PCYC
                   </a>
                   programs. Policing includes sometimes not chasing a kid on a stolen bike down the street but instead waiting for him at home because it's less risk to the child and less risk to community safety. Whether it's alcohol- and drug-fuelled violence, mental illness, family violence, cybercrime, child protection or just speeding and burglaries, it is police officers that we turn to in our hour of need.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   Police officers are also involved, of course, in fundraising. The Black Dog Ride through my electorate raised money for people suffering depression. Police provide funds for camps for schoolkids. Police are part of our community, and their culture has embraced seeing people as an opportunity for strength and growth rather than just an arrest statistic. It's this kind of community engagement that makes our police service today relevant and accessible. I pay tribute to the leadership of our police in all our communities.

In Tasmania our police service of 1,223 members includes 44 new recruits, graduating from the two courses run each year in the state. This is complemented by six police from the

                   are really getting it right when it comes to getting their message out. Their Facebook page is something to look at. It has 152,000 followers and a great mix of positive and funny engagement. They've gone viral a few times. They posted a selfie they took in Launceston on a phone after they dropped off a young fellow who was very, very drunk. They tucked him into bed and took a photo of themselves to prove that's how he got into bed if he wasn't quite sure how he got home. So to all the police in Tasmania, to all the police across Australia: thank you for your service; we are with you every day.
