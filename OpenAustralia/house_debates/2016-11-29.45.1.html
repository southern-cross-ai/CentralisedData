        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. Last week in question time, the Deputy Prime Minister said the current funding for the promised 450 gigalitres was insufficient, saying, 'You have not got a hope in Hades of delivering 450 gigs—not a hope.' One week later, is that still the Deputy Prime Minister's position?

         I welcome the opportunity to bring to light the fact that we are dealing with a Basin Plan that was actually written by the Labor Party, a Basin Plan for which all the incongruities were orchestrated by the Labor Party. It is interesting to see that the Labor Party has not suggested solutions. What we really need is for the Leader of the Opposition to come to the dispatch box and start suggesting what the solutions are.

         I will take the interjection. As completely laid out in the Basin Plan, as written by the

          Australian Labor Party
         </a>
         . We look forward to it. As the member for Watson knows, it prescribes the amount in there, doesn't it, Member for Watson? $1.77 billion. That is correct, isn't it, Member for Watson? Just nod. That is correct, isn't it? And, after you take out the works and measures for $200 million, it leaves you $1.57 billion. Isn't that correct, Member for Watson? This is exactly what is in the Basin Plan. Isn't that correct, Member for Watson? And, at 7.17(2)(b), it describes the conditions on which you can spend that money, doesn't it, Member for Watson? Yes. And you wrote it, didn't you, Member for Watson? Yes. So all the problems are your problems.
