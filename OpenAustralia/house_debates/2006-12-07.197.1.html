       <p>
        I speak on behalf of student Tenneil Friend, from Tomerong, in my electorate of Gilmore. I am proud to be able to read the speech she has prepared for me, following her visit to Belgium on an exchange program. She says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I have just experienced the most thrilling and challenging year of my life. In July 2005, when I was 16, I left my home, family and friends and flew to Belgium for one year’s cultural exchange.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I left Australia not knowing anyone in Belgium and unable to speak their language. I was completely relying on my Australian resilience and ability to adapt to change, hoping that I would be able to communicate with someone.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        After some months living with French-speaking Belgians, immersing myself in their culture, attending school daily, as well as French night classes, I began to feel confident enough to speak French. I made many mistakes, often saying very inappropriate, impolite words to my professors, who kindly laughed and corrected me.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Trying many new and unusual foods also played a major part in my day-to-day life in Belgium. I have eaten for the first time deer and horse and I also tried one of their favourite lunchtime spreads, raw mincemeat with mayonnaise on a French roll. In return I made pavlovas and jelly. I encouraged them to eat Vegemite, which they thought was absolutely disgusting. They did, however, really enjoy the Aussie meat pies which I regularly cooked for them, along with good old-fashioned Aussie damper.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My experience of the rail system found that the trains always ran on time. Belgium also has a marvellous bus system.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The standard of their education system is very high and if you do not pass all of your subjects each year you must spend your summer holidays studying and redo them again at the end of the summer break. If you are still unsuccessful then that year has to be repeated until a pass is obtained in all subjects. Some students are quite old in their final year! I wonder how Australian teenagers would feel about that system being implemented into our education system?
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I feel our Australian policies on non-smoking are something to be very proud of. In Belgium such policies do not exist. However, I believe they do not have a problem with alcohol as much as we do in Australia. Alcohol is part of their culture and an extension of their cuisine. They drink it because it complements their meal and they have such a wonderful variety of beers and wines.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        One particularly moving experience was a school excursion to Auschwitz. I walked along the railway tracks that had carried the people into the concentration camp. I saw the concrete beds they were to sleep on and the gas chambers which were marked as ‘showers’. There were rooms full of the empty gas canisters and rooms full of clothes and shoes. The whole area had a huge emotional impact on everyone. It was the most powerful history lesson I have ever experienced.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I would like to thank my host family, the Hubinonts, who welcomed me into their busy life. They helped me experience and understand much of the Belgian culture, especially Classic Belgium Art. This helped me to study at school with my major subject, art. My final work was a painting giving homage to a famous Belgian artist. I presented this to my school to show my appreciation.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A special thanks goes to all my school professors at Athenee Royal de Rixensart and to the music community which welcomed me and allowed me to join their band. My exchange would not have been the same without the help of my new Belgian friends, Jonathan, Etienne and Sylvain. They constantly helped me understand their culture and language and encouraged me to focus on my study. I inspired my friends with stories of Australia, so much so that Sylvain is now currently in Australia on exchange for a year and Etienne plans to come and experience the Australian culture after he finishes his degree.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I believe that this exchange between the Australian and Belgian cultures has been beneficial to both myself and the people I have interacted with in Belgium. On my return to Australia I sincerely thank all those involved in making it possible and so rewarding.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am proud of what Tenneil has done and of the role she has played as a cultural ambassador to Belgium. Tenneil’s experiences stand as a model for other young Australians who are proud of their heritage. It is a compliment to her school, her family and friends. It is no wonder that we are so proud of her.
