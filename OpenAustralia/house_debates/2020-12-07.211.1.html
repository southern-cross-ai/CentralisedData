        My constituent and good friend Councillor Joseph Haweil was elected mayor of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Hume" rel="nofollow">
         City of Hume
        </a>
        , making him the first mayor of Assyrian background in Victoria and the second-youngest mayor in Hume's history. Hume and, of course, Calwell have a very large Assyrian and Chaldean community. Joseph and his family are proud members of that community, and his elevation to mayor is a milestone for their representation at local government level. There was also lots of cheering from the Assyrian community in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , where Joseph well known and highly regarded.
       </p>
       <p>
        Joseph has served as Aitken Ward councillor since 2016. During that time he has acquired the reputation as the most anti-infringements councillor in Victoria, by making a first-time infringement offence a legitimate ground for waiving a fine. He has slashed the penalties for 11 parking fine categories from $83 to $33 and delivered a record reduction in the number of fines issued. Joseph has also taken on the pokies industry and was successful in achieving a permanent cap for the number of pokies in Hume City Council. As a recognition of his own Assyrian community, Joseph secured the naming of a local street after the capital of ancient Syria, Nineveh Road in Craigieburn, recognising the cultural heritage of

        . This is a small but significant gesture for a beleaguered people who have no country, who have suffered continuous persecution for the past 2,000 years, and who are grateful to call Australia home.
