        I rise this afternoon to bring to the House’s attention a concern on behalf of the constituents of Paterson. Many sufferers of severe arthritic conditions will be affected by cuts to the Medicare Benefit Scheme. The removal of items 50124 and 50125 from the Medicare Benefit Scheme make a mockery of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        ’s promise to fix our health system. First the Rudd Labor government cut the Medicare rebate for cataract surgery which allows many to have their sight restored. Now those who suffer from painful arthritis will need to pay more or go without injections, which will have a life-changing impact for them. The Rudd Labor government made these cuts while it continues on its reckless spending spree. Taxpayers are now being hit in the hip pocket for the Rudd Labor government’s costly mistake, spending for spending’s sake, which has led to rising interest rates and cuts where it hurts—in the joints of our locals, especially the elderly.
       </p>
       <p>
        I received a letter from a local resident earlier this month that summed up the devastating impact that this decision is having on patients. She said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My husband suffers
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_Arthritis" rel="nofollow">
         Rheumatoid Arthritis
        </a>
        and Osteoarthritis in many joints, quite severely. I also have osteoarthritis. We both worked physically hard during our working lives and this has contributed to the conditions we both have. I recently attended a specialist appointment and was shocked to find out we had to find an extra $24 unexpectedly to cover the cost of the injection. I feel this is a disgrace and definite discrimination against us with our illnesses. We both benefit greatly by being pain free for weeks after receiving them, and cannot see how we can now afford to pay for them every 4 months.
       </p>
       <p>
        This local resident has rightly asked why this decision had been made when no other groups with chronic diseases have had their funding cut from under them. Why would the health minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Roxon" rel="nofollow">
         Nicola Roxon
        </a>
        , remove the rebate for these joint injections if she understood the major difference they made to the everyday lives of sufferers? Any doctor would be able to point out the health benefits of these treatments. One may only conclude that she is not in touch with her portfolio.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am no mathematician, but I am a taxpayer and a caretaker of our family budget. It seems ludicrous that the Rudd Labor government can afford to send our country into enormous debt, rolling out a $42 billion stimulus, yet it cannot afford to spend $12 million annually for this pain-relieving treatment. The government’s insulation bungle alone would have funded 16 years worth of joint injections. It is clear that patients in our health system are being punished for the Rudd Labor government’s poor money management. Adding further insult, the cuts were made without consultation, without listening to the stories of local sufferers, who rely on these treatments to go about their daily lives. The heartless Rudd Labor government needs to review this decision and review it now to avoid another long and overdrawn bungle which is most costly to vulnerable Australians.
