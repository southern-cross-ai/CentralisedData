        Recently I had the pleasure of joining the Jindalee
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_Guides" rel="nofollow">
         Girl Guides
        </a>
        in celebrating their 50th anniversary. The Guides have been an invaluable part of our local community, empowering local girls of all ages to develop their skills and talents, discover new interests and create lasting friendships. As the federal member for Oxley, I have been a big supporter of Guides that have been nurturing and shaping girls to become confident community leaders. They are our country's leaders of tomorrow. It has been fantastic to see the impact that the Jindalee Girl Guides has had in helping so many young achievers reach their full potential.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to give a special thank you and congratulate the Jindalee district manager, Judi Noble, who this year celebrates an incredible 50 years of service. Judi, your continuing dedication to women's adventure, community service and achievement is an inspiration. Congratulations also to

        </a>
        . Michelle, a leader, this year has achieved 20 years of service. She is another outstanding representative of our local community and a great role model for today's Girl Guides. I also would like to commend the leader in charge, Catherine, and all the mentors for their dedication to carrying on the legacy of girl-led personal development and exploration. Congratulations to all the Jindalee Girl Guides and mentors who have worked so hard to build this organisation into an important part of the fabric of our community. I was delighted to join with members of our community, our local state member, Ms Jess Pugh, and our local councillor, Sarah Hutton, to wish the Jindalee Girl Guides a very happy 50th birthday.

        Another important milestone has been celebrated in our community recently, and that was the 25th birthday of the Springfield Christian Family. This church was established 25 years ago as part of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Christian_Churches" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Christian Churches
        </a>
        . Over a quarter of a century, they have made an enormous contribution to the Springfield community, particularly through their non-profit arm, Westside Community Care. Through Westside Community Care, this organisation offers programs and services to help some of the most vulnerable people in our local community. They aim to reach out to help struggling families and individuals in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Springfield" rel="nofollow">
         Greater Springfield
        </a>
        region and surrounds, offering emergency relief to those who need it most. It is this community-minded attitude and willingness to give back that makes this church so valuable in my electorate. Thank you to Pastor Phil Cutcliffe and his wife, Julianne, for hosting such a beautiful morning filled with laughs and reflection on a massive milestone for the church. It was also great to hear from special guest Pastor Gary Swenson, the State Ministries Director for Australian Christian Churches. And I particularly want to thank Deb and John Van Bennekom. I was able to worship with them in the morning and pay my respects for all the work that they've done. I wish the Springfield Christian Family church all the best for the next 50 years.

         Order! I was meant to do this at 10.30, but I'll do it now. I understand it would suit the Federation Chamber if constituency statements were to continue for a further 30 minutes or thereabouts.
