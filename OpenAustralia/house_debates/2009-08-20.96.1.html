        It is a great irony of the members opposite that their communications minister is apparently unable to effectively communicate. And it is a great irony that the same man should also be made responsible for ‘broadband and the digital economy’ when he has demonstrated, at best, a superficial understanding of the technology. The minister has been the subject of much mirth in online forums, particularly the Whirlpool discussion group. One stunned member there even reported that the minister responsible for digital communication responded to his email with ‘snail-mail’.

        Although he is a figure of fun in some circles, the minister should also be seen with fear, for the authority which he wields so ineptly has potentially disturbing implications for us all. Of even greater concern than the farce of the

        is the minister’s planned internet filter—a program widely condemned by

        industry award of ‘internet villain of the year’. That is one victory the members opposite should not be taking any pride in. To be seen internationally as the biggest threat to the internet in the world takes some doing—especially against the likes of China, Iran and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saudi_Arabia" rel="nofollow">

        . But that is the direction in which this minister, this government, is taking us.

        What began as a plan to prevent access to child pornography has now grown into a scheme where unaccountable bureaucrats would be able to block access to any sites they deem unfit for Australians to view—and with the power to make that list a state secret. Already, we know—and we know because the minister told us—that the bans will be extended to sites which distribute or host games some bureaucrats find undesirable. What next? Will words alone be sufficient for the material to be blocked? According to the experts in this field, this scheme is a dud. It will not work in stemming child pornography. It will only hamper internet access for the rest of us, increase access costs and reduce efficiency. There are too many questions about this plan for the minister to duck, as he did again this month, saying that he will have some answers in the next few weeks. It is time for the communications minister to communicate.
