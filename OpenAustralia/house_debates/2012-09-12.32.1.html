       <p>
        There has been a lot of talk over the last couple of weeks about foreign investment in Australian resource management. I particularly mention
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cubbie_Station" rel="nofollow">
         Cubbie Station
        </a>
        and a supertrawler. I also raise today concerns over announcements from some members in this chamber about a particular company participating in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
         National Broadband Network
        </a>
        build. Advice has been given by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Signals_Directorate" rel="nofollow">
         Defence Signals Directorate
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASIO" rel="nofollow">
         ASIO
        </a>
        not to have this company involved in the National Broadband Network build, and I would hope we as parliamentarians respect that advice and are consistent in respecting that advice. I have been very surprised that some members who follow this issue closely are now talking about potentially including this company in the build itself and going against that advice of the Defence Signals Directorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        In light of the many issues about foreign investment in this space, I put on the record that we either trust and invest in the advice that we are given by experts in the field or we do not. I certainly do and will act accordingly where there is no evidence to suggest or dispute that that advice is wrong. Those that do not certainly need to explain in detail why they risk our national interest through a capitulation to what the
        <i>
         Economist
        </i>
        calls a 'charm offensive' and explain why on earth they have changed their view on this matter.
