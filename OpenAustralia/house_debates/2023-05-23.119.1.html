       <p>
        I rise to pay tribute to my constituent Tony Pun, who sadly passed away aged 77. Tony was not only a highly respected community figure in Barton, he was the shining symbol of Australia's successful multicultural community and a loving family man. His passing is being felt deeply by all who knew him. He will be remembered as a remarkable man with a big heart and compassionate nature.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tony was born in Malaysia and first graced Australia's shores more than 60 years ago. During his early years, he studied to obtain a PhD and became a professor in molecular biology at the University of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        . He also the rose through the ranks to become chief haematologist and chief research scientist at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Vincent's_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         St Vincent's Hospital
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        As a legacy to his successful career, Tony has 31 medical publications in his name. These papers covered fields including blood transfusion, haematology survey, clinical laboratory computing and bone marrow transplantation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tony's passion for writing expanded beyond the medical profession. He also authored more than 400 articles on Australia's public policy and geopolitics for national and international publications.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a leader of the Sydney Chinese community, Tony developed a reputation as an influential social justice advocate. He was the founding president of the Chinese Community Council, Chair of the Ethnic Communities Council and a member of the Migration Review Tribunal. He was a prolific networker and really good fun. He worked with all shades of parliament and government, from

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hawke" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , from Bob Hawke through to

        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the highlights of Tony's advocacy was his lobbying efforts calling on the Hawke government to allow Chinese students to stay in Australia following the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen_Square" rel="nofollow">
         Tiananmen Square
        </a>
        massacre. Bob Hawke followed through on this course of action, intervening to offer asylum to all Chinese people who were in Australia at the time.
       </p>
       <p>
        I extend my sympathies to Tony's familyâ€”his wife, Juliana; sons Andrew and Leon; daughter-in-law Jenny; and grandchildren Jade, James, Joshua and Joel. We are all here for you.
