        I rise to update the House on the important work of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clontarf_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Clontarf Foundation
        </a>
        , a community organisation based in the electorate of Swan, which exists to improve the education, discipline, self-esteem, life skills and employment prospects of young Aboriginal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        people through a sports based program. Last week, 14 young men from the original 18 of the Clontarf Academy's 2002 year 12 graduating group gathered in Perth to help the foundation celebrate 20 full years of operation. I had the honour of attending the dinner to learn about the success of the program. These men make up the very first group of alumni who went through three full years of the program, which commenced in 2000, when they were year 10 students. It was fantastic to see that, 20 years on, they've entered successful careers, purchased properties—some of them own several—started families, started their own businesses, and travelled overseas. Most significantly, the group have nearly 40 children between them. The children all attend school and are happy and healthy, a clear indicator of the success of this program and the understanding that education plays such a vital role in the lives of all Australians.

        as a qualified tradesman for almost five years now. I'm sure it was Jeff who said that when he was a young boy and was told about this program he didn't hear anything about education; the hook that got him was the sport, the fact that he could play football every day. So he was more than happy to join that program.
       </p>

        Jeffrey's brother Kelvin was also part of the graduating group. He has been a long-term employee of

        This group of Clontarf alumni can be credited for not only making a commitment to their schooling and achieving great things in their lives but also paving the way for thousands of young Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander men around the country to attend school and complete year 12 via the Clontarf program. Since 2000, more than 4,000 Clontarf Foundation students have completed year 12 and transitioned into employment. The Clontarf Foundation is a genuine example of a successful, sustainable and holistic program that has had the full support of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families, schools, communities, corporate Australia, and all levels of government. Well done to the alumni and the Clontarf Foundation, and to its supporters
