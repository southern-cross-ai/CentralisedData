       <p>
        [by video link] Last week the people of Brighton elected a new mayor and a new councillor. I'd like to congratulate Leigh Gray, who won the race convincingly. Leigh is an experienced local councillor who has spent 16 years in service to the community he now leads. He is as local as they come. Raised in Bridgewater, Leigh has lived in nearby Brighton for more than two decades. In Leigh Gray, Brighton has a mayor who is passionate, dedicated and ready to lead the city as it embarks on a journey of extraordinary growth. I also want to congratulate Aaron De La Torre on his election as councillor. Aaron is a good man, and I have known him for years. He has lived in Brighton his entire adult life with his young family, and he is a driving force for good. Aaron is a proud union man, leading the

        in Tasmania. With his towering height and his lumberjack beard he cuts an imposing figure, but he is one of the most genuine and thoroughly decent people you will ever meet. I am confident Aaron will make a fantastic contribution to the Brighton community in his new role as an elected councillor.
       </p>

        Finally, to outgoing mayor Tony Foster, the

        of Tasmanian local governmentâ€”Tony has diligently served the people of Brighton as councillor and mayor for an incredible 34 years. He has earned his retirement. I wish him all the best. Brighton couldn't have done it without you, Tony. Have a fantastic time.
