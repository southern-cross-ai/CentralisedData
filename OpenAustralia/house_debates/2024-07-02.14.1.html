       <p>
        After decades of making the finest Chinese food anywhere in Australia, Chan's Canton Village in my electorate at The Cross Roads is closing, and with it comes the retirement of its owner, Mr James Wan Ming Chan. Anyone who dined at chance restaurant knows what a fine host he and his wife, Jenny, have been. You are always treated specially, like old friends and members of their family. But this era has come to an end.
       </p>
       <p>
        James Chan in every way is an Australian success story. He has worked hard, treated people fairly, won the respect of all and served his community. James's community service was recognised in 2014 when he was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        . The citation for his medal reads 'For services to the Chinese community of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Greater Western Sydney
        </a>
        '. The citation is true and accurate but, I would argue, perhaps too narrow. This is because James's influence, generosity to local charities and contributions extend far beyond Western Sydney. I think here particularly of James's involvement for years as a chairman of the Australian Chinese Buddhist Society. I wish James, Jenny and their children, Beverley and Anthony, every best wish for the future. The restaurant may close, but our friendship won't, nor will James's ongoing commitment and service of his community.
