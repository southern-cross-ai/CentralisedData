        Today I want to thank everyone who put in a nomination for my Bonner volunteer awards. These awards recognise individuals and groups that have demonstrated outstanding volunteer qualities. They shine a light on people who have made a significant and lasting contribution to our community. They commend those people who have set a good example for fellow volunteers and inspired others to volunteer. The volunteer awards were a great success last year. This year has been no different, with even more nominations coming in. It's great to hear so many stories of men and women making a real difference in our community. They all deserve praise and I would like to recognise their work today. We're lucky in Bonner to have grassroots sports clubs where children of all ages can hone their love and talent in sport. These clubs depend on the hard work of volunteers. Carindale Juniors

        club has grown to over 100 members thanks to dedicated Bonner parents. Their vice-president, Brad Abell, has donated hundreds of hours of his time coaching the under-10s, managing the umpires, repairing and maintaining their footy oval and much more.

        Jason Lavender started as president of the Bayside Jets Basketball Club in Carina last year. He stepped up to the plate when former club president Noel Merrick had open-heart surgery. He trains the kids every Tuesday night and has been getting them results.

        There are several other Bonner volunteers who also give their free time to help young people in the community. Marian Sheffield volunteers for a number of clubs in the Wynnum-Manly area, including the Acacia Bayside Swimming Club and the Annette Roselli Dance Academy. Michael Lakeman runs the Manly Lota Scout Group. Gloria Guthrie volunteers at Mackenzie State Special School library. Jacqueline Park volunteers as a reading tutor at the Upper Mount Gravatt State School.

       <p>
        There are also local volunteers who help our older residents in need. Lyn Felschow volunteers at the Holland Park Meals on Wheels as well as her local church.

        And then there are volunteers who make a difference for our homeless. The Making a Difference team based in Manly West regularly helps and organises donated items for the homeless or people trying to restart their lives.

        is just 14 years old, and he volunteers every month with the Rosies Friends on the Street program. Joseph is a hard worker who also encourages his friends to get involved with this worthy cause.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, there are volunteers who've made a particular mark in our community. Linda Pascoe started the Gumdale Hub Facebook page to bring the community together to help fight crime in the area. Linda and the rest of the Gumdale Hub team do a great job running the page.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Wright" rel="nofollow">
         Alex Wright
        </a>
        from Mansfield is a long-time volunteer also helping to protect his community. He's involved with Volunteers in Policing and Mansfield Neighbourhood Watch. These are just two of the many organisations that Alex volunteers with. Carindale local Bruce Meers is another lifelong volunteer for many local charities and clubsâ€”the list is too long to read here. Bruce has truly changed the lives of so many people, young and old, over the last 50 years.

        Congratulations to these amazing volunteers. I look forward to meeting them at the Bonner volunteers award presentation ceremony tomorrow, and I can't wait to thank them for their service to the community.
