          It is absolutely wrong. I know exactly what we said. I said that everyone would have access to at least 25 megabits by 2016. When we did the audit on the

           NBN

              The government has not been advised about what additional cost will be consequent on the delay in the connection of premises to the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
               NBN
              </a>
              for customers that are on
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HFC" rel="nofollow">
               HFC
              </a>
              . The honourable member should be very clear about this: the NBN is currently available to around 6½ million premises across Australia. The 350,000 that it's available to on HFC is, therefore, a little bit more than five per cent of the total. So the rollout is proceeding at the rate of around 40,000, or thereabouts, active connections a week. It is the fastest deployment of a telecommunications network in the country's history.
             </p>
             <p>
              What the NBN Co is doing is moving at this extraordinary pace. It's connecting more people every 10 days than Labor did in six years. It is an outstanding effort. What they're doing with HFC is making sure that customers get a great service. They have identified some technical difficulties, and so they're going to get them right. That's the difference—Labor promised the world, as the minister described, and delivered nothing. Labor promised the world and delivered billions of dollars of wasted investment. We're getting on with the job and connecting and delivering. That's the difference between our government and the failures of the six years of Labor government that preceded us.
