        I rise to highlight huge concerns in the aged-care sector about this government's so-called reform package. I have had the opportunity to meet with aged-care providers in my electorate, and to say they are alarmed about the future viability of their critically important services is an understatement. Aged and Community Care Victoria released a statement in June this year titled 'Gillard government slashes aged care funding', which states:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Kate Hough said the industry was shocked to learn that the high-profile budget announcement of a $50 million redirection for the next financial year resulted in a real reduction in funding of over $500 million.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Modelling by providers has consistently shown that subsidy income will be substantially reduced—a cut of between five and 10 per cent for every provider.
       </p>
       <p>
        The statement quotes Ms Hough as saying:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As a result of this new model, residents with exactly the same care needs in the same facility could be entitled to different levels of funding.
       </p>
       <p>
        The board of the Sale Elderly Citizens Village has written to me to express similar concerns. They said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Someone needs to speak up for the Aged and the Facilities that provide these people with the love, care and attention they both need and deserve.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This impacts on us not only by the new charges for electricity, gas, rising insurance costs, the new

        </a>
        which is being negotiated at present, carbon tax etc but there will be such a differential between Residents that are in our facility now versus the ones that will come in after the July 1st.
       </p>
       <p>
        I urge the minister and the Prime Minister to stop hiding behind the spin and actually start delivering better services for older Australians.
