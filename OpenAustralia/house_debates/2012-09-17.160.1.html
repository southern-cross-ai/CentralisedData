       <p>
        My electorate is renowned for its waterways—its rivers and its lakes and of course the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_Strait" rel="nofollow">
         Bass Strait
        </a>
        . I want to congratulate a number of our councils on what I call restoring our waterways to the community and to the people. We have been able to work as a government with my local communities and the state government to open up the waterways for social amenity. I would like to congratulate the Wynyard-Waratah Council. For example, at Somerset near the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cam_River" rel="nofollow">
         Cam River
        </a>
        they have enhanced the foreshore to the surf club plus introduced a shared pathway and recreational fitness equipment. Then at beautiful Wynyard itself the enhancement of the wharf precinct is absolutely superb and now there is a magnificent walking track all the way through the Gutteridge Gardens all the way round to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fossil_Bluff" rel="nofollow">
         Fossil Bluff
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        In Burnie, for example, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnie_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Burnie City Council
        </a>
        have had a major enhancement of the foreshore area, all the way from the Emu River right through to Cooee. I congratulate them very much. We were able to assist with a new rail bridge, shared pathways all the way through to Cooee, the Makers' Workshop, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Park" rel="nofollow">
         West Park
        </a>
        recreation centre and the surf club. The whole precinct itself is absolutely beautiful.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the central coast, Ulverstone now has shared pathways all the way from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turners_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Turners Beach
        </a>
        right the way through to the centre of the town. Now the wharf area itself is being enhanced with a fantastic super community project on the wharf. That is to complement the rec centre, which we contributed $1.8 million to.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another part of the central coast is the beautiful township of Penguin where they have a magnificent foreshore enhancement program and walkway development as well. Moving down the coast towards the east to Devonport, they have an extensive walkway now—which we contributed to—all the way from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Devonport" rel="nofollow">
         East Devonport
        </a>
        to the west and into the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_River" rel="nofollow">
         Don River
        </a>
        community and around through Sawdust Bridge back around to the city itself. There has been a major foreshore enhancement at the bluff—about $7 million worth. We contributed $1 million to develop the surf club area and the maritime museum. We also contributed $2 million to the Hornby Road shared pathway and $1.8 million to the Julie Burgess project to develop the maritime theme of the city.
       </p>

        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         West Coast
        </a>
        have all got water community enhancement access service programs. I congratulate everyone of them. When people have access to water they have access to their livelihoods and their heritage. It is very, very important for the cohesion of a community, particularly in my electorate of Braddon.
