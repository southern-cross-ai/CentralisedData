        Today I rise to pay tribute to two much loved and highly regarded and esteemed Bathurstians: Dr Ben Ami Gelin

        , Ben in 2015 and Martha five years later, an honour only bestowed on the city's finest residents in recognition of their selfless contribution.
       </p>
       <p>
        The pair spent 59 years together, inseparable, after a chance meeting in a lecture hall at the University of Pennsylvania sparked a lifelong union of happiness. The couple and their two children, Adam and Shana, made Bathurst their home in 1984, and they didn't look back, throwing themselves into every facet of their new regional lives, from the cultural, creative and performing arts sectors to community, youth, health and the law. This selfless couple gave so much of themselves to so many groups, organisations and people. In fact, there are few sections of the community untouched by the selfless Gelins. They stretched themselves thin, expertly juggling raising their family with their legal and health professions and innumerous hours of community service.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dr Ben Gelin is a highly respected

        coordinator, a position she held for a decade. Her revolutionary approach to education and workshops taught countless people the importance of protecting themselves during the pandemic, and she authored

        </i>
        to help parents talk openly to their children.
       </p>
       <p>
        Martha's talents did not stop there. A childhood love of fossils inspired her to become the first volunteer guide at the Australian Fossil and Mineral Museum in Bathurst. She dedicated countless hours to cataloguing relics and was the much loved smiling face of the museum, proudly shared her passion with thousands of visitors, a position she held until her passing. Martha had an endless love of creative and performing arts. She was an early member of the Bathurst Panorama Chorus as well as the Bathurst city orchestra. She held several management and board positions, including on the Mitchell Conservatorium. Martha and Ben also made significant financial contributions to it over many, many years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sadly, Martha passed away in 2020, months after being named a Living Legend. Dr Ben Gelin, now in his 80s, still works in the legal field as a consultant solicitor. He's still an active board member of many organisations, including the Bathurst Seymour Centre, the Mitchell Conservatorium and Veritas House. On behalf of this parliament, I recognise and thank Dr Ben and the late Dr Martha Gelin for their exemplary service and pivotal roles in making Bathurst the city it is today.
