         I thank the member for her question and note that, under our policies, 66,000 taxpayers in her electorate got a tax cut this week. As a regional member of this place, I've made it my priority to meet hundreds of community members outside of our big cities over the last few years, and I know what it's like for people on the ground out there. That's why I'm incredibly proud to be part of a Labor government that takes real action to improve the lives of regional people. This week, every taxpayer in our regions got a tax cut, and millions of Australians also got a pay rise. That's how you deliver cost-of-living relief, not by pushing up power prices with expensive nuclear reactors.
        </p>
        <p>
         On this side of the House, we know that power prices are a serious issue for regional Australians, and that's why we acted by taking $300 off power bills now, compared to those across the aisle there, who would take two decades to implement the most expensive form of energy there is. After a wasted decade of inaction and colour coded spreadsheets, they have come to opposition promising the world.

           They came here promising the world in opposition, because, as the Prime Minister just said, they did nothing when they had to opportunity to mandate a code of conduct for the supermarkets. And now they're talking about divestiture powers, which, in regional Australia, basically means your one option might become no optionsâ€”real smart.

             Mr Speaker, on relevance, the question was, in fact, commendably tightly drafted: why are regional communities better off under an Albanese Labor government. It's based on a ludicrous premise, but, nevertheless, it was tightly drafted. There is no scope for the minister to be doing as she's doing, trawling through a series of unsubstantiated allegations about the opposition.

              The minister is on a long bow here in talking about opposition policy or the former government's record. She wasn't asked about that. She needs to indicate how she believes the regional communities are better off, not simply why she believes they're better off. She needs to explain that to the House.

              <p>
               Absolutely, Mr Speaker. They're better off with an Albanese Labor government than they ever were under those opposite.
              </p>
              <p>
               We won't stop at tax cuts. We have today introduced the Future Made in Australia Bill, a bill that is a $22.7 billion injection of funds to make sure that we can make more things in this country and be at the forefront of an energy evolution happening across the world. Letting this opportunity, and the economic growth that comes with it, pass by us would be a real kick in the teeth to regional Australia. But we're not going to do that. This fund will be an absolute game changerâ€”the biggest manufacturing package ever seen in Australia's history. We're not prepared to tell car manufacturers to go offshore. We're going to make sure manufacturers set up onshore. We want to make sure that there's an unprecedented level of funding bringing skilled jobs into our regions to boost local economies.
              </p>
              <p>
               While we're talking to regional communities about the benefits of an energy evolution and the manufacturing jobs that come from it, those opposite are talking to themselves. We are supporting people to stay local and to train local, because we don't want people to have to pack their bags to get an opportunity in a big city. We want them to build a career in regional Australia. We are making our economy more resilient, creating jobs and a better future for regional and rural Australia. That's how you deliver growth for regional communities. We don't want another decade to tick by. Under those opposite, it was delays and excuses. Under us, it's action.
