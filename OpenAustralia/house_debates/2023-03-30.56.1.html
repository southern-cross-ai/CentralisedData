       <p>
        A few weeks ago, a number of wonderful women were inducted into the Tasmanian Honour Roll of Women. Today, I'd like to acknowledge one special inductee: Councillor Heather Barwick.
       </p>
       <p>
        It would be difficult to find a person in my local area of Georgetown who doesn't know Heather. Heather was first elected to the Georgetown Council in March 1989 and is the longest-continuously-serving counsellor. She also served as deputy mayor for two years and was the first female Mayor of Georgetown from 1995 to 1997. Last year, at the age of 83, Heather successfully stood for re-election, with the belief that not being re-elected would be the only acceptable age to retire. She is now in her seventh term as a councillor.
       </p>

        I met Heather when I first joined the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Town_Council" rel="nofollow">
         George Town Council
        </a>
        in 2009 and I've learned so much from a woman committed to her community. Heather is also an absolute force. In my time on the council, particularly as mayor, we have had our differences, but I deeply admire this woman and her commitment to our community. I also say 'good luck' to anyone wanting to pull the wool over her eyes; Heather remembers everything. Councillor Barwick, you have tirelessly worked to improve the lives of your community and have also been a trailblazer and strong role model for the women who have come after you. We are very fortunate to have you. Thank you for your tremendous work over the past 33 years, and congratulations on your induction into the Tasmanian Honour Roll of Women.
