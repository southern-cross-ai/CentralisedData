        While at this time of the year many Australians are focused on the annual

        </a>
        , there's another important grudge match, which is the battle of the bakers, known as Pie of Origin. For every pie sold during Pie of Origin, $1 is donated to charity, and whoever sells the most pies and raises the most money is declared the winner. Every year, Glenorie Bakery, run by my constituent Rob Pirina, from New South Wales, takes on a Queensland bakery. This year, Rob and his team are aiming to buy three intensive-care beds for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Children's Hospital
        </a>
        at Westmead, valued at $33,000. Since Rob started Pie of Origin in 2012, he's raised nearly $100,000 for charitable causes—a truly remarkable achievement.

        Queenslanders always need a handicap, so they're getting five shops to our one. Queensland is represented by Brett Hoy and the team at Uncle Bobs Bakery in Belmont, in the electorate of my friend the member for Bonner, and they are attempting to defend Queensland's title. The scoreboard is currently three a piece, so this year's result is very important. I wish Queensland luck, and they're going to need it, because the pies at Glenorie Bakery are some of the best in Australia, and they've been voted as such. I can tell you from personal experience that they're absolutely delicious. Congratulations to Rob and the team for their incredible support of the kids' hospital. I urge everyone to go to Glenorie Bakery and buy a pie. Support your state, support your mate, support the kids' hospital at Westmead—and go the Blues.
