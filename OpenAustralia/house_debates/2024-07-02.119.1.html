       <p>
        People across the community of Barton can look forward to cost-of-living relief thanks to our government. The Albanese Labor government is delivering for every Australian because we are a government for all Australians. Here's what we delivered yesterday: every Australian taxpayer, not just some, gets a tax cut. Our $300 energy bill relief is beginning to flow. Backed in by our government, 2.6 million low-paid workers are getting their third consecutive pay rise. There will be cheaper medicines. We're providing cost-of-living support while putting downward pressure on inflation.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know that many people in our community are doing it really tough. While our government is providing more help, we're not doing it alone. Community organisations in our community, powered by volunteers, play an important role. During National Volunteer Week, I held a morning tea to thank our community organisations and their volunteers. Around 100 people joined me for a cup of tea and a very large cake.
       </p>
       <p>
        What brings volunteers together is a passion for making our community a better place. You can see that passion in volunteers like the late Michael Shiel, a volunteer with Gift of Bread. It was a privilege to present a posthumous community award to his mother, Patricia, and recognise his work. Patricia herself has fostered over 200 childrenâ€”quite amazing. There are also volunteers like Helen Dwyer, who has given 40 years to 1st Hurstville Scouts. I would like to thank chair Russell Foxe, manager Lala, and assistant manager Laura at the Kogarah Storehouse, who hosted us for the morning tea.
       </p>
       <p>
        Volunteerism is an important part of who we are in our Barton community and, I know, in all communities across Australia. So, next time you see a volunteer in your community, give them a big thanks for all that they do.
