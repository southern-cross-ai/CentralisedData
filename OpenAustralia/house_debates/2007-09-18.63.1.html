       <p>
        I rise tonight to address the House on an issue of significance around Australia but also in the electorate of Wakefield: the difficult issue of suicide. There are a couple of initiatives that I would particularly like to touch on tonight and to raise awareness of because I am very keen to see people taking up the resources that are being made available to help our mates in the community. The Prime Minister recently, at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        national congress, made an announcement about a new initiative called Operation Life. This announcement has been largely overshadowed by the very welcome announcements about the indexation of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPI" rel="nofollow">
         TPI
        </a>
        pension for veterans. I certainly welcome the $330 million package that the Prime Minister announced—both the indexation and the increases across the entire general rate table. Whilst there have been many comments—and I accept some of those comments—that this has been far too long coming, I welcome the announcement. I would also like to particularly acknowledge the work of a number of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESO" rel="nofollow">
         ESO
        </a>
        s around the country who have not held back and have not given up the fight to see this delivered.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would particularly like to acknowledge the work of Blue Ryan, who has worked with members on my side and opposite. I would like to acknowledge the work of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Edwards" rel="nofollow">
         Graham Edwards
        </a>
        opposite, as well as people like Jo Gash on the government side, who have consistently taken up this issue along with many members. I am pleased to see that there has been a very positive outcome. I would particularly again like to recognise the work that Blue Ryan has done so tirelessly on behalf of veterans in the country. He deserves great credit for that.
       </p>
       <p>
        But the announcement I wish to focus on tonight is the one that was made about Operation Life, a $2.3 million program which has been developed jointly between the Department of Veterans’ Affairs, the Department of Health and Ageing and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Defence Force
        </a>
        and endorsed by the National Veterans Mental Health and Wellbeing Forum. It takes a three-pronged approach to suicide prevention to enhance the resilience and health of veterans and their families, to increase the literacy and awareness of mental health issues, and to ensure the timely access to appropriate and effective services. These are men and women and their families who have had battles in the past, and who still have battles, and it is important that we reach out to assist them through this process.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to also talk about other people who are still having real battles today, particularly people in rural communities, as we face yet another crop failure in the areas of Wakefield and north. I have spoken to a number of people recently who are very concerned about their communities and about mental health and the impact on people who are battling not only climate but also debilitating mental conditions—the depression and the sense of shame, in some cases, that affect people who are facing losing a farm or a property that has been in the family for several generations.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government recently announced that it is again putting money into the Mental Health Support for Drought-Affected Communities. There are three components: crisis counselling and outreach services for individuals affected by the drought, providing mental health training to community leaders and raising community awareness about mental health issues and services, and providing training and education and support for clinicians to recognise and respond to the early signs of emotional distress.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Wakefield’s case this is being executed on the ground by the Mid North Division of Rural Medicine. The reason I want to bring this to the attention of the House tonight, and to people who hopefully will be reading this in
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        , is to encourage people to take the opportunities to inform themselves of the resources available through
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        s and other people and allied health areas through initiatives such as beyondblue—which the government is supporting significantly not only for the rural sector but also for others—so that we can be informed and aware of the signs and symptoms in those around us whom we may be able to help. This is not just family but people who are stock agents, policemen in communities and publicans. There is a whole range of people who need to be aware, because they are the people who are in contact with these farmers who are facing this battle as we speak.
