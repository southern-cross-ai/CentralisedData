        Last week I met with the wonderful and committed Antoinette Sulfaro and Grace Newcombe, who are the directors of Ladies Like To Lunch. Ladies Like To Lunch is a non-profit organisation that works in my community to provide support to people with cancer. Their goal is to empower women particularly as they embark on their difficult journey with cancer and to build a strong support network for them and their families. Cancer is a battle that half of all Australians will be affected by, either directly or indirectly, and this journey is something that no-one should face alone.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ladies Like To Lunch raises funds for the Liverpool Wellness Centre and the Cancer Council. The centre provides support through gardening, art workshops, wig services, massages, meditation and many other things. Ladies Like To Lunch provides care packages to those with cancer to help them on their journey. These packages are designed to make the people who are receiving them feel special. This year they have a pink ribbon event, like they did last year, and it will be held on Sunday 29 October. There are some seats left, but very few, so, if you would like to come, please make sure that you get in contact really soon. Last year they raised over $35,000 with this event, and I look forward to helping them raise even more.
