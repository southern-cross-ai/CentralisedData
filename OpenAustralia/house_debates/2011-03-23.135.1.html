       <p>
        I rise tonight in this adjournment debate to address the important issue of mental health, particularly as it affects young Australians. What we all know in this House is that mental health impacts so many Australians. We know that in every community mental illness among young Australians is a major issue that demands practical and tangible support. We know that there is a critical need for early treatment. We know that delay in accessing appropriate treatment or, indeed, the failure to access treatment is particularly damaging for young people in adolescence. Maturity can be delayed, social and family relationships can be strained and employment prospects can be derailed, and secondary problems such as substance abuse, unemployment and behavioural problems may develop and intensify. We outlined these issues very much in our election policy just a few months ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Howard government recognised the critical need in this area. In 2006, the Howard government and the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
         Health and Ageing
        </a>
        at the time, now the Leader of the Opposition, massively boosted funding for mental health and established headspace units for the first time. This policy was backed up and added to in a major way by the coalition prior to the last election. The $1.9 billion boost in the final years of the Howard government was backed with another $1.5 billion policy promise that would, if implemented, have a major positive impact in mental health. There are a number of aspects to it. One aspect in particular was to provide $225 million towards an additional 60 headspace sites, as recommended by leading mental health clinicians. The policy as a whole was recognised and praised by mental health experts as a breakthrough. It was called a ‘game-changer’ at the time. Indeed, Professor John Mendoza in the
        <i>
         Australian
        </i>
        on 1 July declared it ‘the most significant announcement by any political party in relation to a targeted, evidence based investment in mental health’.
       </p>
       <p>
        I focus particularly on headspace. Many members of the House are well aware of the success of this new program that is only a few years old. It provides, as we know, mental health support but particularly a youth-friendly and a youth focused environment in which to do so. A speaker just a few minutes ago spoke about the critical need in his electorate. There is a critical need for an extension of this program. In the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarra_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Yarra Valley
        </a>
        on the outer-east of Melbourne, in the electorate of Casey, the area that I represent, as well as in adjoining electorates, there is a critical need for a headspace unit. As we know, there are 30 operating nationally. The member for Dawson mentioned some of the background. The nearest facilities for the Yarra Valley, in the electorate of Casey, are in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Kilda" rel="nofollow">
         St Kilda
        </a>
        and Frankston. It is vital that this program is rolled out further. It is a practical program that will have an immediate beneficial effect for youth who need to access it. We know that 35,000 young people have accessed the existing services to date, but we need a service in the outer-east and the Yarra Valley. All of us know that there are young people who need this service. We need to put that service where they are. It is vital that the outer-eastern suburbs are given the opportunity to complete an expression of interest for a site in the outer-east and the Yarra Valley.
