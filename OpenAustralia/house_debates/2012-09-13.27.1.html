       <p>
        I am sure the member for Hughes and the member for Barton will join me in congratulating the Southern Districts Rebels, who will take part in their first grand final appearance in the Sydney rugby union premiership—on Saturday, this weekend—since the club was formed in 1989. It was only five years ago that their opponents on Saturday,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_University" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney University
        </a>
        , sought to have the Rebels ejected from the Sydney rugby competition. So we will have the opportunity to settle that score this weekend.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate Cameron Blades, the coach, and all of his coaching staff and the captain,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ulugia" rel="nofollow">
         John Ulugia
        </a>
        , and all of his players. I wish them the very best for this Saturday's contest. Congratulations also go to club president Neville Shooter and his deputy, Steve Brittons, ably supported by general manager Craig Hawkings. I also want to particularly thank the club's sponsors: the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        of Training, Sylvania

        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_Monarch" rel="nofollow">
         Ocean Monarch
        </a>
        , the Tulla Group and McLeish Estate. They have been loyal and fantastic supporters of this club as it has rebuilt over the last five years to realise this great objective and achievement of being in the grand final on Saturday.
       </p>
       <p>
        I seek leave to table an agreement between the member for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         North Sydney
        </a>
        , the member for Hughes and me, which says that this time next week the loser of this contest on Saturday, with the member for North Sydney representing the Sydney University club, will come into this place and give a 90-second statement congratulating the winner. We are looking for that opportunity next week, and I hope the member for North Sydney will be given the call when Sydney University go down.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
