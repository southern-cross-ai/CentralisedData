       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm pleased to introduce the Education Legislation Amendment (2022 Measures No. 1) Bill 2022.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill amends the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Education_Support_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Higher Education Support Act
        </a>
        2003 to improve equality of access to higher education and support this government's commitment to building a highly skilled workforce.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill delivers on our election commitment to remove the 10 per cent
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HESS" rel="nofollow">
         HESS
        </a>
        -
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HELP" rel="nofollow">
         HELP
        </a>
        discount for students who pay upfront their student contribution amounts for Commonwealth supported places.
       </p>
       <p>
        This was a measure that we took to the election on the principle that all students should pay the same amount for the same course, regardless of their ability to pay up front.
       </p>
       <p>
        The measure will take effect on 1 January 2023 and is projected to save $144 million over the forward estimates.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those savings will help to fund the extra 20,000 new university places that I announced earlier this week.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those 20,000 extra places have been allocated to support students who are currently under-represented in our universities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Students from poorer families.
       </p>
       <p>
        Students from regional Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous Australians
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Australians with a disability.
       </p>
       <p>
        And students who are the first in their family to ever set foot in a university.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill will also extend the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FEE" rel="nofollow">
         FEE
        </a>
        -HELP loan fee exemption for a further 12 months.
       </p>
       <p>
        This exemption originally commenced on 1 April 2020 as a COVID-19 financial relief measure, and will now continue through to 31 December 2022.
       </p>
       <p>
        This will help around 30,000 full-fee-paying undergraduate students accessing FEE-HELP to study in 2022. It will also support the higher education providers where these students are enrolled.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill also extends FEE-HELP to eligible students who participate in the government's microcredential pilot.
       </p>
       <p>
        The microcredential pilot encourages universities to develop and deliver industry targeted, flexible short courses as part of building a highly skilled workforce.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill also makes other amendments to the Higher Education Support Act to clarify and improve its operation.
       </p>
       <p>
        It clarifies arrangements around enabling courses.
       </p>
       <p>
        Enabling courses help prepare students for higher education study like a bachelor's degree.
       </p>
       <p>
        The measures in this bill clarify that these enabling courses will not count toward a student's lifetime limit of Commonwealth support.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill also improves consistency by aligning the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HECS" rel="nofollow">
         HECS
        </a>
        -HELP and FEE-HELP citizenship and residency requirements for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        citizens with the existing requirements for those students accessing a Commonwealth supported place.
       </p>
       <p>
        It requires that these students be resident in Australia for the duration of their unit of study to be eligible for HECS-HELP and FEE-HELP.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill also strengthens administration and accountability by requiring that students seeking Commonwealth funding provide their Unique Student Identifier to their institution and the Commonwealth.
       </p>
       <p>
        It also makes other minor technical amendments to the Higher Education Support Act and the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency Act to improve their operation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The measures in this bill support the government's commitment to equal access to higher education and building the skills of Australia's workforce.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend this bill to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
