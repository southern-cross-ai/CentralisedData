       <p>
        I rise to talk about this government's failure to govern in the best interests of Australians. There is no better evidence of this than in my growing electorate of Corangamite. Take

        , which is a new suburb that was established only a decade ago and is already home to 17,000 people. It's expected to grow more than 66,000 residents in the next two years. This community is representative of so many similar communities right around Australia. It has high growth, with many young families just starting out, many students and families who are renting and older families who are retiring. It's a community with hopes, dreams and aspirations.

        But the Morrison-Joyce government has turned its back on these people in Armstrong Creek when it comes to roads, mobile connectivity, the construction industry and housing affordability. On every measure that is important, this government has failed them. On the cost of living, the Morrison government has failed them. On the crucial issue of connectivity and modern communications, this government has not given them what they need to get by. We have one of the highest levels of child care. The government are not helping our local families. On delivering timely community infrastructure, the government have failed. On roads, they are way behind. On community services, the only thing this government has delivered is an illegal robodebt scheme and an

        cost-cutting plan that is hurting many in my communities and their families. On integrity, there's no federal integrity commission. On housing, the cost of buying a home and paying rent has skyrocketed under this government, Housing has become much less affordable, almost prohibitive, for young Australians. We have a national timber crisis that has been created by this government and which is causing huge delays, massive price increases and job losses. In Armstrong Creek and right across my region, this crisis is starting to bite.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Morrison-Joyce government promised in 2018 to meet a one billion trees target. As usual, Mr Morrison has failed to deliver, doing next to nothing on this promise. Because of the lack of a national plan, timber is being imported from overseas and costing between 18 and 125 per cent more. This massive increase is being passed on to builders, leading to a very real increase in the cost of housing. Just this week my office contacted a major home builder who said that in the last six months an entry-level three-bedroom home has jumped in price by $28,000. The cost of housing has gone through the roof, and that's why an Albanese Labor government would introduce a $10 billion housing affordability fund.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let's move on to connectivity. Modern communications are essential to people's everyday lives in Armstrong Creek, just like everywhere else. I had so many complaints to my office that the shadow minister and I had a meeting with about 100 concerned citizens, and they told me terrible stories, such as where a husband had collapsed and his wife could not be with him and had to be at the other end of the house to get connectivity to get the instructions from the ambo. It's just not good enough. No matter where Australians live, they should have quality access, reliable and affordable data and voice communication options. How can you live very close to the second-biggest city in our state and still not have that connectivity?
       </p>
       <p>
        Let's turn to the government's

        . This failed fibre to the node is not up to scratch. An Albanese Labor government will invest $2.4 billion dollars to introduce fibre to the home, and it will benefit Marshall, Bannockburn,

       </p>
       <p>
        I am also proud that Labor has recognised the significance of investment in road infrastructure. We have just announced, if elected, $125 million for the second stage of the Barwon Heads Road. This is an essential road for the safety of my community in Armstrong Creek and will cut commuter times drastically. So, when it comes to connecting people to work, family, school and sport in a high-growth area like mine, it's an Albanese government that will deliver; it is an Albanese government that actually cares about the community. Armstrong Creek is the suburb that the Morrison-Joyce government forgot, and it's time for a government that cares and truly plans for our futureâ€”an Albanese Labor government.
