        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to this letter from the

        which was sent to all employees and states: 'Under the carbon price scheme, Loy Yang Power will be required to purchase $450 million in carbon permits each year.' And further: 'The scheme is threatening our future viability as not all of these costs will be recovered via increased electricity prices and the government's proposed generator assistance package.' Is the Prime Minister aware that Loy Yang Power is now offering redundancy packages to its workers? Prime Minister, how many workers in the

          is that it has a very strong future and we will be working with the local community to achieve that. What I said when I was in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latrobe_Valley" rel="nofollow">
           Latrobe Valley
          </a>
          meeting with workers at the Hazelwood power station, local community members, representatives of the local council and the like was that our carbon pricing package includes a closure-for-tender process. We as a government will be calling a tender where those generators that are the dirtiest generators in the country—that is, they generate the most carbon pollution—can come forward with a proposal which we will assess on value-for-money criteria.

               What I was explaining to the member and to the House—it was exactly the same thing I explained to the workers in the

                Latrobe Valley
               </a>
               when I spoke to them personally—was that we would go through this contract for closure process, it would take a number of years, and obviously we would work with any regions affected with structural adjustment because we want every region in the country to have a bright future.

              <p>
               The point of going through this, and my visit to the Latrobe Valley, is to verify that no matter where I am—whether I am in this parliament, in front of workers from a power station or talking to people who are very passionate about climate change and reducing carbon pollution—I say the same thing. And I think that that is appropriate. What I do not think is appropriate—and it bears directly on the member's question about jobs—is for the opposition to say different things to different audiences. So we have the shadow minister for finance, who says that the policy of the opposition is the closure of the Hazelwood power station. And then the Leader of the Opposition, when he was out there trying to be a friend of the workers—when he was in that guise, which is completely contrary to his 'friend of business' guise, completely contrary to his 'friend of farmers' guise and completely contrary to his 'friend of those passionate about climate change' guise—then said:
              </p>
              <p class="italic">
               There will be no act of policy from the next Coalition government or from any Coalition government that I'm associated with that artificially foreshortens the life of these power stations.
              </p>
              <p>
               The only way that these statements make sense is if the shadow minister is envisaging a situation where the Leader of the Opposition is not associated with a future coalition government. I will allow them to explain that.
