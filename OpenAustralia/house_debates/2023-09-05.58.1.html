        My question is to the Minister for Communications. How is the Albanese Labor government addressing cost-of-living challenges by helping families with school-age children connect to the internet?

         I thank the member for Blair for his question. He understands that broadband is a key driver of equality of opportunity, and, in 2023, being connected to broadband is essential to maximise educational opportunities and to take advantage of our digital economy. Fortunately, the majority of Australian families and their children do have internet access at home. However, there remains a small proportion of families that, for whatever reason, whatever their personal circumstances, do not. The Albanese government understand that cost-of-living pressures can exacerbate digital exclusion, and we are determined that nobody be left behind. To address this inequity, the government is working for Australia through targeted measures that deliver practical outcomes, assisting these families to get connected through our School Student Broadband Initiative.

         During the pandemic, parents shared with me how they would park with their kids outside fast food restaurants just so they could get wi-fi access and download their remote learning tasks for the day. This is unacceptable. That experience was one of the key drivers for the $4.5 million investment we made in the October budget to enable

         Co to deliver this affordability measure to provide free broadband access for 12 months.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am pleased to report to the House that more than 2,500 families without broadband at home have now been connected to free internet. In addition, over 19,000 vouchers for free connections have been issued by NBN to nominated agencies and eligible families, which will flow through to even more families connecting.
        </p>

         The Queensland Department of Education is the latest nominating organisation to come on board, also working with the Smith Family to reach families who may benefit from the scheme. I thank Minister Grace for her support and recognition of the crucial role that access to the internet plays in narrowing the digital divide.

         is also available to take referrals from members of parliament and senators to support families in need, and I'm pleased that a number of colleagues across the parliament are promoting the initiative and identifying families in their own electorates. I thank you for your support and I look forward to working with you on this important initiative.
        </p>
        <p>
         Given the ongoing demand for this program, I'm also pleased to inform the House that we have extended the nominating period for eligible families to obtain a free internet connection until the end of term 1 in 2024. That's because we want to ensure that as many families as possible can take advantage of this very important cost-of-living assistance, so that students, regardless of their circumstances, can access the internet to undertake their education with the same equitable access to broadband as their peers.
