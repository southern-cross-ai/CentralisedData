       <p>
        I direct my remarks to students, parents and staff of Sandringham Primary School. I am celebrating your new school from this House, and I acknowledge the adversity that many of you have faced. The fire that took place at the school at the start of 2020 had a huge impact on families, staff and residents. As a former Sandy parent—both my kids attended your school—I was devastated, and I felt such empathy for everyone affected. Yet our community managed this in such a special way, finding alternative locations for children to go to school and supporting each other through a difficult time, which was even more difficult due to the pandemic. However, it was also a time when we remembered the importance of our neighbourhoods, our local businesses, our environment and our community. Often, when I pass the school with our golden retriever, Tully, I remember when Tully was a puppy, my children were little and I was among the parents chatting in the yard at drop-off and pick-up. What a lovely time that was at such a special little school, tucked away among the gum trees in Sandy. I congratulate you all on your resilience. Enjoy the rebuilt Sandringham Primary School for years to come.
