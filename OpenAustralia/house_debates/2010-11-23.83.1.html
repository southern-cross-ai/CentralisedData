       <p>
        I rise on this occasion to speak about the success of the Active After-school Communities program and, in particular, I wish to mention Scottsdale Primary School where the program has recently been presented with a Super Site award. The Active After-school Communities program aims to engage traditionally inactive children in sport and other structured physical activity to help them develop a love of sport. We know that without the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AASC" rel="nofollow">
         AASC
        </a>
        program more than 90 per cent of participating children would not engage in structured physical activity after school. Whether it is practising in the backyard, playing, competing, socialising with other parents on the sideline, or volunteering as a coach, umpire or official, joining a sports club can be beneficial for the whole family.
       </p>
       <p>
        I cannot reiterate enough how important sport is for communities. It brings together people of all ages and backgrounds. For example, in the Bridport Primary School, which has been running their program in conjunction with the local bowls club, 20 students participate in each session. They have been running the program since 2006. Many of the children and their families have been introduced to lawn bowls through the AASC program and have joined the club, with 10 now playing competitive bowls. Particularly worth noting is Andrew Whitmore, who participated in the program and has now gone on to represent Tasmania at the national championships. The program at Bridport has also offered other activities including golf, which is provided by the local golf club; tennis; netball; basketball; cricket; volleyball; circus skills; martial arts; soccer and dance.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Scottsdale Primary School has been involved in the AASC program since 2008 and on average 40 students have the opportunity to participate in the sessions which are run twice a week. I was most pleased to be present at the Super Sites award, which was presented to the school recently. Mr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Walker" rel="nofollow">
         Duncan Walker
        </a>
        , who took over the role of coordinator of the program at Scottsdale Primary School earlier this year, has been instrumental in engaging community members and local high school students as community coaches.
       </p>
       <p>
        Approximately 45,000 people in Australia have been trained by AASC regional coordinators to become community coaches. These community coaches include people from local sporting clubs; volunteers, such as retirees, family members and secondary and tertiary students; as well as private providers and teachers. These skills are valuable and these individuals are now real assets to their community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia wide the AASC program runs in 3,250 schools, with over 150,000 children taking part each term. The program reaches all corners and populations in Australia, including Indigenous, remote and rural areas. In my electorate of Bass there are 14 sites participating in the program and I have had the opportunity to visit many of them in full action. What I can tell you about what I have seen first hand is that the children involved are not only getting exercise but also learning how to socialise. They are making long-lasting friendships as well as gaining lifelong skills such as respect, tolerance, cooperation and discipline. We know that introducing children to physical activity at a young age is the best way to establish a lifelong enjoyment of sports, which has great flow-on health effects. This program stimulates the local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also wish to express my thanks to the program coordinator in our area, Mr Ralph Morris, for his efforts in ensuring the programs run smoothly. Encouraging children to participate in a sport can be a gift for life. I commend this program to the House and I wish the schools in Bass all the best with the continuance of this program.
