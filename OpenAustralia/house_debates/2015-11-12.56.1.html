        Mr Speaker, my question is to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acting_Prime_Minister" rel="nofollow">
         Acting Prime Minister
        </a>
        and the Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development. Will the Acting Prime Minister update the House on how government measures are assisting regional Australia and its contribution to the national economy?

        <p>
         I thank the honourable member for her question. There is no doubt at all that when our regions are strong around our nation so is our country. When the regions are doing well, our nation also prospers. It is vitally important that, even in a time when drought is affecting much of inland Australia, we look at the progress and the development and the way in which the government's policies for regional Australia are already starting to bear fruit.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have had a record investment in infrastructure across the nation, including substantial expenditure in regional communities. The honourable member for Capricornia and the honourable member for Flynn would be delighted to see examples of that in their own areas, particularly the completion of the Yeppen floodplain project, which will make an enormous difference to the people of Rockhampton, especially when there are times of heavy weather. It is also obvious that these other programs, like Roads to Recovery and the Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Program, are all things delivering vital road work in local communities.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today's unemployment figures are a demonstration about how these sorts of projects are a practical example of creating opportunity for workers across Australia. The reduced unemployment rate, the creation of a very large number of jobs and the movement forward way above market expectations in employment creation contrasts starkly with what was happening before this government came to office. Around 10 times as many jobs are being created each month as were created in 2013 under Labor. That does demonstrate that positive policies, governments that are optimistic about our nation's future and governments that are putting in place the mechanisms to help build a stronger future build confidence, create jobs and therefore build us a stronger economy.
        </p>
        <p>
         That is particularly important in northern Australia.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Australia
         </a>
         produces the majority of our export income; it is 40 per cent of our continent, but only has about five per cent or seven per cent of our nation's population. Those people are punching well above their weight. What we do know is that if we invest in the North, we will get rich rewards. This government is determined to ensure that northern Australia is able to achieve its potential. We are committed to building infrastructure, and we are committed to ensuring that there is investment capital available for the big projects in the North. All of that helps build the confidence that Australians need to invest and save for the future.
