        I'm privileged to stand here today and honour the life of a true gentleman I was fortunate to know for many years, Robert James Colgrave. Rob passed away a few weeks ago, in his 86th year. He leaves behind his devoted wife of 60 years, Val; his children, Lynda, Deirdre and Penni; and his grandchildren and great-grandchildren, who adored him. Rob was, quite simply, a giant in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Town" rel="nofollow">

        community, spending countless hours giving back to his community, alongside his beloved wife, Val. Between them, they have volunteered with

        of George Town, and his service was recognised with an honorary membership by the club.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2016 I was delighted to present Rob and Val with the George Town Volunteers of the Year award during my tenure as mayor. In typical Colgrave fashion, they were surprised and humbled to be recognised for their efforts. At the time, Rob said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If it needs to be done, you step up and do itâ€”that's the way we were brought up, my wife and I.
       </p>
       <p>
        He went on to say:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We both grew up in the country and everybody helped everybody else. It's no big deal, if we can make a difference in the community, we're happy to do that.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have wonderful memories of Robert and Val dancing together on the lawn of their house, holding hands with each other, always inseparable. Vale, Robert. You live on in our hearts.
