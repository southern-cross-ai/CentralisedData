        Water is of critical importance to the Riverina electorate. It underpins the region's economic sustainability, and this is critically so from Narrandera west. Irrigated agriculture, as I have said many times previously in this place, makes the Riverina strong, feeds and clothes the nation and sustains many other countries too. With the three preferential trade deals Minister Andrew Robb has negotiated with China, Japan and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and now that the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement which has been successfully brokered, the Riverina's role in Australia's export viability is even more critical. Farmers cannot grow food and fibre without water. That is why capping buyback at 1,500 gigalitres, which passed the House of Representatives on 9 September and the Senate five days later, gives hope and certainty to river communities. That is why putting responsibility for water back into agriculture is a net positive for Australia.

        A triple bottom line approach is now needed more than ever before, as Australia looks to capitalise on the trade deals achieved under the coalition. Social, economic and environmental aspects must receive equal weighting when it comes to water. In the recent past the environment has been given all of the say and just about all of the water as far as the Murray-Darling Basin Plan was concerned. This cannot and will not continue. Farmers were this nation's first environmentalists after European settlement and remain the very best carers of country. During the official opening last Friday of Ag Inspirations, a workshop for years 9, 10 and 11

        and district school students to get a hands-on experience of a possible future career in an ag related job, Wiradjuri woman Gail Clark of Coolamon and gave the welcome to country and told participants; 'At one time in your life you will need a doctor, a lawyer, a policeman and a preacher, but every day, three times a day, you will need a farmer.' Sage advice.

        Water allocations remain the remit of the state. In the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        Department of Primary Industries' water allocation statement delivered today, Murrumbidgee Valley general security entitlements have increased by two per cent to 29 per centâ€”due mostly to just slightly better than expected inflows into storages since the last assessment. Regarding dam levels at the moment,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blowering_Dam" rel="nofollow">
         Blowering Dam
        </a>
        is currently 46 per cent full, holding 775,000 megalitres.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrinjuck_Dam" rel="nofollow">
         Burrinjuck Dam
        </a>
        is 71 per cent full, holding 731,000 megalitres. We need higher water allocations to grow rice and to grow everything else that we do in the Riverina. I have spoken to the New South Wales primary industries minister, Niall Blair, about this. Water is critically important to the Riverina. I am glad it is back in the agriculture portfolio and I am glad the 1,500 gigalitre legislation has passed.
