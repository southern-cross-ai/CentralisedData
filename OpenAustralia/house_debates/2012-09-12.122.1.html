        Throughout the year I have met with some inspirational young Australians from my electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Connor" rel="nofollow">
         O'Connor
        </a>
        who suffer from type 1 diabetes. These constituents include Lauren Hope-Blythe of Katanning and Rebecca Slater of Esperance. I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the bravery of these young Australians and the tireless work of these constituents and their families in raising awareness about the disease particularly through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juvenile_Diabetes_Research_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation
        </a>
        .

        Recently I met with Lauren and her mother, Sue, in my Albany office. During that meeting I was privileged that Lauren shared with me a personal poem she wrote about her struggle with type 1 diabetes. Lauren wrote this poem when she was nine years old and agreed for me to share it in the chamber today. The poem is titled
        <i>
         My wish
        </i>
        . Lauren writes:

        I implore all members in this place to hear Lauryn's story and act on this issue. In November this year, both Lauryn and Rebecca will be part of a special group of advocates from the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation who will be visiting
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        . These delegates will be in Parliament House as part of a Promise to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remember_Me" rel="nofollow">
         Remember Me
        </a>
        campaignâ€”a campaign designed to start a conversation with MPs about type 1 diabetes and why the government needs to support more research. I note that the foundation is currently seeking federal government funding for an Australian type 1 diabetes clinical research network, and I fully support this request. I implore members of this House to have this conversation with diabetes sufferers and to hear their stories firsthand when they visit Parliament House this year.

        There is no known cure for type 1 diabetes. Research is the only way in which type 1 diabetes management can be improved and eventually cured.
