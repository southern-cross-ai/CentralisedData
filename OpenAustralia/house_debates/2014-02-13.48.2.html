        I wish to note that today marks six years since the historic national apology given by then Prime Minister Rudd and supported by then Opposition Leader Nelson here in this parliament. It was a historic day in our national life. It was a day when ancient wrongs and ancient injustices were recognised and acknowledged. The marvellous thing about that day was that an apology was given and, as I read the mood of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous Australia
        </a>
        that day, the apology was accepted. I say to the Indigenous people of our country: your grace and forgiveness has been a mark of character.
       </p>
       <p>
        In calling to mind and remembering the national apology, it is important to note that this is not the first fault-free generation in history and certainly this generation is not morally superior to its predecessors. I am confident that future generations will learn from our mistakes just as we have learned from the mistakes of our predecessors. Nevertheless, on this day it is important to acknowledge that historic day just six years ago, to place on record our appreciation of what

         Today we mark the sixth anniversary of a healing moment of national unity. I, like many other members in this place who were here that day, will never forget that remarkable moment when Prime Minister Rudd said sorry and reached out for a nation's forgiveness. I associate myself with the remarks of the Prime Minister also in acknowledging the Hon.

         's words on that day. What I saw that day in the galleries and as people were making their path to the parliament to hear these words, and what I saw of Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         Australians not only here but around Australia, was an acceptance of Prime Minister Rudd's words with grace and understanding. The national apology marked the end of a damaging period of division and denial. It showed that Australia had come a long way in its willingness to face a historical truth and to right the wrongs of the past.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, it is not enough for us to look back on that occasion with fondness, because the apology was also a declaration of intent, a call to close the gap and deliver meaningful change in education, health and employment outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. Until all of us, from the first Australians to our newest arrivals, enjoy the same opportunities for a long and happy life full of meaning and quality, this anniversary will always remind us that there is still more to do.
