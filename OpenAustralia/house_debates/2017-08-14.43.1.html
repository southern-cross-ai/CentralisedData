        Last week we launched
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Science_Week" rel="nofollow">
         National Science Week
        </a>
        and, as part of that, students from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulladulla_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Ulladulla High School
        </a>
        came to celebrate the completion of their work for Young Australians' Plan for the Planet. Their idea was to set an agenda on 20 aspects of policymaking for the next five years to address the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals. While we know that much more practical work has to be done, it was exciting to see that half the Ulladulla team were female students. This in itself is one of the

        development goals, that of gender equity. Thank you, Gemma Smith—their teacher—for your efforts both on the day and in all the months beforehand. I was proud to meet students Anna Potter, Taseka Frank and Lachlan Page, then introduce them in my local community radio interview with Barry Mack and Chance Hanlon.

        Last week was also a celebration week for our international efforts on gender equity. The Australian parliament hosted six female MPs from Myanmar. I, along with five other female MPs, mentor these passionate and dedicated women. I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon.

        , for her assistance through allowing the program to visit Australia. One of the ways to make a significant bond and encourage women in politics is to create a positive support network, and this was very much the outcome. Women truly do hold up half the sky—as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation promotes—and we should do everything we can to help women, from encouraging the study of science to mentoring women toward political leadership. Give women and girls a chance and they will achieve and shine as stars in the sky.
