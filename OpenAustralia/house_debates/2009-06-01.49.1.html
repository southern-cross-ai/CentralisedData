        My question is directed to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government
        </a>
        . I refer the minister to the paper that he tabled in parliament today outlining a list of projects to be funded under Labor’s new off-network road program, with money taken from the Regional Strategic Roads Program. What public and open processes were used to choose these projects? How is it that, of the $655 million to be spent, over $540 million is to be spent in Labor electorates?

         I thank the shadow minister for his question. Perhaps now they have managed to work out that they actually voted on the amendments prior to question time. Maybe they worked out what they actually voted on before. What they voted on was indeed the off-network road projects. The shadow minister complains about the electorates that are funded. Perhaps the member for Calare is opposed to the North Orange Bypass—$10 million. Perhaps the member for Wannon is opposed to the $600,000 that is going into the Warrnambool Intermodal Terminal. Perhaps the member for Murray is opposed to the Shepparton Intermodal Terminal. Perhaps the member for

          Mr Speaker, on a point of order: my question is about the $540 million being spent in Labor electorates.

           Order! The Leader of the Nationals will resume his seat. Again I stress that members when they come to the dispatch box for a point of order can make their point of order and then, when I am in a position to decide on the point of order, I invite them to return to their seat. It is not an opportunity to come up and enter into a debate. The minister is responding to the question.

            Perhaps they are opposed to the $60 million that is being provided for improved access to Esperance port in the electorate of Kalgoorlie or the upgrading of

             Hepburn Avenue
            </a>
            in Northern Perth in the electorate of Cowan. Perhaps they are opposed to the Tasmanian projects, including $15 million for the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston_Bypass" rel="nofollow">
             Kingston Bypass
            </a>
            in the electorate of Franklin. The member for Franklin supports that project. The members on this side support every one of the projects that we have just voted for. Those opposite have voted against each and every one of these projects by moving the amendments. They voted against the projects in the division that took place prior to question time. Not only do they not know anything about policy development, infrastructure development and nation building but also they know absolutely nothing about the procedures in this House. They want to not only dissociate themselves from the way that they voted on the $42 billion package but also dissociate themselves at 20 minutes past three from what they did at two o’clock. It simply does not stack up in their own electorates.
           </p>
           <p>
            The fact is that we have put forward $35 billion in nation-building transport infrastructure. We have made sure, when it comes to the Nation Building Program, that we have $26 billion from the Commonwealth, matched with $6 billion from states and territories—all up delivering nation-building infrastructure right around the nation. Those opposite know that the majority of that Nation Building Program funding is actually in coalition electorates—the majority of the funding that they are so offended by, because they are just offended by infrastructure development. Those opposite believe it should all be left to the market. That is why, after 12 long years of coalition government, we are busy repairing the infrastructure deficit that we inherited, we are busy creating jobs, we are busy stimulating the economy and we will continue to nation build into the future.
