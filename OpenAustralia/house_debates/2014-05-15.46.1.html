        On Sunday, 4 May I had the pleasure of attending the Gladysdale Primary School annual festival. It was the 30th anniversary of their annual festival, a festival which raises money for the school. It was a great community event with many stalls run by local businesses, parents, past parents and teachers, who all combined to raise $12,000, which will be used for new play equipment and reversible basketball rings. I want to pay tribute to the principal, Mr John Shackleton, to all of the teachers and to the school council, who put in so much work in trying conditions—freezing cold weather in the heart of the

        on that Sunday morning—to bring about a successful festival again this year.

        It was also a great community-building event. There were a number of competitions. I make mention of the winners of the scarecrow competition, Amy Knight and Maddy Bennett, who took out first prize with their pink-themed scarecrow. This was part of their ongoing campaign to raise money for breast cancer research and they donated their $100 prize to that cause as they continue their fundraising throughout the course of the year.
