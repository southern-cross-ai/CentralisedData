        Today I want to pay tribute to a stalwart of northern Tasmania's theatre scene, Marcus Bower, who recently passed away after a long illness. Marcus was loved and appreciated for his support for and involvement in local theatre as an actor, writer, director and committee member. He first joined the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launceston_Players" rel="nofollow">
         Launceston Players
        </a>
        in 1974 for

        . He'll be missed by students and staff at

        </a>
        , where his teaching career saw him direct over 40 performances. As well as the Launceston Players, Marcus worked for a number of local theatre companies, including CentreStage, Three Rivers Theatre, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Nick_Company" rel="nofollow">
         Old Nick Company

        and the Encore Theatre Company, and played a role in launching the first Tasmanian Theatre Awards in 2014. In 2019, Marcus himself was recognised with a lifetime achievement award for his work.

        Marcus was a film critic for local newspaper

        for more than 25 years and was the driving force behind the popular annual review at the

        pub, a tradition to end the week before Christmas. For other well-known identities in the theatre scene, Marcus was a valued mentor. Belinda King, president of the award-winning Encore Theatre Company, told
        <i>

        :
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        When Encore first emerged he was forthcoming with honest reviews and knowledgeable critique, which helped to shape the company we've become.
       </p>
       <p>
        Above all, Marcus was a husband and father, and my thoughts are with his partner, Suzie, and his two children. Vale, Marcus Bower.
