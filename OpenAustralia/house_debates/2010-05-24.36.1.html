        My question is to the Minister for Education. Can the minister explain why, under the school hall program over which she has presided, a cubbyhouse canteen, like this one at the Orange Grove Public School, could cost taxpayers $25,000 per square metre yet not be able to fit a stove, but a canteen like this one at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Trinity_Catholic_School" rel="nofollow">
         Holy Trinity Catholic School
        </a>
        costs only $2½ thousand a square metre and even has space for coldrooms? Does the minister understand why people like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Bennett" rel="nofollow">
         Rick Bennett
        </a>
        , P&amp;C chair at Tottenham Central School, whose government-issue canteen cost $600,000 and cannot fit a fridge, could be absolutely, bloody gutted by the waste and mismanagement of the school hall rip-off program?

         I thank the shadow minister for education for his question, and I await his explanation of the $425 million they want to rip out of quality teaching and the more than $3 billion they want to rip out of education after having governed for almost 12 long years, a wasted decade. But, on the question that the shadow minister has asked me, I will take some advice from the Attorney-General about whether he has breached the copyright of the
         <i>
          Australian
         </i>
         newspaper. Should it turn out that he has breached that copyright, then I am sure that publishers of the
         <i>
          Australian
         </i>
         newspaper will take the appropriate action. Having seen the story in the
         <i>
          Australian
         </i>
         newspaper from which the photograph has come and which has just been held up to the House, I read the words in the newspaper as well.

                   Order! The House will come to order! Order! It is now time for me to phone a friend! But anyway, on the point of order, the argument having been allowed by me in the question in contravention of the standing orders, there is a little bit of leeway in the answer. The Deputy Prime Minister is responding to the question.

                    If only they put such energy into developing policies and their budget reply! Coming back to the question from the shadow minister for education, brought to you by the

                    </i>
                    newspaper, yes, I did see the story. Of course, as I have said on the public record on a number of occasions, often the cost comparisons we see published are not correct. But I am very determined that we see value for money. I want every dollar that goes to schools to make the biggest difference for schools. That is why I have appointed the

                    Implementation Taskforce, led by a leading Australian businessman, Brad Orgill, to focus on these questions. I say to the members opposite: if they actually have any serious concerns they should research them themselves, as opposed to just reading things in the media. If they ever spend just one minute doing any work and if they actually have a complaint then they can raise it with the implementation task force.

                    On the matter of photographs and Building the Education Revolution, I am very happy to say to the House that I have some photographs, and I would love to see them in the

                        The Deputy Prime Minister will resume her seat. Before giving the call to the member for Sturt, can I say that it is not usual to give advisory rulings. In fact, I try not to do that. But I would suggest to him that he does not, as part of his point of order, try to supplement it by showing things, as he is attempting to do at the moment. So he will place his props back on the dispatch box.
