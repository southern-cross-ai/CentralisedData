       <p>
        Early voting begins this week in Queensland, and I commend to the community of The Gap, Ashgrove and Bardon the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        candidate Trent Wiseman. Already he is getting things done, having secured much-needed funding for an upgrade to our local and iconic
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS" rel="nofollow">
         GPS
        </a>
        and Valley cricket clubs. GPS and Valley cricket clubs have played a historic role in the community, and almost every local family has positive memories of their time involved in these clubs. The upgrade plans that Trent has been able to secure funding for will deliver much-needed facilities for the growing number of female players, a larger function space for club members and a new gym, so that they can continue to produce some of the best competition players in Queensland. I, together with Trent Wiseman, am committed to supporting the GPS and Valley, and I'll be working to leverage the funding needed and provided by the state LNP team to see the upgrade project completed. Locally, I've seen Labor let the community down by not managing the budget correctly, and only an LNP government will provide Queensland with the financial security to get this project delivered.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm also working with Trent to address congestion on the Metroad 5. Here the inaction of the state Labor government could not be more stark. Despite the federal government handing the state Labor government $10 million to investigate upgrades to this congested road corridor, they have done nothingâ€”nada, zip, zilch. They haven't done a thing. Only an LNP team at the federal and state government levels, working together with Trent Wiseman as the local LNP member and myself as the local federal member, will ensure that our local community gets the upgraded facilities and roads that they deserve.
