       <p>
        I present the report of the Australian delegation to the 134th assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union held in Lusaka, Zambia from 19 to 23 March this year. I ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased to present the report of the Australian parliamentary delegation that participated in the 134th Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly, held in Lusaka, Zambia from 19 to 23 March this year. It was my privilege to lead the delegation, which also comprised the member for Werriwa, the member for Forrest, and Senators Bernardi and Lines. This was a hardworking and successful delegation, and all members played an active role at the various proceedings of the assembly. The delegation attended formal sessions of the assembly and its governing council and participated in meetings of the Asia-Pacific and Twelve Plus geopolitical groups. Our participation in the geopolitical groups was a good opportunity to raise matters of like-minded colleagues and workshop issues before debate in the plenary session.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the assembly, I participated in the general debate on the topic of rejuvenating democracy and used this opportunity to explain the measures that the parliament and other organisations, such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Electoral_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Electoral Commission
        </a>
        , are undertaking to ensure that the next generation of Australians is ready to participate in our democratic processes. Another important business item of the assembly involved two sessions of the meeting of women parliamentarians, which
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Lines" rel="nofollow">
         Senator Lines
        </a>
        was able to attend.
       </p>
       <p>
        Once again, the delegation participated in the work of the various standing committees. The member for Werriwa attended the four sittings of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Standing Committee
        </a>
        on Peace and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Security" rel="nofollow">
         International Security
        </a>
        as it debated and drafted a resolution on terrorism. Senator Lines was a panellist at the proceedings of the Standing Committee on Democracy and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Rights" rel="nofollow">
         Human Rights
        </a>
        as it considered a resolution originally proposed by an earlier Australian delegation, in 2015, on the participation of women in the political process. Once again, the member for Forrest continued her work as a leading member of the steering group for the Standing Committee on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_Development" rel="nofollow">
         Sustainable Development
        </a>
        , Finance and Trade. I particularly wish to report to the House that her role in chairing an extended drafting session on a complex resolution concerning the protection of cultural heritage was roundly applauded by all and that the resolution was adopted by the assembly at its final session.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the key benefits of every assembly is the opportunity for delegates to participate in formal and informal discussions and meetings with a wide range of representatives from other parliaments and international organisations. Senator Bernardi and Senator Lines were pleased to meet with the Fijian delegation and receive an update on recovery efforts since parts of that country were devastated by Cyclone Winston in February this year. In addition to our demanding schedule at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPU" rel="nofollow">
         IPU
        </a>
        , the member for Werriwa and I were able and privileged to visit
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_School" rel="nofollow">
         St Paul's School
        </a>
        in the northern part of Lusaka and see firsthand how Australian assistance is making a difference to some of Zambia's poorest children.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Deputy Clerk of the House accompanied the delegation to attend the meeting of the Association of Secretaries General of Parliaments, which is held in conjunction with the IPU. Details of this meeting are also included in the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        The IPU assembly provides an opportunity for delegations to meet colleagues and deal with a wide range of issues of mutual interest at both an informal and a formal level. It is also a unique form of professional development for parliamentarians to foster understanding of different parliamentary models and to strengthen parliament-to-parliament relationships. The 134th assembly did not disappoint in this regard.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the Australian travelling party, I would like to thank everyone who contributed to the success of this delegation. In particular, I wish to acknowledge the support provided by the Australian Deputy High Commissioner to Zambia, Mr Joel McGregor, who provided a wide range of practical support and local advice to the delegation while we were in Lusaka. His Canberra based colleagues at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Foreign_Affairs_and_Trade" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade
        </a>
        , Mr Martin Neuhaus and Mrs Natalie Boyes, also provided detailed and useful briefings to the delegation.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to extend the delegation's thanks to the staff of the Parliamentary Library for providing comprehensive and timely briefing materials prior to departure and to staff in the International and Parliamentary Relations Office for their support.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I thank my fellow delegates for their thoughtful participation in the assembly's meetings and their commitment to our program of work, which has led to the high regard in which the Australian delegation is held by a range of people associated with the Inter-Parliamentary Union across the globe. I am also thankful for the support we received from the department prior to leaving, from the secretary to our delegation and in the Senate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the report to the House.
