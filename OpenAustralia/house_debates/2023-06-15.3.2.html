       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.

       <p>
        The Home Affairs Bill 2023 will establish an act for the termination of the lease held by the government of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Federation" rel="nofollow">
         Russian Federation
        </a>
        on a parcel of land adjacent to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        located at block 26, section 44 of the division of Yarralumla,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Capital Territory
        </a>
        . The bill will terminate any lease, any equitable or legal right, interest, trust, restriction, obligation, mortgage, encumbrance, contract, licence or charge granted or arising under or pursuant to a relevant lease or independence on a relevant lease in respect to the specified land. This action is absolutely necessary to protect Australia's national security interests, something that this parliament and our government will never shy away from.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are not currently any diplomatic or consular premises on the land. This action does not preclude the Russian Federation from a diplomatic presence here in Canberra, which they maintain at their existing premises, in Griffith, Australian Capital Territory. The termination of the lease has no impact on their Griffith site. This legislation is consistent with Australia's obligations under international law.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill includes a provision that, if, by its operation, it results in an acquisition of property within the meaning of paragraph 51(xxxi) of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Constitution" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Constitution
        </a>
        , the Commonwealth is liable to pay a reasonable amount of compensation. This bill demonstrates the government's continued commitment to protecting our parliament and our national security. The Australian government maintains diplomatic relations with the Russian Federation, but we will always act in Australia's national interest.

        <p>
         I rise in support of this bill, the Home Affairs Bill 2023, which terminates the lease over block 26, section 44 in the division of Yarralumla, only a stone's throw away from this house. The coalition stands with the government on this issue, as we will always act to protect our national interest against risks posed by authoritarian powers.
        </p>
        <p>
         It was only five years ago that the former coalition government, with bipartisan support, passed historic and world-leading espionage and foreign interference laws to protect against unprecedented levels of espionage and foreign interference. We note that the task of preserving our sovereignty, especially our political sovereignty, which includes this House, is an ongoing task. Our adversaries adapt and so must we.
        </p>
        <p>
         Russia has not acted in good faith towards its neighbours in recent times. As the Prime Minister said this morning, it has launched an invasion of Ukraine that is both immoral and illegal, which has led to the deaths of thousands of innocents. It continues its campaign there, trashing the principles of territorial and political sovereignty.
        </p>
        <p>
         There is a trust deficit; there is a real risk to our national interest here, and the security advice is that this lease must be terminated. Therefore, we support this bill, and I commend it to the House.
        </p>
        <p>
         Question agreed to.
        </p>
        <p>
         Bill read a second time.
