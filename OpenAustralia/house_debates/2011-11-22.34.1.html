        My question is to the Prime Minister. If the Prime Minister respects working families, as she now claims, why did she lie to the Australian people before the last election when she said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead'?

            Order! I would remind those on my left that they cannot expect immunity just because they act as a collective. I would have thought that, with a question having been asked, they would actually sit there quietly to at least listen to the answer, if they thought the question was worth asking.

              Order! The member for Dickson is warned and, if he looks sideways, he will be named. He has the record for the most number of standing order 94(a) ejections. He is always very careful when warned not to tempt the day, but I am watching him. I warned him yesterday and he knows that, if he wants to get a response properly from me, there is a way to do it. Last week I was told that a letter I sent to the Senate reminding them of my powers over the galleries applied to senators and was, in some way, directed to only a portion of the Senate. Well, it was not on that occasion. The warning I am about to give about my powers to deal with the galleries also applies to the advisers boxes. I expect all those in advisers boxes to sit there quietly. I can understand that they may not be able to do that when their employers sitting in the benches of the chamber cannot do it themselves. Everybody will sit here quietly. Those sitting in the public gallery should not be the only people in this room that are behaving. The Prime Minister has the call.

               Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. If we ever needed an example of the bluster and lack of substance of the opposition, we have just seen one. To the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, who asked the question, I say the following: how dare any member of the opposition come to the dispatch box and say the words 'working families'. How dare they after their record in government. How dare they after they imposed

                  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I was asked very directly about my commitment to working families and I am answering that question. I am doing that by saying that this is a Labor government committed to the interests of working families. That is why we killed the disgusting product—

                      , beloved by the Leader of the Opposition and beloved by his deputy, and it will be back in five minutes if they ever have the opportunity to do so. Our commitment to working people has been demonstrated by the approach we took to rebuilding the nation after the summer of floods—opposed every step of the way by those opposite. Our commitment to working people has been shown by the rolling out of our health reform—opposed every step of the way by those opposite. Our commitment to working people and their prosperity and the services they need in the future is shown by rolling out the technology of the future, the

                      —opposed every step of the way by the Leader of the Opposition. Our commitment to working people is shown by our commitment to working women and equal pay, something opposed by the opposition. We have added to that commitment today with a commitment to safe rates which will inevitably be opposed by the Leader of the Opposition. We are showing our commitment to working people by trebling the tax-free threshold—opposed by the Leader of the Opposition. We are showing our commitment to older Australians by increasing the pension—opposed by the Leader of the Opposition. We are showing our commitment to working families by increasing family payments—opposed by the Leader of the Opposition—and on and on and on the list goes.

                        This is a nation that has committed itself to cutting carbon pollution. The cheapest way to do that is through the government's scheme. The most expensive way of doing that is to do it the way the Leader of the Opposition, today, supports. This government supports putting a price that big polluters pay and putting money in the pockets of working families. The Leader of the Opposition actually supports the complete reverse, taking money out of the pockets of working families and giving it to big polluters.

                       <p>
                        Let me conclude by saying this: all of this pretence and fear campaigning is part of a grand cover-up that the Leader of the Opposition, like every other living Liberal leader, supports putting a price on carbon pollution. It is time he gave up this fear campaigning and just said it.

It might have been missed by some members, but it was not missed by me: during the Prime Minister's answer she said that the opposition opposed the rebuilding of Queensland after the floods.

                           Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order: during the Prime Minister's answer she said that the coalition opposed equal pay for women. We do not and I take offence at that statement and I ask her to withdraw it.

                            Order! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume her seat. The member for Fowler will resume his seat. These points of order prove a matter I have tried to have addressed by the House: that question time is not a debating time and it would assist if debate was not allowed in the answers, because these are not matters for withdrawal on a personal basis; they are rather debating items. If, at some stage, I can get the agreement of political forces within this place that you would like to even the playing field of question time, we might be able to address these matters.
