        My question is to the Minister for Environment and Energy. Will the minister update the House on how the government is ensuring investment certainty for the Carmichael mine in Queensland while putting in place strict and proper environmental conditions? Is the minister aware of any alternative approaches?

         I thank the member for Mallee for his question and acknowledge his deep concern to create jobs across regional Australia. Indeed, the Carmichael mine has the potential to create 4,000 direct jobs and up to 8,000 indirect jobs. The government, through the powerful work of my predecessor, the member for Flinders, put in place 36 of the strictest environmental conditions under the

         Act, including implementing all of the advice of the independent expert scientific committee; putting aside 31,000 hectares of habitat for the black-throated finch, 5Â½ thousand hectares of habitat for the yakka skink and 135 hectares of habitat for the ornamental snake; and ensuring that there will be more money for conservation and that water management will be monitored closely.

         We know where the members for Dawson and Capricornia are on the issue of the Carmichael mine. But where is the member for Herbert? The member for Herbert, rightly, is confused. The Leader of the Opposition says, 'I support the Adani mine.' But the member for Batman and the member for Wills, chasing green votes in the city, have come out against the mine. Senator

         has said it is a 'huge mistake'. The member for Griffith said she does not support the mine. And Labor's climate change spokesman, the member for

         , says that the Carmichael mine will cost jobs elsewhere in Queensland. Go figure that!
        </p>
        <p>
         So who do you believe? Do you believe the Leader of the Opposition, who says he supports it? No. Do you support his backbench, who say they are against it? No. Do you support the opposition spokesman on climate change, who says it is going to cost jobs? Or do you support the member for Shortland? The member for Shortland is the shadow climate change spokesman. This is what he had to say about the Carmichael mine: 'I welcome the jobs it will provide for Queensland.' He said Adani was 'entirely consistent' with Labor's climate change policies. And this is the best, Mr Speaker. Listen closely.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         People who are saying that we can solve climate change by shutting down Adani are kidding themselves.

         So we have division in the state party of Queensland, we have division across the unions and now we have division in the federal opposition.
