       <p>
        It is an honour to follow the member for Lingiari and also the member for Chifley. I am here to pay tribute to a man who was a scholar and a senator. He was from the other side of politics and from the other chamber. He was a Liberal senator, but he was also, for a very long time, a teacher, an academic, a writer and a thinker. I am so grateful for the opportunity to be able to put on the parliamentary record my admiration for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Trood" rel="nofollow">
         Russell Trood
        </a>
        . Russell was a man who cared very deeply for his students, for his colleagues, for his country and for his country's place in the world. There are so many reasons why I admire Russell Trood. Principally I admire Russell because he was, for me, an inspirational teacher at university; he was my lecturer in international relations at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffith_University" rel="nofollow">
         Griffith University
        </a>
        . His loss—firstly, to the Senate in 2011 and, now, to this world—is something that we should mark, because his contribution was so significant.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to speak not necessarily just as a Labor MP but as a student of Russell's in the mid-1990s. Twenty-one years ago, almost to the day, I met Russell Trood for the first time. It was the first week of my first year at Griffith University. I had much longer hair then and my fair share of an 18-year-old's acne. I found myself in an international relations theory lecture, and it dawned on me very soon after the start of the lecture that I had been enrolled in error as a first-year student in a third-year course. As it dawned on me, I got the predictable amount of terror that I was in the wrong place. When I got up the courage afterwards to go and see Russell to explain what had happened and to work out how to extract myself from his course, he said, 'Come and walk me back to my office.' We got talking and we spent quite a bit of time together, and, after a little while, he said: 'You are enrolled in error, but I think you might be okay in the course. Why don't I just keep an eye on you. Why don't I just lend you all these books'—and he started pulling all these books off his shelves from his personal collection to lend to me so that I could catch up. He kept an eye on me throughout that whole course, and he would check in regularly and say: 'If you feel like you're falling behind, or whatever, come and see me; I will spend some time with you. Bring us a cup of tea, and we'll have a chat about the course material.'
       </p>
       <p>
        I tell that story partly because it goes to the care that Russell had for his students, his considerate nature and the way he was such a thoughtful lecturer but also because I do not think my story was necessarily unique. I do not tell the story because I think it is a unique one; I tell it because I suspect it was a pretty common experience for people who were taught by Russell at Griffith University. He was an inspiring teacher. Griffith University is blessed on that front. There were so many people who were so influential in my time at Griffith University, and Russell was one of those extraordinary teachers whose lectures were something to be enjoyed and not just endured. International relations theory was always about Clausewitz, Morgenthau, Thucydides, Joe Nye and all of these sorts of characters, and Russell always had a way to balance the heft of some of those subjects with a little bit of wry humour as well, which people who know him would be familiar with.
       </p>
       <p>
        So much of this early period of knowing Russell as a student came back to me first when he left the Senate in 2011, then when he passed away very recently but also, especially, last Friday when Griffith University, to their great credit, put on a memorial service for Russell. The member for Ryan and the member for Wright, who are in the chamber now, were also there, and I am sure they agree that it was such a fitting tribute to a great man.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to commend Henry Smerdon,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_O'Connor" rel="nofollow">

         Andrew O'Neill
        </a>
        and everyone from their teams who was involved last Friday in putting on such a fitting tribute to Russell Trood for his colleagues, his friends and his family at the conservatorium of music in Brisbane. There were so many people there from all parts of Russell's life, including current and former senators that Russell served with. I think they brought great credit on themselves through the tributes that they paid to Russell.
       </p>
       <p>
        In particular, I wanted to pick up on a point that Senator Brandis made in what was a very moving contribution. What Senator Brandis said was that it was quite easy to mistake Russell's civility for a lack of partisan passion. But I appreciate that Russell was really a passionate Liberal warrior. He was a small 'l' Liberal warrior, but he had been in the Liberal Party since his Young Liberal days in Sydney. He was a warrior for his cause, but he carried himself in such a classy way and in such a civil way that people would easily mistake the sort of way that he carried himself for being something less than a fully-engaged warrior for the things that he and his party—and the member for Ryan's and the member for Wright's party—believed in. I thought that was a good point that Senator Brandis made.
       </p>
       <p>
        From my point of view, I would quite often be on a plane with Russell, or I would see him at the airport or I would see him at the Griffith Asia Institute. I was reminded of his partisanship when he generally made a version of the same reference to the great horror that he felt that he had taught so many students who went on to join the Labor Party. He consider that to be a great failure on his part—that, in his words, he had churned out so many Labor kids and not a Tory amongst them! He would generally make a joke of that nature when I would run into him around the place from time to time. But there were also words of encouragement, which was a characteristic of Russell's.
       </p>
       <p>
        His family were at the memorial last Friday—his wife, Dale, his daughter, Phoebe and his brother, Artie. He also had a son, James—I can only imagine how much they miss him. The version that I got to see of Russell was sparing, apart from that initial engagement at Griffith. I am sure they consider themselves very fortunate to have had so much time with such a great person, husband, brother and father. So we send them, of course, our condolences. On behalf of all the students, really, who were taught by Russell, and on behalf of our side of the House of Representatives, I do want to say that he was an accomplished, decent, thoughtful and considerate man—a man who cared so much about his students, his colleagues and his country, and his country's place in the world. May he rest in eternal peace.

         It is with great sadness that I rise today to speak on this condolence motion for the former senator, Emeritus Professor

         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Russell died shortly after his 68th birthday on 9 January this year—much too young, and with so much more to contribute. His passing came as a shock for so many friends and colleagues. Russell's family held a small, private funeral service at the time, but I was pleased to be able to join with them and other friends, including the former speaker, the member for Rankin, at a memorial service hosted last Friday in Brisbane by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffith_University" rel="nofollow">

        <p>
         The parliament was well represented, particularly by the moving tributes paid by the

         . Of course, we were joined by many of Russell's colleagues and friends, including the member for Wright, who is going to speak later today.
        </p>
        <p>
         A few years my senior, Russell grew up, as I did, in Sydney, where he joined the Pymble Young Liberals and I the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradleys_Head" rel="nofollow">
          Bradleys Head
         </a>
         branch and the Mosman Young Liberals. However, after completing his law degree at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
          University of Sydney
         </a>
         , Russell went to Canada and the United Kingdom where he undertook further studies and returned as a scholar and lecturer at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_National_University" rel="nofollow">
          Australian National University
         </a>
         . Then in 1989 he was recruited by Griffith University and became Director of the Centre for the Study of Australia-Asian Relations from 1990 until shortly before his election to the Senate. Our paths crossed again when he became involved in the Sherwood branch of the Liberal Party in the 1990s.
        </p>
        <p>
         In 2004 Russell won preselection for the third position on the Liberal Party Senate ticket. Now, in those days the Liberal Party and the National Party ran separate tickets, so the No. 3 candidate was considered very unlikely to win. However, in that election the National Party also had a newcomer on their ticket—a bloke by the name of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnaby_Joyce" rel="nofollow">
          Barnaby Joyce
         </a>
         . So the Liberal ticket comprised
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Mason" rel="nofollow">
          Brett Mason
         </a>
         , George Brandis and Russell Trood. In his tribute to Russell, Senator Brandis regaled us with a very colourful recollection of that campaign, with three quite different candidates with quite different tastes and habits becoming very close friends and, as history records, Senate colleagues together. That was the election in which the voters of Queensland delivered four coalition senators out of six positions and gave
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
          Prime Minister John Howard
         </a>
         a majority in the Senate.
        </p>
        <p>
         Russell's gentle, polite, hardworking and knowledgeable contribution to parliament earned him the respect of his colleagues across all political lines. Former Leader of the Government in the Senate,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Evans" rel="nofollow">
          Chris Evans
         </a>
         , said of him at the time of his leaving the Senate:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I think it was good for the Liberal Party and for the Senate that you were elected … You also behave much more like people's image of a traditional senator.
        </p>
        <p>
         …   …   …
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Rather than being a grubby party politician, he brings free thought, an interest in ideas and a style that reflects that sort of approach. I say that very genuinely. I think the parliament and the Senate have benefited from his academic background and expertise …
        </p>
        <p>
         I also want to refer again to the thoughtful recollections of Senator George Brandis, who reflected on Russell that:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         As a scholar and in particular as a scholar of history, Russell was interested in the long run. He could see the course of events not over hours, days or weeks but over years and decades. He was one of the only voices in the coalition party room to oppose the invasion of Iraq. He said, 'Loathsome as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein" rel="nofollow">
          Saddam Hussein
         </a>
         is, if we displace the regional strongman, that will destabilise Iraq with unpredictable consequences not only for Iraq but for the rest of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
          Middle East
         </a>
         . In years to come, we will still not know how unstable we will have made that region.'
        </p>
        <p>
         As Senator Brandis said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         With the learning of history, who can say that he was wrong?'
        </p>
        <p>
         I will continue to quote from Senator George Brandis:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In 2008 he—
        </p>
        <p>
         Russell—
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         was a vigorous opponent of the amalgamation of the Liberal and National parties in Queensland. He said, 'If you fuse the parties, you will create a political space on the right, particularly in regional Queensland, that may well be filled by either the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Nation" rel="nofollow">
          One Nation
         </a>
         party or other more right-wing parties.' Who can say that he was wrong? So Russell had a wisdom born both of experience and of deep learning.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the Senate this week, Senator Penny Wong also spoke about Russell and reflected on Russell's own comments. She said that he noted the importance of education and that he said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Ideas and education matter, not just for the prosperity they promise but because free and open societies depend on them.
        </p>
        <p>
         She said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Professor Trood also acknowledged the role of the Senate as a means of 'ensuring the accountability of the executive arm of government' whilst, in the context of a governing party majority of which he was part, noting that an enduring source of the Senate's political legitimacy is that it was properly elected.
        </p>
        <p>
         Other tributes also came from many other colleagues and I would like to reflect on those, particularly those from the class of 2004. Barnaby Joyce said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Russell was a gentle man. Smart, kind and wanting this empathy to be part of the tapestry of the political purpose of our nation. For our nation to advance by being smart, not boorish. Russell was taken long before his time was due, but he left a great legacy far beyond the length of his tenure in politics.
        </p>
        <p>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Fiona_Nash" rel="nofollow">
          Senator Fiona Nash
         </a>
         , also from the class of 2004, said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Russell Trood was one of life's absolute gentlemen. It was an honour to have known him. He was intelligent, gracious, charming and had a beautiful sense of humour. He understood politics well, and one of his many, many good traits was that he always looked to the positive. There is no one like in the parliament. He will be very much missed, but the enormous contribution he made to the lives of so many Australians will live on.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, yet another from the class of 2004, said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Doctor Trood definitely was the intellect of the class of 2004!
        </p>
        <p>
         These comments came not just from the conservative side. Senator
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Siewert" rel="nofollow">
          Rachel Siewert
         </a>
         , the longest serving Greens senator and whip said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I respected his work and depth of understanding of foreign policy and welcomed his contribution to Parliamentary debates.
        </p>
        <p>
         Senator Helen Polley said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Russell was an articulate and considered contributor to any debate he participated in.
        </p>
        <p>
         As I noted previously, Russell was held in high regard by all parts of the political spectrum. When I came to federal parliament in 2010, I considered myself fortunate to be able to sit with Russell and Senator Judith Troeth in the party room, where I benefited from their many years of experience and knowledge. One of the best pieces of advice Russell gave me in those days was to participate in the ADF parliamentary program. I naturally followed his advice and now pass it on to all new MPs. It is indeed one of the best interactions members of parliament can have with our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Defence Force
         </a>
         men and women and provides an invaluable insight that cannot be gained in other ways.
        </p>
        <p>
         Even after leaving the Senate and returning to academia, Russell continued to make a significant political contribution. Notably, the Prime Minister of the day,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">
          Kevin Rudd
         </a>

In doing so, Prime Minister Rudd stated Russell 'will bring his strong background in international relations to help strengthen Australia's relations with countries in Eastern Europe, the Balkans and the Caucuses, and will build on our considerable people-to-people links with these regions.' Of course, as we know, he also went on to make a wonderful contribution to the success of the G20 in Brisbane.

         Whilst I was familiar with Russell's political life, unlike the member for Rankin I did not appreciate the extent of his academic contribution until we heard some of the eulogies from his academic colleagues last Friday, and I realised that I had very little knowledge of his extensive academic contribution. However, the high respect and esteem in which he was held by his parliamentary colleagues clearly extended to his academic life as well. Professor Andrew O'Neil commented:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         During his distinguished career at Griffith University, Professor Emeritus Russell Trood personified the spirit of collegiality; he was balanced, compassionate, honest, and cosmopolitan in outlook.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         But above all, he possessed a basic humanity that inspired his academic peers and the legions of students he taught—
        </p>
        <p>
         clearly including the member for Rankin. Professor O'Neil also noted that Russell loved quotes, and he told him that the following from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Adams" rel="nofollow">
          John Adams

         , the second President of the United States, was one of Russell's favourites:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Let us tenderly and kindly cherish, therefore, the means of knowledge. Let us dare to read, think, speak, and write.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would like to finish with a poem that was actually read at his memorial and which was sent to his family at the time of his death by one of his academic colleagues. It is the 'Epitaph on a Friend', by

         An honest man here lies at rest,

        <p class="italic">
         The friend of man, the friend of truth,
        </p>
        <p class="italic">

        </p>

         If there is none, he made the best of this.
        </p>
        <p>
         A very fitting tribute to Russell Trood, and I extend my deepest sympathy to Dale; his son, James; daughter, Phoebe; and his brother, Arty.

          I do not often speak on condolence motions, but Senator Trood is a person that I would refer to as a personal friend and, having heard the contributions from both the member for Ryan and the member for Rankin, I want to associate myself with both of their comments. They were both heartfelt speeches, and I would probably not do the good senator justice in my delivery, but nevertheless I will give it my best shot.
         </p>
         <p>
          Senator Trood was a gifted man in the field of academia before coming to the Senate. He was far from fitting the profile of a Liberal senator; he was amongst the most left-wing-thinking in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffith_University" rel="nofollow">
           Griffith University
          </a>
          . He contested the seat. He always had an interest. He contested the third seat on the Liberal Senate ticket and, as the member for Ryan alluded to, a little-known-then
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnaby_Joyce" rel="nofollow">
           Barnaby Joyce
          </a>
          was contesting the second seat. It was uncommon—I think it was unprecedented—that Queensland returned four conservative senators at that election, with two from Labor. Nevertheless, history has written its pages, and Barnaby has gone on to bigger and better things. Senator

          is now serving in the diplomatic corps. Senator Brandis needs no introduction as the country's A-G.
         </p>
         <p>
          What was evident was the number of people in the room at the memorial, not the volume of people but the quality of people who were there. There were past senators who had come back. Senator Boswell was there and spoke to me at length about his relationships with Russell. Senator Brandis spoke at the memorial, as the member for Ryan alluded to. It was an amazing speech, as were all of them.
         </p>
         <p>
          I want to just draw your attention to one of the speeches there, which was from Senator Ronaldson. Senator Ronaldson and Senator Trood and their wives had been out for a function, and Ronno recalled the story that after the function they were in the car driving home, and Ronno's wife said to him: 'He's far too nice to be a senator. He's far too nice to be a politician.' Ronno said to his wife, 'You've never said that of me,' and her response was, 'You're right.' But
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russell_Trood" rel="nofollow">
           Russell Trood
          </a>
          was a terribly nice bloke.
         </p>
         <p>
          I was so privileged to see Senator Russell Trood some time ago, before he got ill. He passed away with thyroid cancer. I saw him at his best in the corridors here. He always had a passion for this place. He stayed connected to it. I saw him at his best, and that is the memory that I will hold of Senator Russell Trood. I was also fortunate to have him as my patron senator. I do not know about the Labor world, but as lower house members we have patron senators; they will look after a group of seats. The electorate of Wright was a new seat brought about by the redistribution, and Senator Trood was my patron senator. He came out in the first week during the campaign, and he suggested that it would be advantageous for me to travel with Senator Russell Trood around the electorate, and we did that.
         </p>
         <p>
          Just after lunch on one hot day we thought we would pop in at the Helidon pub. Helidon is a beautiful part of my electorate, with an old weatherboard pub. It was hot. It was the middle of the day. I said, 'We should duck into the pub for a quick cleansing ale, Senator.' He said, 'That sounds wonderful, except it's a little early.' I said: 'It's after 12 o'clock. Come on.' So we went into the pub, and I had some of my staff with me. I suggested to him, 'What would you like to drink?' He said, 'Oh, I'll have a white wine,' and I went, 'You're not having a white wine in the Helidon pub; you'll have a beer,' but I said, 'I'll see if I can get you a white wine.' I said to the barman, 'Mate, have you got any wine?' He said, 'Moselle.' I said, 'Just two Golds, thanks, brother.' So he drank a beer.
         </p>
         <p>
          I do not think he was that comfortable in the regional provinces of the electorate, but he was very, very comfortable on the international stage in and around foreign policy and foreign development. He served on parliamentary delegations to Japan,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa" rel="nofollow">
           South Africa
          </a>
          , Zimbabwe, Ghana and Ethiopia. He also served extensively on committees relating to foreign policy, from foreign affairs, defence and trade to intelligence and security. Our Prime Minister,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull" rel="nofollow">
           Malcolm Turnbull
          </a>
          , described Russell Trood as having one of the finest foreign policy minds. If he were still in the house as a senator—elevation can come in many different ways, but there needs to be some type of formula of talent, service of time, geographical location and mathematics—and if those planets aligned for him, I have no doubt that he would be serving in a higher capacity, a higher office, in and around somewhere in that foreign affairs portfolio space.
         </p>
         <p>
          Also at the memorial was the member for Rankin, the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_Senate" rel="nofollow">
           President of the Senate
          </a>
          , Senator O'Sullivan, state members and others. It was a memorial testament to his contributions both to academia and the parliament. But noteworthy of a gathering of that calibre was the number of staff who had served with Senator Trood. He did not have a high turnover of staff. As members of this place, we can let our minds go to members who churn staff through, for whatever reason it may be. Senator Russell Trood had a very stable staff when he was serving in office. I want to acknowledge Fraser Stephen—who is still a linchpin for that group and who brings the staff back together for Russell Trood on a regular basis—Marty Kennedy and Greg Birkbeck. Marty served with me when he finished with Russell in a media capacity and Greg Birkbeck today still serves as my chief of staff, which he has done from the day that I was elected. He has asked me to pass on, for the sake of
          <i>
           Hansard
          </i>
          , his deepest condolences to the family.
         </p>
         <p>
          Russell will be missed. It is a salient point, and a reminder to all of us in this place, that when we stand to talk about condolences that we often shower accolade and affirmation on people's contributions to either the parliament or to their communities. I just suggest that, at times like this, it would be so appropriate for us to be a little more generous in our community with the compliments that we pay to people who are alive so that they can hear it themselves. That affirmation could lift them and they could maybe make a greater contribution to communities. It saddens me that someone needs to leave this place—pass from this earth—before we shower them with accolade.
         </p>
         <p>
          Trood is worth the accolade that I have bestowed upon him this afternoon. He was a good man. He was a man who was well respected both in the political landscape and in the area of academia. I have not gone too much into his academia space because I did not know him then. I knew him when he was here. I also know Dale. I have met her a number of times in passing, such as passings at the airport. I remember the first time I met Dale, his wife. I pulled up and I gave Trood a hug because I had not seen him for a while. As they were walking away I could hear them, and his wife said, 'Who was that?' Trood's response was: 'He's one of the good fellas. He's one of the good guys.' So I will always have a soft spot in my heart for him. My heartfelt prayers and thoughts go to his many friends and his family—Dale, who I just spoke of, his two children, James and Phoebe, and his brother, Arty, who was at the funeral.
         </p>
         <p>
          Senator Russell Trood, rest in peace knowing that you will live on. You have left a little bit of you with me. I am a better person for having made your acquaintance, I am a better person for having known you, and I know there are many others in this place who share my thoughts.
