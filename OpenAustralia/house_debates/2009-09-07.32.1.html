        My question is to the Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism. What action is being taken to safely and quickly shut off the leaking well on the Montara oilfield?

         I thank the member for Hasluck for her question. All of us in this place share her concern. The Montara oil spill is a very unfortunate incident and we must do everything we can to make sure it does not happen again. Right now, however, our top priorities are to respond to the oil spill and minimise harm to the environment, and to shut in the leaking well and stop the flow of oil and gas safely and as soon as possible. I was able to inspect the impact of the incident personally on Saturday, 29 August as part of a daily aerial inspection that was being undertaken by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Maritime_Safety_Authority" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Maritime Safety Authority
         </a>
         ,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMSA" rel="nofollow">
          AMSA
         </a>
         . Dispersants are also being applied from the air and water, and this has been successful in accelerating the breakdown of the oil. Coastal and reef areas are not currently at risk.
        </p>
        <p>
         The operator of the oilfield, PTTEP, has decided to stop the leak by drilling a relief well to intercept the leaking well. The best advice available from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoscience_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Geoscience Australia
         </a>
         and my department was that this is the most technically feasible, safest and fastest option to shut in the well. A number of companies in Australia have offered drilling rigs to undertake this work. These were all properly considered from a technical, safety and timing perspective. Again, Geoscience Australia and my department concurred with PTTEP that the West Triton, a jack-up drilling rig in Batam, Indonesia, should be mobilised to do the job. PTTEP also has appropriate contingency plans in place.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is very disappointing that some politicians with no technical expertise, as far as I am aware, and in a politically opportunistic way acted like they thought they knew better. The Australian community can rest assured that the government took the best technical advice and will continue to put safety and the environment before populist politics. The West Triton is due to arrive at the Montara oilfield this Thursday. It will take about four weeks to complete drilling and well operations, taking us to early October to shut in the well. Then we will focus on a full independent investigation into the operational, human and regulatory factors surrounding the incident. We have to learn from this incident and put in place any measures that are necessary to stop it happening again.
        </p>
        <p>
         I indicate that at the conclusion of question time I will be seeking leave of the House to make a full ministerial statement concerning these matters. I will also look to work with the opposition in respect of legislative change to enable a full and independent investigation to occur.
