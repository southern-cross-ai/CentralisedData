        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the government's announcement that doses of the Moderna vaccine will be available from September. Can the Prime Minister confirm that Moderna has been administered in the United States since December last year, in France, Germany and Italy since January, in Singapore since March, in the

         I'm happy to take those dates on notice, but my understanding is that they are correct. In addition to that, though, what we have done in Australia is that we've put in place a system which included six principal contracts for vaccine acquisition in Australia. That includes, firstly, 40 million Pfizer vaccines. We are in that process. Secondly, we have the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AstraZeneca" rel="nofollow">
          AstraZeneca
         </a>
         vaccines, over 53 million of which have been acquired. It's very important. But for the fact that we made the decision for sovereign vaccine manufacturing, it is clear, we would not have been able to receive the vast majority of those. We did that in light of the times that were available for international distributions of vaccines to

          Australia and New Zealand
         </a>
         . In addition to that, we've acquired 51 million Novavax.

           molecular clamp vaccines. That was not ultimately successful, but I think it was an important investment. We've also acquired enough for every Australian for the COVAX Facility. As well as that, there are 25 million Moderna vaccines. That approval, which the TGA has now completed and which I welcome, leads us to be able to deliver that vaccine commencing in the second half of September, subject to final confirmation of supply arrangements. But, on the advice that I had on the weekend, that remains the expected time frame for the first of those 10 million doses this year. Next year, of course, we have the 15 million additional doses of Moderna, and beyond that we also have 60 million doses of Pfizer. What does all of this mean? It means that Australia has a sufficient supply to deliver the opportunity for every Australian to be vaccinated during the course of this year, and to be vaccinated safely—to have that approval from the medical regulator.
