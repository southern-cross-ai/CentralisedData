        Australians have been reminded in 2020 that it does matter who you vote for. In 2017, when

        and the state Labor team, we didn't know what was going to be thrown at them, but we are so lucky that we elected them and not the risky and dangerous alternative proposed by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liza_Harvey" rel="nofollow">
         Liza Harvey
        </a>
        . Their leadership has kept Western Australia safe and strong. On the other side, the risky and radical ideas of Liza Harvey and her team extend to a state Liberal Party conference that debates secession, wanting to tear Western Australia away from the rest of the Commonwealth, and they never support

        s. In fact, the only people they ever do support seem to be Queenslanders—and two specific Queenslanders. They support

        There is one thing that unites the Liberal Party here in Canberra with the Liberal Party in Western Australia: they always make university and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        more expensive for young
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        s. Liza Harvey increased TAFE fees by 510 per cent, making it unaffordable for young Western Australians to go to TAFE. Here, the Liberals in Canberra, and indeed those from Western Australia, made university degrees 113 per cent more expensive starting in 2021. As I say, it does matter who you vote for.

        Over the last four months, 75,000 jobs have returned in Western Australia—the equal lowest unemployment of any of the states, at 6.7 per cent. I think everyone in this chamber would be excited and pleased to know that the West Australian economy grew 1.1 per cent in 2019-20 and is on track again to grow in 2020-21. That is in part because of the strong focus on jobs of the Western Australian government.

Amber-Jade Sanderson, the member for Morley, has been working on the Morley and Noranda METRONET—a project once opposed by the Liberal Party, but now they are now happy to come to the photo opportunities. They are happy to be there because it means 3,000 jobs and it is going to connect our suburbs. It's the biggest project since the Mandurah line.
