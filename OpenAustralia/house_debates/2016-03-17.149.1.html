        I rise to acknowledge school leaders in the 28 schools in the northern
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        . I congratulate them on their appointments as leaders within their schools and communities and I encourage them on their leadership journey.
       </p>
       <p>
        We in this place know only too well that leadership can be a lonely road. What is popular is rarely right and what is right is very rarely popular. So this morning I entreat the young leaders of the Gold Coast to strive hard always to do what is right in their leadership journey within their schools and communities; to serve their fellow students, their schools and their families; and to set the best examples they possibly can, not just in behaviour but in speech, dress and courtesy and in how they work hard and represent their families and schools. I say to our young leaders on the Gold Coast: if service is beneath you, leadership is beyond you. You can never lead until you can first serve. The biblical example of the basin and the towel holds true today as it did almost 2,000 years ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        We in this parliament are very proud of our young leaders, and I am very proud of what the Gold Coast young leaders are doing, who they purport to be and what they aim to do during the year. I am also extraordinarily proud to present their names today here in the federal parliament of Australia. I look forward to following their leadership journey. I encourage them to be the best they can be. I know they will serve their families and their schools with distinction and pride.
       </p>
       <p>
        I seek leave to present the names of the northern Gold Coast leaders to this esteemed House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
