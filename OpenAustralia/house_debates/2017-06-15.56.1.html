        My question is to the Treasurer. Will the Treasurer update the House on the release of today's employment figures? How is the government's budget generating stronger economic growth to create more and better-paid jobs?

         I thank the member for Boothby for her question. She has a keen interest in economic issues in this parliament, and I thank her for her input to the government's strong economic plan, which is driving jobs and growth. More than 50,000 Australians went out in May to seek a full-time job under the Turnbull government and got oneâ€”50,000 Australians, under the economic policies of the Turnbull government.
        </p>
        <p>
         The unemployment rate now has fallen to 5.5 per cent, which is lower than what we inherited from the Labor Party back in 2013. And it is not just that. More Australians have expressed confidence in the Australian economy by going back in and joining the labour force; we have seen the labour force participation rate rise to almost 65 per cent. And it is not just that. Australian workers got more hours. The shadow Treasurer may not be interested in this. He is very quick to come out with commentary on a number that may not be as good. But, when there is a good number, his back is turned to the Australian economy. His back is turned to Australian workers when they are getting more hours, when they are getting more jobs. When young people are finding jobs, the Labor Party's back is turned, and in this parliament they say no to doing things that will grow our economy and ensure that those jobs and those wages can flow.
        </p>
        <p>
         We congratulate those Australians who went out and got those jobs in the month of May and the months leading up to May, as we saw the lift in employment growth. The rate of jobs growth has increased to two per cent through the year. That is 10 times the level of jobs growth we saw under the Labor Party. The budget I handed down a month ago was all about making the right choices to support more and better paid jobs, and that is what we need to do if we are not going to be complacent about securing better days ahead. What we know about the Australian economy is this: when Australian businesses are providing Australians with jobs, they are expressing confidence in the future of the Australian economy. They can see those better opportunities and they are seeking to seize them, and I commend the Australian businesses who have been creating jobs for Australians in this country and giving their families a sense of confidence and certainty.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Turnbull government is on the side of Australians who want to get a job or who want to create a job, and that is what these figures demonstrate today. The Labor Party, by contrast, is standing in the way of the Turnbull government's economic plans that will generate more and better paid jobs, and seeking to play the politics of opposition, with the cynicism that defines this Leader of the Opposition.
