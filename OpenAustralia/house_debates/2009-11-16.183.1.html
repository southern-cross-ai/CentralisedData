       <p>
        On 31 October 2009, I attended the handover of a brand new double horse float to the Riding for the Disabled Association by the Golden Grove
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Lions Club
        </a>
        . I acknowledge and commend the Golden Grove Lions Club who, with the support of the Australian Lions Foundation, made an extraordinary effort to raise the funds required to purchase the float. Equally commendable was the understanding and concern shown by Lions Club members, who were driven by their care and desire to assist children with disabilities and their families. I am familiar with the work of the South Australian Riding for the Disabled Association, having been associated with it for some years. Several years ago I was able to support the organisation in securing its current riding facilities at Globe Derby Equestrian Centre.

        Horse riding has been proven to assist children with disabilities with both their physical and mental responses. Of course, it also offers children and their parents a most enjoyable recreation activity. This is all made possible because of the extraordinary efforts of the devoted volunteers who keep the

        organisation going and whose work has now been made easier with the addition of the new horse float, made possible by the work of President Ken Snaith and his team of Golden Grove Lions Club members. I also note that, in response to the growing recognition of horse riding amongst children with disabilities, the Special Olympics

        </a>
        organising committee for the 2010 event in Adelaide are collaborating with Riding for the Disabled Australia to showcase equestrian competition in the event. I wish them every success in including equestrian events in the National Games and providing another opportunity for children with disabilities.
