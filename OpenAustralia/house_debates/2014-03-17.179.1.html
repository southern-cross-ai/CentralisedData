       <p>
        On last Tuesday, 11 March, I had the very great pleasure of speaking at the inaugural general meeting of the Cultural Bridges community action group at the Thomastown Library together with Councillor Kris Pavlidis of the City of Whittlesea. Kris, along with Jemal Ahmet of Whittlesea Community Connections, started this project in 2007, so it was terrific to share the launch with her. I would like to extend my thanks to Nessie Sayar, secretary of the group, for the invitation to and organisation of the event, as well as all the residents, especially the committee members, who attended. I pay particular tribute to Odi Gerzina, the president, who chaired a very large meeting effectively with charm, humour and also purpose. I continue to be struck by the tireless efforts of passionate volunteers and compassionate citizens within the Scullin electorate.

        The city of Whittlesea contains a culturally and linguistically diverse population with nearly half its residents coming from non-English-speaking backgrounds. Whittlesea also has a large Indigenous population, and there is great interest across cultures. The Cultural Bridges project has been underway for some time. The inaugural meeting places it on a sound foundation to reach its goal: the establishment of a centre. This will be a place that encourages our diverse communities to come together to share traditions and experience to learn together from one another. It builds on the great strengths of our multiculturalism and will facilitate a cross-cultural engagement that builds understanding and respect. I commend the work of all involved and look forward to the future progress of this wonderful action group towards a vibrant centre.
