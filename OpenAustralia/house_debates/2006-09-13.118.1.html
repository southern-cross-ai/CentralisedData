       <p>
        In recent days we have heard a number of comments on what are referred to as Australian values. Some have called for such values to be taught in our schools and signed off by persons entering Australia. But what are the values to be enshrined as Australian? I must admit I have not seen any statements I could fully agree to. So without mentioning the words ‘mateship’, ‘digger’, ‘vegemite’ or ‘fair go’, I have put together my own statement of Australian values and I invite my fellow Australians to accept or reject them as they see fit.
       </p>
       <p>
        Here is my statement of Australian values. Australia is a society which by law and custom respects and shows tolerance to the political, social and religious beliefs of all its citizens and residents. Australia is a democracy with its government freely elected by the people and governed according to the rule of law. The official language of Australia is English. Australians respect the rights of individuals to pursue happiness in their own ways, provided they do not injure or unreasonably offend others. In respecting the diversity of their population, the people of Australia expect all within their borders to treat each other as equals regardless of race, gender, marital status, sexual preference or disability. Australia supports its families in the nurture and education of children and seeks to improve the skills, intellectual development and cultural enrichment of all its people. Australians come together in communities, in corporations, in workplaces, in social, sporting and cultural organisations and as a nation to promote their mutual benefit, advancement and protection in the face of adversity. Australians care for their natural environment and hold in trust their heritage for future generations. Australia provides care and support for the social security of its aged, disabled, infirm and economically disadvantaged citizens and residents. As a nation Australia is proud of the achievements of its citizens—proud of its multicultural and inclusive society and confident of its future. Those are my Australian values. I welcome the comments and the criticism of my fellow members of parliament and all my fellow Australians.
