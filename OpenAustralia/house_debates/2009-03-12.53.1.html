         I thank the member for Kingston for both her question and her passionate advocacy on behalf of both students and universities. I note that those opposite, almost on cue, jump to the ideologically extreme battles of the past when we, on this side, are talking about a new and balanced way forward to rebuild services and amenities at our universities. We do this because we on this side know—and have long argued—that it is all students who are paying the price of the extreme legislation of the previous government. It just so happens that we do have new evidence to back this up. It is not just the students who are paying an extra $800 a year in child care at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTS" rel="nofollow">
          UTS
         </a>
         , or those who are paying an extra $200 a year at

          Monash University
         </a>
         , or those students who can no longer access sport, catering and welfare services. It is, in fact, all students who are paying the price of the previous government’s approach, because it affects efforts to deliver quality teaching and research, to reduce class sizes and to attract overseas students—which we know are all critical to sustaining Australia’s workforce and our future productivity and economic growth as a nation. I was asked for new evidence—

             Universities Australia
            </a>

            … directly impaired our ability to deliver quality education and research …
           </p>

            He further stated:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            We had to use money [set aside] for research and teaching and use it to support the student experience on campus.
           </p>
           <p>
            These concerns, though, were further echoed by the

             University of Sydney

               Peter Costello

                  Thank you, Mr Speaker, I will do that now. My point about the outdated argument that those opposite were making is that the argument being put forward by the member for Higgins earlier today was that you should vote against this because in 1975 a now defunct organisation passed a number of resolutions which he thinks is the current argument to be reading to the House. In contrast, we are talking about a new system moving forward. As stated, we have also heard from the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Technology_Network" rel="nofollow">

                  of Universities that reduced services are a significant threat to the level of international enrolments. So all of this hampers our ability to deliver world-class universities—all because those opposite went too far. Now, despite the evidence, they will not admit to the damage they have caused—so they are in denial and voting against it.

                      Yes, we preferred the member for Mackellar’s contribution, but thank you. In contrast we are taking action. We have delivered a new system. We are looking forward, and the opposition should get on board and do the same because it is critical to securing the future of our universities and the contribution that they make to our economy.
