        Mariners on their victory in the A-League 2023-24 men's grand final. With back-to-back premierships, the Mariners have demonstrated that they are the best men's football team in Australia and, with their recent 2024

        cup victory, the best men's club side in Asia. The grand final was a nerve-racking watch, but Ryan Edmondson's goal in the 91st minute, which saved the match and took it to extra time, had everyone out of their seats. This season's grand final victory was even sweeter because it was in front of a home crowd at a sold-out Gosford stadium. I was excited to join thousands of locals cheering on the Mariners with my nephew Finn. The team showed true Central Coast spirit and grit, never giving up. They knuckled down and fought to the very end.

        Last week, alongside the Prime Minister and the Minister for Sport, I was delighted to meet netball superstar Liz Ellis AO when she visited parliament. I congratulate Liz on her recent election as chair of

        My love for netball started when I was in year 5, playing at Baker Park in Wyong and coached by local legend Trish. In 2016, I was a proud volunteer director, bringing together Wyong, Gosford and

The Central Coast Heart opens captain, Maddy Wild, who played her junior netball at Wyong, said, 'The opens team has been working hard and is looking to be a force in the premier league competition.' Opens coach Kristie Fuller said, 'The team has been able to put out solid defensive performances and is now focusing on improving their attack in the back half of the season.' On 15 and 29 June, Central Coast Heart will host premier league rounds 12 and 14 opens and under 23s matches at Niagara Park Stadium against the Panthers and

        . I encourage all coasties to support Central Coast Heart netball throughout their season, especially their home games on the coast. I acknowledge the work they do in fostering a love for netball in the community and in building a pathway for athletes, coaches, umpires and administrators from the coast to super netball.
