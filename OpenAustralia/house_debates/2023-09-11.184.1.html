        On 26 August I attended the South West Festival at Thomas Hassall Anglican College. It was the first festival since the COVID pandemic, the last being held in 2019. It was an opportunity for families to enjoy a local day out, with rides, food stalls, petting zoos and even a mermaid. The energy on the day was incredible, and we were blessed with beautiful weather and an amazing turnout. Thank you to everyone who stopped by my stall for a chat and showed a keen interest in their community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to acknowledge the hard work of all the staff involved in putting together such a successful festival. I thank Principal Ross Whelan. This will be his last South West Festival as principal of Thomas Hassall Anglican College. Ross is retiring at the end of this year, after 16 years of dedication and service to both the school and our wider community. It has been my pleasure to work with Mr Whelan during my time as a local representative. I wish him and his family well as they embark on the next phase of their lives. He has had a positive impact on so many students during his teaching career, and I look forward to working with the incoming principal, Mrs Karen Easton.
