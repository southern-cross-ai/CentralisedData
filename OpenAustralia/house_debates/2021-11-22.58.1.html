        producer Keaton has given up on the NBN. Instead of being able to work from home, he has to keep his production in Sydney and commute.

        These people have been ignored by the Liberals and denied upgrades to their fibre to the node. Labor will fix that. If we win the next election, we'll connect homes to fibre for free if people want it. That will give these businesses a boost, give students reliability and make things safer when disaster strikes.
