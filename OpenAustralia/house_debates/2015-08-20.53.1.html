       <p>
        Tuesday was Vietnam Veterans Day. Originally, it was a day to commemorate the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Long_Tan" rel="nofollow">
         Battle of Long Tan
        </a>
        in 1966, which was the largest single unit battle fought in Vietnam by Australian troops.    However, it is a day now when Australians pause to remember the service and sacrifice of those who fought in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" rel="nofollow">
         Vietnam War
        </a>
        . More than 60,000 Australian service men and women deployed to Vietnam between 1962 and 1975. We suffered 521 casualties. Many of those who survived endured great hardship during the war and returned home both physically and emotionally scarred.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my electorate, there are a number of organisations and support groups who offer an incredible amount of care for the large veteran community in my electorate. I want to acknowledge
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        and RSL sub-branches in my electorate, who do a wonderful job of supporting and advocating on behalf of Vietnam veterans. Additionally, it is important to note the terrific job that the veterans' advocacy groups do. In particular, I acknowledge the town of Canungra, where there is a rich and proud tradition of commemorating the Vietnam War and honouring those who served.
       </p>
       <p>
        I lament that I was unable to be with the residents and RSL members of Canungra on Tuesday as they commemorate Vietnam Veterans Day. However, earlier this month I did have the pleasure of attending a celebration in honour of the 53rd anniversary and reunion of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army_Training_Team_Vietnam" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Army Training Team Vietnam
        </a>
        association at Canungra. It was a great day that saw old friends reunite and look back on their time in the war, both the good times and the bad. I was honoured to be amongst such brave men and I spoke about the government's plans to repatriate the bodies of 25 Australian Vietnam veteran soldiers buried in Terendak Camp and Singapore cemeteries.
