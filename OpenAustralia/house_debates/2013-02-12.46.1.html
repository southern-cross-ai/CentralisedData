        My question is to the Attorney-General and Minister for Emergency Management. How is the government helping families, businesses and farmers recover from the severe storms and flooding that have affected large parts of Australia?

         I thank the member for Blair for that question because it is important that people in disaster affected areas know what help is available to them. I know that the member for Blair has put tremendous effort into helping his constituents to clean up, to get their lives back on their feet after they have been turned upside down, helping businesses open again and helping rebuild farms.

         has moved very quickly to ensure that assistance is activated as soon as possible for those that need it. More than 300

         personnel were deployed to assist with the emergency response and recovery efforts. Led by ADF Joint Task Force 637, Queensland flood assist 2 was on the job very quickly. We have signed a new national partnership agreement with Queensland for reconstruction and recovery. It is a significant effort that will speed up reconstruction and recovery. The Prime Minister has reappointed Senator Ludwig as the minister assisting her on the Queensland floods recovery.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australian families, business operators and farmers are a very resilient people. They will get through this disaster and they expect their local members, state and federal, and their state and federal governments to get on with the job of supporting them at this time.
        </p>
        <p>
         Members of parliament like the member for Blair have their constituents' interests at heart, and many members of the federal opposition, I am very pleased to say, have put their politics to one side and have worked tirelessly in their constituents' interests. Sadly, I cannot say the same for all members of the Liberal and National parties. But I would hope that, in times like this, all members of this place—and, indeed, of other parliaments—are able to put politics to one side and work with our national government. We do need to support those people who have had their lives turned upside down. That is what I will be doing. That is what this government will be doing. And I can report to the member for Blair that we are getting on with the job.
        </p>

         Yesterday, the Prime Minister approved additional disaster assistance for those affected in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Burnett" rel="nofollow">
          South Burnett
         </a>
         in Gladstone, Toowoomba, Ipswich and a number of other areas. That brings the number of local government areas receiving Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements assistance in Queensland to 53. We have paid $77.4 million in recovery support directly into people's bank accounts, which means that some 66,000 applicants from Queensland have been paid, with every eligible adult receiving $1,000 and $400 per child; that is the Australian Government Disaster Recovery Payment. Today I approved an extension of those payments for the people in South Burnett. The Gillard government will continue to support people devastated by disaster.

          I ask a supplementary question. The minister has talked about what the government is doing to help communities recover and rebuild. What has this meant in the community of Blair and what has been the response?

           I thank the member for Blair for that supplementary question. This government has acted immediately to provide assistance to communities decimated by these floods. As I said a moment ago, we are delivering $1,000 for each eligible adult and $400 for each eligible child. There are special clean-up grants: $25,000 for primary producers, small businesses and not-for-profit organisations. There are concessional interest rate loans of up to a quarter of a million dollars, and freight subsidies so that farmers and small businesses can repair or replace buildings, plant and equipment; buy livestock to replace those that they have lost; pay rent and rates; and restore essential operations on their properties.
          </p>
          <p>
           These measures and more have been activated across Queensland because this government believes in looking after people when hard times hit, as they so often do in a country like ours where we are vulnerable to the extremes of weather. We are standing shoulder-to-shoulder with state governments across Australia to identify the areas in greatest need so that we can activate financial help and practical help on the ground. Again, as I said before, I would acknowledge the good grace of those opposition members who are working cooperatively with the government to do the right thing for those in need. The damage is extensive and we will continue to work as a priority to help our fellow Australians get the help they need.
