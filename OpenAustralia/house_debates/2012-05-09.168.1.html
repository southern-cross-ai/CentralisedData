        James Oswald Little, known across the nation as 'Uncle Jimmy', was a true Australian hero and music legend. We gather here today to mourn Jimmy's passing on 2 April, after losing his long battle with kidney disease.
       </p>
       <p>
        He was born at the Cummeragunja mission on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        -Victorian border in 1937. Just under 18 years later, he commenced his recording career with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regal_Zonophone" rel="nofollow">
         Regal Zonophone
        </a>
        . It was an extraordinary achievement for a 17-year-old, particularly as he was one of the first
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous Australians
        </a>
        to top the music charts in an industry that was dominated at the time by Anglo Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        For five decades, he continued to sing and produce popular songs and albums, including

        ,

        , plus perform numerous plays on stage. Whilst he is often believed to have been solely a country singer, his remarkable talents enabled him to perform reggae, gospel, alternative rock, Aboriginal music and sixties pop.
       </p>
       <p>
        Through his pursuit of music, he increasingly became a role model for Indigenous youth, and established a music mentoring program in Redfern from 1985. An endearing and selfless personality with a 'velvet voice', Little was appropriately recognised by the Australian music industry and others for his unique contribution to music and the Indigenous community. He was inducted into the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARIA" rel="nofollow">
         ARIA
        </a>
        Hall of Fame, received honorary doctorates from three Australian universities and was awarded the Order of Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of his greatest achievements was the establishment of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Little" rel="nofollow">
         Jimmy Little
        </a>
        Foundation to improve renal health amongst Indigenous Australians. He himself suffered from kidney failure from 2002 until he received a life-saving transplant. Even during daily kidney dialysis treatment, he continued to perform and mentor young Indigenous people. It is little wonder that he is affectionately known as Australia's 'Uncle Jimmy'. His selflessness and eternal optimism characterised our 'Uncle Jimmy'. He was a national Australian treasure, whose legacy as a music performer and Indigenous ambassador should endure, as well as his incredible sense of humanity.
       </p>
       <p>
        In recent years Jimmy worked closely with Medicines Australia to support Indigenous health in Australia. Medicines Australia provided $770,000 in funding to support the Jimmy Little Foundation deliver its
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumbs_Up" rel="nofollow">
         Thumbs Up
        </a>
        ! healthy-eating campaign targeting children in remote Aboriginal communities, promoting the notion of 'healthy tucker—long life'. Encouraging healthier food choices assists to reduce the terrible burden of diabetes and kidney disease, an issue obviously close to Uncle Jimmy's heart. Children and young people were chosen as the primary target group of this program to foster the development of healthy eating behaviours at an early age to improve health and educational outcomes and prevent the development of chronic health conditions such as diabetes later in life.
       </p>
       <p>
        After Jimmy's passing, Medicines Australia's Chief Executive, Dr Brendan Shaw, made the following statement:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The death of Jimmy Little … marks the passing of a truly great Australian. Jimmy was not only a supremely talented musician and entertainer, he was a passionate advocate for indigenous health.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Medicines Australia was extremely fortunate to work with him through the Jimmy Little Foundation to help promote the importance of healthy food choices in remote indigenous communities, particularly among children.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Jimmy was driven by a single-minded determination to ensure the Foundation made a meaningful difference to the lives of indigenous Australians.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        While his passing is extremely sad, the Jimmy Little Foundation is a fitting monument to a lifetime devoted to helping other indigenous Australians and will long continue to make a real difference to the lives of many living in remote communities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Medicines Australia extends its condolences to Jimmy’s family.
       </p>
       <p>
        Uncle Jimmy will be mourned and missed by people, not just music fans, all over our nation. I must say that as a very young person watching

         . James Oswald Little was a phenomenal musician, captivating actor and inspirational teacher. He was perhaps the first Aboriginal person to be widely embraced by all Australians at a time of high discrimination and hardship for Indigenous people. He was recognised right across the nation for his talent, his teachings and his dedication especially to younger

         , about 30 kilometres from Echuca in Victoria, on 1 March 1937. The eldest of seven children, he was born into a musical family. His mother, Frances, was a singer and yodeller and his father, James Senior, was a tap dancer, comedian, musician and singer who led his own vaudeville troupe along the Murray River during the 1930s and 1940s.

         was born to perform. At the age of 13, not long after his mother had sadly passed away, Jimmy was handed a guitar and not long after was often seen playing at local concerts. In 1955, at the age of 18, Jimmy left home to live in Sydney and pursue a career in country music. A year after moving to the big smoke, Jimmy was signed to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regal_Zonophone" rel="nofollow">
          Regal Zonophone
         </a>

          Mysteries of Life

         /
         <i>
          Heartbreak Waltz
         </i>
         . In October 1963, eight years after his first single, Jimmy issued his biggest hit with the gospel song
         <i>
          Royal Telephone
         </i>
         . In November it peaked at No. 1 in Sydney and No. 3 in Melbourne. Jimmy was the first Aboriginal recording artist ever to make the top 10, and this famous song
         <i>
          Royal Telephone
         </i>
         sold 75,000 copies. In 1964, Jimmy was the
         <i>
          Everybody's

         magazine Australian pop star of the year. From 1985 Jimmy taught and mentored Aboriginal musical students at the Eora Centre in Redfern and from 2002 he was an ambassador for literacy and numeracy for the Department of Education.

        <p>
         In 1990, Jimmy was diagnosed with kidney disease, something he blamed on not having a healthy lifestyle and not getting regular check-ups. Because of this, Jimmy became an avid campaigner for the health of Aboriginal people and in 2006 he began the Jimmy Little Foundation, to improve renal health across Indigenous communities in regional and remote Australia. On 2 April this year, Jimmy died from natural causes at his home in Dubbo, aged 75 years. He is survived by his daughter, Frances, and his beloved grandson, James Henry Little. In 2005, Jimmy told

        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I just want people to remember me as a nice person who was fair-minded and had a bit of talent that put it to good use.
        </p>
        <p>
         However, it seems Jimmy Little has left more of a mark on this world than just being fair-minded with a bit of talent. Jimmy was an ambassador for Aboriginal health and highlighted the importance of healthy living to all Australians. He was a true gentleman and a great Australian and has left behind an enduring legacy. Vale Jimmy Little.
