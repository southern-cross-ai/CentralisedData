        On the weekend I popped in to see Alwyndor Aged Care, which is based in Hove in my electorate. It is a beautiful aged-care facility that is run by the local council, and it has beautiful gardens. It is a special place for me and my family because it is my husband's former family home, which was bequeathed to the council. We pop down there and look at the statues that his grandfather built. They are cement statues of deer, lions and frogs, and there's a sunken garden that many of the local kids actually remember playing in when it was a working farm.

        This weekend they had the SALA Festival, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian_Living_Artists_Festival" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian Living Artists Festival
        </a>
        . As well as the statues that we usually go and see, we were treated to some spectacular cast-iron and other metal really modern statues in such a beautiful garden. This is an important part of the aged-care service that people can visit. They can pop out there with their families and friends and spend time in a beautiful environment, rather than the somewhat clinical area of a nursing home. Congratulations to the South Australian Living Artists Festival. It was on all last month, and I attended a number of different events. But I have to say this one at Alwyndor was particularly special.
