        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Donaldson" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Around 102,000 Australians have made the supreme sacrifice in all wars and 226,000 have been wounded. Over 34,000 have been taken prisoners. At the last Defence census, around 60,000 people were serving in the ADF and about 17,000 in the reserves. Latest figures reveal that 19.7 per cent of ADF personnel are women and about 25 per cent of Navy and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Air Force
        </a>
        and 15 per cent in the Army, although the Army has the largest number of women in real terms.
       </p>
       <p>
        These people carry on the tradition of their forebears and their service represents the highest ideals of Australian citizenship. Every country needs a defence force of people who are prepared to lay down their lives for their fellow citizens. Defence service is a huge ask of any country of its citizens. Therefore as civilians we must be grateful to those prepared to serve and respect their service and sacrifice.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given the recent withdrawal from Afghanistan, I wanted to acknowledge over the last 20 years some 39,000 men and women of the ADF who have served along with diplomats, police officers, aid workers, civil officials and, of course, Afghan coalition military partners from more than 50 countries. I also want to acknowledge the 41 ADF members who made the supreme sacrifice, including Trooper Jason Brown from my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        The mission of the ADF today is to defend Australia and its national interests and to advance Australia's security and prosperity. Every day ADF personnel defend our values and the Australian way of life, supporting humanitarian assistance and disaster response efforts, and assisting in recovery efforts.
       </p>
       <p>
        In that regard, I want to place on record my thanks to ADF personnel who came to the aid of communities on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawkesbury_River" rel="nofollow">
         Hawkesbury River
        </a>
        earlier this year following the floods. The presence of the ADF brought confidence and hope to communities whose homes and livelihoods had been decimated. Let me again thank the personnel from the 5th Brigade Infantry Company of the ADF, led by Major Mark Whitfield, for their leadership of the rescue and recovery effort.
       </p>
       <p>
        The ADF officers' extensive training to its members is essential to a modern defence force. The ADF offers nationally recognised qualifications and varying entry options like the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force_Academy" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force Academy
        </a>
        and Defence university scholarships. Reservists also receive world-class training in leadership, communication, problem-solving, combined with great benefits, including a tax-free salary.
       </p>
       <p>
        Military service has significant differences from civilian employment, and there are unique demands and sacrifices required both of ADF members and of their families. I want to acknowledge not only the service of ADF personnel but also the sacrifice by their families. Family relocations are regular, sometimes with limited notice, and they can be stressful. Partners' careers may be interrupted, with a commensurate loss of income, and with impacts on child care and schooling. These factors are perhaps too rarely acknowledged, and I'm pleased to be able to salute defence family members as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wanted to conclude with some words about current Australian defence policy.

AUKUS will see Australia and the other nations share more information in intelligence; foster greater integration of security and defence-related science technology, industrial bases and supply chains; and strengthen our cooperation in advanced and critical technologies. The first major initiative of AUKUS is to support Australia's acquisition of nuclear powered subs. Our trilateral efforts will enhance our joint capabilities and interoperability, with an initial focus on cybercapabilities, artificial intelligence, quantum technologies and additional undersea capabilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are living in increasingly uncertain times both at home and abroad, and I want to thank the ADF for their service in such challenging times: we salute what you do.

            I rise to speak in support of the member for Stirling's motion, which recognises the benefits of a career in the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Defence Force
            </a>
            ; the importance of recruiting the best and the brightest to serve our country; and the sacrifice—sometimes the ultimate sacrifice—made by those who do serve and have served our country.
           </p>
           <p>
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">

            Base Williamtown is in my electorate of Paterson. I've visited it many times over the last nearly six years since I was elected and, indeed, I lived on the base for the ADF parliamentary program for a week, and last week the shadow minister for defence,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_O'Connor" rel="nofollow">
             Brendan O'Connor
            </a>
            , came to visit and inspect the Williamtown RAAF base. I've also had the honour of visiting my local defence cadet squadron, the Maitland squadron, and I've been really impressed when I've been invited to inspect the parade and seen the skill of the fine young people that enrol and enlist in cadets.
           </p>
           <p>
            The ADF Cadets program is a wonderful personal development program for our young people, and there are more than 28,000 cadets Australia-wide across Navy,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">
             Air Force
            </a>
            and Army units. In undertaking challenging and disciplined activities and programs in the cadets, these young people develop the capacity to contribute to society as individuals, as members of a team and, importantly, as leaders. They also develop a spirit of civic participation, and they develop the character that comes from service, which is really vital in today's world. Importantly, cadets also fosters an interest in defence careers, and it is vital that we do attract our best and brightest to a career in defence.
           </p>
           <p>
            On the world stage, when we are moving to shore up our defence capabilities, I want to highlight some of the things that stand in steep contrast to the wonderful work and leadership of our best and brightest young cadets, and they are, most sadly, our Prime Minister's diplomatic failures, particularly and most recently with the French. Young people often get into trouble for breaking up with someone, or leaving a job, via text. How about one of the most important diplomatic messages being sent by text? That was certainly clumsy. It was certainly costly. But, most importantly, to many Australians it was incredibly deceitful, coming from a prime minister. He further embarrassed the nation in Glasgow.
           </p>
           <p>
            Then there's China—another relationship the government must work hard to repair. In our region, we face the most difficult strategic circumstances since the end of World War
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
             II
            </a>
            . Our region is being reshaped, in large part by the strategic competition between the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
             US
            </a>
            and China. We have a role to play in that reshaping, one that requires diplomacy and strategy far beyond the bungling of our present Prime Minister. We need to work with the US, the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
             UK
            </a>
            and our regional partners to demonstrate that we are serious about regional stability, and that is not just about military power but also about economic power and the health of our region, including the timely access to vaccines and the charting of a course out of this pandemic.

            </a>
            into Defence and Veterans Suicide is about to get underway. After dragging its heels for two years, the Morrison government finally agreed in July to hold this royal commission. The very need for a royal commission is an admission that, as a nation, we are letting down our defence personnel and our veterans. Labor has long campaigned for this royal commission, and it is vital that the commissioners hear from the people who are central to this issue: serving personnel, veterans and, really importantly, their families, who've lived it all. Alarmingly, rates of suicide among veterans are higher than among the general population. Among male veterans, who make up the vast majority, the rate is 22 per cent higher. Among female veterans, who are in a minority, the rate is a staggering 127 per cent higher.
           </p>
           <p>
            While the royal commission is long overdue and welcome, the government should not wait for it to conclude to make these long overdue reforms.

             I rise in strong support of the member for Stirling's motion and acknowledge his distinguished service to this nation in uniform before entering the parliament. Serving in our country's Defence Force is a selfless act, and we ought to acknowledge those among us who have dedicated themselves and continue to dedicate themselves to our nation as part of the ADF, whether that be through full-time service or in the local reserves.
            </p>
            <p>
             My electorate of Ryan has a strong military presence, as I've spoken about often in this place. It's home to the Australian Army's
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallipoli_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
              Gallipoli Barracks
             </a>
             at Enoggera, and there are many families across Australia that relocate to the Ryan electorate as a result of being posted to the Gallipoli Barracks during their years of service, which can be a difficult move for many. It's quite a sought-after posting, I have to say, because you don't get too many large Army barracks centrally located in a major city, and many choose to remain there with their families. As so many defence families would attest, it is a great place to live, work and raise a family, and I'm humbled as I hear many stories from defence families who feel so welcome in our community.
            </p>
            <p>
             Australia has a proud military heritage and it continues to attract the best and brightest among us, as it should, to serve the nation and contribute to the rich military history that we share with our region. Our unique defence pathways continue to attract young men and women from across Australia who want to go above and beyond in serving our nation. The Morrison government will continue to back our defence pathways and encourage young Australians to get involved. Recently, the Morrison government committed $11.5 million to upgrade the Enoggera Health Centre within the Gallipoli Barracks in my electorate of Ryan. This will develop the existing facilities and provide service men and women with the care that they need. It is these kinds of practical upgrades that support our defence men and women and ensure they are prepared to defend our nation.
            </p>
            <p>
             I also want to acknowledge, as did the contributor before me in this debate, the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Defence Force
             </a>
             Cadets and the pivotal role they play in developing our young men and women and encouraging them to join the ADF. Earlier in the year I had the privilege of being joined by Assistant Minister Hastie, who is, of course, a former member of the Defence Force, to launch the Brookfield cadet unit in the electorate. There has been strong interest from my local community in developing another cadet unit. There's already one located at the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enoggera_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
              Enoggera Barracks
             </a>
             , but it has a significant number of young people on the waiting list. The Morrison government's commitment of $100,000 a year to start the new Brookfield cadet unit will mean more local families on the other side of the electorate will have an opportunity to join the cadets. The cadets, of course, play a vital role in teaching young people leadership and resilience, skills that are useful and important not only in the ADF but in life.
            </p>
            <p>
             Being home to the Gallipoli Barracks and to a number of military families, my electorate of Ryan also has many veterans support groups and
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
              RSL
             </a>
             s located within it. These play a vital role in supporting local veterans and their families.
            </p>
            <p>
             Many of us in this House would understand the difficulties of being away from family and friends for prolonged periods of time, and it is much the same for our veterans—albeit worse if you're on operations. Whether they are posted overseas or across Australia, members of our ADF are often away from their families for extended periods of time. The other night I was speaking to a senior naval officer, who mentioned that their two years of shore leave had been cut short. They had had one year of shore leave, and now they're back out on operations. It's a story that's repeated many times across the ADF. As their skills are in demand, they're sent out again away from their families to serve our nation. But they do it with great fortitude.
            </p>
            <p>
             I want to particularly pay tribute to the Picabeen Community Association in Mitchelton, who last year were awarded nearly $270,000, as part of the Morrison government's Family Support Funding Program, to help with their targeted programs in engaging with the local defence community and their families. It's a wonderful program that I'd like to see more funding go towards, and I'll continue to advocate for them.
            </p>
            <p>
             Recently the Gaythorne RSL was awarded over $45,000 to upgrade their facility and further enhance the valuable role they have in the local community, serving as advocates to support our veterans.

                Remembrance Day
               </a>
               , a solemn day of reflection for our country, as we remember the service and sacrifice of the 102,000 Australians who have lost their lives in wars, conflicts and peacekeeping missions. We also recognise those who returned home to Australia, from theatres of war all around the world, bearing physical and emotional burdens. I commemorated Remembrance Day with our community at

              <p>
               One name marked on the memorial is that of Private William Starling. Private Starling was born in Penrith. He went to the local public school, was a member of the local rifle club and worked at the Penrith Post Office. He enlisted in 1915 and sailed to Egypt for training before his battalion was deployed to Pozieres, on the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Front" rel="nofollow">
                Western Front
               </a>
               , in France. Pozieres was a strategically important position due to the advantage of the high ground to launch offensives. Australians captured Pozieres on 23 July 1916 and were subjected to relentless artillery bombardment. Private Starling was wounded the following day and died from his injuries, at 19 years of age. Private Starling was one of 6,800 Australians who were killed at or died of wounds from the

               </a>
               . Like so many others and so many to follow, Private Starling exhibited the values marked on the Kokoda Trail: the courage to travel to distant lands in conflict and fight for Australia; the endurance to be pushed to the limits and to keep going; the mateship, the spirit of camaraderie, that defined the Anzacs; and the sacrifice for our country.

It was wonderful to see people gathering together in person again at the St Mary's outpost, a testament to the hard work of our community going out and getting vaccinated.

                Order! It being 7.30, I regret to inform the Federation Chamber that the time allotted for this debate has expired. I thank the member for Lindsay. I acknowledge that the member for Solomon was about to speak, and I thank him for his service to our nation. The debate is adjourned, and the resumption of the debate will be made in order of the day for the next sitting.
