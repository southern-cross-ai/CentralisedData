        I would like to acknowledge some of the many community groups in my electorate who have been successful in securing grants under round 4 of the Stronger Communities Program. I would also like to wish those whose applications are still being assessed every success. Thank you to Kate Broadhurst,

Thank you, Rhonda, for providing social and recreational programs for people and families whose lives have been affected by mental illness. Berkeley Vale Rural Fire Brigade was damaged during the storms of January 2016 and started refurbishing this year. This grant will be put towards a community space and providing laundry facilities and a place to feed people during emergencies. The Country Women's Association of

        equipment for students to better access the digital technologies component of the science curriculum. Tacoma Public School P&amp;C will provide a sunshade over their play equipment for sun-safe play, and The Entrance Baptist Church will install children's playground equipment and a half basketball court for their community. Wyoming Public School P&amp;C will build a commemorative paved area to mark its 50th anniversary next year, while providing a safe surface for students and community groups. Wyong Men's Shed will replace woodworking equipment to provide a safe environment for members to acquire new skills and help the community groups with their projects, working shoulder to shoulder. Autism Central Coast will construct a 'boys shed', a social space for males aged 10 to 22 to learn life skills and make new friends, and Wyongah Progress Association will install air conditioning at the Wyongah Progress community hall, one of the only community owned and community funded halls in our region. In closing, these projects will go a long way towards helping those who help others in our community.
