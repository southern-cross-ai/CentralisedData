        Jeffrey Hockley was recognised with an OAM for his tireless service to community theatre. Jeffrey has had a long involvement in the Launceston Players Society, directing more than 17 productions since the 1970s and holding a number of position within the society, including president, and has served as a board member of the Theatre Council of Tasmania. A special shout out to OAM recipients Sharon Leonard and Jennifer Logie, who were recognised for their service to the communities of Ravenswood and Bicheno respectively. Jennifer has played an integral role in progressing tourism events on the

Mrs Leonard says that she understands life can be very lonely for some people, and is motivated by the knowledge that we all have hard times. 'All I ever wanted was to help people,' she said.

        'When life handed me a lemon I made lemonade,' said medical practitioner and associate professor Gary Kilov, who was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes as an adolescent. Professor Kilov was awarded an AM for his significant service to medicine, particularly in diabetes research and advisory roles, describing the AM as one of the proudest moments of his career. Congratulations on your much-deserved award, Professor Kilov.

        Lastly, I congratulate Joe Chromy for being awarded an Officer in the Order of Australia. I have spoken previously in this place about Mr Chromy, and this award is just recognition for his achievement in our community. Congratulations to all recipients.
