        Coming to Canberra in 2010 as a new member, I found the orientation somewhat disorientating. Similarly to the first day of school, I gravitated to those who seemed to share my level of apprehension. The member for Hasluck and the member for Longman became friends. Ken laughed when I revealed that I had shoes older than Wyatt Roy. What I did not reveal was that the hardly worn suit I was wearing was also older than our young colleague. I was seated behind Ken for his maiden speech and was deeply moved by my new friend, so worthy of respect and admiration. I gathered myself, however, and attacked him for his total disregard and lack of consideration for his new friends, now former friends, who had to follow his extraordinary contribution with their maiden speeches. We laughed more, knowing that we shared the common Australian bond of our unique humour and the ability to convey our most sincere feelings, thoughts and emotions that men of our age sometimes find difficult.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ken, you have been honoured today as much for your achievements as for the manner in which you have achieved them. Today you united all those who represent us, as our respective leaders freely acknowledged, which makes this a happy day for our nation. Congratulations to you and Anna.
