       <p>
        I would like to speak about the passing of a special person that made an enormous contribution to our local community in South West Sydney. Bev Moroney passed away on 24 May, after battling cancer for several years. Bev regularly volunteered for various charities, including the annual
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McHappy_Day" rel="nofollow">
         McHappy Day
        </a>
        for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_McDonald_House" rel="nofollow">
         Ronald McDonald House
        </a>
        and worked at her local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonalds" rel="nofollow">
         McDonalds
        </a>
        because, as she said, 'I like working there.' Even last October, while extremely sick, Bev was still out there fundraising for McHappy Day. Bev never let her illness get her down and often said that there was someone worse off than she was.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bev was the wife of former New South Wales
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Police_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">
         Police Commissioner
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Moroney" rel="nofollow">
         Ken Moroney
        </a>
        . Obviously, Ken led a very public life. But it was Bev who very quietly and diligently went about her community life and, in many ways, was better known in our community than the Police Commissioner himself. Bev was a genuine and selfless lady who loved life and loved her husband, her three boys—Michael, Peter and Andrew—and their seven grandchildren. Last Monday, Bernadette and I, together with many hundreds of mourners, attended Bev's funeral, which, by the way, was held on Bev and Ken's 47th wedding anniversary.
