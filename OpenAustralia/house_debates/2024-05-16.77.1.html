        I rise to pay tribute to an extraordinary Australian. Former

        player and coach
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neale_Daniher" rel="nofollow">
         Neale Daniher
        </a>
        is an inspiration. Neale received a diagnosis of motor neuron disease more than 10 years ago. Since then he has shown remarkable strength, courage and humility to put aside his own misfortune and dedicate his life to raising awareness and, importantly, raising money for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MND" rel="nofollow">
         MND
        </a>
        research.
       </p>
       <p>
        While this place records many fine speeches and words that are spoken in support of various causes, Neale wryly observed in his memoir that 'when all is said and done, much more is said than done'. No-one could accuse Neale of doing nothing because Neale has been a man of action. Neale has activated the FightMND Army, which has raised more than $60 million for research and has just launched the 10th anniversary beanie. Just buying one of those FightMND beanies is one way that we can help the cause to find a cure for MND.
       </p>

        We look forward to the King's birthday clash at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MCG" rel="nofollow">

        clash between Melbourne and Collingwood takes place. I urge all Australians to help Neale Daniher and his family of supporters to find a cure for motor neuron disease by donating at FightMND.org.au and show your gratitude and appreciation to a bloke who has turned adversity to advocacy and done us all proud. Thank you, Neale, for all that you do and all that you continue to do for this incredibly important cause.

         on indulgenceâ€”I want to congratulate the Leader of the Opposition on that contribution.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neale_Daniher" rel="nofollow">
          Neale Daniher
         </a>
         is indeed an absolute hero. He was strong and a hero on the field, and off the field he has shown enormous strength and courage in speaking about
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MND" rel="nofollow">
          MND
         </a>
         and raising funds for MND and in organising the charitable events in order to provide more awareness and greater knowledge of this terrible disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is something that is debilitating and it is something that I think most Australians, unfortunately, know people who've suffered from it. It is a debilitating disease. We wish Neale all the very best, and we join with all of the parliament in saying that it is a very good thing if people kick in, buy a beanie, help to raise funds and help to cure this terrible disease.
