         bill
        </a>
        is to amend the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 by appropriating additional funding of $26.1 million over the 2007 and 2008 calendar years to improve opportunities for Indigenous students in the school, vocational education and training and higher education sectors.
       </p>
       <p>
        This funding will be used for the expansion of the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program, the expansion of the Indigenous Youth Leadership Program, the provision of infrastructure funding for boarding school facilities and, where government and non-government education providers agree, the conversion of Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) program places into ongoing jobs in the education sector.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government places great importance on achieving better educational outcomes for Indigenous students. To achieve this, new investment is necessary in the areas of school, vocational and technical education and higher education sectors. The Australian government is committed to developing the capacities and talents of Indigenous people so they have the necessary knowledge, understanding, skills and values for a productive and rewarding life.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proportion of young Indigenous people living in remote areas who reach year 12 is approximately half that of their metropolitan peers, and only one in 10 actually completes year 12. Approximately one in four 15- to 19-year-old Indigenous people lives in a remote area.
       </p>
       <p>
        Up to 1,610 students will benefit from the expansion of two successful programs, the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program and the Indigenous Youth Leadership Program. The increase in the number of scholarships offered under the Indigenous Youth Leadership Program and the places available under the Indigenous Youth Mobility Program will allow more young Indigenous people to access high-quality education and training to make informed life choices.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Indigenous Youth Mobility Program will be expanded by around 860 places over the next four years, 2007-08 to 2010-11. In the 2008 calendar year, $2.6 million will be used to increase the number of places available in that year.
       </p>
       <p>
        The number of scholarships available through the Indigenous Youth Leadership Program will increase by 750 over four years, 2007-08 to 2010-11. Over the 2007 and 2008 calendar years, $4 million will be used to increase the number of scholarships available in these two years.
       </p>
       <p>
        The increased funding for these two programs will provide support for Indigenous young people to relocate from remote and regional areas to access high standards of education, training and employment opportunities not otherwise available to them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Indigenous students will benefit from funding of $14.1 million over two years to provide infrastructure funding to existing boarding schools catering for significant cohorts of Indigenous students. This will facilitate the urgent upgrade of accommodation facilities to prevent a loss of existing boarding places.
       </p>
       <p>
        Approximately 200 Indigenous people will benefit from the provision of funding of $5.3 million to convert, where government and non-government education providers agree, Community Development Employment Projects (CDEP) program places into ongoing jobs in the education sector.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the 30 years since CDEP began, Indigenous people have been delivering services for all levels of government. Through this initiative, CDEP participants will gain the full benefits of employment including wages, leave, superannuation, training and professional development.
       </p>
       <p>
        The initiative will be available to both government and non-government schools and systems.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the bill to the House.
