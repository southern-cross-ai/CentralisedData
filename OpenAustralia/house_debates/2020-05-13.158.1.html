        This year we've seen our lives change and change forever, no more so than in our local schools.

        and in my electorate of Forde teachers and schools have been working hard each and every day to support the students and families in light of the pandemic we're going through. I know that the past couple of weeks have been difficult for all, especially for the parents who are working from home and also trying to help their kids learn. I want to take this opportunity to thank those parents who have gone to great lengths to support their children during what has been a challenging and uncertain time. Equally, the wonderful teachers and schools across my electorate of Forde, which covers parts of

        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        , have done a fantastic job for the students that have needed to attend school, especially those in vulnerable situations—which, sadly, is common in parts of my electorate—and also the children of our essential frontline workers, who are doing such a great job at this time. Over the past couple of weeks, we've seen our schools innovate and adapt to these changing circumstances, and I want to take this opportunity to give a shout-out to some of the great schools and teachers who have done some truly amazing things to support our kids.

        state school had an Anzac Day drive-through service, with students and their families paying tribute in their driveways. The principal, Mr Curran, and the school's Adopt-A-Cop, Aaron, from the local police beat also joined them in their cars. The Cedar Creek State School principal, Mr Meier, has started a new band with the teachers, aptly named The Creekers, which boosts the spirit of students and their families. At Coomera Springs State School, they had a drive-through

        stall. Eagleby State School has been looking through doing a book and maths game exchange, and, at Eagleby South, Mr Barnes, Mrs Morgan and Mrs Dillon have joined together in songs to cheer up the kids learning from home. Kimberley Park State School and Boronia Heights State School have welcomed their preppies back this week with great fanfare, with the school fences decked out with balloons and decorations. Last, but certainly not least, Mr Evans, one of the teachers at Norfolk Village State School, has starred in a fun video showcasing what it's like to teach at home, starring his dog, Chai.

        Our teachers, and our school staff more generally, do an incredible job each and every day. I'm sure they're all eager to see the students return to school but that, most importantly, it's done in a safe way for all involved.
