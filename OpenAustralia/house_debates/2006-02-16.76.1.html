        My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. Would the Attorney-General advise the House of the government’s national security information campaign, in particular the work of the national security hotline?

         I do thank the honourable member for

         for his question. I know of his interest in matters relating to law and order and security. Of course the national security public information campaign has been very successful in raising awareness in the Australian community of the hotline and its role. The fourth and final scheduled burst of advertising for the current campaign will start this Sunday for three weeks. The campaign will feature television, press, transit and outdoor advertising. Of course it is there to remind people of the importance of being vigilant in identifying possible signs of terrorism and to report on any suspicious activity. The hotline is an integral component of our national counter-terrorism arrangements, and a high proportion of calls have provided helpful information in relation to investigations that we are undertaking.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am aware that there was a recent Morgan poll which reported that the overwhelming majority of Australians are aware of the national hotline and its role. That is clearly evident from the fact that 73,300 calls, letters and emails have been received since it commenced operations in 2002. Over half of these have provided information which has been of assistance to security and intelligence authorities as well as police. The number is prominently listed in the
         <i>

          </a>
         </i>
         . I hope it is still on some fridges. The number, of course, for all of you, if you do not remember it, is 1800 123 400—not all that difficult, I might say.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is disappointing that the opposition has sought to deride and undermine the effectiveness of the national security hotline. It is obvious that the Labor Party does not recognise the value of engaging the community in relation to terrorism. I want to assure the House that the government remains committed to protecting the safety and security of Australians and that the national hotline is integral to our national security arrangements.
