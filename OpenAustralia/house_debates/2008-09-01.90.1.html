       Dear Mrs Irwin
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Thank you for your letter dated 28 May 2008 referring a petition regarding the Ipswich Motorway and the Goodna Bypass.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       As you will be aware, the Australian Government is committed to the full upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway, from Dinmore to Rock1ea. We have already allocated nearly $1 billion to upgrade the Ipswich Motorway between Goodna and Darra, and $1.14 billion to upgrade the Ipswich Motorway between Dinmore and Goodna. The section from Darra to Rocklea will be upgraded in the future, potentially funded from the new $20 billion Building Australia Fund, following assessment by the new advisory body, Infrastructure Australia.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       An infrastructure project of this size is generally undertaken in stages. The construction schedule is determined in consultation with the Queensland Department of Main Roads to minimise the impact on commuters while construction takes place. In this case the Dinmore to Darra upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway is being undertaken in three stages.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Construction commenced on the Ipswich Mot01â€™way/Logan Motorway Interchange in February 2007. The Australian Government is providing $255 million to ensure the upgrading of this two kilometre stretch of the Motorway between Goodna and Gailes. This project is expected to be completed in early 2009 and will provide improved traffic flow between the Ipswich and Logan Motorways.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Site work has also recently commenced on the Wacol to Dana section of the Motorway. The Australian Government will provide $700 million to increase this five kilometre stretch from four to six lanes. Stage one of this project will upgrade from Dana to Sandy Creek, including the Centenary Highway Interchange, and stage two from Sandy Creek to Waco1.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Planning is currently underway for the upgrade of the Dinmore to Goodna section to upgrade to six lanes. The Australian Government allocated $5 million in the 2008-09 Budget to accelerate the planning process. Construction is expected to commence in early 2009 with project completion anticipated by late 2012.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       These works will result in improved safety on the Ipswich Motorway through increased capacity and improved design. The upgrades will also allow free-flowing access for inter-regional freight movements to the Brisbane Markets, the Port of Brisbane and the export industries hub being developed at the mouth of the Brisbane River.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Regarding the Goodna Bypass, within weeks of being appointed, I met with the Hon Warren Pitt MP, Queensland Minister for Main Roads and we agreed that work on this project would cease.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Thank you again for referring this matter to me and I trust this information is of assistance.
      </p>
      <p>

       <b>
