        , the Anzacs, went ashore at Gallipoli, Turkey in 1915. One of the most significant events happening in Queensland this April to recognise the Centenary of Anzac is the re-enactment of a troop train journey that took place 100 years ago. The original steam train embarked from Winton in outback Queensland en route to Brisbane via Rockhampton. The train signed up

        recruits from country towns at numerous stops along the way. The recruitment drive touted such signs as 'Don't wait until the Germans arrive here', referring to the enemy of the day. The 2015 troop train re-enactment will carry 225 passengers departing Winton on April 20, with overnight stops at Longreach, Emerald, Rockhampton and Maryborough. The train will arrive at

        in Brisbane on April 24, the eve of Brisbane's Anzac Day service. Accompanying the troop train will be military re-enactment groups from the Capricorn 9th Battalion Living History Unit, based in Rockhampton, and a light horse brigade. In Rockhampton, the Capricorn

        The troop train project was initiated by my friend and colleague, Ken O'Dowd MP. The federal government has provided every electorate in Australia with a $125,000 funding pool to distribute for local Centenary of Anzac activities. The federal member for Flynn, myself in Capricornia and our fellow National Party colleagues, the member for Maranoa and the member for

        , have each contributed a minimum of $25,000 from our respective funds to allow this spectacular re-enactment journey to take place. In my vast electorate of Capricornia, I am delighted to inform the House, a total of 16 community projects, including the troop train, have been funded to mark the Centenary of Anzac. In Capricornia the funding includes: $7,500 to the Livingstone shire to install plaques on a memorial walkway in Emu Park's Centenary of Anzac commemorative precinct; $7,500 to the Livingstone shire for a memorial fountain as part of the Yeppoon Centenary of Anzac commemorative precinct; $2,500 to St Joseph's Primary School in

        , depicting the lives and service history of men and women from the Sarina region who served in World War I. These projects will serve as a respectful footnote in our local history to mark the significance of the Centenary of Anzac.
