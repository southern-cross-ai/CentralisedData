        as a direct result of the watering down of the law by the Albanese government and the issuance of direction 99. A 14-year-old girl was raped by her stepfather, known as CHCY, while her mother was in hospital giving birth to her sibling. A Kenyan national known as XLFM had his visa cancelled after he was convicted of raping the 17-year-old sister of the mother of his infant child and then robbing a petrol station with a meat cleaver. The Congolese national known as HWGF had his visa cancelled after being jailed for aggravated assault and repeated breaches of domestic violence orders. He has been convicted of a total of 27 separate offences, including multiple counts of violent assault against two former partners, their extended families and police. And an Afghan national referred to as ZJFQ had his visa cancelled after being convicted of both raping a 16-year-old girl and having intercourse with a disabled 14-year-old girl.
