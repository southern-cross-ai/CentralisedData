       <p>
        Since coming to government the coalition has announced and implemented a number of job-creating policies that will help the nation. Today I want to speak on infrastructure. The coalition government has invested heavily in infrastructure—record investment; $50 billion in an infrastructure program that is driving jobs and productivity throughout our great nation. Of this a record investment of more than $2 billion is coming directly to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        . The Deputy Prime Minster on a recent visit to my electorate mentioned to industry stakeholders that a key reason for the record investment was to address the decline in mining and resources that was projected in a couple of years time. This is a classic economic stimulus program that has helped Australia's economy navigate the slowdown in China and transition from manufacturing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our policies and investment have worked, evidenced by over 300,000 jobs created in Australia last year—the highest number since the coalition was last in government in 2006. Unfortunately, South Australia has not experienced these green shoots, but we have projects that bring optimism. In South Australia there are a few projects that have benefited from this massive infrastructure spending, including the Torrens-to-Torrens section of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Road" rel="nofollow">
         South Road
        </a>
        —something I have fought very hard for. It runs on the side of my electorate. Such investment benefits infrastructure companies like Bardavcol, who are building a section of the project.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, there is the Darlington upgrade and the recently announced Northern Connector, which the federal government has committed $788 million towards. Both are projects which are good for the state and together have over a billion dollars of federal funding. Both projects are more than just road projects, however.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have held a number of meetings with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_University" rel="nofollow">
         Flinders University
        </a>
        and have been impressed by their plans to develop the Tonsley precinct, which has a focus on industry and growing and providing for international students. This forward thinking by Flinders University is what South Australia needs more of. The proposed rail link is something I am very interested to see progress as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        The state government is involved in the projects on South Road and I look forward to seeing the infrastructure analysis of new sections that they have proposed for the rest of South Road, as I want to see South Road upgraded within a decade.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have also spoken with several residents about the traffic problems, particularly at peak times, at the Marion Road and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Cross Road
        </a>
        intersection. This intersection is complex due to the Glenelg tram line in close proximity. The Glenelg tram is a great asset, taking people to and from work and from the city to our most popular beach and leading tourist destination in Glenelg. What makes this intersection a problem for commuters, however, is the tram line as it runs straight through the centre of one of the slowest sections of road in South Australia. The latest traffic survey from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAA" rel="nofollow">
         RAA
        </a>
        showed there is a section of Marion Road, which the tram is pretty well in the centre of, that will take you 6½ minutes to travel one kilometre. I am keen for this section of Marion Road to be upgraded and will continue to raise it with the relevant ministers, the state government, local residents and commuters.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another project that will drive jobs and activity in South Australia is sealing the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strzelecki_Track" rel="nofollow">
         Strzelecki Track
        </a>
        , which connects Lyndhurst to Innamincka. Sealing this stretch of road will unlock new activity in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Basin" rel="nofollow">
         Cooper Basin
        </a>
        resource sector. It was discussed last week with the minister for energy and resources and with SACOME, our local industry body. The project is estimated at $450 million and will open the area to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        mining services company that currently cannot compete due to the lack of a sealed road.
       </p>
       <p>
        When government finances are stretched, alternative funding mechanisms should be considered. Before I explore this further I want to be very clear that I am not proposing this as something to be adopted as party policy. I note with interest the heading in the Committee for Sydney's report of December 2015: 'It's time for innovative thinking to fund transport'. The report states:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If the community—and business—wants a liveable, productive .... city, we are going to have to pay for it … Value capture … will be an increasingly important item in the funding toolbox along with other 'beneficiaries pay' approaches.
       </p>
       <p>
        The term 'value capture' refers to a family of public finance mechanisms that raise funds in proportion to the increase in land value associated with the new or improved public infrastructure. This point is reiterated in the Committee for Melbourne report. As the federal Minister for the Environment told a business chamber, 'Value capture is increasingly used internationally to ensure that projects go ahead, residents receive huge benefits, but some of the cost is offset through the uplift in value to beneficiaries.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Two case studies were outlined in the Committee for Melbourne report. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dallas_Area_Rapid_Transit" rel="nofollow">
         Dallas Area Rapid Transit
        </a>
        had over $4 billion of development projects adjacent to railway lines. This project is an example of a transit-orientated development—something the South Australian government has looked at. Another example from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        is the

        </a>
        30/10 project, which accelerates the construction of 12 new transport projects that were scheduled to be built over a 30-year period but now will be completed in 10 years. In

        </a>
        we are looking at
