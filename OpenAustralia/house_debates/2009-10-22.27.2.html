        On behalf of the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support, I move:

       <p class="moved">
        That, in accordance with the provisions of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Works" rel="nofollow">

        Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report:

        Tropical Marine Research Facilities—Cape Ferguson and Townsville Works.
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Institute_of_Marine_Science" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Institute of Marine Science
        </a>
        proposes to undertake works associated with the Tropical Marine Research Facilities Project at Cape Ferguson and Townsville at an estimated out-turn cost of $49.5 million exclusive of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        . The new facilities delivered by this project will build on AIMS’s expertise and collaborative links both nationally and internationally. These facilities will support research that is directly relevant to the national research priorities—on sustainable development in tropical Australia and understanding the capacity of marine ecosystems to adapt to climate change and develop appropriate mitigating options.
       </p>
       <p>
        Facilities to be built at Cape Ferguson and Townsville as part of the AIMS Tropical Marine Research Facilities Project will provide for the establishment of the Australian tropical ocean simulator, which will integrate with existing facilities to create significant seawater experimental infrastructure for cutting-edge research that was previously not possible—new infrastructure to enhance AIMS’s internationally significant coral core collection. It will provide for new tools for analysis and research of these critical records of tropical climate; improvements in energy supply systems, which will provide improved energy efficiencies and improved reliability of critical electrical power and seawater cooling and heating systems; and a vessel berthing and operations facility within the new light commercial marine precinct at Townsville port, ensuring appropriate and safe access to AIMS’s research vessels and capability to host visiting research vessels.
       </p>
       <p>
        The investment reflects the government’s decision to make marine science an innovation priority. It represents an investment in Australia’s future and is building on existing strengths in our innovation system. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction will commence in March 2010 and be completed by late 2012. I commend the motion to the House.

        <p>
         For some decades now, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Institute_of_Marine_Science" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Institute of Marine Science
         </a>
         have been leading the world in tropical marine science. They are widely respected and widely regarded right across the planet. I strongly support this motion, which refers the proposed investment of $49.5 million to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Works" rel="nofollow">
          Public Works
         </a>
         Committee for consideration and report.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIMS" rel="nofollow">
          AIMS
         </a>
         , through the director, Dr Ian Poiner, and staff, have done a wonderful job. This referral will provide significant new scientific work space for AIMS. It will ensure that they can berth their vessels safely, with the construction of the new eastern access corridor at the Townsville port requiring AIMS vessels to be berthed further downstream. That is part of another very significant project in the city.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am pleased to see that the tropical collections facility that is being proposed under this referral will allow AIMS to house their internationally famous coral core collection and other important biological collections so that as many researchers as possible will have easy access to those resources. The facilities being provided through this project will support research that is directly relevant to the National Research Priorities, to sustainable development in tropical Australia and to the understanding of the capacity of marine ecosystems to adapt to climate change and develop appropriate mitigation responses.
        </p>
        <p>
         I congratulate AIMS on the work that they do in partnership with other agencies in the world but particularly their partnership with the marine and tropical sciences research unit at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook_University" rel="nofollow">
          James Cook University
         </a>
         , the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef_Marine_Park_Authority" rel="nofollow">
          Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority
         </a>
         and so on. It is a great collaboration. AIMS have always collaborated nationally and internationally. They will continue to do that. This referral to the Public Works Committee—and I hope we secure a green light from the committee—will allow construction to begin in November. There is a bit of urgency about that, but I know the chair of the committee, North Queensland Senator Jan McLucas, and together as committee members we will work very hard to make sure we get the approval back to the parliament before it rises because we want to see this project started.

          The Department of Defence proposes the redevelopment of Tarin Kowt stage 1 project. The project will provide upgraded living and working accommodation for

The project will replace the interim accommodation currently being used and provide longer term sustainable facilities with appropriate protection. The new facilities include protected living-in accommodation, kitchen facilities and working accommodation. Improvements will also be made to some existing facilities. The estimated out-turn cost of the proposal is $37.723 million plus
