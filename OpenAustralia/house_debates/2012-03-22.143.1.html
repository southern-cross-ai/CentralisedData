        I want to note in this place that this Sunday 26 March is International Purple Day supporting epilepsy around the world—a day to raise epilepsy awareness. We have been asked by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epilepsy_Action_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Epilepsy Action Australia
        </a>
        to wear purple today, Thursday, 22 March, to show our support. I note also that my colleague and friend the honourable member for Shortland through the parliamentary group demonstrates the support of the parliament, and I know there are many others as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my seat of Page, a local woman, Tracy Doherty, has organised for this Sunday a barefoot bowls day at the South Lismore Bowling Club at 11 am to raise awareness for much needed funds for research. Tracy's beautiful daughter Emily has been diagnosed with non-specific epilepsy, and Tracy is thanking people for supporting such a great cause. I may not be able to attend but I have given support. My office manager, Carmel Cook, also has epilepsy and is a bowler, so she and her husband Ian, also a bowler, are going to attend on Sunday. I want to commend Tracy for her efforts in organising such an event for Sunday.

        Another issue of importance in my electorate is that a significant number of local people have asked me to meet the Tibetan delegation who visited parliament this week. A formal request came through the Australian Tibet Council. Their presence was welcomed here, but unfortunately I could not meet simply due to the parliamentary responsibilities and clashes of times, but my apologies were given. I am a member of the Parliamentary Friends of Tibet—a group headed by Mr Michael Danby MP and Mr Peter Slipper MP. I thank them for their good work in this area.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also welcome the foreign minister's comments in the Senate that he asked the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/People's_Republic" rel="nofollow">
         People's Republic
        </a>
        of China for permission to send Australia's ambassador in Beijing to Tibet to investigate religious protests by self-immolation and that he was asking permission to allow a group of parliamentarians to investigate the grievance that had given rise to these extreme and distressing forms of protest.
       </p>

        My office also took delivery of a letter signed by 201 Yamba residents handed over by local Yamba resident nurse and artist Jill Bradshaw with a whole package of salient material that detailed human rights abuses. I know that they are having a function in Yamba at the Star of the Sea Convent on Tuesday night, 3 April, with monks performing. A lot of people have been asked to attend that.
