        Sports Awards showcase the achievements of the many great athletes in the Clarence Valley. In what has been an extremely challenging year for many, I'd like to recognise the efforts of this year's winners across 13 categories. The Senior Sportsperson of the Year went to Mitch Christiansen, who won three silver medals at the New South Wales Athletics Para Championships. The Masters Sports Award went to Laurelea Moss, who won two gold medals at the National Cyclist Masters, where she was named Women's Champion of Champions. Junior Male Sportsperson of the Year went to Hayden Ensbey, a great local cricketer and rugby league player. Junior Female Sportsperson of the Year went to Andrea Thomson, an outstanding swimmer, who recently broke eight South Grafton High records. Andrea also won the

        I'd like to acknowledge St Brigid's Primary School in Kyogle, who recently won the national Reconciliation Story Award and the Best Cultural History Story Award in the Wakakirri competition. Through the program, schools like St Brigid's create a 'story-dance' using a combination of dancing, creative movement and acting to music. St Brigid's could not have made the performance without the guidance of local Aboriginal elders Uncle Wayne and Aunty Vera Walker. St Brigid's story represented the impact of the bushfires in the past year as well as traditional perspectives on learning and land management practices. Uncle Wayne and Aunty Vera's granddaughter Tahnesha was also in the production. The school used the 'Gondwana Dreaming' music by

        . Congratulations to the 67 students involved, from kindergarten through to year 6, who gave up many lunchtimes to practise their performance. Also a massive congratulations and thanks to the Indigenous education worker, Sonja McNab; facilitator Hayley Kennedy; coordinator Till Beetge; and community member and mother Emma Rixon. And thank you to St Brigid's for representing our region so proudly.
