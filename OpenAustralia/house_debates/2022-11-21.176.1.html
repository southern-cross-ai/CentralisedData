       <p>
        I ask everyone here to imagine, just for a moment, that 10 years ago you had to leave Australia because you were about to be killed. Then imagine you spent the next 10 years separated from your wife and children, who were at the mercy of terrorists. Try to imagine the pain, the shame, the trauma at being unable to keep your family safe and missing your own children growing up. That's what thousands of people in my community who have lived here for over 10 years still live with every day. They are genuine refugees who fled war, death and persecution, working and paying taxes here but unable to build a life or be fully Australian, cruelly condemned by the Liberals to temporary visas. It's done Australian society no good to have this hidden underclass of tens of thousands of permanently temporary migrant visa holders.

        I'm proud that this Labor government will honour our election commitment to provide permanent protection to these

        visa and SHEV holders. I spoke recently to the Prime Minister, who confirmed work is advancing and it will happen as soon as possible. That day cannot come soon enough. A first step happened last week, when the minister announced restrictions will be eased to make it easier for TPV visa and SHEV holders to leave Australia and visit family. The Liberals' treatment of these people has been needlessly cruel, and the mess they left in

        is shocking. Labor did not create this mess, but we are taking responsibility for cleaning it up.
