        It gives me great pleasure to rise and congratulate the Midland Agricultural Association on successfully conducting the 177th

        Show—this is in fact the oldest show in the southern hemisphere. It is a wonderful community event and is very important to the small community of Campbell Town and also the broader community within the northern midlands.

        It is run by volunteers one and all. It starts with the children and young people at the Campbell Town District High School and it extends to:

        from Glendonald in Victoria. The grand champion fleece went to Trefusis—congratulations to Georgie Wallace. The New England Wool award, presented by my good friend Andrew Raeber, went to Julian Cotton from Kelvedon on the east coast of Tasmania. The most valuable fleece went to Frank and Josie Chester of Camelford at Campbell Town.

        A show like this would not run without sponsors. A long-term sponsor of the Campbell Town Show is Roberts Limited, in their 150th year of operation. Congratulations to them, also. Many others—agricultural businesses and individuals—support the Campbell Town Show. These volunteers have my thanks and my admiration for the amazing job they do. Congratulations to all on another wonderful Campbell Town Show this year.
