        I rise to present a petition which has been considered by the

         Standing Committee
        </a>
        on Petitions and certified as being in accordance with the standing orders.

       <p class="italic">
        To the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We, the undersigned citizens of Australia,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Express our appreciation to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        1. Our Prime Minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
         Tony Abbott
        </a>
        , and Members of his Government, for the principled and moral stand taken hitherto concerning its continuing recognition of, and strong support for, the modem
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Israel" rel="nofollow">
         State of Israel
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        2. The current Government for its adherence to the international community's decision, expressed through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations
        </a>
        in 1948, to support the Jewish homeland which has been the cradle of Jewish religion, culture and identity since ancient times.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We therefore request the House to strongly encourage the current Government to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        1. Recognise officially that the Arab-Palestinian people manifestly fail to meet the conditions of statehood under international law, and that Palestinian leaders regularly use incitement in calling specifically for the obliteration of Israel, consistent with the Charter of Hamas.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        2. Recognise the totally untenable security position that Israel would face should a "Palestinian state" be established on what under international law are clearly "disputed territories."
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        3. Maintain its clear stance that any peace agreement - and solution to the current ongoing conflict -
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUST" rel="nofollow">
         MUST
        </a>
        be achieved through direct negotiations between Israel and Palestinian representatives, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOT" rel="nofollow">
         NOT
        </a>
        through a unilateral recognition of a "Palestinian state."
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        4. Be open to leading the way in supporting a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ONE" rel="nofollow">
         ONE
        </a>
        STATE SOLUTION, being the democratic
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_State" rel="nofollow">
         Jewish State
        </a>
        of Israel, in order to allow Israel's Government to strive for peace whilst continuing to protect her citizens (of all nationalities and religions) within safe and secure borders, especially in its undivided capital of Jerusalem.
       </p>
       <p>
        from 3,625 citizens
       </p>
       <p>
        Petition received.
       </p>
       <p>
        The petition I have tabled expresses appreciation to the Prime Minister and members of his government for the principled and moral stand taken on the recognition of and support for the modern state of Israel. The petition also calls on the House to encourage the government to recognise officially that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arab_Palestinian" rel="nofollow">
         Arab Palestinian
        </a>
        people manifestly failed to meet the conditions of statehood under international law and that Palestinian leaders regularly use incitement in calling specifically for the obliteration of Israel consistent with the charter of Hamas. The petitioners also call on the House to encourage the government to lead the way in supporting a one-state solution, that being the democratic Jewish state of Israel.
       </p>
       <p>
        The petition as signed by 3,625 individuals, and I think it is something that we do need to consider. In international affairs there has viewpoint dominant that only a two-state solution is worthy of consideration when it comes to Israel. Israel is a beacon in that area of the world. It is democratic. There are rights extended to minorities. It could be that a one-state solution is the solution to peace in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
         Middle East
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I also seek leave to table a document entitled 'Future of the state of Israel', which has gone before the Petitions Committee. It is not in accordance with the rules but it is basically a copy of the same petition.
