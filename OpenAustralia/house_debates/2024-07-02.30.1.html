        For the benefit of those in the gallery, I am the federal MP that represents Darwin and Palmerston in the

        There are some incredible community events on in Solomon. In last couple of weeks we've had a festival with the Nepalese community and the Pakistani community. My family and I also joined about 4,000 others at the Barunga Festival. If you ever get an opportunity to go, it's a great festival that really looks at

        We also had the Supercars. It just doesn't stop; It's just great event after great event. The Supercars were a fantastic weekend as well. We had the flyovers by the jets, by Joint Strike Fighters, the F-35s. They wowed the whole crowd. Speaking of them, we have
