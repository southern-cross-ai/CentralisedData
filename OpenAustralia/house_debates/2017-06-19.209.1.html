        Queensland is one of the largest providers of school-based chaplains in Australia. They focus on bringing hope to a young generation by enabling them, with skills and strategies, to face life's greatest challenges. Chappy

        and chappy Sarah Dwyer from Meridan State College in my electorate of Fisher are shining examples of the Scripture Union vision. I recently had the honour of attending their annual fundraising dinner, where I was provided with an insight into their amazing work. Parent Karina Bombski reflected on the support given to her family after the passing last year of their daughter and sister, Sophie, who had been a student at the primary school. Support came by way of home-cooked meals, a shoulder to cry on and, most importantly, a listening earâ€”and there was not a dry eye in the house.

        locals Dave and Adrienne Larkin also shared their personal experiences of being foster carers and how Dave, a chaplain himself, has navigated his own path from a life of struggles to the ultimate responsibility of being a parent. Chaplaincy and becoming foster parents has given this family a focus and a life purpose that they are incredibly grateful for.

        Our children these days are facing complex social and environmental challenges, and chaplains provide support and guidance that makes no judgement. To all of the chaplains serving at our schools in Fisher, I say thank you for your dedication and support.
