        Australians woke up over the weekend to news that the government is engaged not just in sports rorts but in the nuclear rorting that has been going on with the infrastructure fund. The people of Dunkley want to know where is the money, the so-called budgeted money, that was promised to Dunkley when it was a Liberal held seat. We heard the former member for Dunkley talking about $225 million worth of funding for the extension of the Metro line to Baxter. They called and called for the release of a business case. It was provided to the federal government in October last year. Three weeks ago I wrote to the minister and asked him to release the business case to the community and to me, but he has not responded. We had the former member for Dunkley talking about there being $38.5 million in budgeted funding for car parking at Frankston, Kananook and Seaford, apparently for 800 spaces. We have seen nothing. What do we know? There was no consultation with the community, the council or the state government, just an announcement out of the air. What are they going to do? Are they going to build a car park at Seaford at the site of the

         RSL
        </a>
        ? Who would know, because they have been completely silent on it. Where is the $30 million that they announced for doing up the intersections on Ballarto Road? We want the business case released, we want the parking station at Frankston to be started as soon as possible and we want a commitment in this year's federal budget that all the money promised for Dunkley is going to stay there. We are a Labor seat now and we're going to make sure that we get the money that was promised to us.
