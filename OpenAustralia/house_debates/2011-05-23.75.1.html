        Recently, I recognised eight local sporting champions from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains" rel="nofollow">
         Blue Mountains
        </a>
        and Hawkesbury at an afternoon tea. These truly exceptional young sports men and women have competed in a variety of sports. The Local Sporting Champions program involves federal members of parliament nominating individuals for greater recognition and financial support.

       <p>
        Jack Bangel of Bilpin competed in hurdles at the All Schools Championships in Melbourne. Determined to qualify, he competed in this competition against those in the age group above his. Jack is very committed, training four days a week. He is also a member of the Australian under-17s development squad for hurdles.

        Mitchell Chaston of

        has competed in the last four national championships in

        and in the World Titles at Adelaide in 2009 he was placed 12th. Mitchell has been training as part of the State Talent Squad, and he dreams of one day competing at the Olympics, in BMX.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lachlan Weber of Winmalee competed at the National Swimming Titles in Adelaide. Lachlan has been training since he was seven and was surprised to have qualified for the National Swimming Titles. Lachlan and fellow swimmers Cameron McElroy,

         Jack Kemp
        </a>
        and Ryan Nichols formed the relay team and were placed 10th in the titles. This great achievement demonstrates the hard work of swimmers at the Springwood Swimming Club.
       </p>
       <p>
        Shannon Usher of Katoomba competed in tumbling at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
         NSW
        </a>
        State Aged/Elite Championships. Shannon has been tumbling for eight years and was placed first in the state and second in the Club Nationals last year.

        I congratulate them and their parents for the contributions they makeâ€”
