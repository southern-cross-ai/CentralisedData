          (3)
         </dt>
         <dd>
          supports the participation of Taiwan in the WHA as an observer, given that such participation would allow Taiwan to more effectively contribute to international health coordination, and to better protect its 23 million people from possible trans-national health emergencies, including Avian Influenza.
         </dd>
        </dl>
       </p>
       <p>
        This is the third time in four years that I have spoken in favour of Taiwan being granted observer status in the World Health Organisation. This is because I believe it is right and fair that that happen. This is not a political issue; it is a fundamental issue of human rights.
       </p>
       <p>
        Article 1 of the World Health Organisation states as a fundamental aim of the organisation the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health. This must therefore include Taiwan’s 23 million people. There are three good reasons why Taiwan should be granted observer status. The first is the need to maximise international cooperation—that is, to integrate and coordinate approaches to tackling health issues that cross national borders. It is more and more vital due to the increased population movements, the increased levels of trade and the increased threat of the international transmission of disease, such as SARS, which we had in 2003, and the threat of the avian flu pandemic. I notice that in a resolution of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
         European Parliament
        </a>
        just last week they mentioned ‘the necessity of direct and unobstructed participation in international health cooperation networks, forums and programs for all parts of the world, especially with today’s greater potential for cross-border spread of various infectious diseases—for example avian influenza and SARS’.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second reason is that health is a fundamental right. Taiwan’s 23 million people have a right to information and services, as do other people in the world. The non-access to the World Health Organisation limits Taiwan’s capacity to protect its people, as happened in 2003 with the SARS outbreak when Taiwan’s efforts were hampered by non-access to World Health Organisation expertise.
       </p>
       <p>
        The third reason, conversely, is Taiwan has much to contribute to the world health effort. It did in 2003 and it is currently contributing with the avian flu issues. It has helped in many areas in recent years. In response to the tsunami, Taiwan has a proud record of help in, for instance,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lanka" rel="nofollow">
         Sri Lanka
        </a>
        . It has put in substantial work in recent years to overseas aid, health and humanitarian issues, giving relief to over 78 countries. It has run campaigns, for instance, to eradicate malaria,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS" rel="nofollow">
         AIDS
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TB" rel="nofollow">
         TB
        </a>
        and yellow fever. Taiwan has a quality health system and needs to be able to contribute freely. Again, the resolution last week by the European Parliament says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The health care system of Taiwan is one of the best and most advanced in the region and the Taiwanese authorities wish to let their specialists participate in the World Health Organisation’s preparatory meetings of experts on the avian flu situation.
       </p>
       <p>
        For those three reasons, it makes sense and it is fair that Taiwan be given access, as an observer, to the World Health Organisation. It is for those reasons also that Taiwan’s efforts have been supported so strongly in recent years by many professional organisations, such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Medical_Association" rel="nofollow">
         British Medical Association
        </a>
        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Medical_Association" rel="nofollow">
         World Medical Association
        </a>
        , the International Paediatric Association, the
        <i>
         Lancet
        </i>
        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Standing Committee
        </a>
        of European Doctors, the Philippine Medical Association, the International Congress on Traditional Medicine—and the list goes on. As well as that, a number of governments have supported Taiwan’s efforts, including the US congress, the European Parliament—which, again, reinforced its commitment just last week, on 18 May this year—the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_American_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
         Central American Parliament
        </a>
        , the Belgium Chamber of Representatives, the Council of the European Union and so on. In fact, the Council of the European Union says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Taiwan’s record in improving health conditions and the life expectancy of its population is impressive. Taiwan should be given the right and the opportunity to contribute to and benefit from the work of the World Health Organisation.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are indisputable arguments in favour of Taiwan’s participation and there are no arguments against it. I know there is nervousness about Taiwan’s political situation and concerns that this may have implications for that country’s political status, but those concerns are misguided. Being granted observer status to the WHO would have no bearing on Taiwan’s political situation. This is a totally separate issue. It is a health issue, not a political issue. Of the World Health Organisation’s six semipermanent observers, only one is a sovereign state; therefore, Taiwan’s participation does not have to be construed in political terms. It is a health issue, not a political issue. Taiwan should be granted, without delay, observer status to the World Health Organisation.

         </small>
         <p>
          It is my pleasure to second the lengthy motion moved by the Chief Government Whip, a motion that seeks to have Taiwan granted observer status to the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
           World Health Organisation
          </a>
          . I will go over some of the points made by my esteemed colleague. Unfortunately, it is true that we have suffered epidemics in recent times. The Chief Government Whip mentioned
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS" rel="nofollow">
           SARS
          </a>
          and avian flu, and I would add that we were very lucky that japanese encephalitis was contained within Malaysia.
         </p>
         <p>
          The truth is that we are facing epidemics and surely we run the risk that at some time at least one will turn into a pandemic. It is when one of these epidemics becomes a pandemic that we will regret Taiwan not having been granted observer status to the World Health Organisation, in that it will not have been able to bring to that organisation its skills and expertise. Every country that we leave out increases our risk, I believe, of getting a pandemic.
         </p>
         <p>
          Many Australians may feel that Australia is not at risk of avian flu. Every year some 13,000 illegal fishing boats land on our shores, with some of them containing birds. If there is one way that Australia will face the threat of avian flu, it is through those illegal fishing boats coming from our north. I would say that the risk is quite high; and, in containing such a disease, we would want all possible assistance from every member country of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO" rel="nofollow">
           WHO
          </a>
          . It seems to me that leaving Taiwan out is a shame and represents a risk to all of us.
         </p>
         <p>
          There is this issue: is this somehow giving Taiwan de facto political recognition? I believe that neither the government nor the opposition is walking away from our one-China policy. We believe that the issues between China and Taiwan are capable of being resolved—but by discussion and diplomacy, not by freezing one country out of all international organisations. I have been privileged to visit Taiwan and I am impressed with the level of skill and expertise of the Taiwanese. They would have much to contribute in fights against epidemics and pandemics.
         </p>
         <p>
          The
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
           United Nations
          </a>
          World Health Organisation, for the record, was established in 1948. Its objective, set out in its constitution, is the attainment by all peoples of the highest possible level of health. I repeat: to achieve that these days is not a one-country operation. We are all interdependent in terms of health and outbreaks and in stopping epidemics becoming pandemics. The WHO has 192 members and some six observers. I believe that the World Health Organisation would be strengthened by Taiwan being granted observer status.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Chief Government Whip pointed out, quite rightly, that the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
           EU
          </a>
          recently strongly supported observer status being granted to Taiwan. The EU is a considerable body of countries, countries which are not insensitive to the tensions that exist from time to time between Taiwan and China. I strongly support this motion. I sincerely hope that it will not be too long before we see observer status granted to Taiwan.

           I rise to speak on the member for Macquarie’s motion. It is most regrettable that Taiwan, a nation of some 23 million people, continues to be frustrated in its attempts to participate in the world’s premier public health forum, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
            World Health Organisation
           </a>
           . Once it is accepted that Taiwan’s application for admission to the World Health Organisation as an observer should be assessed on humanitarian grounds, and within the context of global health security concerns, it becomes impossible to maintain any objection to this application. Under its own constitution, the World Health Organisation is charged with the task of ensuring the attainment ‘by all peoples’ of the highest possible standards of health. As we know, the World Health Organisation has worked towards the achievement of this objective through a range of mechanisms. Each of these mechanisms is committed to the delivery of health services—be they in the form of alert and response networks, prevention programs, research initiatives or medical expertise projects—within the framework of this greater, non-political objective. Yet, sadly, Taiwan is continually denied access to the expertise of these mechanisms, solely on political grounds.
          </p>
          <p>
           In spite of these ongoing difficulties, Taiwan continues to demonstrate its steadfast commitment to the achievement of optimal national and global health security. On 15 May this year, the Taiwanese government announced its voluntary early compliance with the terms of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Health_Regulations" rel="nofollow">
            International Health Regulations
           </a>
           (2005). This commendable achievement is indicative of the fact that Taiwan takes very seriously its responsibilities, as a regional hub of trade and commerce, for the development and maintenance of sound public health practices.
          </p>
          <p>
           As a member of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Trade_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
            World Trade Organisation
           </a>
           , Taiwan has an obligation to develop and implement such practices without disrupting international trade and traffic through its territory. It is only when the volume of such trade is analysed that the enormity of this task and the implications for Australia of Taiwan’s compliance with the International Health Regulations can be fully appreciated. For example, Taiwan is Australia’s ninth largest trading partner, accounting for more than three per cent of Australia’s total trade. In the 12 months to August 2005, some 109,000 Taiwanese tourists visited Australia, and there are over 6,000 Taiwanese students currently studying in this country. In global terms, Taiwan registers around 7½ million outbound travellers and 2½ million inbound visitors each year. Taiwan’s health administration deals with health matters relating to some 27 million international air passengers, 225,000 international flights, 51,000 international-serviced vessels and hundreds of millions of tonnes of cargo each year. Quite clearly, Taiwan has a very close trading relationship with Australia and is an integral member of the greater international trade and global transport framework. These figures only serve to strengthen Taiwan’s application for admission to the World Health Organisation as an observer.
          </p>
          <p>
           The threat of a worldwide outbreak of infectious disease is very real and is not curtailed by international borders or state boundaries. Taiwan’s level of integration into the global economy, combined with its geographic situation in close proximity to continental East Asia—the region from which many of the world’s deadliest infectious disease outbreaks have emanated—make it a vitally important cog in the global health protection framework of the World Health Organisation.
          </p>
          <p>
           Many members will recall the two previous private member’s bills that were tabled in this place in support of Taiwan’s application to the World Health Organisation in May 2003 and March 2004. A significant number of members spoke in support of those bills. It is not only in this place that Taiwan’s bid for observer status with the World Health Organisation has been supported. I wish to bring members’ attention to the resolutions of support in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">

            European Parliament
           </a>
           this year and in a range of other parliaments around the world. These resolutions, combined with the vocal support for this bid coming from a range of well-respected international medical bodies including the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Medical_Association" rel="nofollow">
            World Medical Association
           </a>
           , provide evidence of the widespread international support for Taiwan’s participation in the World Health Organisation. It is time that Taiwan were incorporated into the World Health Organisation. No matters of argument substantiate any claim that this not occur. I urge all members to support this motion.

              <p>
               Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I rise to speak in support of this motion. Taiwan is a thriving democracy with a world-class health care system and it has one of the largest biotechnological science industries in the Asia-Pacific. It has the potential to make a substantial contribution to global health care, yet it remains unrepresented in the world’s most important health forum, the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
                World Health Organisation
               </a>
               , due largely to political reasons, the details of which all members will be aware.
              </p>
              <p>
               Self-evidently, however, the question of Taiwan’s admission as an observer to the World Health Organisation is of a humanitarian and health related nature and is not a political question. Taiwan does not seek full membership of the World Health Organisation, and thus issues of statehood or political recognition are irrelevant to this debate. Taiwan’s participation in the World Health Organisation as an observer would not in any way contravene the organisation’s constitution. Currently, the World Health Organisation makes provision for the participation of a number of observer entities including the

              </p>
              <p>
               Taiwan’s achievement in the field of health care has indeed been commendable. The 23 million people of Taiwan enjoy one of the highest life expectancies in Asia as well as very low maternal and infant mortality rates. The country has instituted highly successful disease eradication and preventative health programs. Moreover, and despite its exclusion from the World Health Organisation, Taiwan has sought to share its expertise in the field of health care through the ongoing provision of international aid. Indeed, Taiwan is engaged in long-term medical development projects throughout the world. If Taiwan were to be admitted as an observer to the World Health Organisation, it would have the opportunity to expand its already substantial contribution to international health care.
              </p>
              <p>
               Taiwan has become a major regional trade and transport hub. In 2005 alone, over 27 million international air passengers, 225,000 international flights, 51,000 international-serviced vessels and hundreds of millions of tonnes of cargo were in transit through Taiwan. In the 12 months to 2005, over 109,000 Taiwanese tourists visited Australia. In an era of unprecedented global interconnectivity, the threat posed by infectious diseases such as
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AIDS" rel="nofollow">
                AIDS
               </a>
               and avian influenza has become even more acute. Given Taiwan’s level of integration into the international trading network, it would be a great and unnecessary risk to continue to exclude Taiwan from participating in, and contributing to, the global health care framework under the auspices of the World Health Organisation.
              </p>
              <p>
               Due largely to its inability to gain access to the global outbreak and response network of the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO" rel="nofollow">
                WHO
               </a>
               during the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS" rel="nofollow">
                SARS
               </a>
               crisis of 2003, Taiwan’s capacity to respond to the spread of the disease was severely hampered, resulting in the tragic deaths of 73 Taiwanese SARS victims. We cannot allow a tragedy such as this to be repeated. We must recognise that disease knows no boundaries and that emergent diseases such as the highly pathogenic
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H5N1" rel="nofollow">
                H5N1
               </a>
               strain of avian influenza constitute a grave threat to both the people of Taiwan and the health of the international community at large.
              </p>
              <p>
               Taiwan has a population larger than that of 75 per cent of the member states of the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
                United Nations
               </a>
               . It is unreasonable for them to be denied the protection of the prevention and response networks and expertise of the World Health Organisation. Many parliaments and congresses throughout the world have passed resolutions supporting Taiwan’s meaningful and constructive participation in the WHO as an observer. These include the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
                US
               </a>

                European Parliament
               </a>
               . In addition, a large number of medical professions and organisations such as the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Medical_Association" rel="nofollow">
                World Medical Association
               </a>

                British Medical Association
               </a>
               have expressed their support for Taiwan’s bid for observer status. It is the responsibility of the international community to ensure that all peoples throughout the world are able to enjoy the highest attainable standards of health. This is not a political issue. The obstruction of Taiwan’s bid for participation in the World Health Organisation should not, as a matter of international health security, and in the interests of the people of Taiwan, be permitted to continue.

               <p>
                As indicated by a number of colleagues before me, the question of Taiwan’s admission as an observer to the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
                 World Health Organisation
                </a>
                is a health issue. It is not a political issue. That point should be made perfectly clear to all members of this House. Taiwan is a thriving democracy of 23 million people. This is a population larger than three-quarters of the member states of the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO" rel="nofollow">
                 WHO
                </a>
                itself. From this fact alone, denying the citizens of Taiwan the right to international health through the WHO is essentially placing a significant proportion of the world’s population at risk. For a group of 23 million people who are facing some extreme situations, especially related to avian influenza, granting Taiwan observership status in the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Assembly" rel="nofollow">
                 World Health Assembly
                </a>
                is a matter of principle. Dr Lee Jong-Wok, Director-General of the WHO, has stated publicly that all members of the international community should work together to share information and expertise in relation to avian influenza.
               </p>
               <p>
                For Taiwan to be an effective contributor to this global prevention and containment effort, its participation in the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHA" rel="nofollow">
                 WHA
                </a>
                is vital. Taiwan has a world-class health care system that has been recognised internationally. Its citizens enjoy the highest life expectancy in Asia, with very low maternal and infant mortality rates. The government has eradicated diseases such as cholera and smallpox completely. Taiwan has also demonstrated its willingness to share its excellent resources with the rest of the world through the provision of development aid. It donated over $
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
                 US
                </a>
                120 million in medical supplies and humanitarian relief to 78 countries, spanning five continents, from 1995 to 2002. Moreover, the fact that its government has continued to do this while being excluded from the WHO is evidence of Taiwan’s strong commitment to international health care.
               </p>
               <p>
                The
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS" rel="nofollow">
                 SARS
                </a>
                experience in 2003 illustrates the vital importance of a fully integrated global response system regarding international health emergencies. Taiwan’s exclusion from the WHO delayed the provision of assistance from the WHO by seven weeks and as such severely hampered Taiwan’s efforts in containing the spread of SARS within its borders. The catastrophic result was the death of over 70 Taiwanese citizens, constituting almost one-fifth of the world’s total SARS fatalities. Had Taiwan been included in the WHO, these deaths could have been avoided.
               </p>

                Taiwan is located at an important juncture for the movement of both goods and people in East Asia, with nearly eight million outbound and three million inbound travellers annually. This places Taiwan at the crossroads of any infectious disease outbreak in the region. Taiwan is Australia’s 10th largest trading partner and accounts for 3.1 per cent of Australia’s total trade. Moreover, in the 12 months to August 2005, 109,000 Taiwanese tourists visited Australia. If avian influenza were to affect the Taiwanese population, the effect on the health of Australian citizens, not to mention our trade and economy, could be disastrous. The rules of procedure of the WHA formally allow through several mechanisms for the participation of observers in the activities of the organisation. There are a number of precedents for such participation, as the former speaker said in her speech, that include the

                Taiwan does not seek membership status at the WHO. It seeks only to become an observer according to the rules of the WHA, rules which give effect to the fact that participation in the WHO is a health and humanitarian issue, not a political one. The time has come to allow Taiwan to participate in the WHO. The
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
                 European Parliament
                </a>
                enacted a resolution supporting Taiwan’s bid for observer status in the WHA last week, and I hope very much it is passed. In light of the growing threat of an avian influenza pandemic, it is increasingly evident that Taiwan’s non-participation in the WHO places at risk not only its 23 million citizens but also the health security of people around the world. This issue is about reducing serious health threats. I urge members to give this matter serious consideration and to support Taiwan’s bid to become an observer to the WHO.

                 I rise to support the motion moved by the member for Macquarie. As asserted by the Director-General of the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
                  World Health Organisation
                 </a>
                 in a speech to the International Pledging Conference on Avian and Human Pandemic Influenza in January this year, it is vital that all members of the international community work together to share information and expertise in order to prevent the spread of infectious diseases such as avian influenza. In realising this objective, it is necessary to ensure that the global disease response and prevention framework operates seamlessly. The continued exclusion of Taiwan from the World Health Organisation creates a significant gap in this framework, particularly given Taiwan’s emergence as a major hub of trade and commerce in the Asia-Pacific region. This exclusion increases the risk of the spread of infectious disease both amongst the 23 million people of Taiwan and, indeed, throughout the international community.
                </p>
                <p>
                 In global terms, the past decade has witnessed an increase in the level of interaction between peoples. As evidenced by the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS" rel="nofollow">
                  SARS
                 </a>
                 crisis of 2003, this increasing mobility has also given rise to substantial difficulties in the area of disease prevention. Frustrated in its attempts to gain access to the global outbreak and response network of the World Health Organisation during this crisis, the health authorities in Taiwan were left to fight the disease alone, leading to the tragic death of 73 Taiwanese citizens, constituting one-fifth of the world’s SARS related fatalities. Similarly, Taiwan’s lack of real time access to the latest information about avian influenza threatens the global coordination effort and places an unfair burden on Taiwan’s medical authorities.
                </p>
                <p>
                 These problems serve to lessen the effectiveness of global disease prevention measures and to increase the chance of regional proliferation of communicable diseases. In this respect, it is extremely important that Taiwan is party to the early warnings, threat indicators, vaccines and other medical supplies, and the pool of combined scientific knowledge that the World Health Organisation has to offer.

                 have all been strengthened by the work of the World Health Organisation, often with remarkable results. Significantly, disease is no longer the only imperative. Now we have the added threat of chemical and biological terrorism. This must also be considered in the context of global health security. This threat provides yet another reason to encourage Taiwanese participation in the World Health Organisation.

                 By granting observer status to Taiwan at the World Health Organisation the international community would enhance its capacity to deal with these emerging and continuing threats. As mentioned earlier by the other honourable members, the World Health Organisation has previously sanctioned the participation of a number of observers, including the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_See" rel="nofollow">

                 . Observer status is granted on humanitarian and health grounds and does not involve questions of political recognition.
                </p>
                <p>
                 Taiwan’s bid for participation as an observer in the World Health Organisation has gained widespread international support. Many governments and political organisations around the world have offered their support for this bid, including the

                 Australia and Taiwan have longstanding friendly relations. Both have benefited from the close economic relationship that has been developed between us, and we in Australia welcome the emergence of Taiwan as one of the region’s strongest and most vibrant democracies. Yet, despite the great successes of Taiwan’s health care system and despite the significant technological advances that have delivered Taiwanese people the highest life expectancy in Asia, Taiwan has no access to the expert information, alert and response networks of the
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO" rel="nofollow">
                  WHO
                 </a>
                 . The admission of Taiwan to the WHO as an observer is not a political question. It is a question of recognising the right of the people of Taiwan to the highest attainable standards of health care. I urge all members to offer their support to this motion.
