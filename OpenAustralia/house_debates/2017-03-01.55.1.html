       <p>
        Our national capital is linked to parts of my own electorate through the visionary hands of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Burley_Griffin" rel="nofollow">
         Walter Burley Griffin
        </a>
        and Marion Mahoney Griffin. Just as they shaped Canberra as the bush capital, so the Griffins were responsible for the celebrated planning and architecture of Castlecrag. Their vision was for a suburb created in harmony with the area's natural bushland and founded in a strong sense of community.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the early 1930s Marion Mahoney Griffin established the Haven Valley Scenic Theatre to help bring the community together. The theatre was formed by the landscape of a Castlecrag gully and allowed theatregoers to witness productions under moonlight and the stars, surrounded by majestic eucalypts and the colour of wattle blooms.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sadly, the theatre fell into disrepair, but was salvaged through the efforts of the local community in the mid-1970s. Today the community is again rallying to ensure its future. I was therefore thrilled to be able to attend the Sydney premiere of a spectacular circus opera,

        , at the Chatswood Concourse to help raise funds for the rebuilding of the Haven amphitheatre stage.
       </p>
       <p>
        The three performances raised over $58,000, and I want to congratulate all those involved in what was a major undertaking. Willoughby Council has allocated funds for the restoration of the Haven, which will need to be matched by contributions from the community. Their attendance at
        <i>

        demonstrates just how committed residents are to achieving this goal. I hope it will not be too long before the Haven once again is restored to its unique place in the community and cultural life of our city.
