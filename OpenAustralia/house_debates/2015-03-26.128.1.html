        Next month, our nation will come together to commemorate the Anzac Centenary. Anzac Day 2015 marks 100 years since the Gallipoli landings. It is our nation's annual commemorative day for acknowledging and remembering those who served not only in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         First World War
        </a>
        but also in conflicts and operations throughout the last century and into this century as well. In my federal electorate of Holt, we will be encouraging individuals and families to become involved in the Anzac Centenary and attend the major commemorations that occur on that day, which are generally held in Cranbourne,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endeavour_Hills" rel="nofollow">

        and Berwick.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am very pleased to tell this chamber that many local schools in my constituency—such as Fountain Gate Secondary College and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alkira_Secondary_College" rel="nofollow">
         Alkira Secondary College
        </a>
        —and local sporting and community groups will also conduct their own Anzac Day Centenary commemorations around the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Casey" rel="nofollow">
         City of Casey
        </a>
        . In the lead-up to the Anzac Centenary, I would like to commend the Australian government on its Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program that assists and encourages communities across Australia to undertake their own Anzac Centenary projects.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Holt, five Anzac Centenary grant applications have so far been approved. Saffron Grove retirement village was awarded $814 for the installation of a flagpole for use at Anzac Day and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Remembrance Day
        </a>
        commemorative ceremonies. Even that small amount has made a substantial difference to the life of that home and that community. The Cranbourne combined patchworkers were awarded $3,420 to create a Cranbourne Anzac Centenary triptych. The Provenance Artists Inc. were awarded $22,605 to hold an Anzac Centenary arts exhibition from 3 to 5 July 2015. There will be more than 30 artists participating and displaying commemorative paintings at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics'_Institute" rel="nofollow">

        hall on Webb Street,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narre_Warren" rel="nofollow">
         Narre Warren
        </a>
        . Alkira Secondary College was awarded $8,135 to install an avenue of memorial trees and establish an artefact display in the library at the college in commemoration of the First World War. And the Hampton Park Progress Association were awarded $17,510 to construct a garden, a mural and a memorial, which will be a cenotaph, as part of a brand new Hampton Park Anzac memorial.
       </p>
       <p>
        Each of these projects benefit the local community, and, importantly, they honour the Anzac Centenary in a respectful manner. I also wish to thank all the members of the Holt Anzac Centenary Grants Committee that played a role in selecting these projects for funding, namely: Leanne Petrides, Erica Maliki,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barry_Rogers" rel="nofollow">

        . The Anzac Centenary is a historic event for our nation. I am very pleased to see it commemorated in these ways on this very important day to our country.
