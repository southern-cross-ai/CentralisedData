        I take this opportunity to recognise some of the fantastic volunteer groups and individuals across my electorate of Forde who have recently been recognised in the City of Logan Safe City Awards for their exemplary contribution to making our community a better and safer place to live.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Logan and Beenleigh high-risk team received top honours in the partnership category for their cross-agency work in supporting women and children at risk of domestic and family violence across Logan. This is an exemplar of the corrective and health services, public servants and volunteers working together to keep women and children in our community safe and to hold domestic violence perpetrators accountable for their actions. In doing so, the team handled over 500 referrals since they began their work in 2017.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rolando Pisia won the Safe City Volunteer Award as a proponent of Sturdee Park Youth Engagement Project in Loganlea. Rolando has been a champion of community safety and development in his work to engage with local youths to reduce organised crime and vandalism at Sturdee Park. I would also like to commend
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Logan City Council
        </a>
        for the tremendous work they have done to upgrade the facilities there as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Katrina Whitfield, a teacher's aide at Beenleigh State High School was nominated for her dedication in her role as a school crossing supervisor. For the past five years she has made it her mission to ensure students get home safe from school every day, while also being a friendly face students can talk to in times of need. She is known in our community for her fearless dedication to keeping children safe on the road.
       </p>
       <p>
        Youth Off the Streets took out the not-for-profit category award for their Logan outreach program supporting disadvantaged youths to recover from hardship or trauma. They host community barbecues, movie nights and other events to help young people connect with youth workers and create a positive outlook for their future.
       </p>
       <p>
        It fills me with great confidence heading into 2020 to know that there are groups and individuals in Forde and everywhere else in Australia who make it their life's work to help our communities unite and be safe. I want to thank them for their work. I will take this opportunity to wish them all the best for the festive season and a fantastic and prosperous 2020.
