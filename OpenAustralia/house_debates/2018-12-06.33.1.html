        I would like to say just how much I welcomed the tabling of the review into regional telecommunications a couple of days ago. It's a very fine body of work that recognises the good work that the government has done, particularly in the rollout of the mobile phone network. Over 840 base stations have been built as a result of that program. Of course, there is the continuous rollout of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        network. They do recommend increasing the satellite packages, the Sky Muster, which has already been done, but I'm hoping that there is more scope to do that in the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        I made the point at the release of the review that sometimes Australian agriculture farmers, in particular, are viewed with a hayseed behind their ear and the backside out of their pants. Modern agriculture is not like that at all. It is cutting edge. It's first rate. It's high technology. Some of the smartest people in the country are investing in this wonderful industry, which supports regional Australia, and they need the best tools. Some people need to monitor where their packages are on this earth for their marketing and for satellite guidance for precision agriculture within the paddock. All these things are giving great benefits to Australian agriculture and to regional Australia. That's why this government continues to invest strongly in that area. I keep lobbying the Prime Minister and others that we make an ongoing commitment to mobile phone infrastructure in Australia. That's what my people keep asking for.
