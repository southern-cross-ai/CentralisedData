        is a time for communities across this vast continent to pay tribute to some of their outstanding people: citizens of good character who have selflessly served their local community in many and varied ways to improve the lives of others. I want to extend my congratulations and appreciation to some outstanding citizens in my electorate of Mallee who are worthy of public recognition. In the Yarriambiack shire there are two young achievers of the year, both from Rupanyup: Lachlan Weidemann and Chandan Thandi. Lachlan is a role model in his community, where he has served as school captain. He has excelled in academic achievements and sport and is recognised in his community for his business achievements. Chandan Thandi has also been awarded for his excellence in sport and academia and for significant contributions to the local Rupanyup show. Chandon is known as a humble, confident young man and generally a great bloke. Yarriambiack Citizen of the Year was awarded to Marg 'Chappy' Lingham, a lifelong contributor to many sporting clubs in the area, including the local football and netball club, golf club, tennis club and bowls club. She is known as someone who is hardworking, never complains and just gets on with it. Congratulations to these wonderful citizens.
