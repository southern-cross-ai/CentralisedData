       <p>
        I rise to express my deep sorrow at the recent passing of Professor Lianggong Chiou. Professor Chiou was an educator for more than 40 years, who most recently taught at the University of Queensland in the Department of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_Science" rel="nofollow">
         Political Science
        </a>
        and even taught
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Swan" rel="nofollow">
         Wayne Swan
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">
         Kevin Rudd
        </a>
        , or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lu_Kewen" rel="nofollow">
         Lu Kewen
        </a>
        . Professor Chiou was an educator in many places around the world, including at the Hoover centre at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_University" rel="nofollow">
         Stanford University
        </a>
        and as a visiting professor at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_State_University" rel="nofollow">
         California State University
        </a>
        . He was awarded a postdoctoral fellowship at the University of California.
       </p>
       <p>
        Born in the countryside of Miaoli and raised in the mountains of Tainan, with both Hakka and aboriginal ancestry, Professor Chiou was educated at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_University" rel="nofollow">
         Taiwan University
        </a>
        in foreign languages. Professor Chiou wanted to be a writer, but he changed his study plans and eventually studied politics, specialising in international relations, political culture and democratic development. Professor Chiou was a passionate advocate for Taiwan's democracy and freedom and culture throughout his life.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am grateful to have had the benefit of Professor Chiou's wisdom while he was alive. He was a great mentor to me and many other politicians. I extend my condolences to Professor Chiou's family during this difficult time. Professor Chiou touched so many people in his life, and he left a passionate legacy that will live on for many more generations. I look forward to working with the next generation, who will be standing on the shoulders of a giant who has left us way too soon. I am sorry that I can't be at the funeral on Fridayâ€”unfortunately I made a commitment to a democratic process that I can't get out of. Vale Professor Chiou.
