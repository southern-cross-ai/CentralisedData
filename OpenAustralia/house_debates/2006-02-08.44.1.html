        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade. I refer the minister to his non-answer to my last question. I refer the minister to the statement of the then
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_Executive" rel="nofollow">
         Chief Executive
        </a>
        of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWB" rel="nofollow">
         AWB
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Rogers" rel="nofollow">
         Mr Rogers
        </a>
        , that the July 1999 changes in the contracts with Iraq were discussed ‘with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">
         DFAT
        </a>
        in Canberra before we proceeded’. Given that this statement by Mr Rogers was made more than three weeks ago, the Volcker inquiry has been ongoing for about two years and that the contract changes that we are talking about were at the very beginning of what was to become a five-year long $300 million scandal, how on earth can you stand up in the parliament today and evade answering the question? Will you report back to parliament by the end of the day on the question I just asked? When did the meeting happen, who was there and what was discussed?

          Will the minister report back to parliament by the end of today on the answers to questions concerning: when did his officials first meet with the

           AWB
          </a>
          in Canberra after the July contract changes with the Iraqis, who were those officials and who did they meet from the AWB and what was discussed? These are serious matters.

           The first point is that we have established the Cole commission of inquiry to investigate all of these matters. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs has outlined, we are the only country out of about 66 countries—

                 The Labor Party keeps interrupting when I am trying to answer the question. I will state again that the Cole commission of inquiry has been established to get to the facts of the matter of this whole issue. That is currently part heard. We should be allowing the Cole commission of inquiry to complete its work and deliver its conclusions. As to the issue in the last part of the member for Griffith’s question, I indicated before that it was quite a complex question on whom, where, when and what dates and what information. I said I would find out for him and I will find out for him and bring it back.
