        It was with a tinge of sadness that, a fortnight ago, I was at the retirement of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Collins" rel="nofollow">

        , from

        , as part of

        . Wayne has been in that role for over 12 years. I also thank his wife, Karen, and his children, who often would have to give up dad to help out the Emerald community. Wayne, you have been an absolutely fantastic ambassador for helping young people not only in Emerald but through the

        It was refreshing to hear young person after young person who was at the send-off tell me personally what a magnificent job Wayne has done, quite often bringing them from a path where they were going down the wrong way to their actually becoming outstanding citizens. I spoke to Wayne Burgess, a former principal at Emerald Secondary College. Wayne brought the chaplaincy program to the school. When it comes to emergency services in the area—I spoke to Ben, who is the captain of the Emerald

        In this short time, we cannot express our gratitude and our thanks to Wayne for what you have done for the community and for all those young lives you have helped. We truly respect you. We honour you, and we look forward to working with you in the future. Good luck in your retirement.
