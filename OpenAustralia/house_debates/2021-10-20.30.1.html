        The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security has made 14 recommendations in its advisory report. Notably, it recommends that the bill be split into two separate bills, with the first bill to incorporate the urgent cyberincident response framework and reporting regime. The government acknowledges and thanks the committee for its work in relation to this bill and other government national security priorities. The Australian people are safer and more secure as a result of the responsible approach that members of this committee take, working together in a truly bipartisan way in the national interest.
       </p>
       <p>
        These government amendments respond to the urgent recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security's 29 September 2021 advisory report on this bill and statutory review of the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018. The intelligence and security committee recommended that these amendments, outlined in recommendations (1) to (5) along with recommendations (10) and (14), be legislated in the shortest possible time. The government is taking immediate action by acting in the very first sitting week since the committee's advisory report was released
       </p>
       <p>
        The reason for this urgency is clear: cyberattacks pose a serious threat to Australian infrastructure. On 19 June 2020, the Prime Minister announced that Australian organisations were currently being targeted by a sophisticated, state-based cyberactor. They were targeting our critical sectors, including government essential service providers and operators of critical infrastructure. Cyberattacks continue. Internationally, we have seen cyberincidents cause significant impacts. The 2021
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonial_Pipeline" rel="nofollow">
         Colonial Pipeline
        </a>
        ransomware attack prevented the distributed of energy supplies to customers along the east coast of the United States. Repeated attacks over the past years on the Ukraine power grid show the devastating impact that malicious cyberactors can cause to critical infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian Cyber Security Centre's 2021 annual cyberthreat report, released on 15 September 2021, highlights that the volume of cybercrime reporting equates to one report of a cyberattack every eight minutes, compared to one every 10 minutes last financial year. Approximately one-quarter of reported cybersecurity incidents affected critical infrastructure organisations, including essential services that all Australians require, such as education, communications, electricity, water and transport.
       </p>
       <p>
        These government amendments address recommendation 1 of the advisory report by amending this bill to retain only the measures that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security recommended be taken forward to the first bill. The measures in the bill as amended will specifically expand the scope of the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act 2018 to include assets across 11 industry sectors as critical infrastructure assets, provide a mechanism to require cyberincident reporting, enable government responses to serious cybersecurity incidents and retain associated definitions and powers. The amendments do not, however, define offensive cyberaction. This bill is clear that the use of offensive cybercapabilities is expressly prohibited from any direction or intervention that the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Home Affairs
        </a>
        can authorise.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill and explanatory material also respond to recommendations 2 and 3 of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security's advisory report through amendments to the cyberincident reporting requirement. In accordance with recommendation 4 of the advisory report, these government amendments also include a provision to ensure that, as soon as practicable after a government assistance measure is directed or requested, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security be notified in writing about the circumstances, actions, status of, and parties involved in each measure used relative to any cybersecurity.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government amendments include a provision that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security may conduct a review of the operation, effectiveness and implications of the reformed security of critical infrastructure legislative framework in the Security of Critical Infrastructure Act not less than three years from when this bill receives royal assent in accordance with recommendation 14 of the advisory report. The amendments also change the commencement of the bill to the day after royal assent and deal with other minor technical matters, including that the bill be passed as per recommendation 5 of the advisory report. These urgent reforms will put the laws in place to respond to a cyberincident and protect Australian critical infrastructure. I commend the government amendments to the House.

         While I rise to support the government amendments to the Security Legislation Amendment (Critical Infrastructure) Bill 2020, it's clear that the government requires the splitting of this bill into two parts in order to bring forward some of the recommendations arising out of the joint standing committee's report. It's critical that we move on these issues.
        </p>
        <p>
         What the opposition has been saying for some time is that cyberattacks in this country are growing rapidly. Indeed, the government should have acted earlier. That's the obvious evidence, so we welcome the procedural motion to split the bill. We believe that in doing so we'll be able to bring forward and action some of these matters that were in the original bill, and that's important because the demand in responding to cyberattacks is greater and more urgent each and every day. For that reason, we have supported that. In fact, it was a suggestion by opposition members of the committee and the shadow minister for home affairs—and no doubt the shadow Attorney-General and other members on this side—who believe the government has been dragging its feet in this very important area of national security. So we do support the minister's procedural motion to split the bill if it means actioning things that should have happened some time ago.
        </p>
        <p>
         It's important for the security of this nation and it's important that organisations that continue to be attacked in this space believe the government can attend to these matters as quickly as possible. I know that national security agencies have been wanting some of these matters for some time. Therefore, we don't want to see, by the enactment of the original bill, any delays to some of these very important matters. It is for that reason that I join the minister in supporting the procedural motion to split the bill. It reflects the view of the opposition, the view of the joint standing committee and, I'm glad to say, the view of the government. For those reasons and for others, the opposition supports this and will be supporting the procedural motion put by the minister.
