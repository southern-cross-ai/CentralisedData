        I want to talk today about an incredibly courageous man in my electorate. His name is Mick Simpson, a former truck driver. Mick is quiet, humble and full of energy. He is also a recipient of the Campaspe Shire Council's senior citizen of the year award and is a Victorian Senior Citizen of the Year Award. He won't tell me exactly how senior he is but he is a senior citizen. What makes him so inspirational is at the moment he is on a walk from Kyabram to Melbourne, 184 kilometres, to raise awareness for dementia. Mick was diagnosed with dementia some years ago and he has made it his mission over the past years to raise awareness about dementia. He has done walks previously, but, at the moment, this senior gentleman is pounding the pavement between Kyabram and Melbourne. People are greeting him along the way. I had the honour, along with Victoria Nationals leader,

        , of walking those first few steps with him. He will be met in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        in Melbourne by many parliamentarians. He hopes to raise $20,000 to assist the work of the Shepparton and Campaspe dementia group.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2023, it is estimated there are more than 400,000 Australians living with dementia, including more than 28,000 with younger onset dementia. Dementia Australia estimates more than 1.5 million people in Australia are involved with the care of living with someone with dementia and I honour Mick for bringing this to people's attention.
