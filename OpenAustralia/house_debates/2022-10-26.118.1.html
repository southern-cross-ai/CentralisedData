        Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).
       </p>
       <p>
        by leave—On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, a committee established back in 1913, I present the committee's 4th report for 2022. This report considers two proposals referred to the committee in August with a combined value of over $491 million. Most of this is for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">

        improvements at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        Tindal outside Katherine in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF_Base_Edinburgh" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF Base Edinburgh

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        . The report also includes the proposal for an office fit-out for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Taxation_Office" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Taxation Office
        </a>
        in Paramatta,

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF_Base_Tindal" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF Base Tindal
        </a>
        and RAAF Base Edinburgh will support the introduction of the Triton aircraft system into service at an estimated cost $427 million.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Triton" rel="nofollow">
         The Triton
        </a>
        is a remotely piloted aircraft system capable of high altitude, long endurance flight, designed for maritime patrol and other surveillance roles. The introduction of this aircraft system will enhance this nation's defence capabilities and ensure we remain agile and adaptive within a rapidly changing geostrategic environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second project is for an office fit-out for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATO" rel="nofollow">
         ATO
        </a>
        , within the recently constructed building at 6 Paramatta Square in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Western Sydney
        </a>
        . The member for Parramatta, who sits next to me, tells me this is the biggest building in Australia for floor space—Paramatta, who knew? The project has an estimated cost of approximately $64 million. The ATO's location plan recognises the need to maintain its 47-year long presence in Paramatta, often described as Sydney's second CBD, though I'm reliably informed it is the country's most dynamic CBD. In line with this plan, it's important that the ATO can provide continuity for its current workforce and continue to attract high-quality personnel located in Western Sydney into the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee extends its thanks to all those who provided written and oral evidence in support of these inquiries. I would like to thank the personnel of both the Department of Defence and the ATO for their comprehensive presentations on these two projects. They provided enough detail to ensure the committee was able to appreciate the importance and nature of the proposed works. In the case of the defence project, the committee travelled to inspect the proposed works at RAAF Base Tindal, outside Katherine. I wish to thank the Department of Defence for facilitating the committee's visit and providing an invaluable insight into the opportunities and challenges associated with the project. In both cases, the committee recommends it be expedient that the proposed works be carried out.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I point out that the Public Works committee, with the full support of the deputy chair, the member for Hinkler and the rest of the committee, have gone from relying on numbers in the title to now using words—radical, I know, but I stand by my committee. I commend the report to the House.
