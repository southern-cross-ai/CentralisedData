        My question is to the Prime Minister. In July this year, Voice architect and member of the government's Referendum Working Group Professor Marcia Langton said, '22 per cent of the Australian population are deeply racist.' Does the Prime Minister agree with this statement?

         I agree that Australians are generous people—that's what I think. I think Australians are fundamentally decent. Regardless of what way they vote in a democratic referendum, I respect Australians—each and every one of them—and I call upon everyone in this debate to be respectful and to carry themselves like my friend

         , who joins us in the gallery. I joined Michael Long today. Michael has walked from Melbourne to

         , just as he did in 2004. He did so then because so many of his friends, family and other people he knew were dying. He was sick of attending funerals. Now, almost 20 years later, the gap has not closed. Michael Long has walked a long way. He is asking Australians to walk just a short way or, to quote the Uluru statement, 'to walk with us in a movement of the Australian people for a better future'. That's what we are being asked to do—to show the generosity and character of the Australian people. The Indigenous people of 65,000 years particularly since 1788 have suffered a lot. We have an eight-year life expectancy gap. We have a greater chance of an Indigenous young male going to jail than going to university. We cannot do things the same way and expect different outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
         Michael Long has come to parliament today. Now it is now up to us to carry his message of love, hope and reconciliation away from the parliament and back to the people in our electorates. In the next four weeks, Australians can take the next step to a better future by writing 'yes'. That is all we are being asked to do—to write 'yes'. To walk those few steps is what we are being asked to do. That step will give our nation the opportunity to take a giant stride—

           I think it is a pity that these interjections occur consistent with, as Michael said this morning in his letter, our former prime minister Howard asking Australians to 'maintain the rage'. This is about love, reconciliation and bringing people together. That is what
