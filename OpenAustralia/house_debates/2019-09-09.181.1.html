       <p>
        I stand today to let everyone know of the circus that just came to Townsville. It's called the Queensland state parliament. They came to Townsville in force and it was an absolute rabble. I have never seen more rabble than the Queensland state Labor government. They do not care about the north. You could tell by what they did when they came to Townsville. They cancelled meetings.

        , I can tell you now: corruption is corruption, and, Jackie Trad, you are not welcome in Townsville.
