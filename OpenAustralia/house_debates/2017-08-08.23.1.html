        It is national Homelessness Week. I was quite proud last week to be able to partner with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MASP" rel="nofollow">
         MASP
        </a>
        , Mallee Accommodation Support Programs, which has been running for 30 years in the electorate of Mallee. The federal government gave MASP $2.45 million to match its contribution to build a new $5 million building to address homelessness in the electorate of Mallee. I want to commend the board and chairman, Mr Greg Leslie, and the chief executive, Mr Gary Simpson. They have had three goes at applying for a grant under the national Building Better Regions Fund and this time they got up. It is going to be a great multipurpose building to address youth homelessness in the Mallee.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the things I really am proud of about the people who live in north-west Victoria is that when they see a problem, rather than come and complain about it, they usually roll up their sleeves and see what that they can do to address it. MASP started 30 years ago because people saw a problem and, out of that, it has grown into an organisation that now employs just under 100 people. I have got to say that their contribution has been recognised with this $2.45 million from the federal government to build a $5 million facility, one that will be there to improve people's lives. That we are addressing the problem is something we should celebrate, particularly during this national Homelessness Week.
