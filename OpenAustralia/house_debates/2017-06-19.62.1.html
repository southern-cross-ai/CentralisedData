        Sam Carroll, three years ago at nine years of age, through that he had an ear infection. After a week of diagnosis, Sam, along with his mum Angela, dad Adam, brother Hugh and sister May got the news that no family wants: Sam had cancer. He had angiosarcoma, a cancer of the lining of the blood vessels. It was very rare and virtually unknown in children. Sam commenced treatment—radio, chemo and drugs to combat side-effects. He felt sick all of the time. His body ached so much it hurt if he was touched, even though at times all he wanted was a hug from his mother. His toenails fell off, he lost his hair, he had mouth ulcers and spent much of his time away from family and friends.

        community stood by Sam and his family. Fundraisers were held everywhere. The community wanted to help. After 18 months of gruelling treatment, Sam got·to finally ring the bell in the ward, signalling the end of his treatment. Doctors declared Sam's recovery a miracle. He became captain last year of his primary school,

His motto is: 'Anything is possible.' Sam, you are an inspiration, like all children who are cancer survivors. I wish you all the best on behalf of our community.
