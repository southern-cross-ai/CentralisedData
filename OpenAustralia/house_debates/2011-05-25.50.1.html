        Today I want the mention the very exciting Healthy Communities Initiative program that is coming Holroyd

        in my electorate of Greenway to deliver new healthy eating, exercise and wellness programs.

         Holroyd City Council

        has received a grant of more than $700,000 as part of the federal government's $72 million Healthy Communities Initiative to support local government promotion of healthy lifestyles. This project, called the Healthy Holroyd Program, will improve health outcomes in my community by providing physical activity and nutrition programs for residents. Due to the vibrant multicultural nature of Greenway and the Holroyd

        generally, this project will be delivered in Arabic and Tamil to cater for people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds.

        As a former local government representative, I know how important it is to encourage such health initiatives in our local communities. As we live longer, wellness plans are now an inherent strategy in any good local government plan. Both this government and Holroyd council know the importance of encouraging healthy relationships, community safety and unique programs to cater for the different demographic and cultural needs of our respective communities. This fantastic initiative reflects federal and local government working cooperatively to deliver a great result for the people in my electorate, and again highlights the strength in their cooperation. I commend the mayor of Holroyd council, Councillor Peter Monaghan, and the Holroyd community development leader, Ms Hiba Soueid, for their commitment to delivering these programs to the community. I would also like to thank the Minister for
