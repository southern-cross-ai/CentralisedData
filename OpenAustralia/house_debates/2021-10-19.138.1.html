       <p>
        There are so many challenges that we must face during this global pandemic—balancing work, taking care of children and even elderly loved ones—while we are likely to be physically and even mentally exhausted. As we open up post-COVID, I want to make sure that people in my electorate of Higgins and right across Australia are taking care of their health. The Morrison government has ramped up health and mental health funding to record levels during this pandemic to ensure supports have been able to pivot online through things like telehealth or adapting vital services so they can remain accessible.
       </p>
       <p>
        But there is a gap. The gap is evident when you look at preventive healthcare services. Research shows that many of us are delays preventive health check-ups during COVID. It is not surprising. This is a problem we need to address. As one example, around 27,000 people skipped heart health checks. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Heart Foundation
        </a>
        says this number of skipped checks will result in nearly 350 heart attacks, strokes and heart related deaths that now won't be prevented. When it comes to mammograms, it is estimated there'll be between 1,300 and 2,600 missed or undiagnosed breast cancer cases based on Cancer Australia data released this month. Meanwhile, diagnostic and investigative surgeries dropped by up to a third in the first wave of COVID-19 alone. I want to be very clear, and Australians need to hear this: you need to put your health first. You need to catch up on your preventive health checks. There will be potentially life-changing health risks going undetected. If caught early, it can save your life.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's why I am working hard with my community to hear from them directly what they have skipped or missed during the six long lockdowns in Melbourne. I'm finding out through surveys what, when and how they would like these services delivered to be most convenient for them, to ensure we deliver the services that are required to make their health better. I'm advocating that we as a government pivot our healthcare system once again—this time to adapt our preventive health care services, provide surge service, incorporate telehealth services or potentially establish health hubs where needed. This pivot will allow Australians greater opportunities to catch up and ultimately prevent further strains on our healthcare system.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I said in my first speech, I've always wanted to prevent health problems; not just wait with the ambulance at the bottom of the cliff for problems to arrive. I want to send resources to the top of the cliff so that we can help keep people healthy and safe from the precipice. That's what this government has been doing through COVID with our testing and our vaccines. We know Australians want to get into the public health deal stream. That's what I'd like to hear—people going and getting their preventative healthcare checks, making sure that they're checking up for cancer and heart health.
