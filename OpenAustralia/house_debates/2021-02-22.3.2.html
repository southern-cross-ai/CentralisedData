        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Committee
        </a>
        for the 46th Parliament, comprising two petitions and 44 ministerial responses to petitions previously presented. Due to the cycle of the petitioning process there are no e-petitions to be presented today. The two petitions I present are paper petitions, each containing signatures that have been collected by hand through face-to-face engagement in each petitioner's community. While this method of petitioning has become more difficult during the times of COVID-19, paper petitions continue to be received by the committee. For centuries, this has been the only form of petitioning. Nowadays, with the introduction of e-petitioning, support for petitioning is usually gained through online communities via social media, emails, blogs and subscriptions. This method has become the preferred way to petition the parliament and, in today's environment, it's also COVID-friendly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Regardless of the way the signatures are collected, petitions remain a popular way for people to engage directly with parliament. The committee takes pride in its role of facilitating the petitioning process, regardless of what format the petitions are submitted in, and it's pleased to be able to support this longstanding parliamentary tradition.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you, Mr Speaker. I look forward to further updating the House on the work of the committee.
