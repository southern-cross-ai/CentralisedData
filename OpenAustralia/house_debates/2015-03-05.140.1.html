        Today I rise to honour the work of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Philip's_Christian_College" rel="nofollow">
         St Philip's Christian College
        </a>
        in Narara. It is a fantastic school that also has great personal significance for me, having formerly been both a student and a teacher there. I am pleased to say that, even after the many years since I walked through those gates for the final time as a year 12 graduate, it remains a shining light for education in my electorate. It was great for me to have the opportunity to visit the school last month, not only to reflect on its fantastic past but also to inspect the school and marvel at its future prospects. This is a school delivering quality education in a modern learning environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will give the chamber a few fun facts while I go on a trip down memory lane. My father,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Warren" rel="nofollow">
         Max Warren
        </a>
        , served as a principal of the college back in the 1980s and the 1990s, when it was called Gosford Christian Community School. I also had the honour and privilege of working there as a teacher for a few years after I completed my university studies. On indulgence, I also note that it was where my husband Christopher proposed to me some 18 years ago. In fact the proposal took place in front of my entire year 8 English class—on the same grounds where I was on this occasion last month able to open the brand-new middle school building. It was a fantastic honour to cut that ribbon for the opening of the new middle school building and to inspect the plans they have for a revamped junior school building, which will be partly funded by the federal government.
       </p>
       <p>
        I spoke with many of the staff and students of the college both before and after the official opening and they were as thrilled as I was with the quality of the rooms, their flexibility and the welcoming atmosphere. The new classrooms are designed to be really bright, vibrant learning spaces that allow for flexible learning, and they are suitable for a range of student learning styles in an inclusive environment. The principal, Mrs
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelle_Kelly" rel="nofollow">
         Michelle Kelly
        </a>
        , has indicated to me that this is a 21st century, world-class education building model, and she has also advised that they are looking to extend this model to the junior school. During the welcome breakfast that they held before the official opening, I was really pleased to be able to inspect the college's junior school building plans. They are fantastic designs, and I really look forward to seeing progress in the coming years.
       </p>
       <p>
        A $750,000 grant has been approved for the college for this project under capital grant funding to non-government schools, as part of the Capital Grants Programme, which assists primary and secondary schools to improve capital infrastructure where they otherwise might not have access to sufficient capital resources. Funding can be used for a wide range of infrastructure projects, from the planning stage to the fit-out stage. This particular project will see funds used on the construction of two flexible general learning areas, two withdrawal rooms, four storerooms, toilets and other fittings.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am really proud to be part of a coalition government that is committed to improving the quality of our school education, a government that wants to ensure that students are equipped with the skills they need to succeed in an increasingly competitive and technologically advanced world. St Philip's Christian College is certainly a great example of outstanding educational opportunities on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Many graduates and parents who I know and who I have met many years after teaching and being a student there are now themselves leaders in our community—outstanding health workers, teachers, emergency services personnel, business leaders, entrepreneurs, lawyers, artists, musicians and photographers. I commend this school to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        In conclusion, I would like to thank the principal, Michelle Kelly; the deputy principal, Malcolm East; the head of middle school, Ben Yap; middle school students who I was privileged to meet and speak with during the school opening; and the entire college community for their invitation to attend the welcome breakfast and to open this important new building. It was indeed a very great honour, and I look forward to being able to return again and visit in the not too distant future.
