        Two weeks ago, I had the pleasure of attending the launch of a fantastic music video entitled 'Our Hood', which was made by 12 young people who are engaged with the Inala Youth Service Sittella Street Project. The music video speaks to the lived experience of the young people in their own communities and how this has shaped who they areâ€”who they have become. The song and video also aim to demonstrate the positive future of our young people and what they are striving for. Since the launch of the video clip on Facebook, the post has reached over 100,000 people and more than 42,000 people have viewed the video.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Sittella Street Project works with high-risk young people and supports them to persevere, evolve and create opportunity for the betterment of themselves and the community.

        Lisa Evans told me that, by offering a youth-focused program in which participation is voluntary, the young people were empowered to choose the extent of their contribution on their experiences and what they have achieved through their lives. The video was a truly great example of young people working together to achieve these outcomes.

        I want to particularly pay tribute to the Inala Youth Service and CEO Lisa Evans, social worker

        Reboz, for all of their fantastic work to make the music video a reality for our young people. They deserve our congratulations. It is a fantastic video that I encourage everyone to enjoy and observe.
