        My question is to the Treasurer. Alan is a retiree from Greenfields in my electorate who is proud of his financial independence. He has planned for a total yearly income of $40,000. Under Labor's retiree tax, however, he will lose $10,000 a year.

           Can the member resume his seat. Members on my left, I'm trying to hear the question. You're preventing me and you're wasting your own question time, which I would have thought is important to you. The member for

He has planned for a total yearly income of $40,000, and under Labor's retiree tax he will lose $10,000 a year. Why is it important to have a carefully designed taxation policy that incentivises people to save and remain independent in retirement? What are the risks of alternatives?

I suspect the Manager of Opposition Business will agree with me. The last part of that question is in order. The first part of that question is completely out of order. Questions cannot be asked about opposition policies, because ministers are not responsible for them. The Treasurer will address himself to the second part of the question. I hope members realise why I want to listen to questions.

                 I notice the interjections of those opposite, who say he hasn't paid any tax. Alan has paid tax all of his life, you muppet. He's paid tax all of his life. Beaker over here—

                   They have just shown the tell, Mr Speaker. Alan has worked hard all of his life and he has put a nest egg together and he is now a victim, like another 850,000-plus Australians, of what Labor would propose to do by abolishing commonsense, good principles of tax design. And pensioners are not immune either, as the Prime Minister has reminded us.

                     Pensioners will be hit if they dare to want to manage their own superannuation funds and not be extorted into putting it into industry funds with Labor mates, like the Leader of the Opposition wants to demand of them. Alan should get the same tax benefit, the same tax relief, as every other Australian for the tax paid by the company he's invested in.

                       The shadow Treasurer has completely muffed this one, and we're used to it. I'm particularly used to it. In the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government this bloke was the prince of failure amongst a royal family of failures on that side, which has no limit. We know, as the Prime Minister reminded us, about GroceryWatch, Fuelwatch and the employee share ownership schemes. They were the warm-up for the worst immigration minister we have ever seen in this country.

                           The Deputy Leader of the Opposition might want to resume her seat, because her colleagues behind her seem intent on delaying proceedings.

                           I'm just going to say very briefly: the Minister for Veterans' Affairs is warned. I'm not going to have people continue conversations when I'm trying to address the House. The level of interjections was again ridiculously high. I'm not going to address this point at length. There were so many loud interjections I'm giving a general warning. I am going to remove people from the House, whether they are serial offenders or not. The level of noise is ridiculously high: I can't hear the minister's answer and on occasion can't hear the questions as well. A number of people have been warned already a number of times. If they interject at all they'll be out. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition.
