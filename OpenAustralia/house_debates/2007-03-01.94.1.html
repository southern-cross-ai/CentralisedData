       <p>
        Last week I was at the Bathurst campus of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sturt_University" rel="nofollow">
         Charles Sturt University
        </a>
        , where the vice-chancellor, Professor Ian Goulter, launched the university’s proposal and detailed plans for a school of dentistry and oral health. This is a project I fully support. I have already taken it up with the relevant ministers on more than one occasion and will continue to pursue it until we have a successful outcome. Charles Sturt University’s proposal is an exciting and innovative plan which will be a major step forward in providing a long-term solution to the shortage of dentists in rural and regional
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a serious shortage of dentists in this state and an even more severe shortage in rural and regional areas. A 2002 report from the Association for the Promotion of Oral Health said that five of the six worst areas for dental health workforce were in inland New South Wales. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
         OECD
        </a>
        said that, while the average dentist per hundred thousand of the population is 56, one of the worst areas is central west New South Wales, with an average of only 17.3 dentists per 100,000 people. This maldistribution is not just confined to the private dental system; it is also the case with the public dental system. In fact, the far west of New South Wales has just over one dentist per 100,000 of the population and mid-western has only 2.4, whereas central Sydney has 11 dentists per 100,000 of the population.
       </p>
       <p>
        Importantly, Charles Sturt University’s proposal would address the underlying cause of this shortage by increasing the supply of dentists and, specifically, increasing the supply of dentists most likely to practise in rural New South Wales. If dentists train in the west, they will make connections in the west, they will put down roots in the west and therefore they will be most likely after their graduation to set up practice in the west. So this proposal would be a win-win: it would be a win for those needing access to dental services because it would add to the supply of dentists and it would be a win for young people in the central west and western New South Wales by providing increased educational opportunities for them.
       </p>
       <p>
        As an aside, this is similar to the argument that I, along with two of my colleagues, put forward back in 2004 when we pursued the proposal for a medical school for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         University of Western Sydney
        </a>
        . Along with the member for Lindsay and the member for Macarthur, I took up the fight for a medical school for the University of Western Sydney. It was promised in 2004 prior to the election, and I am pleased to inform the House that this year—in fact, just last month—the medical school of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UWS" rel="nofollow">
         UWS
        </a>
        opened and took its first intake of students. They are students who will no doubt largely practise in Western Sydney. I am determined that we will have the same successful outcome for Charles Sturt University in this proposal for a dental school that, as I said, will provide increased educational opportunities but also add to the supply of dentists.
       </p>
       <p>
        We hear a lot from the other side about the dental crisis. Dental services are a shared responsibility. The Australian government, the federal government, has the responsibility to provide the training to add to the supply of dentists—as I said, this proposal will help in that regard. The Australian government assists in a number of other ways—for instance, some of the veterans’ affairs programs and some of the Indigenous programs provide dental services for some of our veterans and Indigenous communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Strengthening Medicare package includes additional support in some cases for dental services for those with chronic conditions and complex care needs. From 1 July 2004, dental assessments and treatments can be provided to patients on referral by their
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        s, under an enhanced primary care plan. The Australian government also helps through the private health insurance rebate—a rebate opposed by the other side—which reduces the effective costs of dental services. The Australian government is doing its part. The states need to do their part for public dental health and they have failed, despite record revenues. I am determined to pursue this great proposal with Charles Sturt University for a dental school for western New South Wales.
