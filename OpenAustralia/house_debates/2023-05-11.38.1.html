        My office has received a large number of approaches about the impending closure of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oaklands_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Oaklands Park
        </a>
        post office at Westfield Marion Shopping Centre. Of all the post offices in the area, the closure of this one will hit local residents the hardest. It is in a major shopping centre, which is also a public transport hub, so it's very easy for local people to get to. Eighty-nine-year-old Peter, who is legally blind, told me that he goes there to get assistance with paying his bills. He's able to walk to the centre and there's someone at the counter to help him. He will have difficulty getting to another post office because he can't drive and they are less accessible by public transport. He is unable to use online bill-paying services because of his vision impairment. Other constituents have talked to me about access to passport services, as well as postal and parcel collection. This is the one place some of our older residents can still pay their bills in cash, get a hard copy receipt and be helped by someone behind the counter.

        I spoke today to the Minister for Communications about the concerns raised with me. I'll be writing to her today asking to have this decision reconsidered by

        . I really thank her for her time and her understanding of the issues raised by my constituents.
