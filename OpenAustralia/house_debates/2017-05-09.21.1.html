        Isn't it incredible that tonight, on budget night, we are going to have a Treasurer who stands up here and defends a decision to give a $50 billion tax giveaway to the biggest businesses in this country, including the four biggest banks, at the very same time that he will be cutting funding to Australian schools? What we have is a government who are trying to get away with this fiction that they are somehow increasing schools funding. Hang on a minute—what are they doing? They are doing something not quite as bad as

         The member for Sydney will resume her seat. I have made it very clear to members that they need to refer to other members by their correct titles. I have even sat down the Deputy Prime Minister on the subject. The member for Sydney will refer to members by their correct titles.

          You are quite right, Mr Speaker, and I am very sorry. The member for Warringah, when he used to be Prime Minister, cut $30 billion of school funding. Because this government is only cutting $22 billion, we are supposed to tug our forelocks, take our porridge bowls away and say, 'Thank you, I've actually got enough; I don't need any more.'
         </p>
         <p>
          This is a cut, any way you look at it. The evidence that this is a cut is in the government's own briefing document, which they gave to every single journalist last week when they were trying to sell this dog of a policy, where it says the difference between Labor's policy and this policy is $22.3 billion. That is a $22.3 billion cut, any way you look at it. Those opposite try to say that this is somehow fairer. How can this be fairer when the vast majority of government schools will never reach their fair funding level? Under our proposal, the majority of schools will get there in 2019; Victoria in 2022. Under this new proposal, one in seven schools will be there at the end of the decade and the rest of them will never get there. Not in the foreseeable future do they get to that schooling resource standard—that fair level of funding described by the Gonski needs-based funding report.
         </p>
         <p>
          And then there are the Catholic schools. If it is so fair, how have the government managed to unite government school advocates against the cut with Catholic school advocates against the cut? We went to a meeting last night. Hundreds of parents, hundreds of teachers—
