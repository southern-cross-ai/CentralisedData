        Thirty years ago a small group of generous, kind-hearted and driven Riverina women established a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wagga_Wagga" rel="nofollow">
         Wagga Wagga
        </a>
        committee of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Children's_Medical_Research_Institute" rel="nofollow">
         Children's Medical Research Institute
        </a>
        . On 26 May, amidst laughter, a few tears and a good deal of pride, the committee, now considerably larger numerically, celebrated three wonderful decades. Since its establishment the committee, which now boasts 90 members and 30 volunteers, has raised an impressive $1.184 million for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMRI" rel="nofollow">
         CMRI
        </a>
        at Westmead in Sydney. That money has assisted the fantastic people at the institute to significantly increase the lifespan of children with what were once terminal illnesses. Many of those children have hailed from the district where the Wagga Wagga committee's money was raised, many from elsewhere. It matters not; a child's life is priceless.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee's founding member was Margaret Cerebona, of Wagga Wagga, and the inaugural president was Libby Lamont, of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Junee" rel="nofollow">
         Old Junee
        </a>
        . The current president is Catherine Cruikshank, of Brushwood, between Coolamon and Ganmain, who gave an emotional address at the recent luncheon attended by 140 guests. She drew on her personal experience of a young relative—her nephew Jake Fryer, aged 12, who has needed ongoing care and treatment—to emphasise the importance of the CMRI's work. One member afforded special and deserved praise at the function was Penny Lamont, of Harefield, whose idea to host a garden party led to the annual Christmas fair at the Wagga Wagga Racecourse which has been the committee's trademark event and biggest charity earner.

        The Wagga Wagga anniversary was honoured to have the eminent professor, Roger R Reddel, as guest speaker. He told of the marvellous advances in medical research and how this has been largely shaped by the dollars raised by the 25 CMRI committees. He told me later:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I left that event with two very strong impressions. One was the palpable feeling of community, which I hope Wagga Wagga and the surrounding areas never lose.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The other was that the attendees are not only generous but also smart: like so many other members of the Australian public, they are willing to give generously to support victims of natural disasters, but they also support the research work that takes very many years and has little instant gratification while steadily accumulating to give us the extraordinary increases in health that we have enjoyed over the past 50 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Well said, Professor Reddel. Well done to Catherine and the outstanding ladies in her fabulous organisation. May they enjoy many more years of fun, friendship and fundraising for a most worthy and notable cause.
