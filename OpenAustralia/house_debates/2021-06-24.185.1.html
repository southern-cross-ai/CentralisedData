        I would like to pay tribute to some outstanding Australians with connections to the Territory, or Territorians. First,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Leonard" rel="nofollow">
         Ray Leonard
        </a>
        , the last survivor of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
         HMAS
        </a>
        <i>
         Armidale
        </i>
        , has passed on. I believe Ray's gone to God. He was a very good man. He passed just shy of his 98th birthday. Ray was there on 1 December 1942, during the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         Second World War
        </a>
        , in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timor_Sea" rel="nofollow">
         Timor Sea
        </a>
        north of Darwin when the
        <i>
         Armidale
        </i>
        come under sustained attack by the Japanese. As the attack unfolded, Ray witnessed the extraordinary acts of heroism performed by his shipmate Teddy Sheean
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VC" rel="nofollow">
         VC
        </a>
        . Many did not survive the loss of the
        <i>
         Armidale
        </i>
        , and all of the survivors suffered as they tried to get back to safety. Many passed. After the war, Ray fought to get recognition for Teddy Sheean's heroism, resulting in the awarding of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Cross" rel="nofollow">
         Victoria Cross
        </a>
        to Teddy in December last year. Ray, after the war, had a long career as a psychologist and helped many, many people, including many, many veterans. Ray and his wife, Beryl, were married for 76 years. I extend my condolences to Beryl and to Ray and Beryl's three children and their extended family. Ray Leonard was a great Australian, and his example shines on as a beacon to the rest of us. Vale Ray Leonard.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to pay tribute to Val Eaton. Val Eaton is a true local hero in my electorate. It's rare to go to an event in Darwin or Palmerston—in the Greater Darwin area—without seeing Val there volunteering for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John_Ambulance" rel="nofollow">
         St John Ambulance
        </a>
        . She recently received the St John Ambulance Richard Morris award, and of course it's not the first award that Val has been given. She's demonstrated an ongoing commitment to the continuing training and mentoring of younger members of the community in the Territory through first aid education. Congratulations, Val, and keep up the great work.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to acknowledge Territorian Anthony Draper, or Drapes, who has a long history with Timor-Leste. He's a senior epidemiologist at the Northern Territory Centre for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disease_Control" rel="nofollow">
         Disease Control
        </a>
        , and he was deployed to Timor-Leste as part of the Australian medical assistance team, or AUSMAT. He has been providing great technical assistance and public health advice while working alongside colleagues in the Timor-Leste departamento de la agencia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to acknowledge Territorian paediatrician Dr Josh Francis for his tireless work helping the people of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timor_Leste" rel="nofollow">
         Timor Leste
        </a>
        with their various and significant health challenges, particularly at this time. Parabens mano! Obrigado.
