        Deputy Speaker, I'll take this opportunity to welcome you to the chair and to congratulate you on your deputy speakership. Australia is home to communities of many backgrounds, especially so in south-west Sydney and the electorate of Werriwa. On 7 May, I attended two separate events: a gathering of the Cambodian community and one of the Kurdish community. They're two cultures that are thousands of kilometres away from each other in the world, but right here in Sydney they're just a few suburbs apart.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Cambodian people have a long history within Australia, with many having arrived during the seventies and eighties after escaping the

        regime. They have since called Australia home, and I know they are fierce Australians. I was honoured to be invited by the Cambodian National Rescue Party of

        to attend and speak at their community event. I spoke about what an Albanese-led Labor government would deliver if we were to win government, and I'm privileged to have been re-elected as the member for Werriwa in an Albanese government. I'm committed to delivering for our area and the Cambodian community, who have supported me throughout the campaign. I'd like to thank the CNRP and its president. Mr

        was a guest speaker at the event, and his wife, Tioulong Saumura, graciously translated the speeches from Cambodian to English, which made the event, for me, just so much more personable and understanding. When she was introduced—you'll enjoy this, Deputy Speaker—she was introduced as Mr Rainsy's wife, and she pointed out that she wasn't his handbag; she has also been a member of parliament in her own right. It was just a really lovely afternoon.
       </p>
       <p>
        The temple and its volunteers have spent most of the last two years supporting their community, with translations for COVID measures and what was required, and providing many practical supports. I'd really like to thank the Cambodian community, especially Chhayri Marm, for the always warm welcome and the invitation.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the same day, I also was fortunate to attend a gathering with the Kurdish community. I'd like to thank the Democratic Kurdish Community Centre of New South Wales, the Federation of Democratic Kurdish Society and the Sydney Kurdish Youth Association for the invitation to the day. They even coaxed me into joining in their cultural dance, which I did very badly, but everybody was so welcoming and supportive—even though I have three left feet.
       </p>
       <p>
        Werriwa is just a wonderful community, and, with just under 50 per cent identifying as having been born overseas, I'd like to thank them all.
