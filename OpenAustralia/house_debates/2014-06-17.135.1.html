        I am very proud to take this opportunity to speak about the local sporting community in my electorate of Forde. Our clubs produce some of the best talent in this country. Whether it is in a team sport or an individual discipline, on any given day there is another local sporting champion rising up. We often have our local champions compete not only on a national level but all around the world. For example, 16-year-old Shailer Park volleyball player Bryce Poland will lead Australia's charge at the maiden championships in Mexico this July to become the first country to win the World Under-17 Beach Volleyball Championship.

        in December. Only the very best get to compete at this invitation-only event, which will see about 12 participants up to the age of 13 compete to be crowned the world champion in front of a crowd of 20,000 spectators.
       </p>
       <p>
        In another historic event, the Waterford Demons Rugby League Club has made history by becoming one of the first teams to join the new Brisbane girls rugby league competition. Around 16 girls formed an under-14s team and I understand there is interest in forming additional girls teams to field an under-15s team and an open women's team.

        In other news, some time ago I had the privilege of hosting the Minister for Health and Minister for Sport in my electorate and we visited the Gold Coast Compound, a world-class indoor ramp park. Since our visit, Tom Herzog has been busy promoting interschool competitions and girls-only sessions to encourage more female participation in the

        , scooter and skateboard sessions which he holds on Monday nights. During the minister's visit, we also met with the Park Ridge Pirates Junior
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">

        Club at their home base at Park Ridge State High School. Over the past few years we have been working with the club to help them grow their facilities as the club continues to go from strength to strength.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Pirates' President, Andy Colenso, said that Park Ridge State High School had benefited greatly from their location at the school, with fewer break-ins and incidents of vandalism in the five years that the club has been there. The club won two championships last year and is keen to expand into senior divisions. It has been successful in achieving that, with a new senior team coming on board this year. I would like to thank the state government for their commitment of $100,000 towards upgrading the facility with the installation of lights to enable both the junior and senior divisions to enhance their training.
