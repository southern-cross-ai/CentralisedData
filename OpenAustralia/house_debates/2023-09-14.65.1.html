        It was a very cold and stormy day in Adelaide on Friday. But, despite hail 30 minutes before my seniors forum started, I had over 230 local Boothby residents come out to have a chat and have a lamington from our local Kytons bakery. We also had really interesting speakers. We had Debra from Aged Rights Advocacy Service, who talked to them about their rights, choosing nursing homes, the five-star rating that they can look at and what they can actually do if they feel that they need some assistance. We had Gemma and Teneille from Hearing Australia who not only talked about a wide range of hearing aids and the sorts of things you can do to keep your hearing healthy but also did hearing tests there. That information will help people going forward, and it will be provided to their

        . Hopefully we've helped some people there.

        I had a chat about the previous scams forum that we had with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Jones" rel="nofollow">
         Stephen Jones
        </a>
        , the Assistant Treasurer, and talked to people about the importance of, when they get those scam messages, not clicking on the blue link—never a better time to have that conversation than now, with some of the scam messages that we've seen associated with the referendum. We also talked about some of the cost-of-living measures that are relevant to our older citizens. We'll be having some more seniors forums, and I encourage people to contact—
