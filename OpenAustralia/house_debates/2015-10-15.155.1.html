        I rise to share with the House an important issue affecting Australia today: domestic violence. Latest statistics show that by 6.30 am, throughout Australia, police have attended the scenes of 195 incidents of domestic violence. By 10.30 am that number is 315. By 5.30 pm the number has grown to 525. Each day sees police across Australia attend 657 cases of domestic violence. This is an average of one incident every two minutes. Tragically, as of September this year, 63 women had lost their lives as a result of domestic violence.
       </p>
       <p>
        There has been much media focus in the past couple of months on the devastating effect that domestic and family violence has on our society. It is my responsibility to focus on what action can be implemented in my electorate of Dobell. The issue of domestic and family violence was highlighted recently when I hosted a breakfast to provide support for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        Community Women's Health Centre domestic violence programs. It was a pleasure to welcome to Dobell Senator the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michaelia_Cash" rel="nofollow">
         Michaelia Cash
        </a>
        , Minister for Employment and Minister for Women, who addressed the attendees about domestic and family violence. Senator Cash spoke of the Second Action Plan 2013-16, the second of four stages of the National Plan to Reduce Violence Against Women and their Children. The Second Action Plan 2013-16 promotes tangible and concrete actions that will be implemented at a local and national level to address horrendous acts of violence in the home, particularly domestic violence. Senator Cash spoke of simple measures which were welcomed by the audience, who understand that the implementation of these actions will bring about profound difference to the lives of women and men suffering from domestic violence.
       </p>
       <p>
        Perhaps one of the simplest measures to be implemented will be the recognition of apprehended violence orders across state and territory borders. While currently an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVO" rel="nofollow">
         AVO
        </a>
        is only recognised in the state or territory in which it is granted, the new legislation will mean the AVO is applicable across Australia as a whole. This is particularly pertinent for those who are fleeing across jurisdictions to avoid domestic violence. I know this particular aspect of the Second Action Plan 2013-16 will make a noticeable difference. This was reinforced recently during my visit to Coast Shelter. Coast Shelter is an outstanding organisation which encompasses the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        Central Coast and is responsible for a myriad of services making life-changing differences to the community. I was humbled to visit a domestic violence facility managed by Coast Shelter where I spoke with women who welcomed the proposed changes regarding national AVO coverage.
       </p>
       <p>
        The electorate of Dobell possesses one of the highest rates of domestic and family violence in New South Wales. It is not a statistic I am proud of but it is one that must be acknowledged in order to move forward and ensure that programs to help and make positive changes are identified and implemented in the region. What I am proud of is the work undertaken by those in the community—police, ambulance and court services—who deal with the issue of domestic and family violence daily. Their passion and dedication is rivalled by no other. Their commitment to what they do and the changes they make in the lives of those who turn to them for help is unsurpassed. I am proud to know these people and to know of the work that they do to make the electorate of Dobell on the Central Coast a better place to live.
       </p>
       <p>
        Addressing the issue of domestic and family violence is not an easy one and there is no simple fix and no one-size-fits-all solution. However, there are things that can be done now which will make a difference. The financial support raised at the domestic violence breakfast will go towards the provision of creche services for at least a year at the Central Coast Community Women's Health Centre. This means that children will have a safe environment to be in while their mothers receive counselling support and advice regarding their domestic violence situation.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have also been speaking with local service providers regarding the issue of financial abuse. Financial abuse does not receive a large amount of visibility; however, it is severely affecting a large number of people in my electorate. Put simply, financial abuse involves the debts and bills of a family household being put in the name of a victim and the mortgage and assets in the name of the perpetrator. Financial abuse usually means that the family income is controlled by the perpetrator who does not pay the debts that are in the name of the victim, which affects the victim's credit rating in the future. This is something I will be working on in the near future with agencies of the government to raise awareness.
