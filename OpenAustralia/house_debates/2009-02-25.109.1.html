        , in conjunction with Cricket New South Wales, ran a competition in late 2008 inviting cricket teams to submit entries comprising photos and a slogan of no more than 25 words which disapproved of speeding—part of their ‘Pinkie’ campaign. Revesby Workers B Grade (1) team won the competition, with first prize being a Twenty20 match at the

        against the RTA SpeedBlitz Blues. ‘Don’t be a fool and speed like a tool, save the speed for the game, nobody gives a full toss about people who speed’ was the successful slogan.
       </p>
       <p>
        The match took place on a fine and sunny day at the

        on Wednesday, 4 February. In excess of 100 spectators were there to support the players. The players were taken on a tour of the SCG and out on the field to examine the pitch and meet curator

        awards ceremony, held in Melbourne the previous night.

       <p>
        The Speedblitz Blues players came out to meet the other players and there were short speeches. It was an exceptional experience for the team, which was led by captain for the day, Jason Tomkins, who was the motivator in submitting the winning entry for the competition run by the RTA and Cricket New South Wales. The Speedblitz Blues got 5 for 262, with the Revesby Workers Club 4 for 119. They were never expected to win, but it was a great experience for the side. Wicket takers for the Workers were J Tomkins, 1 for 36, C Jurgeit 1 for 23, and M Benham 3 for 40. The main scorers for the workers club were M Benham, 21; B Dippert, 25; M Hibbert, 32 not out; and J Tomkins, 24 not out. It was a great day for everyone. I congratulate everyone who was involved with it.
