       <p>
        On Friday 11 August in Tamworth you will see the start of a new, organic movement of people. It is not a Barnaby movement. It is not a National Party movement. It's not a Greens movement. It's not a Labor movement. It is a movement that is going from Clerk Creek to Gippsland, from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Hunter Valley
        </a>
        to the Peel Valley and from Tasmania through to north Queensland. It's a movement that is dealing with transmission lines that are dividing our country, wind factories that are dividing our communities and solar factories that are covering our views. The environment is coming second to overseas power companies and putting power prices through the roof. Power prices are going through the roof, reliability is going through the floor and the money is going overseas to make other people very wealthy from the pain that it is causing us in regional Australia. It's not only regional Australia. It's the western suburbs of Sydney. It's the western suburbs of Brisbane as well. I'm very proud to be one part of this organic movement. I'd like to commend the people, such as James Gooden, Hamilton down in Gippsland and Nikki up in Rockhampton, who are all getting together. They're working their way to Tamworth. They're going to make sure they are heard. I say to people: please listen to them. They're going to make a difference.
