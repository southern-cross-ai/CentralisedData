        It is with a heavy heart I advise the House of the passing of Aileen Sandy, nee Dawson, a truly great northsider and Australian. Aunty Aileen was a beloved aunty, grandmother and mother and an active and respected elder in our community. Aunty Aileen was an ordained minister and, in September 2015, she founded the Past On The Fire Ministry, which had its open day at Zillmere Community Centre. Aunty Aileen had a phone ministry that would minister to anyone in Australia day or night, even in the very early hours of the morning, praying and counselling in their time of need. Aunty Aileen's work extended beyond her immediate community, assisting with the development of social, emotional and wellbeing spaces within Wantulp Bi-Buya College in

        , assisting with addiction management, community development, and Indigenous mental health counselling.

        When influential people pass away, quite often we will erect monuments in their honour. But, when we look around for the monument to Aunty Aileen and the legacy that she leaves behind, all we need to do is look at her children—Jason, Wayne, Faylene, Sandy, Fred, Sammy, Sono and Otila—and the outstanding work that they continue to do for

        I'm excited to announce that Welcoming the Babies is back on for 2021. It's a proud northside tradition started by my predecessor

        , and this year will be the 20th anniversary of the event and my very first time hosting it—and I've got two twins ready to roll! There will be lots in it for everyone, including an Easter egg hunt, bouncy castle, sausage sizzle, food trucks and coffee van, games and craft activities organised by local childcare centres, live music and a special visit from the

        . Local icon Dagwood the Clown will also be making a very special appearance. Due to the cancellation of the 2020 event because of COVID and the federal election the year before that, this year we will welcome all Lilley babies born since 2019. It's going to be babypalooza! If any northsiders would like to register their child or their grandchild or a child in their care, please hop onto my website and register your baby so that I can welcome them myself. I hope to see lots of families come down to Mulbeam Park in Boondall on Sunday 28 March from 9 am for a morning of fun family entertainment.

        A few weeks ago, northsiders from Sandgate right up to Nundah participated in

I joined Linda, Neil and the Keep Sandgate Beautiful Association in Decker Park in Brighton, and I would like to give a special shout out to all the brilliant students from St Kieran's Primary School in Brighton and their excellent principal, Ben Gray, who were up at the crack of dawn to give our beautiful coastline some
