        I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate Susie and Gerard Daly, winners of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Farmer" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Farmer
        </a>
        of the Year Award as well as the Award for Excellence and Innovation. Susie and Gerard, along with their children, operate the Daly Potato Co. in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marion_Bay" rel="nofollow">

        , which is located near Dunalley on the south-east coast of Tasmania in my electorate. The Daly family has been farming potatoes in this area for more than 30 years. The combination of great soil, rain and sunshine has resulted in enormous growth and, as demonstrated by this much-deserved award, remarkable success. The Dalys now supply several thousand tonnes of washed potatoes, ready-to-eat dishes and, of course, vodka and gin to many major and boutique supermarkets. The ready-to-eat range, which includes flavoured potato salads and premade home-style meals, was established to minimise waste after up to 20 per cent of their crop was rejected by supermarkets for not being pretty enough. I know how they feel. Also, in an effort to minimise potato waste, they started the Hellfire Bluff Distillery, starting with a vodka made from potatoes grown on their farm. It has since expanded to include a range of very nice gins and liqueurs. My wife's personal favourite is the limoncello. This is value-adding at its finest, transforming low-value products and waste into premium Tasmanian product that is making its way in the world.

        The Daly family also represent some of the traits that we as Australians are so proud of: resilience and adaptability. The farm was originally for fine merino wool, but in lean times for wool years ago the family decided to diversify by planting spuds. They won a contract with Woolies, but in 2013 the Dunalley bushfires destroyed their farm and processing facilities, and they had to start again from scratch. What a wonderful job they've done in six years. This family is innovative. They recognise the value of Tasmanian produce, and their approach to sustainability and waste management is so responsible and has paid off in spades. Several hundred tonnes of oddly shaped or scratched potatoes were being used as cattle feed until Susie realised that they could serve in a more lucrative and delicious process. The enterprise has continued to rise since they planted their first potato crop more than 30 years ago. It was a crop that they anticipated would provide them with pocket money at the time, but it has now become their primary business. Congratulations to Susie, Gerald and the entire Daly family on a well-deserved award.

        Very quickly, congratulations to Sally Murfet, also from my electorate, recognised as Rural Consultant of the Year.
