       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased to present to the House this bill, which will introduce an R 18+ category for computer games.
       </p>
       <p>
        This will bring the classification categories for computer games into line with existing categories used to classify films and make the Australian classification regime more consistent with international standards.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill amends the Classification (Publications, Films and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Games" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        ) Act 1995 and makes a consequential amendment to schedule 7 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992.
       </p>
       <p>
        This reform has been a long time coming.
       </p>
       <p>
        Agreement to introduce an R 18+ category has been reached after 10 years of negotiations with the states and territories.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over these ten years the Australian computer game industry has grown—along with the number of Australian computer gamers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Research that has been conducted by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_University" rel="nofollow">
         Bond University
        </a>
        suggests that nine in every 10 Australian homes now has a device for playing computer games.
       </p>
       <p>
        The average age of Australian computer gamers is 32—with Australian women making up 47 per cent of computer game players.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian gaming industry is forecast to grow at a rate of about 10 per cent a year—with forecasts predicting it will reach $2.5 billion annually by 2015.
       </p>
       <p>
        A lot of Australians are passionate about this reform.
       </p>
       <p>
        When the Attorney-General's Department released a discussion paper on the introduction of an R 18+ classification category for computer games in 2009 they received 58,437 submissions in response.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ninety-eight per cent of these supported the introduction of an R 18+ category.
       </p>
       <p>
        My predecessor in this portfolio, Minister O'Connor, pursued this issue throughout his time as Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Home Affairs
        </a>
        and Minister for Justice.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last year he led the discussion of this issue with state and territory attorneys-general at the Standing Council on Law and Justice. At their July meeting the ministers decided to support this reform.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill will implement the Commonwealth's obligations as part of this agreement—and state and territory jurisdictions will follow with their own legislation later this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is anticipated that the act provided for in this bill will come into effect on 1 January next year.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the bill to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
