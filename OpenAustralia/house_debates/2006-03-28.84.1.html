         The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:

          was charged full commercial rates for set-up, audio-visual services, food and beverages by the catering contractor,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyatt_Hotels" rel="nofollow">
           Hyatt Hotels
          </a>
          . It was also charged for security costs reimbursable to
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPS" rel="nofollow">
           DPS
          </a>
          . The imposition of these charges is in accordance with the policy for use of parliamentary facilities for a non-parliamentary function.

            involve a commercial agreement between the client and the catering contractor, and payment is made direct to the catering contractor rather than through DPS. Charges are based on competitive commercial rates. The sum charged by DPS for security was $2,965.10.

          </dl>

         <dd>
          In 1993, the then Presiding Officers approved a proposal for the use of parliamentary facilities which states: “Where a political party or
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
           Member of Parliament
          </a>
          proposes to use any facility at Parliament House for the purposes of fundraising for any purpose whatsoever, they or he/she will be treated as a commercial hirer and charged accordingly.” This policy has been applied since 1993, and is still in effect.As well, a document called Use of Parliament House facilities: General conditions of use, which is given to external organisations proposing to use parliamentary facilities, states:Collection of MoneysCash transactions and fundraising activities, including ticket sales, registration fees, membership fees, donations, raffles and auctions are permitted at functions held in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Hall" rel="nofollow">
           Great Hall
          </a>
          , Private Dining Rooms, or other discrete space in Parliament House. Such activities are not permitted in areas other than the particular room where the function is being held or at times other than when the function is being held. Charitable collections within other areas of the building are prohibited.
         </dd>
         <dt>
          (3)
         </dt>
         <dd>
          Political and other fundraising events held in Parliament House have been treated in the same way as any other non-parliamentary functions. Accordingly, DPS and its predecessor department have not kept records that would enable us to distinguish party-political fundraising events from other functions that are also charged at full commercial rates.
         </dd>
         <dt>
          (4)
         </dt>
         <dd>
          The use of parliamentary facilities for political fundraising was considered and approved by the Presiding Officers in 1993 as indicated in the answer to Question (2). We have not located any records indicating that the Presiding Officers have ever considered any proposals to ban party fundraising activities from Parliament House.
