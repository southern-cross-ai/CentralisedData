        No doubt the recent months have been tough, but thanks to the JobKeeper program many Australian workers and businesses have been spared the worst economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis. Recently I spoke with Phillip Kong, the general manager of Surrey Park Swimming in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_Hill" rel="nofollow">

        . Surrey Park Swimming is a facility that many schools and families in Chisholm take their kids to for the learn-to-swim program. It is a unique centre that provides minerals based saltwater for swimmers with sensitive skin conditions. It is a swimming school that offers professional coaching and training to our elite swimmers. It is also a place many of my constituents rely on for employment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Surrey Park Swimming was hit especially hard by this crisis. The nature of the business meant that it was particularly vulnerable to the physical-distancing restrictions that were a necessary part of our early response to the pandemic. Through no fault of his own, Phillip lost 100 per cent of his business's revenueâ€”no swimmers, no kids, no families and no jobs for the coaches and staff. Yet, because of JobKeeper, Phillip was able to keep on all 73 of his employees. They are 73 hardworking Australians who do not, on top of everything else, have to worry about putting food on the table or looking for a job during a time of global crisis.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the Treasurer pointed out, JobKeeper has provided hope and certainty during these challenging times. It has enabled a connection to be maintained between employers and employees. This means that when social distancing restrictions are relaxed and the economy opens up again, to which we are all looking forward, businesses like Phillip's will have staff on hand. They will not have to waste time and precious resources replacing the bulk of their workers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unlike the Labor Party, the Morrison coalition government supports businesses and their workers. Local success stories like Phillip and Surrey Park Swimming help to remind those of us in parliament why we do what we do. With the easing of restrictions, it is great to see swimmers are gradually coming back to the Surrey Park Swimming centre. In Chisholm, as in the rest of Australia, JobKeeper is responsible for keeping businesses in business and workers in jobs.
