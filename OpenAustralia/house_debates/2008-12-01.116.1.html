       Dear Mrs Irwin,
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Thank you for your letter of 17 September 2008 in relation to a petition about giving Indigenous Australians a voice. I welcome the opportunity to respond to the petition.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The Australian Government is committed to establishing a national Indigenous representative body to give Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people a voice in national affairs and is seeking their views prior to making a decision on the form of the body. A public consultation process commenced in July 2008 which to date has included over 80 public meetings across Australia in every state and territory.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       There has been a high level of positive and productive feedback at each consultation meeting and as part of the written submission process. Some of the key messages are that the representative body should:
      </p>
      <ul>
       <li>
        advocate human rights and social justice for Indigenous people;
       </li>
       <li>
        be credible with both Government and communities, with open and transparent operations and decision making;
       </li>
       <li>
        be independent from Government;
       </li>
       <li>
        be accessible to all Indigenous people;
       </li>
       <li>
        have fair and diverse membership, particularly equity in gender, inclusion of youth and representation from urban, regional and remote communities;
       </li>
       <li>
        be sustainable and have adequate and appropriate sources of funding; and
       </li>
       <li>
        have clearly articulated roles and functions.
       </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="italic">
       Copies of submissions are available on my Department’s website, and outcomes of each consultation meeting will shortly be available.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       I will soon make available information on the next phase of consultation.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       During the consultation process, Indigenous organisations and other formal advisory mechanisms will continue to be consulted to inform the Government’s policy making.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Further information about the consultation process can be found on my Department’s website at http://www.fahcsia.gov.au/internet/facsinternet.nsf/indigenous/repbody.htm.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Thank you again for writing.
      </p>
      <p>
       from the
       <b>
        Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs, Mrs Macklin
