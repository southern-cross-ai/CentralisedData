       <p>
        I rise to speak about an organisation in my electorate of Hughes doing tremendous work to help and support our youth and families at risk: the Dunlea Centre in Engadine, formerly known as Boys' Town. Teenage years are challenging for the teenagers themselves as well as for their families. Some teenagers find it harder than others. That is why Dunlea is such an important organisation. Since 1939 the centre has been helping teenage boys at risk and, since 2010, teenage girls as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        I recently had the privilege of touring Dunlea, where I met with acting principal Samantha Dennis and her staff, as well as some incredible young people turning their lives around. Dunlea empowers adolescents through therapeutic and educational services in a supportive residential program. Last year, the centre had its first cohort of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSC" rel="nofollow">
         HSC
        </a>
        students. Many of them had not attended school for over a year before they went to Dunlea. This year's school captains, Ashly and Victoria, told me that they came to Dunlea with self-proclaimed 'toxic behaviour' and were disengaged completely from school and from their families. They will be completing their HSC over the coming months and looking at attending university next year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Dunleaâ€”changing lives, empowering teenagers and restoring families. Well done, Dunlea.
