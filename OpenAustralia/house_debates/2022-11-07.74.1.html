          My question is to the Prime Minister, and I refer the Prime Minister to the front page of the
          <i>
           Australian
          </i>
          on 2 May this year, titled 'Life will be "cheaper" under me', where the Prime Minister said: 'Labor has real, lasting plans for cheaper electricity and cheaper mortgages.'
         </p>
         <p>
          Given that the budget confirmed power prices will rise 56 per cent and that interest rates have already gone up six times since the election, how can the Prime Minister seriously suggest that life is cheaper under Labor? Why won't he say sorry for yet another broken promise?

           The Deputy Leader of the Opposition will resume her seat. I specifically asked the Deputy Leader of the Opposition not to use a prop. If she does that again, she'll be asked to leave the House; I can't be clearer than that. That goes for every member in the House.

            I always read the front page of the

             Australian
            </i>
            , Mr Speaker, so I did read that; I read the front page of every newspaper in this country to try to keep on top of where things are. A couple weeks later, in May, the first interest rate increase by the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
             Reserve Bank
            </a>
            occurred—on their watch. I thought they were in government at that point in time. But what we also know is that there was scheduled to be an increase in wholesale energy prices at the same time.
           </p>
           <p>
            But I didn't get to read about that on the front page of the
            <i>
             Australian
            </i>
            . I didn't get to read about it, and I wonder why that is the case because it was scheduled to occur during the campaign, just like the interest rate increase occurred during the campaign. We knew about one, but we didn't know about the other. We didn't know about the other because someone—

              someone introduced—actually introduced—a change in the law so that people couldn't know that there was this wholesale price increase scheduled to occur. What date did they pick? The election was on 21 May, so do you think they picked a day before 21 May or after 21 May? Hands up those who think they picked a day after! You are all right. They picked a day after because they were not transparent. They were not transparent about what they had intended as a result of this.
