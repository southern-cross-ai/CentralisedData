        covers the committee's proceedings in 2023. Last year the committee reported on 16 major works with a combined cost of over $2.4 billion. The committee also scrutinised 63 medium works with a combined value of over $905 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        The threshold for works to be referred to the committee is $15 million for non-defence works and $75 million for defence works. Since the early 1990s, the committee has also reviewed medium works—those with a value between $2 million and $15 million. At the start of 2023, the committee raised the lower limit of medium works to $5 million. This change has allowed the committee to review fewer medium works, with each receiving a higher degree of scrutiny.
       </p>
       <p>
        Chapter 1 also discusses the requirements of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_Protection_and_Biodiversity_Conservation_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act
        </a>
        1999 which applies to all public works. In 2023 the committee saw an increase in projects referred to it prior to the conclusion of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPBC" rel="nofollow">
         EPBC
        </a>
        assessments. Where projects are referred to the committee without finalising the EPBC process it can delay committee approval and derail the committee inquiry process. Future projects referred to the committee should have finalised any EPBC assessments prior to referral.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second chapter of the annual report discusses areas of the Public Works Committee Act 1969 which the committee considers would benefit from reform. Although the current act dates from 1969, the concepts and processes are largely unchanged since the first public works committee was created in 1913. The legislation does not reflect the current complex government procurement and construction environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        In chapter 2 of this report, the committee lists the areas that could benefit from change. These include some fundamental questions, such as: What is the right time for committee oversight? What public works should be exempt from parliamentary scrutiny? There are also some suggestions for technical and process changes that would make the committee more effective.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee recommends that the government conduct a thorough and consultative review of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, with a view to repealing and replacing the legislation. Any future review should consider the issues raised in the annual report.
       </p>
       <p>
        In looking back at the work of the committee in 2023 I would like to thank the members of the Public Works Committee—particularly the deputy chair, the member for Hinkler—for their participation and contributions last year, and commend the wonderful work of the secretariat, who, I know, are listening closely to this statement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Speaker, I also table a second report, report No. 2 of 2024. This report considers two proposals, both referred to the committee in November 2023. The total value of the proposed works for the two projects is $822 million dollars with the projects being undertaken near Darwin in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        and Learmonth in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The first chapter of the report contains the report of the inquiry into the Department of Defence's proposed
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF_Base_Darwin" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF Base Darwin
        </a>
        mid-term refresh project, which has an estimated cost of just under $160 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposed mid-term refresh of RAAF Base Darwin will address safety and capacity concerns associated with the base entrances as well as deliver upgrades to engineering services. These works will enable RAAF Base Darwin to surge rapidly to full capacity on short notice to support the significant number of defence personnel, aircraft and support elements that operate from the base during major activities, and should the need arise.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second chapter of report 2 contains the report of the inquiry into the Department of Defence's proposed

        -30A operations at Exmouth in Western Australia. This project has an estimated cost of $662 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project will upgrade the airfield at RAAF Base Learmonth to support KC-30A aircraft operations and improve overall airfield resilience. The KC-30A is the largest aircraft in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        fleet and provides airlift and air-to-air refuelling. The KC-30A is currently unable to land at RAAF Base Learmonth with a full payload due to limitations of the current runway.
       </p>
       <p>
        Specifically, the works will strengthen the runway and parallel taxiway and construct new connecting taxiways and dedicated parking aprons.
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <i>
         2020 Defence Strategic Update
        </i>
        and
        <i>
         2020 Force Structure Plan
        </i>
        state that enhancing our northern defence capability is an integral part of Australia's defence strategy. The 2023 Defence Strategic Review also urges for the upgrade and development of Australia's northern bases as this will improve the ability of the Australian Defence Force to operate from northern Australia. These two Defence projects directly support both these objectives.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee would like to extend its thanks to personnel from the Department of Defence who provided presentations and hosted a committee site inspection at RAAF Base Darwin in the course of these inquiries.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee recommends that it is expedient that the proposed works are carried out.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend both reports to the House.
