        Skin cancer is very frequently referred to as our national cancer. The outcome of the inquiry that the House of Representatives
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Standing Committee
        </a>
        on Health undertook into skin cancer in Australia was very, very explicit. It raised a number of issues around skin cancer, and it also highlighted the need for early intervention, early diagnosis and looking at the best practice and the best treatment and management of skin cancer. It highlighted the difference between melanoma skin cancers and non-melanoma skin cancers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Everybody is aware of melanoma and how melanoma can prove fatal. There was an excellent motion debated in the House on Tuesday night in relation to melanoma. It highlighted the need for Australians—everybody, for that matter—to be very aware of their bodies and to constantly undertake skin checks.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would just like to spend a little bit of time in this debate talking about the scope of the inquiry—we visited a number of areas in Australia and looked at the issues—and some of the issues that the committee and I believed were most important in relation to skin cancer. The inquiry looked at the statistics, at the different kinds of prevention actions that can be taken, and at diagnosis and treatment. I would like, now, to spend some time going through some of the recommendations of that report. Australia is a sporting nation—we love our outdoors—and the committee received evidence from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTA" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cricket_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Cricket Australia
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surf_Life_Saving_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Surf Life Saving Australia
        </a>
        , looking at skin prevention and the actions that those organisations take to ensure that people who are involved in their sports are aware of the dangers of exposure to ultraviolet rays and the strategies to deal with it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cricket Australia and Surf Life Saving Australia were highlighted in our recommendations. I will spend a little bit of time on Surf Life Saving Australia. They have totally changed their culture in the way that our volunteer surf lifesavers, who do such a wonderful job on our beaches, protect their skin, and in their approach to the sun. Gone are the days of lathering yourself in coconut oil; now it is all about skin prevention with long-sleeve shirts, always having the floppy hat on, and having sunscreen available for all the people who are working to protect people in the surf.
       </p>
       <p>
        There was some concern that high schools do not have the same commitment to prevention of sun damage and skin cancer. In primary schools, it is a 'no hat, no play' approach; in high schools, there is no such approach. I need to acknowledge that it is very difficult to get a high school student to wear a hat, but education about skin cancer needs to be included in the curriculum. There was a very good example in the Hunter region of apps on phones and advertising on the backs of buses, and targeting young people in the way that is best able to reach them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Every primary school has covered outdoor learning areas, but it is not quite as common in high schools. So there was a recommendation to encourage that to be expanded. We also made a recommendation that local governments give consideration to having shadecloths covering their pools. It is not the responsibility of one level of government; it is the responsibility of all level of governments. It is our reasonability as members of parliament to make sure that that message gets out about having sun-smart programs and policies in place because education is of vital importance.
       </p>
       <p>
        About 18 months ago, in conjunction with some pharmaceuticals and doctors within Shortland electorate, ran a skin cancer check at Redhead Beach in the electorate of Shortland. On that day, four cases of melanoma were identified. People came from all around the suburb to have their skin checked. A number of people had non-melanoma skin cancers identified. It is really important that when Australians visit their doctor they have proper skin checks. We heard of many occasions where patients were visiting their
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        and as they were leaving they said, 'While I am here, Doctor, could you please have a look at this mark on my arm,' and it was identified as being a skin cancer and, in some cases, a quite serious melanoma.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another area that the committee thought was fairly important to look at was the undergraduate medical curriculum. Currently, the undergraduate medical curriculum has two hours in the whole of the course dedicated to looking at dermatology. We felt that this could be expanded. We also felt that there was a need to increase proficiency in the use of dermascope and that there should be some practical component included in the course.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are some occupations that are very sun exposed. It was also considered that more education needs to take place in relation to people working in those industries. There are some really standout examples. We heard from a number of witnesses about how, in various workplaces, the exposure to sun was really quite life threatening and we heard of people that had actually lost their lives, particularly in the building industry. The committee thought that, maybe when people are given their competency certificates or induction certificates to go onto a worksite, a component of sun education could be included.
       </p>
       <p>
        Obviously there needs to be ongoing research, and adequate funds need to be provided to support non-medical services—that is allied health services and allied health support services—particularly for families that live in non-metropolitan or rural and remote areas. The committee believes that there should be a little bit more work done there.
       </p>
       <p>
        We need public awareness campaigns to increase awareness and the need for skin checks. We especially need strategies for high-risk groups, and I see young people as being at high risk. I note the chair of the committee has just entered the room. He is very committed to fighting for better guidelines, better treatment and better services in the skin cancer area. He presided over this hearing extremely well. As well, I would like to thank the committee secretariat for all the work that they put in—
