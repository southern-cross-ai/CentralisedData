        On Wednesday 18 November, I was delighted to join Toukley Neighbourhood Centre for a morning tea to celebrate the unveiling of their new community mural, painted by artist
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Miller" rel="nofollow">

        . The mural is Colin's gift to the Toukley Neighbourhood Centre for their big hearts and generous support. As Colin put it: 'After receiving some unexpected help from the Toukley Neighbourhood Centre, I kept thinking about their big blank wall. I was pleased when they approved my offer to paint something for them for free.' Colin dedicated six months to this project, painstakingly capturing locals chosen by the students of Toukley Public School as pillars of their community: Uncle Gavi Duncan; Matt Sonter, the Indigenous community development manager from

        , the Aboriginal education officer from Kooloora preschool; Mrs Beckman, a favourite teacher; Annette Starr, a retired

        community liaison officer; Michael Stoke, also known to the kids as 'the hamburger man', from Nachaels at East Toukley; Shaun McKinney from the Toukley Hawks; and social worker Bonnie Merz. Colin modelled the mural on an original Australian $1 note and said he's hidden 38 animals in the mural for children to find with their sharp little eyes. Colin has also beautifully painted our local flora and the spectacular Norah Head Lighthouse. He hopes his mural, 'simple from a distance, yet complex and interesting up close, will bring joy and happiness to people for years to come'. And, as with all of his work, he said that he couldn't have tried any harder. I would like to thank Colin for his generous gift of this mural to our community and join with Colin in recognising the Toukley Neighbourhood Centre and its volunteers for the work they do for others.
