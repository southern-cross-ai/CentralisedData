       <p>
        One of the most important duties we have as a nation and as representatives in this place is to care for and represent those who cannot care for or represent themselves. We were reminded of this during elder abuse week. Sadly, many vulnerable people are not receiving the care, respect and support they deserve, and their health and lives are being put at risk. This is precisely what happened at the Oakden aged-care facility in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        under the Weatherill Labor government. Families who entrusted the care of their loved ones to Oakden were betrayed by the healthcare system, staff and the Labor government.
       </p>
       <p>
        In comparison, when we received news of this terrible situation federally, the Minister for Aged Care met with families of residents and heard firsthand of the shocking and unacceptable treatment endured by patients. Following his visit, the minister commissioned an independent review into the Commonwealth's aged-care quality regulatory processes. The review will determine why the extent of failures at Oakden were not identified and will examine the accreditation, monitoring, review, investigation, complaints and compliance processes to ensure that the regulatory system in residential aged care works effectively.
       </p>
       <p>
        The impact of the terrible situation at Oakden has been extensive and has reached into my electorate of Boothby. I commend the brave actions of Mrs Barbara Spriggs and her son in seeking a review and explanation of the horrific treatment so many loved ones suffered at Oakden.
