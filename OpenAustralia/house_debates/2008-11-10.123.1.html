        Yesterday I was fortunate to be present at the dedication ceremony for the Southport Surf Lifesaving Club for the coming year and to join the community to pray for safety not only for lifesavers but for all visitors to the pristine beaches of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        . It is not an easy or especially safe vocation to risk your own safety on a regular basis for the welfare of others, but summer after summer these brave local volunteers give of their time for others, whether they be from around the corner or indeed from around the globe. According to the Surf Lifesaving Association, since its inception 493,000 lives have been saved throughout the nation—including more than 94,000 lives in Queensland—and, in the 2006-07 season, more than 11,500 people were rescued from the surf. As we enter the summer season, we should reflect on what the surf lifesavers will do. This summer they will rescue more than 3,000 people, they will administer first aid to more than 11,000 people, they will treat more than 8,000 people for marine stings, and more than 230,000 people will benefit from preventative action. Lifesavers brave conditions not of their choosing and circumstances not of their making to save lives in peril not of their causing, because they are who they are and they sacrifice their time accordingly. These incredible volunteers simply say, ‘You enjoy your time at the beach, stay between the flags and we will watch over you.’ It demonstrates that the spirit of sacrifice is alive and well. All of these volunteers give their time freely. They should be commended.
