How does this reality compare with the commentary on electricity prices over the last year, and what is the government doing to assist households with it?

        <p>
         I thank the member for Chifley for his question. When the government announced its Clean Energy Future package last July, we released comprehensive modelling by Treasury on the impacts of carbon pricing. That modelling showed very clearly that the carbon price would add about 10 per cent to electricity prices, which is around $3.30 a week per household on average—and, of course, the government is delivering assistance to the extent of an average of $10.10 per household per week.
        </p>
        <p>
         Price regulators in different jurisdictions are now confirming Treasury's modelling and showing a lesser impact in some states and territories than the modelling suggested. For example: in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         , IPART, the independent price regulator, has issued a draft determination with a carbon price impact on the average household in New South Wales of $3.27 per week; Western Australia's regulator has found an impact around $2.45 week; in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Territory
         </a>
         it is around $2.48 a week; in Tasmania is around $3 a week. All these figures are under the Treasury-modelled cost impact.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government's household assistance package will provide, as I indicated, an average of $10.10 per week per household. It will do this through permanent tax cuts—by trebling the tax-free threshold, which also releases one million taxpayers from having to file a tax return. It will also deliver it through permanent increases in the pension and through payments to many self-funded retirees. It will also deliver it through permanent increases in family tax benefits and many other Commonwealth payments. This is contrary to much of the commentary that we have heard from the Leader of the Opposition.
        </p>
        <p>
         These are the facts: electricity prices are bang-on or a bit less than the Treasury modelling as the regulators bring in their determinations and the government is providing comprehensive assistance to households—it will reach nine out of 10 households—yet for the last 12 months the Leader of the Opposition has run around making false claims designed to engender fear that the carbon price will increase electricity prices by 20 per cent, 25 per cent or 30 per cent. That is specifically what he has claimed—just last week, the Leader of the Opposition went on a hysterical rant claiming that the carbon price will certainly force up electricity prices by 20 per cent. But, now that the facts are coming in, what they will show is that the Leader of the Opposition is nothing but a shallow political con man.

           I thank the member for Chifley once again. He represents the area where I grew up—
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooty_Hill" rel="nofollow">
            Rooty Hill
           </a>
           —and I am very proud, having grown up in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
            Western Sydney
           </a>
           , that the government is providing very strong assistance to households in Western Sydney.
          </p>
          <p>
           In the seat of Chifley 58,000 taxpayers will receive a tax cut, 19,000 families will receive an increase in payments—that is, family tax benefit payments—and 24,400 pensioners will receive an increase in the pension. In the seat of Parramatta, in Western Sydney, 55,000 taxpayers will receive a tax cut, 43,300 families will receive family tax benefit increases and 22,100 pensioners will receive an increase in the pension. In the seat of Greenway, in Western Sydney, 55,000 taxpayers will get a tax cut, 13,500 families will receive an increase in family tax benefits and 17,000 pensioners will receive a pension increase.
          </p>
          <p>
           These are the facts: this is a Labor government, and we are introducing an extremely important environmental and economic reform in a socially equitable, socially fair manner that looks after the people of Western Sydney, and we are proud to do it.

              Thank you very much, Madam Deputy Speaker, because that was very selective quoting indeed by the Leader of the Opposition—something we have become completely accustomed to. As has been made clear by

               Hydro Aluminium
              </a>
              over a considerable period of time, there are a number of factors that are influencing this decision and the financial losses that they are incurring—essentially, the effects of growth in global supply in aluminium, the strong value of the Australian dollar over a period of time, the ongoing effects of the global financial crisis, and in fact nothing less than a 40 per cent depreciation—

                   Leave is not granted. I am not precious about what everybody calls me. It is a very difficult situation, so please do not correct someone if they get my title wrong, especially in the middle of question time. I think it is more appropriate we get on with question time.
