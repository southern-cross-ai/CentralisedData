       <p>
        I rise today to speak out against the religious persecution of the Sabaean-Mandaean community and Christian minority groups in Iraq that I feel requires a more proactive and compassionate response from the Western world. Despite the Australian government’s involvement in helping to establish a democratic society in Iraq, members of religious minority groups continue to be persecuted and killed, causing many to flee as refugees to the neighbouring countries of Syria and Jordan.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently I met with Dr Amad Mtashar, who is the president of the Mandaean-Australian Community Cultural Club and a member of the Mandaean Human Rights Group. Dr Mtashar informed me of the recent killing of a Mandaean goldsmith, Mr Weam Abdul-Nabi Lazim, on 6 August this year. He was gunned down in the Iskan district of Baghdad in the middle of the morning, in a busy shopping centre with security controlled entrances and exits. This is not the only example of persecution against Mandaeans. I have been advised that recorded incidents against Mandaeans in Iraq since 2003 include 171 killings, 275 kidnappings and 298 assaults and forced conversions to Islam. As I understand it, they also include four deaths, which occurred in the last week alone. The Mandaean people are followers of John the Baptist and are not regarded as ‘people of the book’ by Islamic extremists, so they are considered worthless and expendable. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR" rel="nofollow">
         UNHCR
        </a>
        , in its April report, noted:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The situation of the remaining 3,500-5,000 Sabaean-Mandaeans in Iraq remains of serious concern as they continue to be singled out by Sunni and Shi’ite extremists as well as criminals on the basis of their religion, profession and (perceived) wealth.
       </p>
       <p>
        The UNHCR report went on to say:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The fact that Mandaeans generally have no tribal networks and live scattered in small groups, further increases their vulnerability. In addition, non-violence is a basic tenet of their religion.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important to note that the population of Mandaeans in Iraq prior to 2003 was approximately 60,000. The persecution of Mandaeans and the subsequent decision of these people to flee Iraq is similar to the position of Christian minority groups. The UNHCR also noted in its report that Christians are being targeted by Islamic extremists for being un-Islamic, a charge that equally applies to Mandaeans. A wave of attacks on Christian minorities in Mosul, in October 2008, forced almost 10,000 Christians to flee their homes. As a consequence of these attacks, a large Iraqi security force presence was deployed to the city of Mosul, but mass casualty attacks, kidnappings and targeted assassinations continue to occur on an almost daily basis.
       </p>
       <p>
        In October 2008, Archbishop Jean Sleimam, of Baghdad, told the Aid to the Church in Need conference in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        that this ‘paralysing fear’ was gripping Iraq’s Christian and religious minority groups, including Mandaeans. The archbishop said that very real persecution remained a huge threat to these people, who have been forced to adopt Islamic practices, including that of dress, and who have been encouraged to leave various areas. In the light of the above examples of persecution, I strongly believe the Australian government should be more disposed to granting humanitarian visas to Mandaean and Christian refugees.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I understand it, very few, if any, visas have been granted to these refugees sheltering in Syria and Jordan. The refugee and humanitarian program is designed to assist those people who are the victims of a level of persecution or discrimination that amounts to a gross violation of their human rights. Mandaeans and Christian minority groups in Iraq are certainly suffering that degree of persecution every day. Regardless of individual political views concerning Australia’s initial involvement in Iraq, I believe the government has a moral responsibility to assist with the consequences of the 2003 invasion and the ensuing instability in Iraq that followed. Clearly, these are consequences that should have been considered by the Howard government prior to committing Australia’s troops to that activity in Iraq. It is now up to the Rudd Labor government to be compassionate, to deal with these consequences and to not turn our backs on the people who most need our assistance.
