        On Saturday night I had the honour of attending the legends of racing gala evening at Kilmore Trackside. Local racing identities and members of the broader community alike attended this event to witness the unveiling of three amazing paintings by renowned artist Brian Clinton. Brian's work is without peer, and I can see why he is an internationally renowned artist. The level of precise detail in his paintings of racing greats

        local who is the embodiment of a true gentleman. John has a strong history of community spirit and we are lucky to have him as a McEwen resident. Joining John was Brother Doug Walsh, who spoke about the passion and support for the Bagong Barrio Education Fund, which supports the educational needs of the children of Bagong Barrio, the second largest slum in Manila. One hundred per cent of the sponsors' money goes directly to the students. Their mission statement says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our program aims to support education in the hope that it will serve as a means of empowering an individual to break out of the cycle of poverty.
       </p>
       <p>
        I encourage all members to get on the BBEF website and read 'My trip to Australia' by Maurice Gravidez, a truly wonderful story of one of the sponsored children who benefit from this wonderful program.
       </p>
       <p>
        The night's entertainment was provided by Deb Cotton, who wowed the audience with her outstanding and powerful voice. It was a wonderful evening, and I again thank John for organising and delivering this event and for his continued dedication. It was stated that from little things big things grow, but it takes a big heart and John Gaffney embodies that big-hearted spirit.
