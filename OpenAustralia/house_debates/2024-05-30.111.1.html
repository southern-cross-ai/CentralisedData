        I rise to speak about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        of Granville and its invaluable contribution to our community.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         The Rotary Club
        </a>
        of Granville embodies the spirit of service and community betterment. For decades it's been a beacon of hope, a catalyst for positive change and a source of unwavering support for individuals and families in need. Its commitment to the Rotary motto 'Service above Self' is not just a slogan but a way of life embraced by each member.
       </p>
       <p>
        Right now the unemployment rate in the Cumberland
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGA" rel="nofollow">
         LGA
        </a>
        is around three per cent higher than the national average. In fact, unemployment—and youth unemployment in particular—is one of the most pressing challenges faced by residents in my local community. Recognising the urgency of this issue, the Rotary Club of Granville took proactive steps to help their local community by introducing their Crack Your First Job training program. I recently visited Granville Rotary to attend their flagship Crack Your First Job program, which was held in collaboration with Sewa Australia, a not-for-profit organisation that works to empower everyday Australians. Crack Your First Job aims to help people find their dream job, stand out from the crowd and jump into a fulfilling career.
       </p>
       <p>
        This program joins a growing list of initiatives by Granville Rotary to better our local community, including their digital literacy program for seniors, their women's health forum, an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Women's_Day" rel="nofollow">
         International Women's Day
        </a>
        awards ceremony to recognise local women, the Rotary Youth Leadership training program and their regular barbecues to help fundraise for local not-for-profit organisations.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the heart of this organisation lies a profound commitment to inclusivity and diversity. No less than nine nationalities are represented among the club's membership. This diversity reflects their core value that everybody, regardless of background or circumstance, deserves an equal opportunity to thrive. The Rotary Club of Granville is a catalyst for meaningful connections and friendships.
       </p>
       <p>
        In particular, I want to acknowledge the outgoing club president, Sanjeev Goyal, the incoming club president, Stephen McKee, the secretary Shanthini Donald. I also want to acknowledge Rotarian and district governor, Renga Rajan. For years, Renga has been an active member of our local community. By day he's a procurement specialist, but outside of work you'd most likely find him running a 10 k charity marathon or donating at his local blood bank. Through his tireless charity work and relentless optimism, Renga has not only entrenched but endeared himself to the local community in Parramatta as an inspiring leader. This club and our local community have been beneficiaries of his selflessness and we thank him for his contributions.
