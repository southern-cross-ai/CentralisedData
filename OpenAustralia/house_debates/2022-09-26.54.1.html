       <p>
        My heartfelt thanks are extended to our policemen and women, heroes in the eyes of many within our communities. One of my team members is the wife of a hardworking, proud, long-serving local police officer. She has previously written these words and has given me permission to share them today: 'My darling husband, I see you. At two am I see you reach for that same shirt you only took off a few hours ago. I hear the front door gently close so as not to wake me or the kids, even though you know I can hear you and will hear you again when you return. I see you leave to rescue someone from a mangled car, from a violence-filled home, from a complete stranger, from themselves. I love that you just go. You cast no judgement. I imagine their relief when they see the blue lights flashing and they hear your firm hands on their front door. I can see you through their eyes, and you make me so proud. I see you when you come home many hours later, sometimes days, weary and torn. I know every fibre in your body aches for our bed, but our boys want their daddy, and your mind is not ready for sleep after what you have just seen. Your everydays are other people's nightmares. I see you come home and breathe our children in. I see your grateful heart and shining eyes. I can only imagine what you see every day. I'm so grateful that you shield me from so much of what you see and know. Thank you for that. But please know that my shoulders are wide, and I can share your sorrow and pain too, even if it is just to hold you and let you know that I see you.'
