        The coalition parties are focused on the wrong jobs. We've got the former Minister for Border Protection, who we discover has been double-jobbing, after the Prime Minister's job. We've got the Minister for Health, who wants the deputy leader's job. We've got the Treasurer, who can't do his own job and wants to determine who has the Prime Minister's job. We've got the former Deputy Prime Minister, who wants the new Deputy Prime Minister's job. We've got the former Prime Minister, who wants a better job. We've got the Minister for Human Services, the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment, the Minister for

        It's absolutely true that over the last week it's been clear that nobody is doing their job and it's time for this Prime Minister to go to the Governor-General and let the Australian people do their job, because we've got real problems in this country, but it's quite clear this government is focusing on none of them. Changing the Prime Minister is going to do nothing about it. We're still going to have a dodgy
