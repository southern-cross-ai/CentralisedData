       <p>
        Bennelong
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ " rel="nofollow">
        </a>
        wants their government to be responsible, they want a government that listens and they want a government that cares, and last night's budget showed that Bennelong helped elect a Labor government that delivers on all three. Late last year, locals asked me for more cost-of-living support, which is something I raised both publicly and privately. In response, the government will deliver a tax cut for every single taxpayer in Bennelong. On average, local taxpayers will get a tax cut of $1,782, with 81 per cent of locals better off than they would have been under the Liberal's plan.
       </p>
       <p>
        Secondly, Bennelong told me that last year's energy rebates were great but a little too targeted. Again, I raised this both publicly and privately. In response, starting July this year every household in Bennelong will receive $300 off its power bill. Tax cuts and energy rebates will help with family budgets and deliver much-needed relief to every household.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thirdly, Bennelong told me that they needed the infrastructure to match our region's housing growth. There is an incredible investment in infrastructure in Bennelong from this Labor government. Building on $190 million already delivered, last night's budget delivered a further $150 million in infrastructure for Bennelong, including $115 million for Sydney's first electric-bus depot and $35 million for roads and a bus interchange. This is a responsible budget for all Australians, but, significantly, it's a budget that delivers for everybody in Bennelong.
