        For the past month I've been inundated with concerns from people living in the suburb of Bonython, which is in my electorate, about a drone delivery service trial called Project Wing. Normally there are standards and regulations for drones—where and how they fly in a suburban area, their proximity to people and the need for the drone to always be in the sight of an operator, not flown remotely by a computer and a camera. But Project Wing was given the all clear from the

         Civil Aviation Safety Authority
        </a>
        . Project Wing has been excluded from all standard drone regulations to trial the delivery of food—burritos—and small goods of up to two kilograms over a distance of up to 10 kilometres.

        this year, a representative from Project Wing met with the Tuggeranong Community Council and listened to people's concerns. This was before the trial had even started. Now here we are in September. The trial has been going on for months, and I've got to report that residents are not impressed. They're concerned about the loud buzzing noise flying over their homes several times a day. They're concerned about their privacy—cameras are fitted on the drones, and the footage recorded is kept offshore for up to 30 days. They're concerned by the reduced number of birds in their backyards, in what is usually a peaceful area. They're concerned the number of drones will only increase, as the project has no predicted end date. Canberrans, get in touch with me and share your thoughts on the drones.
