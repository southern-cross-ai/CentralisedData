        Sandra Ruth Johnson was awarded an Order of Australia for her contribution to the mining sector. I want to place on record my thanks to Sandra for all the hard work that she does in our community—an extraordinary lady, and I am very glad that she has won this. It is nice to see a friend be acknowledged for the work that they do.
