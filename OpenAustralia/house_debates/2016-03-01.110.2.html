        We know that this Prime Minister says one thing and does the complete opposite, but what has come to light when it comes to the opening of trade training centres is that it is not just the Prime Minister but it is most of those on the other side. They like to go out to their trade training centres—the trade training centres that Labor funded—and cut the ribbon, but, when they come back to the parliament, they argue in support of cutting the funding. As I have noted in this House already, over 40 government members and senators have attended their trade training centres, put out media releases, posed for a picture and got in their local paper, but then they have cut the program, stopping many other schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have here a trade training centres lucky dip, where we have quotes of things government members have said in support of trade training centres. I will start with the member for Flinders.

          But there are just so many here. Okay. I will pop them there. It is a lucky dip here. We have got the member for Flinders, on Labor's trade training centres in his electorate. He says:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          This is a state-of-the-art building where students can gain practical construction and trades qualifications.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          These students have a keen interest in taking up employment in trade industries and this will provide them with the necessary skills to fulfil their passions.
         </p>
         <p>
          Who else have we got in the trade training centres lucky dip? We have got the member for Lyons, who says, on Labor's trade training centres:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Training centres like these enable local students to pursue vocational pathways and develop skills across a range of fields.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          There are real skills shortages around Tasmania - business needs employees who have the right type of training for businesses that are increasingly specialised.
         </p>
         <p>
          Who else have we got in the trade training centres lucky dip? We have got the member for Hume, who said, at the opening of one of Labor's trade training centres:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The new facilities at Wollondilly Anglican College Trades Skills Centre will give students the best chance to learn workplace skills. I already know local businesses in Tahmoor are excited about this opportunity.
         </p>
         <p>
          There are plenty more in here. Who else have we got? We have got the member for Cowper, who said about one of Labor's trade training centres:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          There are ongoing skills shortages in many parts of the hospitality industry and this new facility will provide more choice and opportunity for students who wish to pursue a career in the sector.
         </p>
         <p>
          I will keep going with our trade training centres lucky dip. We have here now the member for Macarthur, who said:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          We know that Australia's future productivity and competitiveness depend on a skilled and trained workforce.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          …   …   …
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          It's important that we build strong school and industry partnerships like this one so that student training in schools meets industry and employer needs.
         </p>
         <p>
          There continues to be the hypocrisy on full display. I will go now to the member for Gippsland, who said:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          This new training facility at Catholic College Sale will help give our students the skills they need before embarking a trade, so they can hit the ground running when they start their apprenticeships.
         </p>
         <p>
          I have got some more time, so I will continue with the trade training centres lucky dip. We have got the member for Riverina, who said:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          Each high school will be putting their funding towards exciting initiatives which will benefit students of all ages, particularly providing vocational pathways which are important for secondary schools these days.
         </p>
         <p>
          We also have, at the opening of a trade training centre, the member for Mallee—

            He is in the lucky dip as well. He said:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Providing young people in our region with education and vocational training opportunities that can lead to careers, is vital to the sustainability of our towns …
           </p>
           <p>
            I think I will have time for one more, and I hope it is not you, Mr Deputy Speaker! No. This one is a short one. It is the member for Cowper again, in the trade training centres lucky dip. He said:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Educational opportunities are the way to transform our community.
           </p>
           <p>
            What we have seen is coalition member after coalition member praising Labor's trade training centres out there in their communities, taking credit for them and then coming into this place and cutting the funding for trade training centres. This denies others schools and students the opportunity. Indeed, $950 million was ripped from this budget. It would be nice if the 40 coalition members who went out there praising these trade training centres in their communities would come into this place, stand up to the Prime Minister and say, 'We want this money back in our communities.'
