       <p>
        I rise today to speak to two critical issues for my electorate of Newcastle, the first being the ongoing erosion of Stockton Beach and the second being the critical need for the diversification of the Port of Newcastle.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've had many discussions with my constituents about the dire state of Stockton Beach and what this means for the health and wellbeing of that community. The ongoing erosion of Stockton Beach, made worse with every storm and extreme weather event, has been a source of great anxiety for residents in that community. Indeed, it has meant the loss of vital community assets, like the sudden closure and demolition of the Stockton Early Learning Centreâ€”the only childcare facility in Stockton. The Stockton Surf Life Saving Club, the popular cafe Lexie's on the Beach and the nearby Stockton caravan park, all of which are publicly owned assets, are now in real danger of being lost too.
       </p>
       <p>
        The continued erosion of Stockton Beach is having a devastating impact on residents, who are feeling more and more vulnerable to disasters now. Coastal communities like Stockton are already living with the shocking consequences of increased storms and extreme weather events on their beaches, public assets and way of life. We can't leave them stranded.
       </p>
       <p>
        That's why I wrote to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        minister Paul Toole, strongly urging him to apply for the Commonwealth funding and to nominate Stockton Beach erosion as their No. 1 priority project for the state, which they have done. I have discussed this issue, the circumstances of the Stockton community and the funding application with the federal Minister for Emergency Management, Senator Murray Watt, and I know he understands how important this funding is for my community. I stand with the Stockton community and make the promise that I won't stop fighting every day to help secure that funding. This project will be the start of bringing sand back to Stockton Beach, but Stockton needs mass sand nourishment, and there is an issue around the mining licence that absolutely needs to be resolved. I look forward to the state and local government working on a solution for our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another urgent issue is the diversification of the port of Newcastle. Newcastle and the Hunter have powered Australia for generations, and under Labor they will continue to power into the future. This Labor government sees the opportunity to transform Newcastle to a renewable energy superpower, and we'll be creating more jobs, cutting power prices and reducing emissions in doing so. That's why Labor will fund $182 million into the development of key infrastructure and prospects for the production and export of green hydrogen in the port of Newcastle.
