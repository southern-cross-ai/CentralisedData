         It is my pleasure to also welcome Prime Minister Taur Matan Ruak to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Parliament
         </a>
         . I thank the Prime Minister for his personal support for the important partnership between Australia and Timor-Leste. Timor-Leste and Australia are more than just near neighbours; we share a strong and a vibrant friendship. This relationship was forged during World War
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
          II
         </a>
         when the people of Timor-Leste saved many Australian lives at great cost to themselves. One of those lives that they saved was my mentor
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Uren" rel="nofollow">
          Tom Uren
         </a>
         who was captured on Timor along with other members of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparrow_Force" rel="nofollow">
          Sparrow Force
         </a>
         and other forces that were there during
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" rel="nofollow">
          World War II
         </a>
         . The Timorese literally put their lives on the line to save Australian lives. I know that, at the memorial at Marrickville Park in my electorate, there's a tribute to the courage of the Timorese.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our friendship has grown even stronger in the decade since, particularly since independence. In 2019 I was very honoured to visit Dili with then Prime Minister Morrison for the 20th anniversary of the independence referendum. It took enormous sacrifices for Timor-Leste to achieve its sovereignty, and I want to acknowledge that today as well as the efforts by leaders since then to make democracy work. Today, with this visit, the Prime Minister and I reaffirmed the bond between our nations and our commitment to deepening it further. We have discussed defence and economic cooperation, labour mobility and our joint commitment to security and prosperity of the region. We know that important projects, including the Greater Sunrise project that we discussed today and I discussed with Woodside last week when I was in Perth, are important for the future development of Timor-Leste.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am incredibly optimistic about our future. Timor-Leste has a lot of friends in Australia, and everyone in this chamber can be counted upon as part of that. Again, I thank you, Prime Minister, for bringing your delegation here today. You are very, very welcome.

          To the Prime Minister, His Excellency General Taur Matan Ruak, thank you very much for being here today with your Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation, Her Excellency Adaljiza Magno, and the ambassador. The three of you are most welcome guests, and on behalf of the coalition it's a great honour to have you in the chamber with us today.

          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Cosgrove" rel="nofollow">
           Peter Cosgrove
          </a>
          reflected on his time commanding the multinational peacekeeping forces in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
           East Timor
          </a>
          . He spoke of the stoicism, of the cohesion and of the energy of your national community, of the hardy nature of your people, of the generosity of spirit that exists in the hearts of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timorese" rel="nofollow">
           East Timorese
          </a>
          . Our two countries' relationship is characterised by a deep and abiding friendship, a friendship forged by our interlocked histories, our shared neighbourhood in and peaceful outlook for the region, and the mutual respect which exists between our people.
         </p>
         <p>
          Prime Minister Ruak, in 2007 Australian Prime Minister John Howard wrote about the difficult and demanding task which faced your people in building a sustainable, democratic and prosperous future. It is something you know more than most, as a former freedom fighter, chief of defence force, human rights award recipient and president of your country. Sixteen years on from then Prime Minister Howard's remarks, Australians look on with admiration at what East Timorese have accomplished. Our two countries today are dear friends, and we share a very strong future as friends and as partners.
