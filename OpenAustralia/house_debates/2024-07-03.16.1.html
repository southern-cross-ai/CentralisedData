        The proposed works were referred to the Public Works Committee on 7 February 2024. Following its inquiry the committee made two recommendations: first, that Defence report back to the PwC with the source location of the steel that will be used in the proposed works once identified; and, second, that the House of Representatives resolve that it is expedient to carry out the proposed works.
       </p>
       <p>
        The issue of the source location of the steel was raised by the member for Makin in the public hearings. In response, Defence said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I can assure you that the share of Australian industry content in this project will be very high.
       </p>
       <p>
        A Defence official went on to say:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As part of those Commonwealth Procurement Rules, there is guidance in terms of expectations of the Commonwealth for material supply as part of that, and, therefore, the expectation would be that it would be Australian supplied steel that's delivered as part of this project.

        Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence in early to mid-2025 for completion in late 2026. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee, ably led by the member for Moreton, for undertaking a timely inquiry. I commend the motion to the House.
