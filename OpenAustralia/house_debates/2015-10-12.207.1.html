        I would like to acknowledge a local community group in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascot_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Ascot Park
        </a>
        which is doing great things in my electorate of Hindmarsh. The Active Elders Association is a social group for the over-50s which meets every Wednesday and provides support for the elderly to stay active, be sociable and be part of the community. Groups like Active Elders are so important in caring for the aged. I heard a number of stories of how members had become involved because, quite simply, they were lonely at home following the passing of a loved one, or because they just needed to get out of the house.

        Last Wednesday I was invited to join them for afternoon tea, at which I got to meet the new president, Nora Lyons. Congratulations to Nora on her appointment. I wish her all the best for the coming year. I would also like to acknowledge Jan Hedger, who does a terrific job in her role as treasurerâ€”winning grants, promoting the Active Elders and recruiting new members. Each week, the members do different activities. This week, when I arrived, they were locked in a competitive game of indoor bowls before I joined them in a few games of bingo in the afternoon.

        As a local community group, the Active Elders are also doing great things to support job seekers. Always looking to give back to the community, they have been a supporter of the government's Work for the Dole program. According to Jan and Nora, current job seekers

        and Alicia Walker are doing a great job. Trevor has changed from being a shy person to one who is much more confident, while Alicia is fitting in very well. Jan boasted to me, proudly, how Active Elders have a good track record, having only recently seen Kyran Moore re-enter the workforce after spending some time with the group, and he is doing a great job. Congratulations to Nora, Jan and the members of the Active Elders.
