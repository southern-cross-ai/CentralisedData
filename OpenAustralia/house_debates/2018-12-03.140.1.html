        As a federal member for Petrie, my job when I come to this place is, of course, to represent the constituents, the 150,000 or so people, who live in my electorate. I've had a few people raise questions with me via social media, which I want to quickly address.

        said, 'Please ensure our live export is exceptionally high.' I've had a number of people talk to me about live export. I have visited the cattle stations up in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and looked firsthand at the ships and how those farmers treat their cattle. People might not be aware that, in Australia, whether it's sheep or cattle, we're the only country in the world that actually has laws whereby our agriculture, when it is exported, has to be dealt with in a proper manner, in a professional manner and in a humane manner at the other end. If Australia got out of that export market, other countries would take its place and there would be no protections at all. So, in many ways, Australia's involvement in this industry raises the standard, but I'd say to Sandra: I do plan on visiting a live sheep ship soon and I'll report back to her once I've had a look at that.

        wants to make sure higher education is affordable and asks why Queensland's unemployment rate one of the worst in the country. First of all, in relation to higher education, Joshua, the federal government currently pays 60 per cent of the bill. Australian taxpayers foot 60 per cent of every university degree and 40 per cent is paid for by the student. The student can either pay for that up-front or can

        it and pay it back after they earn approximately $50,000 or above. I've got the new University of the

        region, which the federal government has put a lot of funding towards. That'll start in 2020. If people aren't able to afford to go straight up, they can HECS part of it and the federal government will pay the other 60 per cent.
       </p>
       <p>
        In relation to why the Queensland unemployment rate is the worst in the country, I could be really partisan and say that's because you've got a Labor state government in Queensland—and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        has a Liberal government—but I won't pretend to do that. I think that's a question you'll have to put to the state Labor members in your area. All I can tell you is that the unemployment rate, federally, is five per cent, and it's not an accident; it's because the federal coalition government has had a plan for jobs and growth around ship manufacturing, free trade agreements and small and medium-sized tax cuts, and it's working well.

        June Uksi wants to ensure our borders are safe and wants to know what we're doing. As you know, June, we've stopped the boats. We've stopped children drowning at sea. We've got 2,000 children out of detention since I came into office. There are now something like 13 there. Also this week we're introducing the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Bill 2018. Police currently can, if they have a warrant, go to Telstra and access people's text messages and phone records or intercept live calls, if they think there is terrorist activity or another serious offence going on. This new bill will allow our law enforcement and intelligence agencies to go to the companies that provide encrypted services on WhatsApp and other apps and via social media. If these companies are operating in Australia, they'll be captured by the legislation, which is really important as well.

        Jim Frew and Trish Lesina would like Australia to exit the Paris Agreement. We won't be doing that. I've spoken to the Prime Minister. We've signed the Paris Agreement. It's a 26 to 28 per cent emissions reduction target. The fact is that we will meet that target. It's a way of moving to renewable energy. We still have coal and gas and other forms of energy, which are important. Jim and Trish, this is in stark contrast to Labor's 45 per cent emissions reduction target—and we know that they haven't given up on a carbon tax, which will see electricity bills rise. We have also brought in legislation this week to keep energy costs under control, and we're seeing many energy companies reducing costs, including for those who are loyal customers to their electricity provider—in the past they haven't passed on discounts to you, but we're now seeing them pass on discounts to you. I'd say to people in my electorate, if you haven't checked with your energy provider, make sure you check with them that you're on the best deal. Now is the time to act: they are listening, because of the federal government legislation that we're implementing.
