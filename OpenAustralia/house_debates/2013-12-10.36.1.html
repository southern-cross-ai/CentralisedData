        My question is directed to the Minister for

         Small Business
        </a>
        . I refer the minister to the representations I have had from Mr Russell Parson of the Little Creek Cheese Shop in my electorate. Due to the rising cost of gas and electricity as a result of the carbon tax, he made a decision not to employ an additional shop assistant. What impediments are there to repealing the carbon tax and helping small business operators like Mr Parson create jobs?

         There you have it: for a Labor Party that might be remotely interested in jobs, there is evidence of the impact of your job-destroying carbon tax. It backs up all the other case studies that have been brought to this chamber and shared with Labor time and time again, case studies of how the carbon tax that you promised not to implement but went ahead and implemented has cost jobs in the Australian small business community. But you did not want to know about. There are 412,000 Australians now not employed in small business—

                  There is the evidence for the indifference Labor has to the women and of small business.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  We have seen in the most recent Sensis survey a 62 per cent positive turnaround in the sentiment of small business towards Commonwealth government policies. What do they talk about? They say: 'Support amongst
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SME" rel="nofollow">
                   SME
                  </a>
                  s for the federal government improved dramatically following the recent federal election, bringing this indicator to the highest point it's been since November 2007.' They go on to describe this as a turnaround of 62 percentage points following the federal election. The reason for that is that the coalition took a small business policy to the electorate. The coalition bothered to engage with the men and women of small business. At the heart of that agenda was the abolition of the carbon tax.

                   I rise on a point of order, Madam Speaker. I appreciate that he has practised the answer using the word 'you'. But he should listen to your ruling, Madam Speaker. It is not that hard. Every other member of parliament can do it.

                     Here we have at the heart of our policy the abolition of the carbon tax. All the Abbott government wants to do is get on and implement its policies. What a novel idea that would be after Labor came to office promising not to do something and then went ahead and did it. What we say to Mr Parsons and all of those small business men and women is this: we are on your side; we are your best advocates; we will not rest until we get rid of this carbon tax—the carbon tax that Labor promised not to introduce and then went ahead and introduced that contributed to the loss of 412,000 jobs in small business. Shame on you, Labor. At least get out of the road so we can get on with our job.
