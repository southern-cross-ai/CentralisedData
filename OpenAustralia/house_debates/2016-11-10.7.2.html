        That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Woomera Range Remediation Facilities Project.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Defence is proposing to deliver new and refurbished facilities and infrastructure capable of facilitating the operation of a new range-safety and -control system at the Woomera Range Complex in South Australia. This project will provide purpose-built facilities which will enable more frequent and more sophisticated trials in support of future testing and evaluation of air platforms and weapons. The project will significantly contribute to meeting a defence capability need for the future use of the Woomera testing range. The proposed works will enhance aerospace testing and evaluation techniques and increase the capacity of the range for future air warfare development.
       </p>
       <p>
        The works will provide the Australian Defence Force with purpose-built facilities to support the introduction into service of a new, state-of-the-art integrated range control system at the Woomera Range Complex in South Australia. The proposed works include a new range control centre, a communications interface building and a maintenance and storage facility. The works will significantly improve the ADF's ability to conduct more regular and sophisticated trials. The project also proposes to upgrade and establish new communication sites on the range, which will be supported with road upgrades and the expansion of a fibre-optic network.

       <p>
        The estimated cost to deliver the project is $48.64 million, excluding GST. This includes construction costs; escalation allowances; professional design fees; service fees; design, construction and defence contingencies; and information technology equipment. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to begin in mid-2017, with completion expected in mid-2018. I commend the motion to the House.
