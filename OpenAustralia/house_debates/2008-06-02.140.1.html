        I rise to speak in support of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation_Army" rel="nofollow">

        and, in particular, their annual

        doorknock appeal. Yesterday I spent several hours doorknocking for the local Salvation Army, helping them to raise much-needed funds for the many purposes that they put them to. Over the years, I have had occasion to work with many of the people from within the Salvation Army, both within and outside of the electorate of Makin. I have to say it is one organisation that not only has an incredible amount of credibility with people but also does so much good for so many people. I say that, because as I was doorknocking yesterday it was interesting to see the reaction and reception I received as I got to the doors of different householders. Almost without exception, everyone that was home was willing to put something in as part of the fundraising efforts.

        I rise to compliment on one hand the Salvation Army for the work that they do and on the other hand the generosity of the people out there who, where they believe that a charity is raising funds for a good cause and have confidence and faith that the funds raised will be used for a good cause, are willing to donate. The other interesting observation I make is this: quite often, the households which, as soon as you opened the door, you might have thought were in need of the support and benefit of the Salvation Army were some of the most generous.
