         Queen's Birthday Honours
        </a>
        List. Lyn was appointed a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Member of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        for her significant service to cricket as a player, selector, manager and coach. Lyn played 15 tests and 49 one-day internationals for Australia. She proudly captained our country between 1986 and 1993, and led Australia to victory in the 1988 World Cup. Lyn was a genuine all-rounder who averaged 41 with the bat and, as a leg spinner, took 26 wickets. Lyn is a Lismore local, growing up in Tuntable Creek on the family farm with her parents, George and Beth, and brother, Peter, who too were wonderful community people.
       </p>
       <p>
        There was a strong women's cricket competition played in Lismore in the 1980s, with up to five teams in the comp. Lyn captained and played for Norths, which, may I say, a few of the Webber girls played in as well. Karen, my wife, says Lyn was a standout from the start and a great captain even back then. She was destined for greatness. Lyn was able to represent

         New South Wales
        </a>
        and Australia whilst still living at home. After playing a game of cricket locally, Lyn would catch the bus from Lismore on a Saturday night, arrive in Sydney Sunday morning, play another game, then jump back on the bus and be ready for school on Monday morning. Congratulations, and well-deserved, Lyn. We are all very proud of you.

        I'd like to recognise Dr Austin Curtin Sr, who was named on this year's

        in 1985 to focus on regional health. There were only five surgeons in our area at that time. Since then, he has become a highly popular and respected surgeon in our community. Austin has also worked on many health boards, including ministerial advisory committees and rural task forces. He joined the
