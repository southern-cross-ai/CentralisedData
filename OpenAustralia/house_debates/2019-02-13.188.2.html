       <p>
        ) ( ): I just want to say a few brief words on this important commemorative debate. As this parliamentary year commenced, it was striking that we heard excellent speeches, in particular from both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, about current natural disasters in Australia as we also reflected on the 10th anniversary of one of the worst natural disasters that's ever befallen our countryâ€”one which is so vivid in the minds of people from Victoria.
       </p>
       <p>
        Black Saturday's bushfires very significantly impacted the whole Victorian state, either directly or through our concern for our fellow Victorians, and impacted on parts of the electorate of Scullin. In recent days there have been affecting commemorative events in both the shire of Nillumbik and the City of Whittlesea. I know that this has been a difficult experience for many of those affected, for their relatives and for those who care about them, but it has also, I hope, been an important moment for the whole community to reflect on the tragedy that happened, our shared endeavour to respond and the manner in which we did so. It's something I'm very proud of as a Victorian. I was proud then; I am now, 10 years later.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm thinking of colleagues as well. The fires in Scullin and around Scullin greatly impacted the local community, including the local Labor family; we are in mourning for that. Greater impact was felt in the areas represented by my friend the member for

        . My thoughts are with him and also with the state member for

       </p>
       <p>
        There are just two points I want to make in participating briefly in this debate, to make clear, as the member for Scullin, that I am thinking of those events of 10 years ago: I'm thinking of the courage, generosity and decency displayed by Victorians and people from right around the country who reached out at that time; and I'm thinking not only of all those who lost their lives but also of those whose lives continue to be scarred today and who need to be supported, particularly on this difficult anniversary.
