        <p>
         Thank you, Mr Speaker. I'm extremely grateful to be standing here in this place to represent the people of the Hunter electorate. It is my privilege to stand on the land of the Ngunnawal and Ngambri people, the traditional owners of this place, and I pay my respects to their elders past, present and emerging. I also want to pay my respects to the traditional owners of the lands of the Hunter electorate, the Wonnarua, Awabakal and Darkinjung people, and I pay my respects to their elders past, present and emerging. Anikanyantin wantakalowa yarma—which is hello and welcome in the language of Wonnarua, Awabakal and Darkinjung people.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm not your average person. I am certainly not the average person you would expect to be in Canberra, in this place. I'm not the guy who came through the usual path to politics. I was born in Carlton, Victoria, and spent my early years growing up in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melton_South" rel="nofollow">
          Melton South
         </a>
         in the newly formed seat of Hawke. My mother was a nurse and my father was a quarantine officer. I definitely feel that mum had the harder job. My older brother, Jason, and my younger brother, Stephen, and I had what you would call a normal upbringing. Our days were spent out with our mates on our bikes, outdoors. We had to be home when the streetlights came on. If we were late or did something wrong mum would get the wooden spoon out, and if we were really bad she would just tell us, 'Wait till your father gets home.'
        </p>
        <p>
         When I was 26 I found out that I had an older half sister, Karen. I'm glad that you found us. It's been an absolute pleasure getting to know you and your family over the last 14 years.
        </p>
        <p>
         Melton was where I found my love for shooting. I attended the Melton Pistol Club from as early as I can remember. Mum worked nights and weekends, so the old boy had no choice but to take me and my younger brother to the club. We were known as the gruesome twosome.
        </p>
        <p>
         I attended Melton South Primary School and Wilson Park Secondary College, now called Storeton College. Let's be honest: I wasn't the greatest student and I couldn't wait to leave. After leaving school at 15 I started my apprenticeship as a fitter and turner at D&amp;H Rodwell Tooling. I spent 10 years working for Don and Heather, learning my trade with a small team of dedicated workers. I'm still friends with many of them today, like Dennis, John, Chris, Steve and my older brother, Jason. It wasn't easy working with my older brother. I was a pretty lippy apprentice from what I can remember. I copped it from all the tradies. I probably deserved everything I got. It was a hard, old-school workplace that really taught me well. Thanks, Don and Heather, for taking a chance on me. It's odd that we have three tradies in the family, especially given the old boy, who doesn't even know which end of a screwdriver to use.
        </p>
        <p>
         It's fair to say that there were plenty of people involved in shaping me into the person I am today: my first shooting coach, John Corral; my first sponsor, Darrell Bevious; most of the members of the Melton Pistol Club; Norm and

        </p>
        <p>
         I played many sports growing up, with the main focus being on basketball and shooting. Unfortunately, I was better at the sport that wasn't very appealing financially! Representing Australia on the world stage is an incredible honour, and I feel very privileged to have represented Australia since 1998. I've competed in world championships, world cups, Oceania championships and national championships. I've won over 50 national titles. I've represented Australia at five Olympics and four
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games" rel="nofollow">
          Commonwealth Games
         </a>
         . I have three Commonwealth Games gold medals and three bronze medals—or, as my girls and I call them, the brown ones. Mr Speaker, can I tell you there was no better feeling than winning the gold medal at the 2018 Commonwealth Games in front of my wife, Alex; my daughters, Zoe and Asha; and a large group of my family and friends. Turning around to see the excitement on their faces is something that I will never forget.
        </p>
        <p>
         I started work in the mining industry in 2009. I began working as a line borer, travelling around the state before landing a full-time position at Mount Thorley Warkworth. It was an opportunity to drive something I really could say was bigger than me! I spent seven years working at Mount Thorley Warkworth. I was a union delegate, a dispatch officer, a trainer and an operator. Being an operator is the best job in the pit. The biggest concern you have for a 12½-hour shift is what setting the aircon is on—one, two or three?
        </p>

         At the end of 2017, I was headhunted by

         to manage a new engineering shop in Singleton. Our focus was working in the mining industry and trying to grow the business to around 15 people. Fast forward four years and we had grown the business to 70-plus employees working around the Hunter and beyond, specialising in tractors, ag equipment and parts sales as well as our core business in repairs and heavy engineering. I had some amazing times both professionally and personally whilst I was working at Double R, and I still feel it is by far the best team I've ever been part of. I know me ending up in this place wasn't in our 10-year plan, Rusty, but you know you have to take every opportunity that life throws at you. Thank you to Kate, Rusty and the Double R team. It was an amazing ride.

        <p>
         I've been lucky to travel the world doing the sport that I love, and that has given me some of the most amazing experiences of my life, but there is nothing better than coming home to the best country in the world—Australia—and especially my home in the

         Some would argue that we have the best wine in Australia coming out of the Hunter. There certainly is no argument from me. We do have the best wines in Australia. In fact, we have the best wines in the world, from Australia's oldest and first vineyard—

Tourism is a massive part of the Hunter economy, from regattas and families holidaying around the beautiful Lake Macquarie to the world-famous golf courses, restaurants and boutique breweries scattered throughout the Hunter, to our world renowned horse studs in the

          NSW
         </a>
         energy and export market for well over a century, and we will continue to be for centuries to come. There is no doubt about that. At the moment, our traditional industries such as mining, energy, horse studs, farming and tourism are doing well. My position and Labor's position is clear: coal will continue to play a role for many years to come in powering the world. Whilst ever there is an export market for coal, the Hunter and its workforce will continue to fill that market. I am proud to be a former coalminer and I'm bloody proud of my electorate's mining history. And I'm proud to be mates with many people who work in the pits. We need jobs that are well paid and secure and aren't dominated by dodgy labour-hire arrangements. Put simply, whenever you work, if you're doing the same job as the person next to you, you should be paid the same—same job, same pay. It's simple. The difference between us on this side and those that play dress-ups on the other side is we back mining and we back our miners, and we say the same thing in my electorate as we do in my friend Michelle Anandah-Rajah's electorate of Higgins. As I stand here, the export market for coal is as strong as it's ever been. For as long as that continues, and it will continue for years to come, I will make sure Hunter remain at the forefront of supplying coal to the world. My message to every Hunter mining family and the whole of the Hunter electorate in a changing world is this: I will always be up-front with you, and I will always have your back.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Hunter is about to go through one of the biggest booms in decades, not just in our booming traditional industries but with the next phase of powering our nation—through hydrogen, biomethane, battery storage, wind and solar farms, and a range of innovative new projects. Now that the Labor government have committed to a 43 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030, we have just firmed up a solid stance that will invite business and private investment into the Hunter with certainty. And I plan to use my big voice to make sure the Hunter gets its fair share. It's an exciting time for the Hunter electorate.
        </p>
        <p>
         Deputy Speaker, I know that I didn't become the candidate for the seat of Hunter through the normal process. To the branch members around the Hunter: I'm sorry for the process that was undertaken. The seat was on a 2.9 per cent margin when we started the campaign, and we ended up with a 1.1 per cent swing to us. With three more years of hard work, we will make sure this margin is even bigger. I thank you all for the help and time that you all put into this campaign. I'm looking forward to working with you into the future. And I thank the branch members that have taken the time to be in the gallery today: thank you.
        </p>
        <p>
         I've always had strong Labor values and have seen what great hope the Labor Party gives to Australians when we are in government. I believe that everybody should be entitled to the same healthcare services, whether you earn $5 or whether you earn $5 million. Now—I know this is something that those sitting opposite us certainly don't agree with—after nine long years of cuts to Medicare and health services, it's time for us to stand up for the everyday Australian again. This is what an
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Albanese" rel="nofollow">
          Anthony Albanese
         </a>
         led government gives to Australia—hope, after nearly a decade of cuts, neglect and aimless drift. We now have a government that cares not only for the everyday Australian but for every Australian. I want to thank the Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, and all of the now ministers for all of the help in the Hunter campaign. It really made a difference. I particularly want to thank the Prime Minister for supporting a big unit like me from day one. This won't be forgotten. As I campaigned around the Hunter electorate, a common theme and discussion from blue-collar workers was that politicians are all dodgy, are on the take, are on the gravy train and are only in it for themselves. Despite repeated promises from those opposite us, we now have a government that will actually bring in a national anticorruption commission, an independent authority with some teeth, so once again the people of Australia can look at politicians with respect and pride, knowing that we are doing the very best for their communities and Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         For too long the original custodians of this land have been without a voice in our parliament. But now, with a Labor government, we are one step closer to changing this. I can't wait to be part of history when the Australian people own, support and enshrine the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full and give the oldest known civilisation in the world a voice to parliament. What a loud voice that will be. This is something that every Australian should be proud of.

Thank you for your tireless work that you have put into the Hunter over the last 26 years. Without you and your hard work, we would not have the

The third rail line into the Newcastle port has enabled the Hunter to thrive and become the largest coal port in the world. This has created tens of thousands of jobs in the Hunter and surrounds. Without your vision for Hunter, we would not be where we are today. Thank you from not only myself but all the constituents of the Hunter electorate. There's been a Fitzgibbon representing the Hunter since 1984, so I certainly have massive shoes to fill. Lucky I have big feet! Thanks, mate; I'm proud to call you a friend.

         Those on the other side of the chamber don't seem to or just don't want to understand how much blue-collar workers in Australia need the mighty trade union movement.

         and Josh Lloyd for the hard work that they both put in for me at the start of this process. Without the coaching and mentoring that you both provided me, I know I wouldn't be standing here today. I'm sure that you both thought at some stage, 'How did we get stuck with Dan?' To Bob Nanva,

         To Chris Northam, my constant companion during the campaign: what a ride it was, buddy—six months of early starts in Upper Hunter, late night visits to coalmines and, of course, our daily visits to the fine eating establishments around the Hunter Valley. I could haven't done this without you, mate, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart. Your dedication and support to help me win this seat will never be forgotten.

         Now, I want to thank my wife and daughters. Alex, you are the strongest, most loving and caring woman that I know, and I'm so proud and so lucky that you came into my life when you did. There is no doubt it's been a wild ride since we first met in early 2009, from you googling me when I told you I was an Olympian because you thought I was trying to pick you up to us building the life that we have today. You have put up with a lot, with me travelling around the world training and competing, working long hours, being away from home on a regular basis and now representing Hunter in Canberra. I bet you didn't see any of this in our future when we first met.
        </p>
        <p>
         To my beautiful girls, Zoe and Asha: you are both amazing kids, and I cannot wait to see how you both continue to grow into the future. ZoZo, you are a great athlete already, and the world is at your feet. You will achieve anything in life that you want if you put your mind to it. Ashie, you're one of the most caring, lovable and interesting souls I've ever met. Please don't change this; it will take you a long way in life. As your mother and I already know, you both are very strong willed kids, and that will become even stronger into the future. I cannot wait to see the strong, independent women that you both will grow up to be.
        </p>
        <p>
         Girls, I want you to have the same opportunities as anyone else in this country, and I promise that in this place I will fight every day to make sure we have a more equal and fair society to pass on to future generations. I'm sorry in advance for all the birthdays, dinners and important events that I will miss with this new role, but I promise that I will always make it up when I come back home. The three of you are the most amazing women, and I love you all.
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, I look forward to getting to know the members of this place from the Liberal Party and the National Party and the Independents, but what I really look forward to most is working with this amazingly diverse

           I acknowledge the

            First Nations
           </a>
           people here today as well as the traditional owners of the land on which we meet. I thank our First Nations brothers and sisters for showing us that the pathway of truth, treaty and voice will lead to a more unified future for all Australians. And I acknowledge the presence of the so many people who have travelled to Canberra to be here today. Some of my oldest friends are in the gallery. Some of you have been looking out for me since I was three feet tall, and it means a lot to me that you are here today, up there in the gallery, still looking out for me.
          </p>
          <p>
           High in my thoughts are all the members of the Parramatta Labor Party who are here in the gallery; my predecessor,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julie_Owens" rel="nofollow">
            Julie Owens
           </a>
           , who gave nearly two decades of service to the Parramatta community and set a high standard that I aspire to emulate; and counsellors from Parramatta and Cumberland councils. Thank you for being here. Most important, I acknowledge all of the Parramatta branch members, volunteers and supporters. I am deeply grateful to you. You welcomed me. You door knocked. You street stalled and phone banked for me. I am here, standing in this chamber, because of you. And I assure you that I will work hard every day to repay your trust.
          </p>
          <p>
           I want to point out my mother and father and parents-in-law; and my brother, Kim, and his family. Like any child, I don't know the half of what my parents did for us kids, but I always felt happy and secure around them. Kim and I could not have asked for a more supportive and loving family.
          </p>
          <p>
           I also want to acknowledge my friends and former colleagues from AlphaBeta. I'm so proud of the business we build together, starting from humble beginnings with two employees in my attic and growing to more than 70 people across five offices. I learned so much about building teams and managing change along the journey with you.
          </p>
          <p>
           Most importantly, I want to acknowledge my talented and beautiful wife, Phoebe. I always feel so lucky to be with you. We've shared a raft through life's rapid and had a lot of fun along the journey. With typical generosity, you encouraged me to take this leap into politics, and, while it's a great honour to be here to make a contribution to our nation, it's a great honour to be your husband. The most difficult thing about my new job is being away from you and our three gorgeous children, Angus, Ruth and Ingrid. I want you to know that I miss you so much when I'm away.
          </p>
          <p>
           I also acknowledge my friends and colleagues in the Labor movement. I joined the Labor Party nearly 20 years ago. I joined the Labor Party because I was inspired by the core ideals of social justice, by the notion that we should be judged as a society by the way we treat our most vulnerable citizens and by the simple principle that every kid deserves the best chance. But I also joined because of the people I met in Labor, from the senior politicians to the union officials, to the staffers and the branch members young and old. I didn't agree with everything each one of them believed, but I knew that their beliefs came from a good place—a place of optimism and compassion, a place that I wanted to be.
          </p>
          <p>
           And 20 years later, I'm still just as inspired by the ideals and the people in the Labor movement. Looking around this chamber, I recognise so many colleagues who spent the last decade of opposition building a vision for Australia's future that inspired not just me but the whole nation. As new members, we come to this place recognising the debt that we owe to experienced legislators and officials who've come before us, and knowing how much we have to learn from them.

           I also owe a great debt to former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd both for the opportunities he gave me and for inspiring me as I watched him use his intellect and energy to make Australia and the world a better place. Thank you to Bob Easton, former chairman of Accenture, for showing me that the most important quality of any leader is humility and empathy. And, finally, thank you to my new team: Launa, Eleanor, Maryam, Kai and Paul. It is an honour to work with such talented and committed people.

          <p>
           I come to this place as a proud representative of Parramatta. In case you hadn't noticed, Parramatta today is a city full of excitement. It's not just the success of the mighty Eels. Parramatta is blossoming as the geographic heart of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
            Greater Sydney
           </a>
           , and the gateway to the new
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
            Western Sydney
           </a>
           powerhouse of growth. Parramatta is the most dynamic and fastest-growing CBD in Australia, with a million square metres of prime office space already laid down and a million more to be built in the next five years. Nine university campuses have flocked to Parramatta to take advantage of the extraordinary pool of talent across Western Sydney, and dozens of companies have moved to Parramatta to be part of its stellar growth. My message to businesses across our state is simple: if you are not in Parramatta, you are missing out on the future of Sydney.
          </p>
          <p>
           Parramatta is also a place of culture and heritage. Its foundations were said 30,000 years ago by the Burramattagal clan of the Dharug people on land rich in meaning and resources, where the fresh water of the Darling Mills and Toongabbie creeks meets the salt water of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parramatta_River" rel="nofollow">
            Parramatta River
           </a>
           . After Sydney, Parramatta is the second oldest city in Australia. But, as any proud Parramatta resident will point out, much of what we commonly take to be the history of Sydney is in fact the history of Parramatta. Old
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_House" rel="nofollow">
            Government House
           </a>
           , James Ruse's Experiment Farm, John and Elizabeth Macarthur's merino sheep holding, the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_Factory" rel="nofollow">
            Female Factory
           </a>
           , the Girls Home were all in Parramatta. Parramatta is the site of Australia's first permanent church building, the first brewery and the first licenced pub. Much of the rich history of Australia is in Parramatta waiting to be acknowledged, protected and celebrated.
          </p>
          <p>
           The most remarkable feature of Parramatta is its people. The city has been built by successive waves of newcomers seeking a better life for themselves and their families, whether it's the strong Lebanese community around
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harris_Park" rel="nofollow">
            Harris Park
           </a>
           , or the Greek community raising a new church on the banks of the Parramatta River, or the Chinese and Koreans who've moved to Carlingford, or the Indians and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankans" rel="nofollow">
            Sri Lankans
           </a>
           in Wentworthville, Westmead and the jewel of business and culture that is

            Little India
           </a>
           , or the Muslims, Afghanis, Hazaras and other communities now growing their presence. These communities are the true genius of Parramatta—a place that attracts people to come here for a better life for themselves and, in doing so, creates a better city for everyone. Parramatta is a great city, an aspirational city, and it's my intention to help its citizens make it a global city.
          </p>
          <p>
           I've spent my life, as an economist and business owner, building stronger economies and stronger communities. And I'm standing in this chamber because I believe in the power of government to make a difference in people's lives. I've been fortunate to work as an economist around the world and witness how politics shapes the success and the failure of nations. In the United Kingdom, I worked at the London school of economics on ideas to drive productivity and growth.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_New_York" rel="nofollow">
            In New York
           </a>
           , at the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Development_Programme" rel="nofollow">
            United Nations Development Programme
           </a>
           , I studied the factors that keep millions of people around the world in desperate poverty. I worked with
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Stiglitz" rel="nofollow">
            Joseph Stiglitz
           </a>
           to show how fair trade agreements can build countries up but unfair deals can perpetuate inequality and stifle opportunity. And, after six years working in different countries, I thought more and more about Australia—how remarkable our national story is; how lucky we are. Australia isn't perfect, but our journey to become one of the most prosperous nations in the world, full of promise and opportunity, is an extraordinary achievement. Many countries have not been so successful. And Australia's success is not an accident. It's the product of good management, tough decisions and strong institutions.
          </p>
          <p>
           And I'm proud of Labor's contribution to Australia's economic journey. Labor governments opened up Australia's economy in the eighties and nineties. We kept our country out of recession in the 2000s. And now the question we have to ask ourselves is: What is next for Australia? How do we keep the arc of Australian prosperity rising? How high can we aspire? The answer starts with acknowledging that, despite the remarkable success of the Australian project, there is much more to do and there are many people who've been left out of our national prosperity.
          </p>
          <p>
           At the Rheem factory in Parramatta recently, I met Rebecca. Rebecca is a generous, warm-hearted person. She's been at Rheem for 20 years. She works hard. She's devoted to her family. She contributes to the community as the secretary of the local
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptist_Church" rel="nofollow">
            Baptist Church
           </a>
           . She volunteers on the weekends to feed the homeless. I thought about all this woman has contributed to our country. She is everything any of us would want in a neighbour, a workmate or a friend. But, as a nation, we have to ask: are we supporting Rebecca as well as she is supporting us?
          </p>
          <p>
           Over the last 10 years, Australia has lost sight of the fact that good economic policy is fundamentally about people. What is the point of a strong economy if most workers have zero wages growth for a decade? What is the point of near full employment if millions of people are in insecure work? What is the point of rising education levels if hundreds of thousands of migrants find themselves in jobs that don't even use their qualifications? What is the point of rising incomes if the gender pay gap is getting worse, not better?
          </p>
          <p>
           When my dad worked at that same Rheem factory as a young engineer in the 1970s and eighties, Parramatta's manufacturing industry produced good local jobs—jobs that could give families security and opportunity. I'm in parliament today because I'm committed to making sure that the people who work hard for Australia are rewarded and the people who need caring for are not left behind. Every day of my working life to date has been about this, whether it was fighting against unfair trade deals, supporting unions in their wage cases before the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Relations_Commission" rel="nofollow">
            Industrial Relations Commission
           </a>
           or advocating for small businesses during the global financial crisis and the pandemic.
          </p>
          <p>
           I'm also in parliament today because I believe that we have a job to do—to remake the Australian economy and set it up for another generation of prosperity. I believe that the next wave of prosperity requires us to harness the new technologies that are transforming our homes and workplaces. Most of us have smartphones in our pockets that contain more computing power than the
           <i>
            Apollo
           </i>
           spaceship that landed on the moon. Every day the world generates more new data than all the information in every Australian library combined.
          </p>
          <p>
           These technologies create new opportunities for progressive governments. Imagine a progressive health system that uses new data to make an early diagnosis before a child gets chronically sick. Imagine a progressive school system that uses technology to track the students who might be struggling and give them a little extra help before they fall behind. If we harness the new technologies for good they might give us the tools to address social injustice before it ruins lives, before it creates insoluble inequities.
          </p>
          <p>
           Just as the Hawke and Keating governments set Australia up for prosperity by managing our transition to the global economy in the 1980s and 1990s so we now have an opportunity to set up the next generation of prosperity by managing the transition to the digital economy. This work has already started. Under the economic leadership of my friend the Treasurer and his strong economic team this government is facing into our economic challenges and bringing Australians together to solve them. Under the leadership of the Minister for Industry and Science and the Minister for

           and the Minister for Education this government is recognising the immense contribution that new migrants make to Australia and ensuring that they fully participate in our economy.
          </p>
          <p>
           As this is the last first speech of the 47th Parliament I want to finish with some words to my fellow new members—the incoming class of 2022. It is an honour to be among you. You are individually so impressive, and collectively so representative. Your first speeches have been beautiful statements of vision and hope. I share your optimism for the possibilities of Australia's future. I share your determination to use every second of this opportunity to make a difference.
          </p>
          <p>
           Like me, many of you grew up in the 1980s and 1990s. Our grandparents had lived through the horror of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
            Second World War
           </a>
           and our parents had lived through the anxiety of the Cold War, but as we reached adulthood in the late 1990s the world seemed relatively peaceful. Democracy was on the march. Global poverty was in retreat. I remember at university our political science professors ventured to predict that we were experiencing what
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Fukuyama" rel="nofollow">
            Francis Fukuyama
           </a>
           called 'the end of history' in which every country would adopt democracy and freedom.
          </p>
          <p>
           Our generation came of age in this sunlit optimism of the new century, but now, a few decades later, we arrive in politics at a darker moment. In many nations liberal democracy is in retreat. Autocrats, tyrants and despots are on the march. Putin, Erdogan, Bolsonaro and Trump—it's as if the shadows of the 20th century are coming back to haunt us once more.

           Australia's democracy doesn't harbour such autocrats, but it is evident that faith in our democracy is down and belief in the power of politics is falling. Maybe, like me, you've experienced this firsthand—knocking on a constituent's door expecting to engage in another lively conversation about policies and ideas only to find the blank look of dissolution from an uninvolved young person or, very occasionally, to be shouted down by an angry conspiracy theorist. It's our overriding responsibility to fight against disillusionment and to build faith in government.

           I want to thank the Prime Minister and all of my colleagues for what they have already done to restore faith in our politics—by putting forward an integrity commission, by ending the pork barrelling, by leading through unity rather than division, and by proving that, yes, our democracy is strong enough to tackle our biggest challenges, like climate change. This is the leadership that will build faith in our politics. These actions are the antidote to disillusionment and the bulwark against encroaching autocracy.

           Finally, as the class of 22 our job is to take this forward. As

           said to our parents' generation: 'In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger.' Our generation is one of them. We have to rise to the moment.

            I thank the honourable member for Parramatta for his contribution. A member's first speech in this House is a memorable occasion. I remind those members in the chamber that if you're leaving the chamber please do so.
