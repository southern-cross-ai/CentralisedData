        This past week, Tropical Cyclone Winston hit Fiji and became the strongest storm on record in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere" rel="nofollow">
         Southern Hemisphere
        </a>
        . The storm has destroyed homes and crops and disrupted utilities, telecommunications and medical services. Reports are that whole villages have been flattened. Fiji's weather has since returned to normal, but the recovery effort has only just begun, with populations on outer islands in particular still struggling to make contact. The death toll has reached 29 and at least 14,000 people have been displaced. Many families are without homes and others are cut off from each other, unable to check the wellbeing of their loved ones. We have, of course, a significant Fijian community here in Australia, who are also struggling to make contact with families at home.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia has a very close relationship with Fiji, with 40,000 people of Fijian heritage living here. Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama has urged the people of Fiji to support each other during this difficult time, saying:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We will stand united in the face of this disaster. Please, if you see your neighbour struggling, help if you are able to.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Sydney Fijian community has done just that. The Sydney Fijian disaster relief group has mobilised very quickly and is working with the Fiji Consulate General to provide up-to-date information to the community. Many of my colleagues are supporting Fijian communities in their own electorates right now.

        is coordinating with telecommunications providers here in Australia to provide free phone calls to Fiji, for example. The government has offered $5 million in assistance to Fiji, and, of course, we welcome this initial package of assistance but expect that the government will do more over time. I would also like to acknowledge the Australian aid organisations and non-government organisations that are working on the ground in Fiji. These organisations have been on the front line of Australia's humanitarian response and are assisting with the delivery of Australia's $5 million package. Australians who are able to make a contribution to these organisations can. The

        , has provided links to Australian organisations that are running appeals on its website.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cyclone Winston serves as a reminder of why it is important that we have a strong aid program in our region, particularly in the Pacific region. We deliver $35 million per year in bilateral aid to Fiji. It is a good thing for that aid to be delivered by the Australian government, its officials and Australian aid organisations. Our thoughts continue to be with the people of Fiji at this very difficult time.
