       <p>
        Last Saturday evening I was delighted to attend the year 12 graduation of a school in my electorate,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minaret_College" rel="nofollow">
         Minaret College
        </a>
        , in Springvale, and witness 87 students, fine young Australians, complete their high school with a well-worn ritual. It does make you feel a little old to be there, but, as someone who recently survived year 12 again when my daughter finished a couple of years ago, I think they are wonderful occasionsâ€”seeing how excited and happy and emotional the students and indeed the parents are.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is an end but also a beginning. Transitions in life, of course, can be difficult times, whatever they are. Like the member for Chisholm, who just spoke, I also reminded the students that their ATAR score and their performance are a number, and it will not determine their life's courses. It may lead them on to a career, but most will have many careers. While there, I was also pleased to award a community spirit and leadership award to a student, Khaled Fares, for his work in the school and in the broader community.

        I acknowledge that Minaret College is an Islamic college. Indeed, it was founded in 1992, and it was the first Islamic college in south-east Melbourne. It serves the Muslim community and encourages and requires students to take an active part in the Australian community as Australian Muslims. I acknowledge the founder and director Mr Mohammed A Hassan
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , an esteemed leader and a gentle man, for his firm commitment to teaching students to live a peaceful existence as part of the wider community and to be proud of their heritage. Indeed, as the school clearly acknowledges, it is critically important in this time of growing extremism that we reach out to our Islamic community and engage them, including welcoming these students into adulthood.
