        I take this opportunity to update the House on several significant projects that the Liberal-National coalition has invested in to improve community infrastructure in the town of Yeppoon and the City of Rockhampton.
       </p>
       <p>
        Firstly, the summer break saw the soft launch of the multimillion dollar Yeppoon town centre car park. The multistorey facility is a key stage of supporting infrastructure to be built under the Yeppoon Foreshore and Town Centre Revitalisation Project. I am pleased to remind the House that the federal coalition government committed $10 million towards this revitalisation plan from the National Stronger Regions Fund. The car park will eventually take vehicles off the main beachfront, allowing that area to be used for other activities to attract more visitors and business opportunities along the Yeppoon esplanade. The car park opened just in time for the busy Christmas shopping season and peak

        holiday period. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livingstone_Shire_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Livingstone Shire Council
        </a>
        has made car parking at the new centre free, which will help to stimulate the local economy by encouraging more people to visit the redeveloped foreshore itself. The anticipated increased visitor numbers are expected to inject up to $6 million a year into the local economy and $60 million to the wider region.
       </p>
       <p>
        Meanwhile, I was also fortunate to attend the official opening of stage 1 of the Rockhampton Riverbank Revitalisation. The riverbank development will be a significant asset to the city when all stages have been completed. Every city has a focal point for visitors, and this will be the start of a revitalised Rockhampton. I am pleased the federal coalition government was able to contribute $7 million into the project, also from the National Stronger Regions Fund. The

        is a great, underutilised asset, and this project will enhance its value. What is also important is the development provides a blank canvas and opportunity for increased economic activity along the river and historic

        , which will help to create future jobs in the region.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have already seen a lot of investment in hotel apartments along the river foreshore, and Rockhampton is on the cusp of harnessing even more growth from its river precinct. Over many stages, advances at the river foreshore will make it a wonderful place to visit and will make us very proud of our city. Congratulations to all involved, and to the
