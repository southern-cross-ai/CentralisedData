        I rise to give notice that the little tiny party that I represent will be moving in the state parliament in Queensland for the introduction of ethanol. We will be moving exactly the same legislation that was moved by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
         LNP
        </a>
        when they were in opposition in Queensland. So in opposition they were all for ethanol but when they get into government they are against it—a rather fascinating proposition. It could only be termed cowardice and betrayal of your electorate if you say that you are for it and get up and give all the speeches. Our state leader has informed me that he will be standing up and giving the same speech that was given by the LNP spokesman when he was moving the legislation, when he was in opposition.
       </p>
       <p>
        But for an exercise in arch hypocrisy, I can assure the members of parliament representing ethanol areas that every one of their newspapers will be carrying an article saying: 'Are you, Mr Member of Parliament, going to vote for this legislation or not?' It is over to you. You have a state election on in five or six months time and let all the people know.
       </p>

        Why is this so relevant, particularly in the sugar industry areas and in the area of Dalby? Why is it so relevant? Because, as you are well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, in the sugar industry we get $420 a tonne if it goes into an ethanol stream; we only get $320 a tonne if it goes into a sugar stream. These figures are all available because the government has just completed the $2.5 million study, the Pentland Project—announced last week. It is the government's own figures I am quoting here.
       </p>
       <p>
        Why is every country on earth on ethanol? Every single one of the European Union countries signed up for 15 per cent. These places are all on ethanol: India; China; Indonesia; Thailand; Philippines; all of the Americas, with the exception of Venezuela; all of

        ; all of the

         South American

        countries. The entire world is on ethanol except for the oil producing countries and Africa and Australia. Why are they all doing it? The reason they are doing it is in this report.
