       <p>
        Today I rise to pay tribute to local and Australian hero Olive Weston and to give my sincere condolences to her loved ones following her death. Olive served as a nurse in World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , helping to treat over 23,000 troops in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        before applying her nursing skills to assist casualties of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearl_Harbor" rel="nofollow">
         Pearl Harbor
        </a>
        . Her impact and service were so great that her incredible story was told in her biography,

         </a>
         Nurse
        </i>
        . But her service did not stop there. Following the birth of her beloved son, Steven, Olive set about improving the conditions and attitudes that confronted people living with a disability. This led to her establishing Community Living Project, an important organisation that helps people living with a disability to live independently, and it continues to impact the lives of many this day. When I met Olive, she was passionate as ever about helping people with a disability. She also continued her lifelong work to improve the lives of others as an active advocate with the Port Noarlunga Christies Beach
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Indeed, Olive was the driving force behind the RSL launching what could have been one of the first ever honour rolls dedicated to nurses. I've previously spoken in this parliament about Olive's achievements, and I hope that she rests in peace. Her contribution to this country will never be forgotten.
