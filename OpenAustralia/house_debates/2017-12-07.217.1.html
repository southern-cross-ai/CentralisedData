       <p>
        ) ( ): Over the past few months, I've been able to work closely with many of the not-for-profit organisations and community groups that work within my community in Bass. Under the Stronger Communities Program, Bass, like every electorate, will benefit from $150,000 worth of funding both to help deliver social benefits and to improve community participation. Working with these groups to identify potential projects has emphasised to me yet again the enormous potential of our northern Tasmanian community and the fantastic work that is already occurring.
       </p>
       <p>
        For example, I visited
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Flinders Island
        </a>
        and met with Peter and other committee members from the Furneaux Islands Community Shed. The shed is a true community hub, contributing to interconnectivity, which is vitally important given the small population and remote nature of the island. Six thousand dollars of funding from the Stronger Communities Program will buy a new wood thicknesser for the shed, providing for more short course programs to be delivered to community members and adding many positive flow-on benefits.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've also worked with the Launceston
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCYC" rel="nofollow">
         PCYC
        </a>
        , hearing about their targeted youth programs aimed at providing early intervention for young people who are at risk of entering the youth justice system or at other risk of disadvantage. Operation Resilience is one such program, a drop-in functional style fitness program that allows for ninja style strength training and includes elements of martial arts and parkour. The Stronger Communities Program is funding much-needed equipment and infrastructure for this and other PCYC programs. The rationale behind Op Res is that physical activity reduces stress, anxiety and depression. By encouraging young people to exercise and by embedding this into youth support services, PCYC can positively impact on young people's lives. I would like to acknowledge the Launceston PCYC club manager, Kath Hawkins, for her enthusiasm, dedication and unwavering commitment to the club and to improving the outcomes for young people in northern Tasmania.
       </p>

        Another organisation is Interweave Arts. This is a local not-for-profit organisation that was also successful in its application for funding under the program. This community arts organisation offers ongoing creative arts programs to youth and people with a disability, with the aim of contributing to a more creative and inclusive community. Kim and the team at Interweave will create and establish a mini arts trial through Launceston's Inveresk Precinct, which will depict the local community's innovative and creative format. This is especially important in these exciting times with the expansion onto the site of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tasmania" rel="nofollow">
         University of Tasmania
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        So far, 17 fantastic projects in my electorate have been approved for funding under Stronger Communities. The impact of these not-for-profit organisations on local communities cannot be understated, and I eagerly look forward to all of these projects getting underway in the new year.
