       <p>
        On 6 March this year it will be
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Up_Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Clean Up Australia Day
        </a>
        . In my local community in Banks one of the most important gatherings will be at Yeramba Lagoon in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picnic_Point" rel="nofollow">
         Picnic Point
        </a>
        . Starting at 9 o'clock at Yeramba Lagoon, people will gather to clean up the lagoon and the surrounding area.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a great opportunity for people to get together to help beautify the lagoon and to remove rubbish and other debris. I would encourage local residents to help out if they have some time. They can find out more information at the website of Clean Up Australia Day at cleanupaustraliaday.org.au.
       </p>
       <p>
        Elsewhere in my electorate there will be other Clean Up Australia Day activities. At Harvey Dixon Park in Peakhurst, at Jinna Reserve in Peakhurst as well, at Banksia Place in Lugarno and at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oatley_Pleasure_Grounds" rel="nofollow">
         Oatley Pleasure Grounds
        </a>
        . Riverwood Men's Shed will be conducting some activities down at Little
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_Pan_Creek" rel="nofollow">
         Salt Pan Creek
        </a>
        , where we have had a very successful
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Green Army
        </a>
        project in Padstow, and there will be activities at Cutting Reserve in Padstow as well. So wherever people are across the Banks electorate I would certainly encourage them to get involved in Clean Up Australia Day.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the great activities of the government at present, of course, is the Stronger Communities Program. Recently, Canterbury council was successful in receiving $20,000 in funding for a shadecloth in the playground down at Salt Pan Creek Reserve. It is exposed to the sun down there and it gets very hot. This provision of $20,000 of funding, which we have been able to secure from the federal government, will go a long way towards helping local families to make more use of the reserve down there at Salt Pan Creek. I am very pleased that we were able to secure that funding.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the great sporting organisations of my electorate is the Oatley Rugby Club. It plays and trains down at Evatt Park in Lugarno. They field teams from under-sixes right through to under-21s and open-age teams. I attended their executive committee meeting on 18 January, where I met with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Rice" rel="nofollow">
         Richard Rice
        </a>
        and other members of that committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the issues at Evatt Park is that there is no lighting in the car park. This is a concern because, especially if you have young children participating in training and evening sessions, it is important that lighting is provided. I am calling on Hurstville council to act and to provide lighting. I would certainly assist the council in seeking funding through the Stronger Communities Program to do that.
