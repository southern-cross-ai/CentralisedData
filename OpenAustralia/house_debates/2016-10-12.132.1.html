        I rise today to talk about a wonderful event I attended on the weekend in my electorate and to pay tribute to those people that organised the event—that was the Cyprus Community Festival, which was organised by their committee. I would like to pay tribute to Christos Ioannou, the former president, who has served the committee for many years; to the new president, Andreas Evdokiou, who has just taken the reins; and to all those involved in the festival. It was attended by thousands on the weekend—many of whom found themselves in Australia as refugees after 1974.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1974, as we all know, the island of Cyprus was occupied—and 37 per cent of that island still remains occupied. Since then, a so-called state has been declared, but it has been recognised by only one nation in the entire world—and it just happens, ironically, to be the nation that invaded in 1974. There are still 1,619 people missing. These people are mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters, sons and daughters. We have, in that 37 per cent of the island, homes where the owners have not been allowed to return. They are still not allowed to return, and 42 years is far too long to still be waiting for a solution.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        resolutions have been called for, basically having the same principle: respect for the human rights of all the people of the island. Here in Australia, we can play a role, and many members have raised this issue, and many of my colleagues in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        n parliament have also raised the issue. When you travel to Cyprus, as I have many times, both as an individual and as part of parliamentary delegations representing this parliament, it is an absolute tragedy to see the situation that exists over there. I have gone along the green line, the demilitarised zone, that divides the island. I have spoken with the Australian UN peacekeeping people that have been there over the years, including the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Federal Police
        </a>
        , who have made such a wonderful contribution to patrolling this zone since 1974. We can play a bigger and better role. Of course, we can raise this issue here in this parliament. Most importantly, Australia can play a role in providing for the implementation of UN resolutions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many people attended the community festival on the weekend, including the Treasurer of South Australia; Senator Nick Xenophon; many state MPs; and the mayor, Angela Evans, and they all had the same view—that 42 years is way too long. I know that talks have been taking place recently between the two communities and different nations that have an involvement. We all hope for a solution very soon.
