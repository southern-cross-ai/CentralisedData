       <p>
        Growing up, for a teenager, is never easy. Kids can be very cruel to their peers. But, for young Australians who are gay, it is even tougher, with bullying and worse a daily reality. Every child in Australia has the right to be safe at school.
       </p>
       <p>
        Safe Schools is an antibullying program. It is a voluntary program. Schools choose to opt in. Five hundred and thirty-three schools have freely chosen to opt in. Thirty-two schools have signed up since the Prime Minister announced his review—more than one a day. When it comes to the welfare of our children, if I have to choose between the teachers, principals and school counsellors of Australia, and the rabid ideologues of the Liberal-National party, I will choose Australian teachers and schools every time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Turnbull has a very simple choice here—to stand with the great majority of Australians or with a small, right-wing fringe. Today we will see how scared he is of his Liberal Party. We know that he is scared; it is just a matter of how scared. Mr Turnbull is learning a very old lesson right now: when you give in to a bully, they come back wanting more. When you give into the bullies of the extreme Right, they come back wanting more. It is time for Mr Turnbull to stand up for vulnerable young teenagers. Mr Turnbull, stop following your party; start leading it.
