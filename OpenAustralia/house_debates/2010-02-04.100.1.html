        I want to speak today about a forthcoming event in my electorate: namely, the 2011

        </a>
        , Sailing World Championships. This prestigious regatta will be held in December next year and will involve 1,400 competitors from around the world in addition to thousands of officials and spectators. These championships will constitute the main qualifier for the sailing component of the 2012

        , and this will be an event of great sporting and sports tourism significance.
       </p>

        Fremantle is a place of special maritime and sailing heritage. It is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        ’s principal port. This has been the point of arrival for tens of thousands of migrants who have made Fremantle—and indeed Australia—the multicultural success that it is today. It is a city that loves to play host and does so with a great generosity of spirit and style. And, to top it all, our coast offers some of the best sailing conditions in the world. For all of these reasons, it is no surprise that Fremantle was selected in 2007 from a group of eight cities around the world bidding for the right to host this event.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last December it was my pleasure to join the Minister for Sport at an event in Fremantle to announce federal government funding for the ISAF event of $8.6 million through the national partnership agreement on health services. This contribution will fund Olympic-class boats, race management equipment, and training for volunteers and officials. It will also support the Emerging Nations Program, which exists to give sailors from less advanced sailing nations the opportunity to be involved in competition at the highest level. Our first regatta for those competitors took place last December and the next regatta will be held on the weekend of 19 and 20 February this year. These preparatory events follow and are related to a series of intensive training camps which have involved 40 sailors from 30 emerging sailing nations.

        I wholeheartedly applaud the fact that John Longley has been chosen as the event director of the ISAF 2011 Sailing World Championships. John was a grinder aboard

John’s commitment to Fremantle, his passion for and involvement in sailing and his expertise make him the perfect person for the role of event director of the 2011

        in Fremantle.
       </p>
       <p>
        This Olympic qualifying international regatta will be a fantastic opportunity for Fremantle. I am very pleased that the federal government is supporting this event to such a significant degree, and I look forward to working with John and the event team, with the
