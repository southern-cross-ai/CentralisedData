       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill supplements the International Interests in Mobile Equipment (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Town" rel="nofollow">
         Cape Town
        </a>
        Convention) Bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of the bill is to make minor changes to the Air Services Act 1995, the Civil Aviation Act 1988 and the Personal Property Securities Act 2009.
       </p>
       <p>
        These changes are necessary to help facilitate Australia's accession to the Cape Town convention and protocol.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Air Services Act 1995 provides for unpaid service charges from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airservices_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Airservices Australia
        </a>
        to be recorded as a statutory lien against an aircraft.
       </p>
       <p>
        These statutory liens have priority over a claim registered with Australia's Personal Property Security Register if the statutory lien was recorded first.
       </p>
       <p>
        The statutory lien also has priority over any other claims over the aircraft.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposed changes to the Air Services Act 1995 preserve this priority ranking system.
       </p>
       <p>
        The statutory lien will have priority over interests registered under the Cape Town convention, provided that the statutory lien was recorded first.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is, where a statutory lien has been recorded under the Air Services Act before a party registers its security interest under Cape Town convention's international registry, the statutory lien will have priority.
       </p>
       <p>
        This approach is consistent with treatment of these charges under the current personal properties framework.
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendments to the Civil Aviation Act 1988 will allow functions to be conferred on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Aviation_Safety_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         Civil Aviation Safety Authority
        </a>
        in relation to the operation of the Cape Town convention.
       </p>
       <p>
        Specifically,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CASA" rel="nofollow">
         CASA
        </a>
        will be requested to record, remove and exercise irrevocable deregistration and export request authorisations, which is one of the remedies available under the Cape Town convention.
       </p>
       <p>
        The IDERAs will ensure that an aircraft cannot legally be flown to another country to avoid recovery of the asset.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lastly, the bill will include a provision in the Personal Property Securities Act 2009 to note that the Cape Town convention will prevail over the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPS" rel="nofollow">
         PPS
        </a>
        Act to the extent that an inconsistency applies.
       </p>
       <p>
        When the PPS Act was first established, it was intended as a 'one-stop shop' for the creation and enforcement of security interests in personal property.
       </p>
       <p>
        By including a provision in the PPS Act, we're increasing transparency for holders of a security interest in an aircraft asset to let them know that the Cape Town convention exists and that it has primacy over the PPS Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the bill to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
