        Tonight I rise to pay tribute to Redhead Public School, which is celebrating its centenary this year. On Saturday night I attended a ball with a long-term resident of Redhead, and I must say that it was a very successful night. One of the highlights of the evening was a donation by the Miners Trust of $100,000 to the school for a hall. This year is a pretty special year for Redhead because it also marks the centenary of their surf club, and the members of the community in Redhead are all joining together to celebrate these two very special occasions.

        Redhead is a unique little place within the Shortland electorate. It is one of those places that has been able to maintain their identity and village atmosphere. Initially, a settlement was set up at Redhead as a banana plantation but it soon established itself as a very strong mining area. It is only appropriate that the miners have got behind Redhead Public School and supported it in the year of its centenary. I need to put on record the fine contribution to public education that has been made by Redhead Public School over the last 100 years.
