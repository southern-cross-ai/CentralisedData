        I recently had the opportunity to join in with the Springbrook community at the official dedication of the Springbrook Centenary Parklands and book launch of
        <i>
         North from Cobargo

        , the history of the Springbrook settlement, which was written by

        . And what a celebration—the rain stopped, the sun shone, the band played and the tight-knit community and special guests came together as one on this very special day.

          I certainly did! The year 2006 will be a year that will be long remembered by Springbrook residents as a time of celebration and acknowledgment of the contributions of the families who shaped the character of the mountain over the past 100 years. Last week’s dedication and book launch was just one of the celebrations planned for this year. There are a host of events planned for the remainder of the year—cricket matches, concerts with
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normie_Rowe" rel="nofollow">
           Normie Rowe
          </a>
          and

           John Williamson
          </a>
          , an art exhibition, a ball and a bush dance. These are wonderful opportunities for the local community to come together as one. It is truly going to be a happy 100th birthday for Springbrook.
         </p>

          Councillor Ted Shepherd paid tribute to the families who shaped the mountain. Ray Cavanough, the President of the Springbrook Mountain Community Association, spoke about the importance of the centenary and what the mountain and the community meant to him and his wife, Di. The commemoration of the parklands was celebrated with the unveiling of a plaque, and I would like to put on record the words on the plaque:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          This area of parkland was named to commemorate the centenary of the establishment of Springbrook. The first group of settlers arrived in Springbrook in 1906, having travelled from the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
           New South Wales
          </a>
          south coast and making their way up the Springbrook plateau by a rough bush track.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          This followed a survey by
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AH" rel="nofollow">
           AH
          </a>
          Burbank, which resulted in the land originally gazetted as timber reserves, being offered for selection under the terms of the special agricultural selections acts 1901 to 1904. The area was originally named Springwood. However, this became confused with Springwood in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains" rel="nofollow">
           Blue Mountains
          </a>
          and the term Springbrook was adopted in 1907.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          The early settlers spent many backbreaking years clearing tracts of dense rainforest to create the dairy pastures that were to later become the lifeblood of this mountain community.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          This park commemorates 100 years of settlement and recognises the contribution made by these

           Gold Coast

          pioneers and their descendants in creating the unique and enviable community of modern day Springbrook.
         </p>
         <p>
          This short history of Springbrook on the plaque will ensure that the evolution of Springbrook and its name will not be forgotten: the plaque will be a long-time reminder of the past and the early pioneers. The

          council and, in particular, Councillor Ted Shepherd were instrumental in ensuring that the book
          <i>
           North from Cobargo
          </i>
          was published.

           Rod Campbell
          </a>
          , addressed the gathering on stories told by Robin about the mountain and the process that Robin went through in writing the book and what it meant to him. The stories were fascinating—truly inspiring—about a community that is still strong and very tight-knit even today. There was a magnificent display of memorabilia in the Springbrook Community Hall and of course a very large cake to cut, which was enjoyed by all who attended the special ceremony.
         </p>

          There are many people involved with the centenary celebrations. In fact, there is a committee of dedicated people who are organising the events and doing the fundraising to ensure the events are a success. Some of those people are John Craufurd, Anne McInnes, Anne Butler, Barbara Eldred, Graham and Patricia Hardy, Don Weir, Malcolm McInnes, Lynne Head-Weir, Pam Hall and Barbara Dungavell—so many people who are giving so much to ensure the success of the centenary celebrations. Jane and Colin Crisp have produced a visitors guide to Springbrook, an illustrated guide to Springbrook’s parks, walks and wildlife. This book is Jane and Colin’s contribution to the centenary.
         </p>

          There is no doubt that Springbrook is a very special part of the world; it is a very special part of my electorate and a place I do not visit often enough, but the people who make up this community always make me feel very welcome, and I was delighted to celebrate this special commemorative day with so many of them. I look forward to reading the book
          <i>
           North from Cobargo
          </i>
          and learning more about the history of the mountain, the early pioneers, the families who came to the mountain and who stayed and built a prosperous and special community under the tall, majestic trees which provided food and shelter in the beginning. To all the people on the mountain, to the centenary committee and to the Springbrook Mountain Community Association, my best wishes to you all for a wonderful 2006 centenary celebration.
