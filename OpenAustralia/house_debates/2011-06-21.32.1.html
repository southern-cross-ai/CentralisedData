        My question is to the Treasurer. I refer to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry's assessment that the impact of your government's carbon dioxide tax will be 'widespread, cascading throughout the economy, adding to inflationary pressures, diminishing competitiveness and reducing earnings across a large number of businesses'. Will the Treasurer guarantee that no small business will be worse off as a result of his government's carbon dioxide tax. And, Treasurer, isn't the Gillard government guilty of being all hypocrisy and no democracy when it comes to its carbon dioxide tax?

         I thank the member for his question, because this is an important reform for the Australian economy. It is an important reform so that we can continue to generate jobs for the future. It is an important reform to make sure that we increase our prosperity in future years. What we do know from all of the reports that we have received and, indeed, from the practice in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealand
         </a>
         is that we can introduce a price on carbon pollution and do it in such a way whereby the economy continues to grow, incomes continue to grow and jobs continue to grow. Those on that side of the House are just intent on running a baseless scare campaign about a price on carbon pollution. Because they are such a policy-free zone, they do not have the wit to come to grips with or grasp the importance of such a substantial reform like this.
        </p>
        <p>
         There was a time in our political life where those on that side of the House did front up and did support some big reforms which were essential to our prosperity, including the big reforms of the eighties and the ninetiesâ€”the floating of the dollar, the bringing down of the tariff wall and enterprise bargaining. Although I note that they most certainly did not support one of the most fundamental reforms, which was superannuation reform. They said that would bring down the house, burning. During the global financial crisis we saw how important that reform was to financial stability within our economy. We know that this can be done and done in a way whereby our economy continues to grow. We also know that it does bring challenges and we also know that business is under pressure. We understand that many businesses are under pressure from the high Australian dollar, for example. But we understand that if we make this reform we will continue to generate jobs. We also understand the fact that the cost of not acting is far higher than the cost of acting. Those opposite would want to delay action in this area and therefore ensure a much harsher adjustment down the track. We are doing the sensible thing that so many other countries around the world are doing and that, indeed, they are doing in New Zealand. We heard it yesterday. I have never seen a more disgraceful performance in this House than we saw from the Leader of the Opposition yesterday.

           Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the Treasurer was asked a question about the impact of a carbon tax on small business. He is now debating every other subject beside that question. I ask you to draw him back to the question he was asked.

             </a>
             was here yesterday to be welcomed to this parliament by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. In his welcome, the Leader of the Opposition proved that he is unfit for high office, because he chose to politicise that event in a way that was absolutely damaging. He is not fit for high office, and he is not up to the task of putting in place the fundamental reforms we need to support employment in our economy.
