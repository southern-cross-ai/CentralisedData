       <p>
        I am happy to report that in recent weeks we have completed a number of projects in my electorate of Bass, with others being rolled out that will make a real difference to my community of northern Tasmania.
       </p>
       <p>
        Earlier this month I travelled to Derby to congratulate participants in our latest
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Green Army
        </a>
        project—one of 10 in my electorate. Green Army teams have improved the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamar_River" rel="nofollow">
         Tamar River
        </a>
        waterfront near Launceston and the coastal environment near Bridport. This latest effort at Derby focused on weed eradication and tree planting at the site of the federal government's $2.5 million investment in the world-class Blue Derby mountain bike trails. Through their dedication and hard work over the last six months, the members of the Derby Green Army team have made a valuable contribution to this important tourism destination.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last month I also had the privilege of opening the rejuvenated Invermay Park sporting facility—a $2.1 million upgrade that has helped stimulate the local economy. The federal government's contribution of $1.25 million was an election promise, and it was pleasing to re-open one of Launceston's traditional sporting precincts—a ground where former Australian cricket captain
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricky_Ponting" rel="nofollow">
         Ricky Ponting
        </a>
        first made his mark. The new all-weather playing surface, improved drainage and new lighting means we have a sporting facility to support the next generation of Tasmanian sporting champions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Earlier this month I was also pleased to host parliament's Defence Subcommittee on its inspection of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Science" rel="nofollow">
         Defence Science
        </a>
        and Technology Organisation facility at Scottsdale. There is valuable work being done at this facility, which produces rations for our troops. One of the projects I have championed is examining the potential of microwave assisted thermal sterilisation, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MATS" rel="nofollow">
         MATS
        </a>
        , technology. We are looking into MATS in association with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Tasmania" rel="nofollow">
         University of Tasmania
        </a>
        , particularly its potential to produce better-tasting packaged foods in minutes rather than hours. I believe
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSTO" rel="nofollow">
         DSTO
        </a>
        Scottsdale is well placed to capitalise on MATS technology for potential applications beyond Defence's requirements. I have written previously on leveraging what we do at Scottsdale to produce a food-response option for humanitarian assistance and disaster-relief contingencies.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am also very pleased to report that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        rollout in Tasmania is currently the most advanced of any state or territory when it comes to connectability. This demonstrates how effectively we addressed the huge problems with the NBN at the time of the 2013 election. At that time, the NBN had ground to a halt and was in deep trouble. Only 32,000 Tasmanian households had fibre running in their streets—a very poor return for three elections of big but undelivered promises by Labor.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the 2013 election, I am pleased to say that NBN connections in Tasmania have tripled to over 100,000 premises, 73,000 of which have an active fixed line footprint and 27,000 homes and businesses in smaller towns can now access superfast wireless. Thirteen thousand premises have been added to the network footprint in 2015 alone. By any measure, that is a dramatic turnaround. Construction in Launceston is scheduled to finish by August 2016, which will make Launceston one of the very first cities in Australia to be fully networked.
       </p>
       <p>
        The small-business feedback in my electorate is also increasingly positive. I spent a day in Scottsdale, last Friday, talking to many small businesses. Max Rainsford, who owns Red Dirt Cycle Company, reports much improved business conditions, particularly after we opened the Blue Derby mountain bike trails. Mary and Murray Partridge, proprietors of Cottage Bakeries, tell me that trade in recent months is so much better and there is a real optimism in the north-east. These comments are typical of what I am encountering in this beautiful region of my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will continue doing everything possible to help grow that sense of optimism. The coalition's $60 million commitment to new irrigation schemes, for example, will deliver 95 per cent water certainty to rights holders in the Scottsdale region. The $6m
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         North Bank
        </a>
        project will help rejuvenate the Launceston riverfront. The job-creating benefits of the $24 million co-investment fund we announced with the Hodgman government last month will also soon be rolled out. Successful applicants are required to put in $2 for every $1 provided from the fund, which will leverage $72 million in job-creating projects for Tasmania. Tasmania's future is looking increasingly positive and I look forward to keeping the parliament informed of its progress.
