        Today I wish to speak about an issue of great importance to Australian women. Ovarian cancer is one of the most lethal gynaecological cancers, yet often little is known of it in our community. I am honoured to have been appointed as one of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovarian_Cancer" rel="nofollow">
         Ovarian Cancer
        </a>
        Australia's national ambassadors. Last week I helped launch Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month with Ovarian Cancer Australia's patron,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicole_Livingstone" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and the board of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCA" rel="nofollow">
         OCA
        </a>
        The awareness month culminates in Teal Ribbon Day on 29 February. Purchasing a teal ribbon or participating in an 'Afternoon Teal' will raise valuable funds for research into ovarian cancer as well as fund important support for women and their families.

       <p>
        Over 1,200 women will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer this year. A staggering 800 of those women will lose their battle with the disease. The outcomes for women diagnosed with ovarian cancer are generally poor, as three-quarters of ovarian cancers are advanced at the time of diagnosis. Ovarian cancer does not discriminate. While having a family history of ovarian cancer increases your risk, 90 to 95 per cent of all ovarian cancers occur in women who do not have a family history. Ovarian cancer can occur in any woman, but the risk increases in women over 50 years of age. Alarmingly, 40 per cent of women incorrectly believe ovarian cancer has no symptoms. Because there are no early-detection tests it is often thought that ovarian cancer is a silent killer. However, that is not the case. Ovarian cancer does manifest itself through a number of symptoms. I urge anybody who is interested in receiving further information to log onto my website or the Ovarian Cancer Australia website.
