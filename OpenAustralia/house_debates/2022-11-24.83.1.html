        Despite some poorly spelled late-night tweets from the former Premier Jeff Kennett, who shut down schools in Victoria, on this side of the House and in the Victorian Labor government we've turned the public schools in Macnamara into places of excellence. When walking into the halls of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elwood_College" rel="nofollow">

        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Park" rel="nofollow">

        college or even

        </a>
        , you can't help seeing the investment and the difference that a Labor government makes. To drive around Macnamara is to drive around without passing over level crossings, thanks to the Andrews Labor government, which got rid of level crossings and consigned them to the bin of history, where they belong. And, of course, the Andrews Labor government are going to bring back the

        , putting electricity back into public hands. Whereas those opposite shut down schools and were privatising electricity, the Andrews Labor government is going to lead not only Victoria but our nation and the world on renewable energies. It is a very, very big difference compared to the bigoted, antisemitic conspiracy theorists that those opposite and their mates in Victoria are hanging out withâ€”and not just hanging with but preselecting, as well as preferencing them in the upper house. It has been a long and sorry line of people that the Liberal Party have been associating with.

        I wish the best to Nina Taylor in Albert Park, Lior Harel in Caulfield,

        in Brighton and Wesa Chau in Prahran, four outstanding Labor candidates as part of an outstanding Labor team. I wish them all well for the re-election of the Andrews Labor government on Saturday.
