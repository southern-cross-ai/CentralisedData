       <p>
        I too want to take the opportunity to recognise the work of some hardworking community members and community groups who recently held functions on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        for the benefit of local citizens in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarra_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Yarra Valley
        </a>
        in the federal electorate of Casey. I will start with Wandin Rotary, which, every year, has an Australia Day breakfast, which has gone from strength to strength, all with the aim of people meeting on Australia Day to celebrate Australia’s history and values and to raise money for important community projects in the Wandin area.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to pay tribute to the president,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angus_McDonald" rel="nofollow">
         Angus McDonald
        </a>
        , to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Parker" rel="nofollow">
         Kevin Parker
        </a>
        , to Keith Corbett, to Peter Manders and to the whole team at Wandin Rotary, who do so much for so many right throughout the year, but I particularly pay tribute to them for their efforts on Australia Day, which brought 250 people from the community together in the local town hall to raise money for important things in the Wandin community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to make mention of Monbulk Rotary, which, also on Australia Day, had an official flag-raising at a flagpole that they fully funded themselves as part of the 100th anniversary of Rotary. Over the course of the year they raised the money in the Monbulk community to construct a flagpole in the centre of town to have a flag-raising ceremony on Australia Day in the town centre, with many local people present. I want to pay tribute to Des Cox, the president, and to Gary Jans, for all their work in Monbulk Rotary; and to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Bennett" rel="nofollow">
         Paul Bennett
        </a>
        and John Surridge, from the Monbulk
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        , for the work that they do right throughout the year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last but not least I want to pay tribute to the local cricket clubs from around the Croydon, Lilydale and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonga_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Wonga Park
        </a>
        area who put together a 20/20 cricket challenge on Australia Day with the express benefit of raising money for two RSLs—the Lilydale and Croydon RSLs. You could not think of anything more Australian than a cricket match between local cricketers in 41 degree heat, as it was in Melbourne, all for charity for the local RSLs. To Alan Bailey, who did so much to put that together, and to all the players from local clubs, a big pat on the back for a wonderful initiative that started last year that I am sure will also grow from strength to strength in the years to come.
