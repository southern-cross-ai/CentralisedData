        Last Friday, 20 March, was the

         National Day
        </a>
        of Action Against Bullying and Violence, and I was privileged to spend the morning with students and teachers at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wadalba_Community_School" rel="nofollow">
         Wadalba Community School
        </a>
        , who were celebrating
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harmony_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Harmony Day
        </a>
        . These two days share a lot in common. Both promote inclusiveness and tolerance.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Across_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        , a total of 1,974 schools and 882,435 students participated in the National Day of Action Against Bullying and Violence.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a member of parliament, I have spoken about the need to take a stand against bullying and violence. I was proud to support the Enhancing Online Safety For Children Bill, and I welcome the appointment of Alastair MacGibbon as our nation's first ever Children's e-Safety Commissioner. This is an important element of enhancing the security and safety of Australian children online and in our community. Approximately one in four Australian students in years 4 to 9 report being bullied. Around one in five young Australians aged eight to 17 experience online bullying, with those aged between 10 and 15 most likely to be involved. Sadly, young people can be reluctant to report bullying, for reasons including shame, concerns and belief they should be able to manage it themselves.
       </p>
       <p>
        The National Day of Action Against Bullying and Violence provides a focus for schools to come together to support a strong message in our school communities: that bullying and violence are not okay at any time. We must work together to lend a hand of support to those who are victims of bullying and violence, with a view to eliminating the horrific consequences that come with prolonged bullying and violence.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst visiting Wadalba Community School, I spoke with year 12 student Jake, and Jake shared with me his experience of bullying at school. I was surprised to learn that Jake, who was a positive and vibrant young man, had experienced bullying. Jake explained how he had been bullied and called names because he was outgoing and friendly to all of his fellow students. Jake told me: 'There is so much pressure on how you dress and look. The bullying led to anxiety, and I did not want to leave home.'
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the most alarming things Jake said was that most of the bullying does not happen at school; it happens at home. This is due to the impact of the internet and other technological advances such as smartphones. In 2011, the use of social media was identified as the primary form of digital communication between young people aged 13 and over. It is estimated that 463,000 Australian children and young people per year are exposed to cyberbullying, and this equates to approximately 1,272 every day.

        , Wadalba Community School's student support officer, advised me of how her school is striving to provide support for students who may be experiencing bullying, either online or in the schoolyard. This includes a school website which contains links to how to deal with bullying, advice for students, and a mechanism to report instances of bullying within the school community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last Friday I also met with Katina Astles, Better Buddies program coordinator with the Alannah and Madeline Foundation. I am a strong supporter of the Better Buddies Program, and I am pleased to be able to support Brooke Avenue Public School in my electorate with this great initiative. Katina and I discussed the need to tackle bullying in schools and provide sufficient support and resources to equip parents, teachers and students in this cause.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Alannah and Madeline Foundation provide a range of excellent tools and resources to protect children. Better Buddies helps students entering their first year of primary school to feel safe, valued and connected to the school community. The school pairs new primary students with an older student buddy to help them through the difficult transition into school and, at Brooke Avenue, the kindergarten students all are supplied with a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddy_Bear" rel="nofollow">
         Buddy Bear
        </a>
        when they commence school. Another initiative supporting children who are victims of violence is Buddy Bags, which provide basic, essential items to children in emergency accommodation, including comfort items such as a book and a teddy bear. Katina advised me that restoring a sense of safety and security into children's lives during a traumatic time is one of the first steps to recovery, and Buddy Bags help to make this transition a little easier.
       </p>
       <p>
        Importantly, Katina shared this government's view that it is essential that we provide greater support to children engaging in an online environment. The eSmart Digital Licence is an online challenge which uses quizzes, videos and games to prepare Australian children aged 10 and over to be smart, safe and responsible digital citizens. This eSmart Digital Licence builds upon this government's establishment of the Children's e-Safety Commissioner, as well as the Alannah and Madeline Foundation's eSmart schools, which operate in over 2,200 schools nationwide.
       </p>
       <p>
        In conclusion, I would like to acknowledge the work of Katina and the dedicated teachers engaged in this program at Wadalba and Brooke Avenue, and all those who dedicate their time and efforts to keeping our children safe from bullying and violence.
