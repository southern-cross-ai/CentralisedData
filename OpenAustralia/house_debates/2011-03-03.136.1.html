        I rise today to speak on a very important topic. The historic reshaping of several
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
         Middle East
        </a>
        ern powers in the last couple of weeks and the ongoing issues in that part of the world are timely reminders of the significance of this region to our lives. There is no doubt that the events still occurring in Egypt, Tunisia, Libya and potentially other countries in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_and_North_Africa" rel="nofollow">
         Middle East and North Africa
        </a>
        are historic. The events remind us of the innate desire for freedom that drives us all and the willingness of people to sacrifice for that freedom.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a member of this great institution, our own symbol of freedom, I commend those who seek to establish their own version of democracy in their own countries. We should do what we can to support these people in their fight. However, when significant change occurs we must remind ourselves that we need vigilance. The uprisings in this region will have short- and long-term repercussions that we as policy makers must consciously consider. For instance, there will be a short-term impact on petrol prices that will be felt throughout our economy. But it is the potential longer term consequences to which I believe we must turn our attention.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the most important stabilisers in the Middle East in recent years was the 1979 peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. It has been and remains a vital element in ensuring that large-scale conflict has been avoided in this region. It is an agreement that we must ensure survives the recent upheaval in Egypt—because its survival is not assured.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1979, a popular revolt in Iran overthrew an autocrat, but of course the popular revolt was eventually hijacked by extremists. The same extremists continue to threaten world security today. There is no doubt that there are some in Egypt, backed by the silent hand of Tehran, who wish to bring the same type of Islamic extremism to power in that country. We must ensure that this does not happen.
       </p>
       <p>
        While it is unlikely that an Iranian-backed extremist will gain control in Egypt, we must be vigilant. Australia is a great friend of Israel, and it should remain a great friend of Israel. While there are some on the far left in Australian politics who will continue to seek to demonise the people of Israel, I will stand with our friends to support their right to exist in peace and their right to have the security that we often take for granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ultimately we must remember that we shared the battle against the same deranged strain of Islamic extremism that has killed Australians in Bali, in Afghanistan and in other parts of the world. Indeed, many of our young Australians continue to fight against some of these people in Afghanistan today.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is Iran’s stated policy aim to push Israel into the sea. Iran is led by a regime which, even in the face of united, concerted, international opposition, continues to pursue an aggressive nuclear program. If their pursuit of this nuclear program is successful, it will bring massive instability to this region and to our world. It will undoubtedly have an impact on us. It is a program that I believe must never come to fruition. The risk that Iran continues to present underlines why it is essential that modern Egypt and other
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Eastern" rel="nofollow">
         Middle Eastern
        </a>
        powers do not fall into the hands of these extremists. This is not just a threat to our friends Israel; it is a threat to our free world.
       </p>
       <p>
        I believe Australian policy must maintain consistency and strong support for Israel. It concerns me when senior members of the government float ideas that suggest our support for our friends in Israel is not rock-solid. While some on the lunatic Left fringe, like the Greens-controlled
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marrickville_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Marrickville Council
        </a>
        , will continue their campaign against Israel, it is vital that the bipartisan support for Israel does not waver.
       </p>
       <p>
        I support democracy in the Middle East. Any movement towards free and open democracy is to be supported. But we must be vigilant against the risks of extremists hijacking these movements. We must continue to show our strong resolve and our support for our friends in Israel, because their fight with extremists is our fight with extremists. I urge the House to maintain the necessary resolve to ensure our ongoing security.
