       <p>
        I rise today to update the House on some great schools in my electorate that have been recent recipients of the government's Capital Grants Program. The Turnbull government is providing higher levels of school funding than ever before—a record of $73.6 billion in total funding, over the forward estimates, in all states and territories. That represents a growth in funding from $16 billion this year to $20.1 billion in 2020.
       </p>
       <p>
        This government recognises the importance of providing and improving school capital infrastructure. These grants from the Capital Grants Program ensure attention is given to refurbishment and upgrading of capital infrastructure for existing students, while also making provisions for needs arising from new demographics and enrolment trends. The non-government schools sector takes a strong interest in these grants and regard the program as an essential component of the Australian government's support for their schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just recently, two schools in my electorate were awarded funds under the Capital Grants Program. The first was St Maria Goretti's Catholic School, which will receive $457,000 to construct a new covered assembly area, a new lift and multi-purpose rooms. They will also refurbish existing learning areas and the canteen. This money will also be used to extend the existing library.
       </p>

        The Kewdale campus of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Islamic_College" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Islamic College
        </a>
        will receive $235,000 for their construction of four general learning areas and two multi-purpose rooms. These construction and refurbishment projects take into account the latest education research and will see students learn more effectively and be inspired by their new facilities. I am looking forward to seeing these projects completed.
       </p>

        Two weeks ago, I officially opened the new classrooms at Fountain College, thanks to the Capital Grants Program. I was more than happy to represent the education minister and my colleague the member for Tangney,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Morton" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , whose electorate Fountain College is actually in. Before the boundary redistribution, Fountain College was in my electorate so I know how great a school it is.
       </p>
       <p>
        The secular school is very impressive. After we officially opened the new classrooms, I was given a tour of the school's lab, where students showed me some of their robotic projects. There was a music machine, an electronic ball you had to get through a maze and even a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubik's_Cube" rel="nofollow">
         Rubik's Cube
        </a>
        -solving robot, which solved a Rubik's Cube in 100 seconds. What was more impressive, though, was the student who made that project: she could solve the Rubik's Cube faster than the robot.
       </p>
       <p>
        Before I finish, I want to publicly congratulate two students from Fountain College whom I presented awards to: firstly, Esra Savran for her citizenship, leadership and philanthropy work—I can see a bright future for her in politics—and secondly, to Hadi Mohd Fairouz, a year 2 student who finished first in
