        I rise to pay tribute to Dr Richard
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson" rel="nofollow">

        . Richard was a loving husband to Lucy, a dedicated father to John and Jane, a respected doctor, an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">

        member and an incredibly loyal friend. Richard was eminently pragmatic in his approach to his politics and fought hard for his principles. He didn't suffer fools or foolish policy. His involvement in the Galileo movement against the carbon tax demonstrated his conviction approach to his politics. Richard was active in the Noosa community both as a founding member of the Sunshine Beach Surf Life Saving Club and as a member of the Tewantin Noosa Golf Club.

       <p>
        When a scan revealed stage 4 lung cancer, Richard was given four months to live. Never one to shy from a fight, he demanded the cancer be cut out. Two years later he took the same approach when cancerous growth was found in his pelvic bone. Despite fighting hard through a range of treatments, he passed away at home. Richard was in a frail state when I last saw him in his Tewantin garden. He was building a flagpole for an Australian flag I had given him. His determination to build that flagpole while so unwell will forever remain with me, reminding me of his patriotism and willingness to fight the good fight.
