        I am particularly pleased to say that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jessica_Watson" rel="nofollow">
         Jessica Watson
        </a>
        has well and truly completed two-thirds of her journey around the world and is on her way home. The teenage adventurer from Buderim on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Sunshine Coast
        </a>
        has shown immense courage, strength and determination in pursuit of her dream to be the youngest person to sail solo around the world. She is truly an inspiration to many, and has proven to many people around the world that with determination, self-belief and preparation anything is possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, 11 March, marks the 145th day of Jessica’s journey. She has completed some 16,500 nautical miles, and has fewer than 6,000 nautical miles remaining until she arrives at her destination, Sydney. Jessica and her pink boat,

        , are on the homeward stretch and due to finish their journey and arrive back in Australia in late April or May. She is currently 700 nautical miles—about 1,300 kilometres—east of the southern tip of

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the residents of Fisher, I would like to formally congratulate Jessica for what she has set out to do, what she has done so far and for the inspiration and encouragement she is generating for all young people around Australia and the world from the message she is spreading: they should dare to dream big and achieve big.
       </p>
       <p>
        At 16 years of age, Jessica attracted both praise and criticism before she embarked on her journey in October 2009. She also battled equipment failure and mishaps on her practice voyage, but she has proven to date that often times it is the right thing to ignore the detractors and chase your goal.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jessica’s journey has highlighted the fact that it is important in this world that we still have people who are adventurers and innovators, and inventors and dreamers; people who will blaze new trails and attempt new things so that mankind can still discover the things that can only be discovered by taking a risk and going out on a limb. Jessica Watson should be proud that she can be classed among those valuable people.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to point out that Jessica has a very informative website that includes regular diary entries, videos, a map of her journey so far and a blogspot where members and residents who are following her progress are able to catch up and leave a comment. It is not uncommon for her to have up to 250 comments posted in response to her diary entries. On Monday alone—that is, 8 March—there were an amazing 982 comments. It is fascinating to read some of those blog entries and get an idea of the inspiration that Jessica is imparting to those back home in Australia and all around the world who are following her journey so closely.
       </p>
       <p>
        Her diary entries to followers are well-written, interesting and unpretentious. They convey a real sense that she is bringing all of these regular readers along on her journey. For those who have not yet visited the website, it is great to read and I encourage you to have a look at www.jessicawatson.com.au. Jessica has shown wisdom and skill beyond her years, and I wish her every success, safety and fun on the remaining part of her journey.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thought I might read in the time available to me an extract from today’s diary entry:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        First off, a huge thanks for all the book title ideas. That was a pretty amazing response and certainly gave us plenty to think about, as well as a lot of laughs! So thanks again.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Ella’s Pink Lady hasn’t been breaking any speed records lately but we are sailing along steadily. Yesterday was pretty slow but today’s been better. The sunshine and calm seas continue, so we’re not exactly doing it too hard. But when the speedo drops below 3 knots it becomes a bit of a test of my patience. It’s not that I’m in any terrible rush, because I’m having such a good time still, it’s just that it feels so much more purposeful to be going somewhere. The warm sunshine, amazing starry nights and lovely pink sunsets put in me in a great mood, but add speed as well and I’m one happy girl!
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Another great thing about the quiet conditions is that I’ve been able to leave the front hatch open, which is doing wonders at giving the cabin a nice freshen up. It is really helping my efforts to keep the mould and damp at bay. You wouldn’t believe some of the places I’m finding little patches of mould. The damp works its way in everywhere, for example all the zips on my jeans have corroded into place which is a little annoying!
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Finally, I’m relieved and pleased to be able to report that the dunny is back in action, the problem was some tiny bits of grit stuck in the pressure relief/air valve.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jessica Watson is an inspirational young lady. She is 16 years of age and is doing something that makes her a role model for all young people in Australia. Australia needs many more young people like Jessica Watson. I applaud her, I salute her, I congratulate her and I look forward to her safe return home.
