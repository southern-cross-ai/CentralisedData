                I think it does not matter because we have seen two very clear, different positions in the last three months from the opposition—a side that now has on the table an emissions trading scheme based on GGAS in
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
                 New South Wales
                </a>
                . The second line on their website says, ‘It is the first mandatory emissions trading scheme in the world.’ That is the basis of their scheme. They are not being truthful to the people of Australia in promoting that. They have a market based response and they are pretending it is something different. This debate is going to die. It is a sad death because the concept of a market based response in a market economy, putting a price on carbon and putting true pricing into the energy sector, is a sensible way forward for the national interest of this country.

               <p>
                The amendments I move this morning work on the detail of the bill. This is the third time these same amendments have been put up. It is of concern, on the slight chance this legislation hits the ground and gets through, that there is an enormous amount of ministerial discretion left in this legislation. When it comes to the crunch on how a particular issue is going to be dealt with, it is left as a question of ministerial discretion, I think, 25 times in this bill.
               </p>
               <p>
                To the minister, whoever that minister may be in the future, I say: who wants to be the person in the chair having to make a decision to remove a lot of these transitional elements in the legislation—for example, fuel credits? Who is going to be the person, man or woman, sitting in the chair who is going to say: ‘I remove fuel credits. Come on Australia, come and enjoy my company’? It is not going to happen. We have to remove the political elements of this. We have to make sure the science is true, the science is supported and the science is allowed to fly. The way to do that is to remove the political elements of this and the amount of ministerial discretion, and to try and instil, as we have with so many other elements of government, an independent element in this process. We did it with the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
                 Reserve Bank
                </a>
                . We consider the economy so pure and so important that we have an independent Reserve Bank board. If this is the moral challenge of our time then we should instil independence, arm’s length from government, in this process. At the moment, we do not have that. It is wrapped up in ministerial discretion in the future. It is a lesser bill because of that. I do not think it really matters, but I hope the government considers this third time round.

                 I thank the member for Lyne for his amendments. As he indicated, he has moved them in the past and we have had some dialogue about these matters on previous occasions. First and foremost, it is important to acknowledge that he has remained very actively and positively engaged in this debate throughout, and is a supporter of immediate and comprehensive action on climate change. That is something that the government respects.
                </p>
                <p>
                 The amendments that the member for Lyne move go to a number of matters: advice in relation to scheme caps—amendments (3) to (6); removal of assistance for emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries—amendment (7); removal of coal fired electricity generation assistance—amendment (8); voluntary cancellation of Australian emissions units—amendments (9) and (10); and the appointment of expert advisory committee members—amendment (11).
                </p>
                <p>
                 The government does not support these amendments. Broadly, for the reasons that I have outlined on previous occasions, in relation to which I am sure the member for Lyne is now well familiar, the government believes that we have the relationship between the responsibilities of the Australian
                 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
                  Climate Change
                 </a>
                 Regulatory Authority and the responsibilities of the minister and executive government in balance in an appropriate way in the legislation. Broadly, without going to further detail in relation to those issues, since I have dealt with it on previous occasions, the government’s position is unchanged and we do not support the amendments.

                  As we have asserted now for several days in debate, in our view this bill remains deeply flawed. It will put Australia well ahead of the world. It will expose industry, and therefore jobs and the livelihoods of millions of Australians, unnecessarily to great risks. These amendments in no way address the fundamental flaws that exist in the bill, and as such we will not be supporting these amendments.
