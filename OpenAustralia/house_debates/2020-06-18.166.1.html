        Clunes Cricket Club this year are celebrating their 100th birthday, and there is going to be a celebration later this year.

        and Phil McCarthy.
       </p>
       <p>
        There have been many successful players from the Clunes Cricket Club over the decades who have reached state, national and international levels. For a village of just a few hundred people, it is a highly impressive list.

        , a Clunes boys, went on to have a very distinguished cricketing career. Not a bad record for a village of just a few hundred people!
       </p>
       <p>
        I might add that I was the coach of Clunes Kanga team for a couple of years in the early 2000s, when my son Sean was a young boy. I can say quite categorically that none of them have gone on to have a stellar career, for which I accept full responsibility due to my lack of technical knowledge.

       <p>
        I would also like to thank the current committee members who are putting together the 100-year celebration: Graham Armstrong, Andrew Crisp,

        I'd like to recognise Allan Hayman from Junction Hill. He has been awarded a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Service_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Public Service Medal
        </a>
        for 40 years of service to the New South Wales government. He started at 14 when he helped build a local public school. He then became a trainee engineman. He married his wife, Lyn, in 1975, and in 1976 he started a job at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Main_Roads" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Main Roads
        </a>
        . He then became an assistant storeman. He considered retiring, but took up a job as a crossing supervisor on Turf Street at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary's_Primary_School" rel="nofollow">
         St Mary's Primary School
        </a>
        . He has been a familiar face for a whole generation of students. This award is usually presented by the Premier, but, due to COVID, the ceremony has been postponed. Congratulations Allan, and thank you for your service to our community.
