       <p>
        I'm proud to stand here today to say that, in just over a week, on 20 September, the changes that we committed to in the budget to the social security safety net will commence for so many. I am talking about rent assistance. The biggest increase that we've ever seen in rent assistance will go towards helping some of the most vulnerable people in our community be able to afford to pay their rent. For single parents, lifting the parenting payment single to age 14 for children—making sure that more people who have young children, and children into teenagehood, get the support that they need. There's the $40 boost to JobSeeker and youth allowance payments for people who are looking for work. These are changes that are happening because of a Labor government.
       </p>
       <p>
        We understand that it is tough for people out there, particularly people who are trying to survive on government support. That is why in our budget we put forward these changes. I'm proud to say that next week these changes will kick in. This will be welcomed by people, particularly people who are doing it tough, people who are our most vulnerable. We are practical, we are smart and we are doing it in a way which helps people who are the most vulnerable: people in regional areas and people who are in those suburbs that are struggling. This is the change that we're doing, and it starts next week—practical change that will help so many.
