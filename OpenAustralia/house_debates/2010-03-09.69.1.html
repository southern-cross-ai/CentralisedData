        Last Sunday I had the privilege to be involved in a fundraising event for the Centre for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_Palsy" rel="nofollow">
         Cerebral Palsy
        </a>
        called the Wheelie Big Day Out. The Wheelie Big Day Out is a community event that not only raises money for those who live with cerebral palsy but also gives people an opportunity to appreciate the difficulties of operating an electric wheelchair. Believe me: it is a lot harder than it looks. The challenge—and it certainly is a challenge—is to complete an obstacle course relay in an electric wheelchair. The event provided plenty of memorable moments, and local

        celebrities from channels 7, 9 and 10 all supported the day, along with

        also participated and brought his family along.

        It was great to see so many community partners involved in the day, including retired fireys from

        displaying the restored fire trucks. Also, there was ‘Beat the Heat’, a community based anti-street-racing program, started in 2005 by the former members of the now defunct WA Police Tango 1 Police Drag Racing Team. The main aim of the program is to reduce the incidence of illegal street racing on WA roads by encouraging participation in drag racing in a safe and controlled environment.

        ‘Reptiles by Request’ was another interesting community exhibit. It was situated next to my stand, which was ably serviced by many
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Young_Liberals" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Reptiles by Request provided my team with some memorable moments, particularly when the snakes were draped over the shoulders of one of my staff, Emma. I also had a snake draped over my shoulders. I admit it was an experience I am glad I have had, but I may not rush out to try it again.

        Amongst the excitement of the day was a strong message that organisations like the Centre for Cerebral Palsy need our support on a number of levels. The centre receives funding from both state and federal governments; however, this funding does not cover all the costs associated with supporting the individuals and families the centre works with. To help meet these costs, the centre relies on events like the Wheelie Big Challenge and the support of the wider community to help fund specialised equipment from the-never ending wish list.

        Over the past decade, modern technology has made a huge difference to the lives of people with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP" rel="nofollow">
         CP
        </a>
        ; however, this technology is beyond the reach of most families. This year, 14 individuals and their families took the challenge and raised over $60,000. One of these champions was five-year-old Euan, who, together with his family and supporters, raised $22,000—nearly a third of the overall total. I would like to now give a bit of background about the courage and determination of this little five-year-old boy and how he achieved such an amazing fundraising total. Euan is an extremely sporty five-year-old who loves to do all the normal stuff other kids do, like run, jump and race around. Louise, his adoring mum, said, ‘Euan wears magic legs and has frequent botox treatments and serial casting to help him keep up with the other kids and be as active as he can.’ Through the centre, Euan works with a range of therapists to keep on top of the difficulties he faces on an everyday basis. Louise said, ‘Without the help of the centre’s early intervention program, Euan would not be blossoming into the happy child that he is.’ Euan is now fully integrated to his school environment and loving it. Euan and his family took part in the challenge to say thanks to the centre for all it has done for him.

        Equipment bought with the funds raised at the event includes walk aids valued at $7,000 each. This amazing new technology has an electrical muscle stimulator which is worn around the lower leg to help children lift their feet as they walk.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Centre" rel="nofollow">
         The Centre
        </a>
        for Cerebral Palsy was established in 1951 and has grown into one of the leading disability service providers in WA. It provides support, care and guidance to more than 1,000 children and adults with cerebral palsy. The centre has an operating budget in excess of $25 million. It employs 650 staff and relies on the support received from more than 200 volunteers. As we all know, the volunteers in our community play an enormous role and make a huge contribution. The overarching philosophy of the centre is for people with cerebral palsy and other disabilities to be included in every facet of society, and the centre aims to achieve this by providing a range of quality services. These services include physiotherapy, speech pathology, occupational therapy, social work, psychology, early education, respite, health promotion, employment, alternatives to employment, accommodation support and recreation. Specialised technology and equipment are often used to improve the capacity of a person living with cerebral palsy to carry out daily activities and participate in their local community.

        Finally, I would like to say thank you to all the team at the Centre for Cerebral Palsy, and Samantha Thiele in particular, for organising such a great event.
