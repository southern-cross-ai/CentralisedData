       <p class="italic">
        4A Application of amendments to trials by the Australian Military Court of multiple charges or accused persons together
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The amendments made by items 2, 30A and 30B of Schedule 7 to this Act apply in relation to a charge of a service offence against an accused person that is to be tried by the Australian Military Court if, before the commencement of those items, the accused person:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a)    had not made an election in relation to the charge under subsection 132A(2) or (3) of the
        <i>
         Defence Force Discipline Act 1982
        </i>
        , as in force before the commencement of those items; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b)    had not been asked to plead in relation to the charge.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is an important amendment—so much so that the passage of the bill is very opportune. The amendment will introduce some efficiency into the process of summary justice. Essentially, it is designed to streamline the handling of trials where there is more than one offence but where those offences range in seriousness—that is, between classes 1, 2 and 3. Where there are multiple offences, they will be bundled together and dealt with together according to the process for the most serious of the offences. This may be either at the summary level—for all minor offences—or, for more serious offences, before a single judge of the Military Court or perhaps even a judge and jury. It also provides for more than one offender. Provision is also made for the defence military prosecutor to use his or her discretion in determining this process. Allowance is also made for circumstances where the accused has made an election for a trial in preference to a summary process.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a straightforward issue but, as we can see from the amendment, it is indeed very complex in the drafting. I may also say that it is, perhaps, inevitable in a matter such as this, where the reform to the military justice system is so far-reaching, that operational realities in this new legal regime might be unforeseen. This is one such instance, and no doubt we will see further need in due course to undertake some finetuning. I commend the amendment to the committee.

         From the outset, we would say that the coalition support this amendment in the general direction in which it goes. This amendment was flagged at a briefing with Senator Minchin last week. However, the detail has only hit our desk today, and I have had very limited time to read through it. Whilst the intent is admirable, I think that perhaps, giving consideration to the number of reports that have been conducted by the Senate, it might be prudent for the Senate to refer it to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to look over the implications of this, to examine it, to provide evidence and to report back.

         It is key and critical that we do what we can to support the men and women in our Australian defence forces and that we give them a level of surety in the direction in which any disciplinary processes go. I am attracted to the option for them to elect to have trial by a single

         judge or, indeed, to have a jury there. These are attractive propositions. The proposition that it be made possible for the charge sheet for a series of offences to be brought together and heard in one jurisdiction is also attractive. But, as I say, the detail provided to the coalition has only been here for a matter of moments. In future, on matters like this—requiring, and deservedly so, bipartisan support in making sure the men and women of our military forces are represented with their best interests in mind—perhaps a briefing ahead of time on the intention of the amendments so that they can be fully supported without any reservation would be prudent. Without taking up any more time of the Main Committee, the coalition supports these amendments because it supports the rights to access benefits for those in our
