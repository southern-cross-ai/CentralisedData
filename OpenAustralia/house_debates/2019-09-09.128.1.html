        In the current debate on religious freedom it is important that we are respectful and tolerant of the religious beliefs of all Australians. The legislation, which is currently in the draft stages, may well be more accurately described as promoting religious harmony as opposed to religious freedom. Nevertheless, as a lifelong Christian, I am a strong supporter of traditional family values, freedom of religion, freedom of speech, multiculturalism and reconciliation. Government should not restrict Australians from worshipping freely according to their faith, beliefs, values and conscience, except in instances where hate, violence or illegal acts are incited. Simply disagreeing with the religious views of another person or group of persons should not be the grounds for government intervention.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_freedom" rel="nofollow">
         Religious freedom
        </a>
        extends into the realm of cultural freedom, which is important in a multicultural society. Individuals must be free to live their lives according to deeply held values and beliefs which are not only religious in nature but cultural in nature without impinging on the rights of others to exercise their rights and freedoms. For example, Christmas is both religious and cultural in nature. The freedom to believe in Christ and the freedom to celebrate with customary carols and festive traditions are religious and cultural freedoms which must be preserved.
       </p>

        There is a distinct difference between the notions of discernment and discrimination. Individuals must be free to discern between what is good and bad. They must have the freedom to choose between what is right and wrong and to determine what is appropriate and inappropriate. These choices are quite distinct from discrimination, which the legislation seeks to curtail. Each day we make discernments in our choices and our behaviour, and about whom we choose to associate, and these choices must not be confused with discrimination. Legislation and regulation should not infringe on our basic human rights to discern. Discernment is often required with activities that are legal, such as moderation in the consumption of alcohol, gambling or smoking tobacco. Individuals, parents and families should be free to express their values and beliefs to their children. The Australian public should be adequately consulted before legislation pertaining to religious freedom is introduced into parliament.

        Looking to the future, I believe that all Australians should become more united through reconciliation and multiculturalism. Australians should all be united as one people under one flag, regardless of origins and history. I strongly belief in the principle of flying one national flag of national unity, under the banner of the Australian flag.

        , new migrants and people from different ethnic backgrounds, and persons born in Australia should all be treated equally, with access to opportunity and advancement based on merit.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was born in Singapore, a nation of many ethnic groups and religions which is very multicultural in nature and which has enjoyed relative harmony in its modern history. From a young age I was exposed to many different cultural practices, religious traditions and festivals in a multicultural society which was diverse and colourful. However, in Singapore's history race and ethnicity were once treated with more formality. Having emigrated from a country which once had a policy of recording a citizen's race on official documents, I can appreciate the benefits of not having one's racial background recorded on Australian official documents.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our constitution should promote harmony, unity and a single national identity, rather than differentiation based on race or ethnicity. It doesn't matter how long one has been in Australia or from which country we have come from. What matters is what we do in Australia—our accomplishments and achievements. We all share a collective responsibility to build up our nation together as one people. In any debate surrounding a referendum to change the Constitution, the principal of national unity should be promoted—one people united under one flag. We must make constructive steps towards uniting all people as Australians, regardless of their origin, ethnicity or other attributes, advancing our nation into the future.
