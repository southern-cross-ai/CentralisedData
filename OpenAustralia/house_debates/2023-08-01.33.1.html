        My question is to the Prime Minister. At the opening of parliament last year the Prime Minister declared, 'The Uluru Statement from the Heart represents an opportunity that must be seized and voice, truth, treaty is the result.' On 19 July the Prime Minister told 2GB's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Fordham" rel="nofollow">
         Ben Fordham
        </a>
        that it was 'not natural' to assume treaty would follow the Voice, and stated, 'This is not about treaty.' He said that four times. Was the Prime Minister being truthful at the opening of parliament or on 2GB?

          I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. He should know, as a member of the Queensland
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LNP" rel="nofollow">
           LNP
          </a>
          , that the Queensland LNP and the Queensland government have advanced legislation in Queensland that the Queensland LNP—of which he is a prominent member—voted for on the matter in which he answers. That's just a fact.
         </p>
         <p>
          But what is actually before the Australian people is a very clear proposition of recognition of Aboriginal and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
           Torres Strait Islander
          </a>
          peoples, in Australia's Constitution, as our
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Peoples" rel="nofollow">
           First Peoples
          </a>
          . What is also before the Australian people is listening to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in order to achieve better results. He doesn't have to listen to those on this side of the House; he just has to listen to those behind him, because the member for Berowra had this to say: 'It's the status quo that is the biggest danger here. The system is broken. This is a wonderful country and we're at the top of the league tables on almost every measure, but we've got this gap that hasn't closed despite goodwill and money. Consulting people about the policies and laws that affect them, in a formal way, I think, will help.' A very constructive contribution from the person—

            Mr Speaker, this goes to the Prime Minister's credibility. Is he willing to demonstrate to the House where he told the truth and where he didn't, instead of this tricky tap dance?

               I'll remind all members that, when taking points of order, it's simply a matter of stating the point of order not giving commentary. The Prime Minister was asked about his comments at the opening of parliament and also on media. The Prime Minister is being relevant. I'm asking the House to listen to the Prime Minister in silence.

               <p>
                I'm being relevant about the question that is before the Australian people. I say this to those opposite. If you believe that there is something wrong with the question that Australians will actually vote on between October and December this year, then put that case. But you are incapable of doing so, so the 'no' campaign continues to raise things that are not part of the question that is before the Australian people—the question that is in legislation that the Leader of the Opposition sat over there and voted for. He voted for it to be put to the Australian people.
               </p>
               <p>
                And I say this. Over coming weeks and indeed months the Australian people will have the opportunity to have their say, to embrace the opportunity that is there for recognition and for listening to Aboriginal and
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
                 Torres Strait Islander
                </a>
                people in order to achieve better outcomes. I say: if not now, when? We need to embrace this opportunity to enlarge our nation by voting yes.
