        It is with the greatest honour that I rise today to extend my deepest condolences to the families and friends of six people killed in a plane crash near
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borumba_Dam" rel="nofollow">

        in Queensland on Monday, 1 October. The group of six friends, all Bonner locals, were flying back to the plane's home base in Caboolture after spending the long weekend raising money for charity by conducting joy flights at the Monto Fly-In when the horrific accident occurred. My most sincere sympathy goes out to the family members and friends of Des and Kathleen Porter, Les and Jan D'Evlin and John and Carol Dawsonâ€”all valued members of the Bonner community who will be sorely missed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Des, the owner of an automotive shop, and his wife, Kathleen, were Wynnum locals who loved being out and about in the community almost as much as Des loved his prized 1930s biplane. Des was a man of incredible character and had a great love of life. I met him many times at various community events. I wish to extend my sincere condolences to their children, Scott, Gavin, David, Elizabeth and Vicki, and the rest of the family following this tragic loss of life.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to express my deep regret to the Dawson family. Carol and John were an intrinsic part of the Tingalpa family, with John operating a smash repairs business with his brother Ian. I wish to pass on my sincerest sympathies to Margaret, Patrick, Ian and the rest of the family.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last, but certainly not least, I would like to convey my deep condolences to the D'Evlin family for the loss of Jan and Les. I wish to share my condolences with Mr and Mrs Petty, Shane and the rest of the D'Evlin family. The couple passed away doing something they loved. Les had over the years built speed cars to race but was always very safe and methodical. Jan will be remembered as a very caring, vibrant person who would do anything for anyone.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is in this House that I would also like to acknowledge the people who worked tirelessly over many days in the desperate search operation. Emergency services were joined in the search by a number of private aviation companies and local residents who gave up their time to search for the plane and its passengers. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority's Rescue Coordination Centre Australia coordinated a search for the plane over an area of 1,500 square kilometres in hilly and forested terrain. The Wynnum, Manly and Tingalpa communities in my electorate of Bonner keenly feel the loss of these six wonderful people who helped to brighten the lives of everyone who they came across.
       </p>
       <p>
        I feel extremely honoured to be able to stand here in the house and say to the Porter, D'Evlin and Dawson families that this parliament is with you and thinking of you and the grief that you feel is felt by all of us.
