       <p>
        The nasty surprises from Tuesday night's budget keep coming. One of the things that we have also learnt from that nasty budget is that this government, the Turnbull government, have continued with their plan to cut the Financial Entitlements Guarantee,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FEG" rel="nofollow">
         FEG
        </a>
        . This government have said that they want to cut the entitlements that these workers are owed. It is heartbreaking when a company goes into receivership and workers are faced with having to lose their entitlements. It is not their fault the company has gone into receivership. They need this government's support.
       </p>
       <p>
        For example, a worker for Queensland Nickel could face being $58,000 worse off because of this government if they have worked for the company for 10 years. Where is the member for Herbert's tears now? Where are his sighs? Why isn't he calling on the Treasurer and this government to back down on cutting the Fair Entitlements Guarantee? Prior to the last election, I sat with cleaners at the Bendigo marketplace and helped them complete their FEG forms for another time when they had worked for several contractors that had gone into receivership. It is good we have a scheme in place that protects workers entitlements. It is so disappointing that, yet again, this government are trying to cut the Fair Entitlements Guarantee.
