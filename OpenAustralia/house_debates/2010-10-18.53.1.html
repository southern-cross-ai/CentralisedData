        My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister stand by her pre-election commitment to adopt the Murray-Darling Basin plan, sight unseen, in its entirety and without regard to costs or impact? Why did the Prime Minister say during the election campaign:

         I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question, though it has caused me to laugh, because the Leader of the Opposition knows, in constructing that question, that what he is saying is absolutely wrong. Let me quote some words to the Leader of the Opposition which I think are very relevant on this point, about the role of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. It was obviously implemented by a bill in the parliament. The words I seek to quote are:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         This is an enormous step forward from the current governance model, which has remained largely unchanged since 1915 and requires the agreement of all basin jurisdictions before anything can be done. Through this bill, for the first time in the basin’s history, one basin-wide institution accountable to the government will be responsible for planning the basin’s water resources. It will be expert and it will be independent.
        </p>
        <p>
         They were wise words, and people may be amazed to hear that they came from the member for Wentworth. I am certainly not going to make a habit of it, but on this occasion I would adopt the words of the member for Wentworth. Everything has a first, and possibly a last moment—and that is my last moment adopting his words.
        </p>
        <p>
         What was set up under the Howard government, when the Leader of the Opposition was sitting at the cabinet table, presumably reading his cabinet papers and absorbing what was in them, was a process where the Murray-Darling Basin Authority—

          Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order with respect to relevance. The Prime Minister was asked about her commitment on 10 August, not about ancient history to do with the member for Wentworth.

                 <p>
                  The point of describing the legislation, and what the Murray-Darling Basin Authority does, is to indicate how the authority is working and where the plan comes in. What has been published is a guide. It is subject to consultation. Then the Murray-Darling Basin Authority will publish a draft plan. It will be the subject of consultation. Then, of course, the minister will sign off a plan and bring it to this parliament. I am determined that, as we work through those stages, as we get to a final plan, the plan is implemented—because that will get the balance right between the environmental needs of the river, the needs of farmers and food producers and the needs of regional communities.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  I would counsel the Leader of the Opposition in the following terms. I understand this is difficult reform. I understand that it has inflamed community passion. But it is not in anybody’s interests—not in the interests of any Australian, any farmer, any regional community—for the Leader of the Opposition to use his status to wreck this process. This is a process—

                    This is a process that was started by the Howard government. It is a process that needs to be worked through with complete and full community consultation. That is occurring now through the consultations of the authority and will occur through the parliamentary committee led by the member for New England, and I thank him for doing that work.
