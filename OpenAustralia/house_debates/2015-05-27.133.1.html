        Those who become members of either side of this House wish in the most honourable way to serve their community. When we leave this place, whether it is by our own determination or as a result of forces beyond our control, we will be judged equally as honourable members by what we say or what we do. Tonight I want to share with colleagues some of the things I have achieved while being in parliament and now we are halfway through our first term in government. It is important for our community to understand what the Commonwealth government's contribution is and the very many ways in which we reach out to assist.

        funding for Munanjali House, which is an organisation that helps with aged care facilities and extended transport and at-home care services. There has been a community development grant for the Boonah showground. That small community organisation received $250,000—their biggest fundraising event during the course of the year is normally the local show, which they normally burn money on. It is grants like that that help build and instil confidence into communities. There is our capital grant program, through which we have invested money into the Tamborine Mountain College for the construction of two general living areas, amenities, a computer nook, verandas and stairs. As that community grows there is a greater demand on education facilities. The Faith Lutheran College in the

        I want to speak about some of the money that has landed in my electorate through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Spot_Program" rel="nofollow">
         Black Spot Program
        </a>
        —$1.1 million has been allocated to widen a section of the Gold Coast Springbrook Road—a dangerous stretch of road hopefully now made safer. That was identified by the Black Spot Program. There was $240,000 to improve the safety of Gehrke Road-Otto Road-Mountain View Drive at Plainland, and over $65,000 to prevent hoons in and around the Veresdale Scrub School Road area.

        Our area is no stranger to natural disasters, and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenic_Rim_Regional_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Scenic Rim Regional Council
        </a>
        received $225,000 to help rebuild our communities after the devastating floods. Included in that was $160,000 to install additional flood warning systems at Coulson Bridge and Canungra to warn those communities of any future imminent threat, and an additional $65,000 for the Scenic Rim Bushfire Risk Reduction Project. The

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Council" rel="nofollow">

        received $150,000 to upgrade the telemetry network and construct flood warning systems.

        predominantly in the Jimboomba CBD and Flagstone areas. That was the result of an election commitment I made to fight to make our communities more secure by providing $150,000, and then on getting into government we were fortunate enough to be able to double that commitment. It was well received and well supported by the community—it was a community-driven project and was what they were asking for. This government listened and supported them.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are also a friend of the arts. Three local arts projects have received a combined $61,500, with $15,000 going to the Lake Wyaralong Sculpture Festival, $30,000 going to the Goat Track Theatre Company and $15,000 going to the Big Stories, Small Towns festival in the Beaudesert.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have also made an ongoing commitment to the Financial Assistance Grants program, through which local shires are allocated funds from the federal government. Logan City Council received $10 million, Scenic Rim Council received $3 million, Lockyer Valley Regional Council received over $4 million and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast City Council
        </a>
        received $18.8 million. All of that money ends up in worthwhile projects.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is things like this that the government is committed to. At the start of my speech, I alluded to the fact that we will be judged not only by what we say but by what we do. I hope that my continued efforts to supply and deliver valued projects into the area makes our community a better place to live.
