           They were clearing away blackberry. They were rehabilitating the area, planting native species and restoring the foreshore. There was a great sense of purpose and satisfaction in what they were doing. We also travelled a little way up the road to where there was a foreshore which, a year ago, was covered in wrack and was putrid. As part of the coalition's Tuggerah Lakes recovery program, it is now free of weed, is open for the public to attend this summer and is going to make a real difference to the environment as well as a real difference to the local economy.
          </p>
          <p>
           This is part of a broader program that we have seen over the last year. We have gotten rid of the carbon tax, we have passed the emissions reduction fund into being, we have put in place one-stop shops across the country, and we have cleared $1 trillion of backlogged Labor projects which they would not say no to and they would not say yes to. But, perhaps, right at the heart of what I do, I take most joy in what the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Army" rel="nofollow">
            Green Army

           is doing. They are young people in the environment having a tremendous sense of satisfaction.
          </p>
          <p>
           Already the army is well ahead of schedule. We have 62 teams in the field around the country. We have young people who are taking great pride in it. We have Jade from the

           More than that, though, these projects are around the country. They are in coalition seats. They are also in Labor seats. They are in Maribyrnong. They are in Throsby. They are in Hunter. Unlike the Labor Party, we can see that the whole of the country should benefit. As opposed to what they do, the whole of the country benefits.

Whether it is Lalor, whether it is Newcastle, whether it is Throsby, there are young people helping the environment in a way which is good for them and good for the country, and that is how it should be.
