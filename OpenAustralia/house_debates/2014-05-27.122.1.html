        As federal member for the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, I have found the topic of the 100th commemoration of the
        <i>
         Sydney-Emden
        </i>
        battle has been a regular part of my chats with community members over many years. The islanders are very keen that this centenary be commemorated as an Australian story of great significance, not only for the Royal Australian Navy but for the Australian nation as a whole. As well as islanders commemorating the centenary of their community's direct involvement in the First World War, there is also considerable interest from historians, families and members of the Royal Australian Navy and the German Navy with an interest or link with the HMAS
        <i>
         Sydney
        </i>
        and SMS
        <i>
         Emden
        </i>
        . The Cocos Island community has a link to the Anzacs, as HMAS
        <i>
         Sydney
        </i>
        was an escort ship for the convoy that took the first Anzacs across the Indian Ocean from Albany to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . I will be attending the events in November, and I encourage all Australians to take an interest.
