        I was watching the clock. Thank you, Madam Speaker, for your guidance. My question is to the Prime Minister. Today the
        <i>
         Australian
        </i>
        <i>
         Financial Review
        </i>
        reported that Toyota had blamed unions in a meeting with the Treasurer on 3 December. The Treasurer has since confirmed that that report is correct. However, Toyota denies the report and confirms that they have never blamed the union for their decision to close their manufacturing operations. Prime Minister, who is telling the truth: the Treasurer or Toyota?

          Madam Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The question is out of order. The Prime Minister could not possibly know the answer to that question. The question should be directed to the Treasurer, and even then it might not be in order. There is a pattern here of questions that are not really in order. It is probably time that the opposition learnt how to draft a question. I ask that you rule that question out of order. It is not directed to the correct minister.

           Madam Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition is asserting that the Prime Minister is not responsible for the conduct of his ministers. That would be a complete change from all precedence in the way this House has conducted question time.

             Before I call the Treasurer—the Prime Minister is totally in order to direct that that question be answered in that way—I believe that the Leader of the House had a valid point to make about the nature of the question. But we will allow it to stand and have the Treasurer answer it.

              The report, as it related to the content of the discussion between myself and Toyota, was correct. Toyota's statement today is also correct. Toyota did not blame the unions because, at that time, Toyota still wanted to say in Australia.

                   In their November submission to the

                   review of the automotive industry, Toyota identified four key requests in relation to their business in Australia. No. 4 is industrial relations. I table that.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   On 10 December, seven days after I met Toyota, I spoke in this place, before Holden had even announced they were leaving Australia. I will quote myself from
