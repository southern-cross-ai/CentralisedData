       <p>
        I rise today to support the men and women who have fought selflessly to protect our country. Some of these veterans paid the ultimate price, and for some their battles continue long after returning home. I have met with veterans and their families in my community who were given the anti-malarial drugs Mefloquine and Tafenoquine. I stand in this place on their behalf. The lack of consultation undertaken by the Turnbull government both frustrates and angers them, and rightly so, because they don't believe their voices are being heard. I have written to and met with previous veterans ministers of this government to demand proper consultation with veterans. These are our veterans' lives and this issue will not go away.

        The Turnbull government just has not delivered for veterans. The previous Minister for Veterans' Affairs committed to a number of priorities, one that would establish a dedicated
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVA" rel="nofollow">
         DVA
        </a>
        Mefloquine support team to assist our serving and ex-serving ADF community with Mefloquine related claims. When asked about this, DVA confirmed there was no dedicated team. Rather, this was spread across a handful of DVA staff who deal with a range of issues at any one time. The new minister needs to be up-front regarding what support his government is offering veterans on this very important and critical issue. I invite the Prime Minister and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs to come to Townsville to talk with and listen to the members of the Quinn group in my home town. Labor is very aware that much more needs to be done and we will work with veterans to further investigate this issue.
