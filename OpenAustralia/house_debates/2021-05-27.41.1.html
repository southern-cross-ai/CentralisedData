       <p>
        Today's announcement of another lockdown is difficult for all Victorians, but we have got through this before and we will get through this again. Last week I had the resounding pleasure of heading down to one of the local shopping centres in my electorate of Chisholm to do five days of listening to the concerns and issues of my constituents. I normally take my constituency meetings in my electoral office, but I wanted to get close to the action, finding out exactly what people were thinking and how I can best assist them. It was a terrific time. Listening to my constituents is one of my favourite roles as a politician, and many people have told me that they really appreciate me coming to them. We stand here in the House of Representatives with the sole intent of representing the people of our respective electorates and Australia at large. Some of my colleagues on the other side of the chamber may forget from time to time, and I can certainly say that government running down in Victoria has forgotten its fundamental role of representing its constituents. But I hope this speech serves as a reminder of what they should be doing.
