        I would like to take the small amount of time available to me to quickly mention the

        opening that I went to last week in Holder. It was a great day. I would like to thank Bishop Power, who gave a wonderful address to all the students, teachers, staff, parents and friends there. There was also Father Brannelly, who is almost like the Father for the Uhlmann family. He is in charge of the parish priests. We have been to many communions and baptisms of the Uhlmann clan that have been overseen and managed by Father Brannelly, so it was lovely to be back at St Jude's. My nieces also attended St Jude's, so in a way it is a family primary school.
       </p>

        The school received about $2 million, from memory, under the BER program. It helped with significant refurbishment of classrooms and the courtyard. They now have a beautiful new courtyard and there will be a working bee on it to upgrade and replant. That is a great new facility for the students. There is also the major entry area. I would like to thank the parents, teachers, staff, girls and boys of St Jude's Primary School for having me there the other day. It was a great opportunity to share with them in this major investment in their educational future.
