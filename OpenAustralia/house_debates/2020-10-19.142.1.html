        Bushfires, the drought, COVID-19, the worst recession in a century—it's been a tough year for individuals, families and businesses across Ipswich, the Somerset region and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karana_Downs" rel="nofollow">

        region. Deferred rents—businesses' doors still open as a result—have to be paid. JobKeeper is being reduced. It's been a tough year for employers and employees.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight, I want to thank those people and thank the wonderful organisations who've supported them. Many individuals and families are using welfare services for the very first time in their lives. I've met some of the Salvation Army's Moneycare financial officers: Jillian McKinlay, Maria Teresa Newell and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachael_Taylor" rel="nofollow">
         Rachael Taylor
        </a>
        . Moneycare provides financial counselling to people, with no eligibility criteria to access the service. The counsellors are supported by the amazing work of Salvation Army Corps Ipswich officers Ashley and Rita Bierman, and they are working at capacity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unemployment is exacerbating the financial strain, especially for those seeking JobKeeper and those who can't get it, like the 600 workers from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JBS" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        Meatworks in my electorate. They've been let down by the Morrison government, who failed to change the eligibility criteria, stubbornly. It's been a tough time for those people looking for work.
       </p>
       <p>
        My thoughts are also with our year 12s. They, in Queensland, were the first preppies; they're undertaking now their final assessment for what has been a disruptive year. In Queensland, those graduating year 12 are the first also to be in high school. What a big change! I want to thank local principals and teachers. They are incredibly proud of their year 12s.
       </p>
       <p>
        Schools such Bremer State High School are making the time special for their students. Bremer high school teacher Leanne Kitching is organising a mystery tour for the year 12s. She said that students have not just endured enormous disruption; their families have suffered financial hardship, which has hit those students hard. Some are despondent.
       </p>
       <p>
        But we cannot escape the fact that three-quarters of mental health disorders emerge before the age of 25 years. In addition, about a third of young Australians are reporting high levels of psychological stress. Tonight I want to also congratulate the local headspace in Ipswich, as well as those who are working in Caboolture, who come across into my electorate in Kilcoy. About 1,350 young people in Blair receive mental health and wellbeing support. Congratulations to headspace, and I hope you have a great day on 21 October, recognising the wonderful work you do.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to thank

        </a>
        Muys at the Tivoli Miracle Centre and his team—2,500 meals a week, or over three tonnes of food, are being delivered to those in need. There's been a 200 per cent increase in activity since COVID-19. They're also working with Kambu Health, who also need to be congratulated. But Pastor Fred and his team are delivering support services to 135 isolated Indigenous people—five meals a week. Congratulations, Pastor Fred and your wonderful team at Tivoli Miracle Centre.
       </p>
       <p>
        Cityhope Church, wonderfully led by Pastor Mark Edwards, has reported a 600 per cent increase in support services being delivered, in food, hampers, clothing and household support. Also congratulations to Ipswich Foodbarn—a 400 per cent increase in support provided. They're based in Darling Street East in Woodend, and they deliver great services to the people of Ipswich.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Vedanta Centre in Springfield is led by a man affectionately known as Swamiji. Congratulations to Swamiji—a holy man, a sincere man, a proud man in a sense, but also a very humble man. Thank you for what you do in the area.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations also to Ashneel Padarath, who is the project manager for the centre. They deliver a soup kitchen and a cafe. Maa Sarada's Kitchen is the name of their kitchen, and they're delivering a hundred frozen vegetarian meals per week through partnerships with local churches. I was pleased to attend their annual multicultural festival—world-class entertainment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you to all the organisations who deliver tremendous service to our local community. I am deeply grateful for the work you do and the support you've given to those most hard-hit during COVID-19 and the other calamities that we've suffered.
