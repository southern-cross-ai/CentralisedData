       <p>
        If only the member for Bowman knew that he was in the government, because this government stinks, and the fish rots from the head. This government is happy to write press releases but it's not happy to write policy or legislation. We cannot look at what the Prime Minister says; we have to look outside the Prime Minister's delusional bubble. The Prime Minister said that there would be a $2 billion bushfire recovery fund. Wrong; it's only a notional fund, an idea. The Prime Minister said that $100 million of taxpayer funds for the sports rorts scandal only went to eligible grant recipients. Wrong; the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_National_Audit_Office" rel="nofollow">
         Australian National Audit Office
        </a>
        said that almost half went to ineligible recipients. The Prime Minister said that he had no involvement but just passed on some of the details from candidates. Wrong; there were 136 emails between the Prime Minister's office and Bridget McKenzie's office. The Prime Minister said, at the despatch box, that it all happened on 4 April. That's when it happened, the Prime Minister said. Wrong; it happened on 11 April, after the election had already been called. The Prime Minister said that there would be a national integrity commission. Wrong; there's been no national integrity commission. The Prime Minister has no plan, he has no relationship with the truth and he has no accountability.
