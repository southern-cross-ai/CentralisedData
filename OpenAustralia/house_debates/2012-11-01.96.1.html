        My question is to the Minister for Health. How is the federal government's investment helping states like Victoria to run their health systems? Are Australians getting the best possible return on this investment from state governments and state health systems?

         I am so pleased to have such a positive and important question from the member for

          McEwen

         ; it is a contrast. This side is interested in health, education, the environment and the Murray-Darling—all of the big issues that face us as a nation. We are proud as the Gillard government to be increasing investment in the Victorian health system and across states and territories. The investments we are making in Victoria will make a huge difference to the patients of Victoria in years to come.
        </p>
        <p>
         The comprehensive cancer centre that we are investing in has research, treatment, teaching and training all in one location so that we can give the very best care to the patients of Victoria. Funding of $77 million has been allocated for a world-leading facility, the world-leading brain injury centre at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austin_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
          Austin Hospital
         </a>
         that the member for Jagajaga knows so much about. In rural and regional Victoria—indeed in the member for McEwen's own seat—we have promised $10 million for the Kilmore District Hospital. It is an excellent project to upgrade the very important health facility.
        </p>
        <p>
         Victorians should be very proud of their health professionals: their doctors, nurses, allied health professionals and clinicians right across the system. They have got many fine facilities in Victoria.
        </p>
        <p>
         That is why it is so very disappointing to see the Victorian government letting down the patients of Victoria by refusing to take the more than $200 million that is on offer from the federal government—and they can't even cash the cheque! In fact, we have got $130 million for round 3 of the Health and Hospitals Fund that they do not want to cash the cheque for. There are 11 really important and much-needed facilities in rural and regional Victoria—including, Geelong, Albury-Wodonga, Kerang, Echuca, Mildura, Colac, Kyneton, Timboon and Ballarat—and the Victorian government cannot even cash the cheque from the federal government. We have also got $111.1 million for subacute hospital beds.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Baillieu" rel="nofollow">
          Ted Baillieu
         </a>
         was out there during the election campaign promising there would be more beds in Victoria. He cannot point to a single new bed. We want to give them $111.1 million for new subacute beds and existing subacute beds—that would deliver 82 new beds—and, again, they cannot even cash the cheque. This is at the same time, mind you, that they are out there cutting $616 million from the state budget—indeed, I will be tabling that relevant section from the state budget papers—and claiming that the Commonwealth has cut funding to Victoria. Almost $1 billion extra will go into the Victorian health system from the Commonwealth over four years—a 26 per cent increase, from $3.6 billion to $4.5 billion, year on year on year.

          Madam Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for that answer. In what further ways have the government's health policies assisted people in my electorate?

           I thank the member for that question. As well as pointing out these two very important projects where we have seen the state government in Victoria refuse to cash the cheque from the federal government, I have heard it reported today that the state government has gone around to all of the locals hospital boards and passed on their $616 million of cuts to those local hospital boards to deliver. This is incredibly disappointing. We know that those local hospital boards need extra funding and that is why, over coming years, the Commonwealth will put $1 billion extra into the Victorian health system—a 26 per cent increase.
          </p>
          <p>
           What is extraordinary about this is that, as health minister, I have not actually had the experience of a state government saying no to funding. Actually, the Queensland government did reject some funding for mental health beds, but the Health and Hospitals Fund money is money that the Victorian government applied for. They asked for funding and they submitted 11 projects that were so needed in those local communities, and now they do not want to cash the cheque. It is beyond me and so very disappointing, because I know that those patients in Victoria need that care. I think what has happened is that the 'no' from November has translated into—
