        Before I was elected I travelled through the electorate of Braddon hosting community cuppas wherever and whenever I could. I invited residents to meet me over a cup of tea or coffee and a bickie to discuss any issues that they wanted to raise. After the election I was determined to continue with the community cuppas, and I have done so. Last week I hosted such cuppas in Ulverstone, Penguin and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulphur_Creek" rel="nofollow">
         Sulphur Creek
        </a>
        , taking the total now to over 30 community cuppas that I have been running since the election campaign of 2013.

        I would like to report to the parliament some of the issues raised at these meetings. They all raised similar issues, coincidentally, with same sex marriage obviously being a big issue of discussion, and I have to say there is overwhelming support for a national vote on the issue. There was a lot of discuss about ice and the problems arising from the ice epidemic, not only in our state but around the country, as well as foreign ownership, and a lot of discussion on the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, with many questions from the audience giving me the chance to put to rest some of the fears that have been put in their minds by the unions and the Labor Party.

       <p>
        Unemployment is a big issue in our region, of course, and there have been questions on superannuation taxation, with people actually thanking the government for the attempt to get the debt and deficit under control. There was also the issue of an unhealthy reliance by some in our community on government welfare. These meetings are great opportunity for people to put their views. Sulphur Creek, particularly, has an issue with mobile phone coverage—or, should I say, lack of it—and I am encouraging them to continue with their campaign to have this fixed.

        Last week the Penguin community lost a true gentleman. Like many of his vintage, Mr Terry McKenna served this country in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         Second World War
        </a>
        . He was an air force navigator who saw action in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
         New Guinea
        </a>
        , returning to devote his life to his family and his community. Following the war, Terry met and married Peg, in 1948, and they had five children. Sharing their lives together, Terry and Peg have modelled to all of us true love and commitment. For 25 years Terry was the Penguin town clerk. He was passionate about his beloved town and following his retirement in 1986 he ran for office, serving many years on the Penguin council. Two years later he was elected to the newly formed
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast Council
        </a>
        . He has actually served the local government for over 44 years. It is fair to say that Terry McKenna was the driving force behind the Penguin Sports Complex and he also had a vision for this complex to be made more of a first-class sporting precinct, and it should be noted that the Central Coast Council is moving closer to the fulfilment of Terry's vision. Perhaps more important to Mr McKenna was his faith and his commitment to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church" rel="nofollow">
         Catholic Church
        </a>
        . His commitment was not only personal but also practical. He helped rebuild the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sacred_Heart_Church" rel="nofollow">
         Sacred Heart Church
        </a>
        in Ulverstone after it was damaged by fire. He was a great family man. On behalf of the electorate of Braddon, I express my deepest sympathies to Mr McKenna's family at this time.

         While it is 10 o'clock, I understand it would suit the convenience of the Federation Chamber to continue with constituency statements.
