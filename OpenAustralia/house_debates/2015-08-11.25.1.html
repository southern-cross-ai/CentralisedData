       <p>
        This week marks the six-month anniversary of the Prime Minister's infamous statement:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Good government starts today.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the time, the Australian people laughed. They laughed that it took this Prime Minister that long to decide that he wanted to lead a good government. Here we are six months later, and Australians are still asking themselves, 'When will this good government begin?' because it has not started yet.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let us just take the recent attack on people who are earning penalty rates: the government, through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Productivity Commission
        </a>
        , are not going after the highest paid workers in our community; they are going after the lowest paid workers. They have singled out retail workers and hospitality workers in our community—people who earn as little as a wage of $441 a week—as being the ones who should take a penalty rate cut. This is what 'good government' means to the government. They are going after the lowest paid workers and attacking them when it comes to their penalty rates.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is also the government whose Minister for Employment says that he has no problem with workers being sacked via text message and email with less than 24 hours notice: 'Check your email. You've been sacked', 'Check your email. You've been made redundant.' What kind of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IR" rel="nofollow">
         IR
        </a>
        minister does not stand beside workers when a company behaves that way? That is bad government. That is not good government. Australians want to know when good government is going to start.
