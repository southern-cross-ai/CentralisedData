        My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister update the House on the actions that the government and the national security authorities are taking to keep Australians safe.

         I thank the member for Hughes for his question, and I reiterate that the safety of our community is the highest priority of government. I can inform the House that earlier today there were raids in Melbourne involving some 100
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Victoria Police
         </a>
         officers. These were raids against a suspected terrorist-funding operation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Just as it is against Australian law to fight with terrorist groups overseas, it is against Australian law to fund terrorist groups overseas. Regrettably, there are some 60 Australians, that we know of, fighting with terrorist groups in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
          Middle East
         </a>
         . Equally regrettably, there are some 100 Australians, that we know of, who are supporting terrorist groups overseas through recruitment or funding activities.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to make it absolutely crystal clear: anyone who supports terrorists is complicit in the dreadful deeds they do. Anyone who actively supports terrorists is putting Australian lives at risk, because terrorist activity in the Middle East is now reaching back here to us in Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         I can, however, today confirm that $20 million to help
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AUSTRAC" rel="nofollow">
          AUSTRAC
         </a>
         prevent terrorist funding was part of the $630 million boost to our security agencies that the government announced last month. I can also reiterate that Australia is determined to play our part in the campaign against terrorist groups here and abroad. Subject to further consideration by cabinet, our objective is to support governments that do not commit genocide against their own people, nor allow their territory to support terrorism against our people. So our intention is to disrupt and degrade the activities of the ISIL death cult, both here and abroad, because at this time international security and national security are indivisible. But I reiterate that this government—with, I am sure, the support of the opposition—will do whatever is possible to keep our people safe.
        </p>
        <p>
         Again, with the support of the opposition we are targeting terrorism not religion, and I would urge Australians to go about their normal lives, because the objective of the terrorists is to scare us out of being ourselves.
