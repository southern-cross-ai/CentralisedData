       <p>
        Last week, a tragic evil struck our wonderful Goldstein community. Brighton's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_Street" rel="nofollow">
         Bay Street
        </a>
        turned from a vibrant shopping village into the scene of a siege, an horrific two-hour hostage incident. An innocent man, Kai 'Nick' Hao, was murdered by a gunman who should not be dignified by giving his name and who claimed inspiration from Islamic extremism. The gunman had been on parole since 1 November, and had a long record of serious criminal offences. The courageous efforts of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Operations_Group" rel="nofollow">
         Special Operations Group
        </a>
        of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victoria_Police" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        meant that, thankfully, the female hostage walked away unharmed. Our thoughts of course remain with the three injured officers, and we thank them very much for their service to the Victorian community. Most importantly, our thoughts are with the family of the victim. Nick's mother has said that she feels like her world has ended.

        The Goldstein electorate office has been inundated with sentiments of support in the wake of this terrible tragedy, and many have one simple message: enough is enough. As lifelong Bayside resident Katherine put it, 'We should be free and safe to walk the streets and attend school and work.' And the Turnbull government agrees. We live in our community because it provides a secure environment in which to live freely, have a family and retire with dignity and safety. Like all wounds, this one will heal, but there is a scar. We can never allow terror to become the norm on our streets, and I hope all members will agree with me.
