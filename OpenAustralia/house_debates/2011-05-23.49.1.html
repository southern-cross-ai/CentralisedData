       <p>
        I would like to make an announcement relating to the Murray-Darling Basin inquiry. As Chair of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Standing Committee
        </a>
        on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regional_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Regional Australia
        </a>
        , I rise to inform the House that the committee will not be presenting its report on the Murray-Darling inquiry within the time frame requested by the Minister for Regional Australia, Regional Development and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government
        </a>
        . The minister requested that the committee report by May. The substantial body of evidence provided to the inquiry requires—as I am sure everybody is aware—due consideration. The committee is very aware of the need to provide certainty to basin communities, as we have heard time and time again across the basin. The way to certainty is through the timely development and presentation of a basin plan. This is also commonly acknowledged as a fact; however, it is important to find the right balance in the basin. It must take into account the needs of the environment and the communities.

        The committee is of the view that it is worth taking a little additional time to make informed recommendations for how to address the issues in the Murray-Darling Basin, particularly considering the failures that came to light with the release of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority's
        <i>
         Guide to the proposed basin plan
        </i>
        in October 2010. The committee is endeavouring to present its report to the House in as timely a fashion as possible. So it is with a sense of courtesy that I notify the House today that the committee will be taking a little bit longer—not too much longer, I hope. As chair of the committee, I congratulate the committee members from all political backgrounds who have worked very well together on this particular report. We are in the final throes of presenting the report. As I said, it is a courtesy today to let the minister and the House know that we will be taking a little bit longer. I also take this opportunity to thank the secretariat for the very diligent and untiring work that they have put in. I think we will present a report to the House that all sides of politics will be proud of.
