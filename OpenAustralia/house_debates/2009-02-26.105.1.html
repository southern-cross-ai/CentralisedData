        The horrendous bushfires in Victoria and the devastation that they have wrought have caused great concern throughout the community. There was a great sense of hopelessness yet a strong feeling that every person throughout Australia wanted to contribute and help in some way. I think the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
         TV
        </a>
        coverage made it so real and brought it into everybody’s living room. My office—and, I am sure, the office of every member of this House—was contacted by numerous people wishing to do something. Because of this massive uprising in the community, I decided to organise a fundraiser. The fundraiser was initially planned for the first weekend after the bushfires but, unfortunately, unlike Victoria, we had torrential rain and the fundraiser had to be postponed, instead being held last Sunday.

        It was an enormous success, with nearly $17,000 being raised. It was a whole-of-com-munity response. I want to take this opportunity to thank those people that were involved in this fundraising event. I was supported by the state member for Swansea,

        The success of the day was because it was a whole-of-community event. Everybody in the community got behind it. Businesses donated prizes and sausages for the sausage sizzle, and Mega Mania donated a jumping castle and fun activities free of charge. It was an outstanding success. It was a comment on what a wonderful community I am privileged to represent in this parliament.
