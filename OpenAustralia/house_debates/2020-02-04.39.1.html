         The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the member's question:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         In March 2017, the Secretaries Group on Climate risk tasked the Departments of Defence and the Environment and Energy to jointly manage the development of scenarios to examine climate risks and implications for public policy responses. This body of work was referred to as "Project Climate Ready" and developed scenarios that considered climate change impacts on various matters over various time periods, including health and wellbeing, cities, infrastructure and energy security.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Defence developed an initial scenario that was considered by the Secretaries Group on

         , and two subsequent scenarios that were considered by various departments from the Australian Government Disaster and Climate Resilience Reference Group (Resilience Reference Group). The scenarios were developed with consultation across Government including

         , and the Prime Minister and Cabinet. Defence was not involved in the preparation of subsequent scenarios, but participated in the fourth exercise, which completed the scope of works in February 2019.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Defence and the Department of the Environment and Energy reported on the outcomes of respective scenarios to the Resilience Reference Group and the Secretaries Group on Climate Risk. The outcomes have supported the understanding of climate risks that are common across the public service and informed the development of cross-agency approaches to frameworks to consider climate risk. Information related to the scenario exercise reports was released publicly through a
