       <p class="italic">
        (1) recognises:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the importance of Australia's Free Trade Agreements (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTA" rel="nofollow">
         FTA
        </a>
        s), which now include nations in three continents—

        </a>
        and Asia;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) Australia's three most recent FTAs negotiated and signed in 2014 with Japan,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" rel="nofollow">
         South Korea
        </a>
        and China and the positive security, stability and economic prosperity which will result from each of these mutually constructive agreements;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) the Government's intention to continue to enhance current and future trade and investment opportunities for the long term advantage of all Australian citizens; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) the significant personal contribution made by the Minister for Trade and Investment in securing FTAs with Japan, South Korea and China in 2014;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) acknowledges the following advantages of FTAs to Australia as being:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) removing potentially billions of dollars of tariff imposts for foreign produced consumer goods (including, clothes, shoes, car components, cars and electronics);
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) enhancing capital flows into Australian agriculture, finance, tourism, infrastructure and mining as a result of streamlined approval procedures for foreign state owned investors;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) improving primary agriculture, particularly dairy, beef, lamb, wine and horticulture as a result of overseas tariffs being phased out over time;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) streamlining licensing and reducing restrictions on Australian services firms, including banks, insurance companies, financial fund managers, as well as law, architecture and engineering firms; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) providing cheaper and more streamlined visa approval procedures, making it easier to undertake reciprocal travel, work and study in Australia and relevant trade partner nations; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) notes the continuing importance of trade between nations and of Australian formal FTAs in supporting both global and regional stability, as well as Australian long term economic prosperity, all of which are emphasised by Australia's unique geopolitics.
