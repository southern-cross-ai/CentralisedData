        Rugby union has a proud history in my electorate. One of the oldest clubs on the

        Rugby Club. The Hillies, as they are better known, have been playing rugby since 1892. 2019 has been an exceptional year for the club. I want to pay tribute to all the players, coaches and volunteers who have contributed to the club's success. This year the Hillies came second in the suburban rugby club championship, with all four of the senior men's grades contesting the grand finals. The fourth and second grade teams took out their premierships, with the first and third grade teams going down in very tough deciders. I joined the supporters for the first grade match. It was an exciting game, with only one point in the final result. In junior rugby the club won three of the four grand finals it contested.

        I want to particularly acknowledge the club for its development of women's rugby. In only their third year, the Hunters Hill women's rugby team were crowned second division champions, which points to their successful growth.

        Clubs like Hunters Hill rely on the support of their volunteers. I acknowledge the incredible work of Board President Andrew Skelly, Seniors Chairman Luke McCormack, Women's Rugby Chair Lauren Salmon, Juniors Chairman Adam Latham and all their respective committees. And 2020 will be an even bigger year for the club with the commencement of the long awaited
