        Many people in my electorate are rightly concerned about access to health care, particularly to see their
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        . I want to thank everyone in my electorate who has contacted me about this, for sharing their concerns and experiences about accessing their GP and bulk billing services. I also want to thank those GPs who have explained to me how they feel burnt out and anxious over whether they can handle the enormous pressures of working in health care.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know that access to health care can have real impacts on people's health and life. A deferred trip to the GP because of cost or unavailability can mean serious consequences down the track. And, of course, it's not just individuals who suffer because of this. Health problems left unaddressed mean people struggle with coping with their lives. They are less able to work, to study, to care for children, to be productive.
       </p>
       <p>
        We didn't get here by chance. This has happened due to nine long years of Liberal government cuts and neglect regarding Medicare. It's never been harder or more expensive to see a doctor than it is now. The former government froze Medicare rebates for six years, ripping billions of dollars out of primary care and causing gap fees to skyrocket. It's not surprising that doctors are now leaving general practice in their droves. But, now that the grown-ups are back in charge, we are cleaning up the mess left by the Liberal coalition. Afterall, Labor is the party of Medicare. We created Medicare, and we will protect it.
       </p>
       <p>
        We're giving our doctors the resources to invest in their GP practices through a $220 million Strengthening Medicare—General Practice Grants Program. We are also investing $146 million to attract and retain more health workers in rural and regional Australian areas, like my electorate of Corangamite, with improved training and incentive programs. And we're reducing costs for people who are looking to study nursing.
       </p>
       <p>
        In our first budget, we cut the price of scripts for general patients by $12.50 a script.

        we cut the price of 2,000 brands of medicines, putting $130 million back into the pockets of hardworking Australians. In November we extended the Seniors Health Card to thousands and thousands more self-funded retirees so they'd get access to cheaper medicines as well. And, on 1 January, with our cheaper medicines policy, we delivered the biggest cut to the price of medicines in the 75-year history of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_Benefits_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
         Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme
        </a>
        . Already, in just the first 2½ months of the scheme, we've put $36 million back into the pockets of Australian patients.
       </p>

        Locally, we've announced one of 20 endometriosis clinics and pelvic pain centres to be located at Kardinia Health in Belmont. Too many people suffer from excruciating pain and delayed diagnosis. These women go through so much, and it's about time that we shed light on this hidden and often debilitating condition. This clinic will give them the best treatment.
       </p>
       <p>
        In another reform, we will open one of 50 urgent-care clinics in Geelong. This will address people's non-life-threatening injuries and conditions. Instead of going to emergency, they can go to this clinic. It's going to mean less stress for health workers, it's going to mean people get treated quicker and it will mean that we can focus in our emergency departments on saving lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        These investments are important. Our government knows this. We want to strengthen Medicare and we want to give people the health services they deserve. After nine long years of Liberal neglect, it is time. It is time for these investments. Labor will continue to support people in their health needs. We are certainly committed to ensuring that the health and wellbeing of our citizens are paramount.
