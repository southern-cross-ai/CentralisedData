        I rise to thank the hardworking members of my local

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osborne_Park" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        for their commitment in keeping the proud RSL spirit alive and for their work with our young people. The Osborne Park RSL subbranch would have to be one of the oldest in my home state of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        , with a charter that dates back to 14 April 1919. Its members still proudly own the same hall that was built in that first year and they continue to join together every month to enjoy camaraderie over an Aussie barbecue.
       </p>
       <p>
        Often around 70 members will turn up on the day of these meetings, out of a total membership of 159, which more than tells the story of what a wonderful job the committee is doing in running the subbranch.

        This leads me to proudly put my support behind the Osborne Park RSL subbranch’s latest community project, aimed at engaging local schoolchildren. The project is designed to help local primary school students appreciate the history of important events such as Anzac Day as well as the history of the RSL itself and of the Osborne Park subbranch. Members plan to invite schoolchildren from both Osborne Park and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Kieran" rel="nofollow">
         St Kieran
        </a>
        ’s primary schools to have lunch with them once each month from February to May next year so the students can chat with the ex-service men and women. This will be especially important in the lead-up to and on Anzac Day as it is just so important that our young people not only get involved but understand the sacrifice that was made by so many Australians in the defence of freedom.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hearing these stories from the members will no doubt be a rewarding and educational experience for our next generation of young Australians. Members will also be firing up the barbecue as normal; however, extra emphasis will be placed on providing the youngsters with a healthy meal. Principals from both schools, Red Berson from St Kieran’s and Greg Tompsett from Osborne Park, are also very supportive of this project. I know that both schools are always working hard to promote health attitudes, both in and out of the classroom, and they have had much success in doing so.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Osborne Park RSL subbranch is celebrating its 87th anniversary this year and once again I would like to congratulate its members for doing a wonderful job within my local area. I would suggest that RSL subbranches around the country take a look at this great project and perhaps endeavour themselves to work as closely with our young Australians as my subbranch in Osborne Park is.
