        . Will the minister please update the House on how the Morrison government continues to improve community safety and national security in a strong and certain way by tackling head-on the threat posed to Australia by serious organised crime? Is the minister aware of any alternative approaches?

         I thank the member for his question. Like everyone on this side of the House, he knows that the safety and security of our local communities relies on the strong approach that this government has taken on a whole range of issues. Strong borders, a strong stand against those who commit crimes, a tougher approach to sentencing: these are the things that Australians know they can rely on a coalition government to deliver.
        </p>
        <p>
         It's in stark contrast to those opposite. Frankly, it's quite disturbing that they don't want us to be here talking about national security or community safety. Australians clearly want to feel safe and secure in their communities. They want their government to be out there every single day doing everything they can to ensure that they are safe and secure. Unfortunately, Labor seems to be very focused on being a small target—a teeny target, in fact. It's very focused on trying to slide in—

           It's relevance, Mr Speaker. We get 30 seconds. All we hear are the words 'strong' and 'tough'. There's no substantive answer to any question, and then we enter into a spray on the opposition.

              </a>
              was asked about alternative approaches. This is probably a good opportunity to touch on this issue, as I have done previously, in relation to times. Three-minute answers are provided under the standing orders. There's no set ratio of how much a minister should—
             </p>
             <p>
              That's not very helpful, Minister for Defence. There's no set ratio as to how much time a minister needs to provide on certain aspects of a question. Having said that, I would remind ministers that there needs to be a reasonable attempt at looking at one's own government's policies, for example. I would ask ministers to reflect on that. The Minister has the call.

              <p>
               I think it's very fair for the Australian people to be able to have the opportunity to witness the very stark contrast between the Morrison government and those opposite, who have been reasonably silent on a range of issues but particularly on community safety and national security matters.
              </p>
              <p>
               People in Australia will soon be making a choice. On this side of the House, they have a government that has a very strong track record of being strong on national security matters. Particularly I would go to our track record on border security. Earlier today, I indicated once again the track record that Labor, those opposite, have and the mess that we were left to clean up on this side of the House. We have done that. We have demonstrated time and time again that, on matters of border security, community safety and national security, the track record and the record of delivery sits with the coalition government.
              </p>
              <p>
               We have had some significant legislation before the House this week. I speak specifically about the legislation in relation to firearms and to trafficking. It's very interesting the positions that have been taken by Labor. I do say 'positions' quite deliberately, because we had the opposition spokesperson saying earlier today that she hadn't read the legislation and she wasn't aware of it being introduced—but it was introduced yesterday. So it really is time for Labor to wake up.
