        As members of parliament, from time to time we see fantastic programs operating within our local communities. One such program in the Shortland electorate is operating out of the career skills education section at Belmont
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . It is federally funded under the Youth at Risk program and it is for 15- to 16-year-olds who have become disengaged from school. This program is getting some fantastic outcomes. The course is at certificate

        level and includes vocational as well as general education units. The aim is to engage young people so that they complete the course, gain some vocational skills and then move on and find employment. There is a variety of organisations involved with the program: the Lake Macquarie

        , a counselling organisation and the schools where the disengaged students come fromâ€”and I know there is a particularly close relationship with

        . Initially, 19 youths were assessed and enrolled. Their literacy and numeracy was assessed and, as a consequence, they have received intensive literacy and numeracy support. The students' behaviour was challenging and that was expected. They lacked concentration, were unable to listen to direction or accept authority and had issues about how they related to other people. The course teachers were aware of these difficulties and the disadvantage of these young people, and the course was structured around those needs. This initiative has been really beneficial to those young students. These youth at risk students are now happy to be there and their attendance is very consistent. Community service youth work students are satisfying their requirements with their work placements. The staff involved have also benefited from their involvement with these young people. The staff-student ratio is one on one. The trial has been at Belmont TAFE and it has worked well with the schools. This is a great program, it involves volunteer tutors and trained qualified teachers and it has enhanced the relationship between the TAFE and local high schools.
