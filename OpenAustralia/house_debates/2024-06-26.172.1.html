       <p>
        It is my pleasure to speak about the next phase of Labor's implementation of Revive, which is the new Australian National Cultural Policy. I love the word 'reviver' in this context. Not only is it a palindrome; it means something that re-energises, restrengthens and revitalises, and it is what our arts sector deserves.
       </p>
       <p>
        To say that Australian artist, performers, writers and musicians have had a tough time over the last decade is an understatement. First there were the bleak years of cuts, mismanagement, policy neglect and confusion when the opposition was in government. The undoubted lowlight of this was the cutting of $104 million of funding in the 2015 budget under
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott" rel="nofollow">
         Tony Abbott
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Brandis" rel="nofollow">
         George Brandis
        </a>
        , the arts minister. As one of my constituents, a published novelist, said of the cuts, 'They not only damaged the amount of work that could be produced, but to be so little valued at a government level was a shocking attack on morale.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Then came the pandemic, which had a devastating impact on the arts and on anything that basically required public attendance. We all remember the rolling lockdowns, the health directives and the social distancing restrictions that constrained so much of cultural life, particularly live music. In many cases it shut down artists totally. And with that, of course, came significant consequences such as reduced and unreliable incomes and, flowing on from that, job losses for many of those involved in the arts sector.
       </p>
       <p>
        Revive was launched by the Prime Minister, who we know is a great lover of the arts. I know he's a great lover of the arts because I've been to see
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billy_Bragg" rel="nofollow">
         Billy Bragg
        </a>
        with him two times in Brisbane and once in Canberra. In fact, he even introduced me to Billy Bragg, which was one of my political highlights. The Prime Minister did that launch in January 2023.
       </p>
       <p>
        Revive has been enthusiastically welcomed by so many. It is a five-year plan to revitalise Australia's arts sector. Revive supports our creative Australians whether they're artists, contemporary dancers, poets, playwrights, singers, theatre directors or back-of-house people. Revive recognises and celebrates Australian stories, Australian culture and Australian heritage.
       </p>
       <p>
        The key themes, or pillars, behind Revive articulate what this looks like. It's about recognition and respect for the place of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nation" rel="nofollow">
         First Nation
        </a>
        stories at the centre of our cultural life. How proud are we to have the oldest words on earth at the heart of our culture! This confirms that there is a place for every story. In fact I came up here from a Google event where I was talking to the Mechanics, who have a couple of million hits on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube" rel="nofollow">
         YouTube
        </a>
        . They create content out on the bush at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnhem_Land" rel="nofollow">
         Arnhem Land
        </a>
        , and it's going all around the world. Kids love it. It's incredible. When we tell our stories the world will listen. So there is a place for every story reflecting and valuing the immense diversity that is Australian 2024. It puts the artist at the centre, supporting and celebrating their work, and it also channels to the infrastructure and institutions around them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, Revive recognises the importance of connecting with audiences both here and around the world. It's good for diplomacy, good for trade and good for safety in our region when we tell those Australian stories and they're heard by our neighbours, all things that we need while maintaining control over our part of the earth—which is11 per cent of the earth's surface. It's a difficult job so we need to have good friends and good connections with our neighbours.
       </p>
       <p>
        Revive also outlined 10 core principles and I want to highlight a couple. The first of these is the development of long-term and sustainable career pathways for creatives and arts workers, and the second is that these pathways will be supported by fair renumeration, industry standards and safe and inclusive workplaces. My philosophy is always that the artist must be paid. People say, '
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
         Can I
        </a>
        have that for free?' Remember the artist should always be paid. Try to use a service, read a book, see an artwork—whatever rewards the artist.
       </p>
       <p>
        These measures will assist in providing stability and clarity to the people in the arts sector who did it tough during the pandemic. Labor has made substantial progress with Revive since January last year. Creative Australia, the overarching body for the arts—some might have known it formerly as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Council
        </a>
        —was launched in August last year. We then established
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Music Australia
        </a>
        to support the contemporary music industry—perhaps reflecting Minister Burke and the Prime Minister's interest in music—including supporting contemporary music and creative workplaces which focus on workplace safeguards and best practices.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Creative Australia Implementation of Revive Bill will deliver the final two pieces of the puzzle, with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        Arts and Writing Australia, which I'm particularly passionate about. The Albanese Labor government strongly values the crucial place of First Nations stories at the centre of Australia's cultural life. For 65,000 years, this land has echoed with the stories, music, art and dance of Aboriginal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        people. As many Australians know, the oldest art on earth is First Nations art. Imagine that—we're connected with the first artists on this planet. First Nations Arts will commence in 2024, and it will be a dedicated new body to support and promote Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander arts. The body will have the autonomy to control the allocation of its investments. In keeping with the principles of Creative Australia, this will be First Nations led and overseen by a board of 10 members, all expert First Nations people. The board's remit entails promoting best practice in cultural protocols, providing financial assistance to support arts practice and reporting to the Creative Australia board.
       </p>
       <p>
        The establishment of First Nations Arts builds on the substantial work already undertaken by Revive. This includes the Australian action plan for the International Decade of Indigenous Languages and the provision of continued support for First Nations people to express and promote their culture through language and the arts. Just as an aside, having been in this parliament for nearly 17 years, one of the policies that I'm most proud of is that schools around the country can now access support to pay for someone to teach a First Nations language in their schools, whether it be in Tasmania, Hobart, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_End" rel="nofollow">
         Top End
        </a>
        , Cairns or wherever. That's one of my proudest achievements—that we're able to turn a policy from opposition into a reality in government.
       </p>
       <p>
        We also continue to advocate for the unconditional return of First Nations ancestors and priceless cultural heritage artefacts held both domestically and internationally. The establishment of First Nations Arts builds on the substantial work undertaken already by Revive, as I said, and it's particularly important for the International Decade of Indigenous Languages. How good would it be to have Australia helping to lead that process, with our First Nations ambassador going around the world telling that story?
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill also establishes Writing Australia, a new body to support and promote Australian literature. I am all for this—not just because I was an English teacher for 11 years but also because I've published three fiction books and I've co-authored one biography with my good friend Wayne Long, which is currently out. So writing is a subject close to my heart, and it's something that I try to do every single day, apart from when I'm in Canberra. Writers have wholeheartedly welcomed the establishment of this dedicated funding body, with one saying:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It acknowledges how central writing is for other pieces of creative work—all of which inspire the conversations about who we are as a country.
       </p>
       <p>
        Writing Australia will start on 1 July next year, and it will be responsible for supporting authors, illustrators and publishers to create new work. The key word here is 'create'. My conversations with writers in Brisbane's vibrant literary community indicate that financially supporting themselves to write is, as one of them said, 'a tough gig at the best of times'. I can personally attest to that, as someone who's sat around in bookstores trying to sell one's books. I'm glad I've got a day job outside of publishing. But I will be at

          I will take that interjection—it might sell more if it were on special!
         </p>
         <p>
          Having support to do the work will have such a positive impact. It is also recognition for the hours and hours of work that go into that glossy book that you pick out at the bookshop, download on your Kindle or select to listen to as an audiobook. I'm particularly excited by the opportunities that Writing Australia will provide for emerging writers and writers from diverse backgrounds who have important stories to share as our society changes and grows. Writing Australia will also establish a national poet laureate. This is something that I actually mentioned in my first speech, way back in February 2008—about trying to bring more poetry back to the parliament but also to the Australian people. That's been 16 years in the making. It's good to see that Minister Burke is making it a reality.
         </p>
         <p>
          There is a clear need to support the sector as a whole. Australia Reads tells us that national reading rates are falling. A recent study showed that 25 per cent of Australians did not read a single book over the course of a year. New technologies are also changing the landscape. Writing Australia will promote Australian literature while applying innovative approaches to funding models tapping into the commercial sector. As I mentioned, a lot of people now are listening to books, which is another way to access good writing. It will invest in a network of key organisations and develop sector initiatives at a national level. All of this will lead to increasing markets both at home and abroad. We want Writing Australia to become a hub for writers, illustrators and publishers so that they can be front of mind during policy development and all benefit from these partnerships.
         </p>
         <p>
          Despite the current challenges and the recovery from funding cuts, the Australian literary community is vibrant and bursting with stories to tell. It is supported by extraordinary initiatives such as AustLit, the definitive biographical and bibliographical database of Australian literature. I'm not just talking about AustLit because I'm the only member of parliament to have an AustLit record for fiction, or so I'm reliably informed by my constituent who helps run AustLit! But I am bringing it to the attention of members here because it is part of the cultural infrastructure that Revive champions. One of the 10 principles of Revive is the restoration, building and maintenance of digital collections. AustLit also proudly contains BlackWords, a comprehensive record of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nation" rel="nofollow">
           First Nation
          </a>
          s storytelling—the primary pillar of Revive.
         </p>
         <p>
          AustLit is a fully digitised, not-for-profit collaboration amongst researchers and librarians. It's housed at the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
           University of Queensland
          </a>
          , in the electorate of Ryan, just over the river from my electorate. It began in the 1970s as a card catalogue and was officially launched as a telnet service by former prime minister
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gough_Whitlam" rel="nofollow">
           Gough Whitlam
          </a>
          in 1988, back when this building was opened. In 2024 it is rightly recognised as a central resource in Australia's national digital creative, literary and research infrastructure. We can all be proud of AustLit. No other country has attempted to compile a comprehensive national record of every work of creative writing and its associated criticism and reviews. This remarkable living database adds to its one million-plus entries daily. It also covers film and television, popular theatre history and awards and festivals—all significant aspects of Australia's cultural history. It is a national treasure.
         </p>
         <p>
          The establishment of Writing Australia will bolster the next generation of well-supported writers, illustrators, publishers and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
           First Nations
          </a>
          storytellers. Their records will find a home in AustLit. These, in turn, will nurture knowledgeable audiences, as well as foster creative and research projects both in Australia and internationally. Perhaps most importantly it will enable AustLit to build on its long history of creating new ways of understanding who we are and how this understanding has changed over time. As more diverse voices tell their stories, this understanding will continue to evolve and flourish.
         </p>
         <p>
          This bill continues the proud Labor tradition of supporting and valuing the arts and showcases the Albanese Labor government's steadfast commitment to the arts. I particularly commend Minister Burke for his great work in this area. The establishment of First Nations Arts and Writing Australia will foster work that creates shared experiences and human connections. It will add to the rich catalogue of creative work that tells the story of our country. It helps us to understand it, to understand ourselves and to further strengthen our national identity. A writer friend told me, 'We tell stories to make sense of who we are.' I'm proud to support this bill for the contributions its institutions will make to our combined national story. I commend the bill to the House.

          <p>
           About this time last year parliament passed the Creative Australia Bill, which established
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Music Australia
           </a>
           and Creative Workplaces. It was the first legislative step in implementing the new national cultural policy, Revive. Today we're debating the establishment of two new parts of Creative Australia:
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nation" rel="nofollow">
            First Nation
           </a>
           s Arts and Writing Australia. At the outset, I want to make clear that I'm supportive of the Revive policy and I commend the government for its efforts in setting out a clear plan to encourage the Australian arts, entertainment and cultural sector to grow and thrive.
          </p>
          <p>
           I'm fully supportive of this bill, the Creative Australia Amendment (Implementation of Revive) Bill 2024, particularly the attention on recognising and respecting the crucial place of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
            First Nations
           </a>
           stories at the centre of Australia's arts and culture. It's so important that we amplify the stories of First Nations people. For millennia, First Nations history, educational stories and stories of country, creation and tradition have been passed down through generation after generation. Today, the practice of storytelling sustains communities, validates experiences, nurtures relationships and serves as a form of important cultural continuation for Indigenous peoples.
          </p>
          <p>
           I'm grateful to take this opportunity to talk about a First Nations theatre group in my electorate. It's a group the Minister for the Arts knows well, and we were happy to have him recently in Curtin to visit the group. Based in Subiaco,

It was established in 1993 with a successful funding application, three staff members and the aim to provide the Aboriginal community with an artistic outlet for positive self-determination. Since then,

           has evolved into a respected cultural leader and artistic hub for Aboriginal people from all over WA, Australia and around the world. Yirra Yaakin's education and community engagement programs support Indigenous trainees to be mentored, to develop skills and to work in the Australian theatre sector. Each year, they present youth-focused productions, undertake residencies and conduct workshops across the state. They tour locally and regionally, providing unique cultural experiences to some of the most remote communities in the world. Last week, I was told about Yirra Yaakin's work with education by distance—making sure kids studying in the most remote areas still have access to First Nations theatre and education. And I know that a number of people from Yirra Yaakin have been involved in consultations on this bill.
          </p>
          <p>
           The bill establishes the First Nations Board. The board has a number of functions, including to support and invest in a diverse range of Aboriginal and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
            Torres Strait Islander
           </a>
           arts practice, to promote best practice in First Nations cultural protocols in the arts and to provide financial assistance to support these functions.
          </p>
          <p>
           While the bill must be commended, I do want to mention two concerns raised with me. Both are in relation to the board's role in providing financial assistance. First, there's a need for a
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
            Western Australian
           </a>
           voice on the advisory board, and, secondly, the board will need to consider the tyranny of distance for Western Australian artists to travel and tour. The bill, as drafted, gives the minister discretion, with consultation with the co-chairs, to appoint First Nations Board members. The minister must be satisfied that the person is an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander person and has appropriate qualifications, knowledge, skills or experience. This is appropriate. But I think consideration of the geographical or regional composition of the First Nations Board should also be required, to ensure the board is representative of all states and territories. This would alleviate the concern I've heard, that the board might become east-coast-centric. While the government is not willing to amend the legislation to require this, I have spoken to the minister, who's given me an assurance that there will be Western Australian representation on this board.
          </p>
          <p>
           The second concern is linked to the need for full geographic representation—that we need to ensure that the different needs of each state are considered in the awarding of grants. In WA, Yirra Yaakin and others travel extreme distances to tour their shows and productions. The cost of touring in WA is much higher than it is in

            New South Wales
           </a>
           or Victoria. I'd like to see this recognised in how grants are awarded to recipients.
          </p>
          <p>
           I also want to make some comments in support of the establishment of Writing Australia. Olivia Lanchester,

           Literature has fallen through the gap between the arts and commercial activity. The general public thinks that authors get paid well by their publishers, but making a living as a writer in Australia is very challenging.

          </p>
          <p>
           I have wonderful memories of discovering a world of stories in high school thanks to my memorable English teacher, Mr Lloyd, who opened my eyes to the power of literature. The literature kids read must include Australian stories. Writing Australia represents an opportunity for national vision for literature. It will develop national industry initiatives and domestic and export opportunities for Australian stories and is welcomed by stakeholders. With only $19.3 million committed to Writing Australia over four years, it's a modest investment, but it is at least a start. Hopefully, it will provide an overall direction and a more cohesive plan than the ad hoc and uncoordinated funding provided by federal and state governments to literature in the past.
          </p>
          <p>
           Telling our unique Australian stories is so important—both First Nations stories, historical and current, and the stories of all Australians. They remind us who we are, challenge us to be better, make us listen and understand each other and help us form our collective Australian identity. Establishing a clear role for our art forms provides greater certainty and cements a place in our communities for the many people who passionately contribute to telling our evolving Australian story. I commend the bill to the House.

           <p>
            In May last year, I stood here to give my speech introducing Revive and reintroducing Australia's national cultural policy. I spoke of Labor's history, our commitment to the growth of our creative industries and how economically and culturally important it was to us on this side of the House and how important it was to our national identity. In that speech, I mentioned some of the key players of Labor governments of the past who helped build Australia's cultural policy into what we are building today.
           </p>
           <p>
            One of those people was the late
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Crean" rel="nofollow">
             Simon Crean
            </a>
            , who we lost at this time last year, give or take a day, at the age of 74. Simon was Labor leader from 2001 to 2003 and Minister for the Arts from 2010 to 2013 under Prime Minister Gillard, where he made a significant contribution to what is now known as Revive. On 13 March 2013, Simon launched the national cultural policy Creative Australia, which was the successor to Creative Nation, which was delivered by
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Keating" rel="nofollow">
             Paul Keating
            </a>
            in 1994. Simon considered Creative Australia to be a fresh expression of the values and priorities that would sustain Australia as a richly creative society in the 21st century, and it continued the spirit of engagement with the arts embraced by ex Labor prime ministers
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gough_Whitlam" rel="nofollow">
             Gough Whitlam
            </a>
            and Paul Keating. Minister Crean described Creative Australia at the time as being 'about creating excellence, creating jobs, creating prosperity, creating opportunity and creating unique Australian stories, all vital to an outward-looking, competitive and confident nation.'
           </p>
           <p>
            Labor is proudly and unashamedly the party of the worker, and that includes every worker's right to enjoy and explore creative expression. We are not just units of economic production. Workers are human beings, deserving of the full range of the human experience. Creative Australia presented a vision and strategy to place arts and culture at the centre of modern Australian life. It spoke of five overarching goals developed in close consultation with the community. Simon Crean was a passionate advocate for artists during his time as minister and after that as well, when he served as chair of McClelland Gallery. He was also an enthusiastic supporter of the

            and always understood and championed the value of arts in Australian society. More than a decade on, we are standing on the shoulders of giants as we revive Simon Crean's vision. His goals left a lasting legacy and established the framework that was central to the development of this

            government's cultural policy, Revive.
           </p>
           <p>
            Culture and arts have an intrinsic value, but, for the hardheads amongst us, they have economic value as well, generating $13 billion a year and employing around 336,000 Australians. The Albanese Labor government are delivering on all the commitments we made in Australia's new national cultural policy. In the year since we launched Revive, we have already made strides in supporting our creative sector. We have established Creative Australia to modernise arts funding; reversed the Brandis cuts; established Creative Workplaces to improve workplace standards and safety; established
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             Music Australia
            </a>
            to support the contemporary music industry; established Sharing the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Collection" rel="nofollow">
             National Collection
            </a>
            so art is shared with regional and suburban galleries; extended lending rights so Australian writers are better paid; boosted funding for performing arts training organisations; provided more support for games developers, through
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             Screen Australia
            </a>
            ; improved tax breaks for the video games industry; and increased funding to Sounds Australia to unlock international opportunities for our musicians—and the work goes on.
           </p>
           <p>
            But this bill further delivers on two key commitments announced in the national cultural policy. While we've established Creative Workplaces and Music Australia, this bill will establish two new bodies within Creative Australia:
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nation" rel="nofollow">
             First Nation
            </a>
            s Arts and Writing Australia, together with their respective governance bodies. The government respects and recognises the crucial place of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
             First Nations
            </a>
            stories at the centre of Australia's arts and culture, and my friend the member for Moreton spoke about this quite eloquently in his speech earlier today. It's why First Nations art was put as the first pillar of the cultural policy. Extensive consultations were led by Creative Australia and were held with First Nations communities in 2023 and at the beginning of 2024, and self-determined decision-making was seen as a priority.
           </p>
           <p>
            This government believes First Nations Arts should be, must be, First Nations led. First Nations Arts will be a dedicated new body to support and promote Aboriginal and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
             Torres Strait Islander
            </a>
            arts practice. The bill will establish a First Nations board to oversee the work of First Nations Arts. The First Nations board will be unique in that it will have autonomy over the allocation of funds for investment in First Nations Arts. The board will also promote best practice in cultural protocols, provide financial assistance to support arts practice, advise the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Council" rel="nofollow">
             Australia Council
            </a>
            board on the responsibilities of First Nation Arts and report its performance to the Australia Council board.
           </p>
           <p>
            Revive consists of five interconnected pillars, and the first pillar, First Nations First, ensures that we recognise and respect the crucial place of First Nations stories at the centre of Australia's arts and culture—and we are already delivering on this vital first pillar. Since the introduction of Revive, the government has been delivering for First Nations artists. This includes providing $5 million to upgrade training facilities at

            .
           </p>
           <p>
            We have launched Australia's action plan for the International Decade of Indigenous Languages, providing a framework to guide Australia's participation in the decade. The action plan was co-authored in partnership between the First Nations members of the directions group and the Australian government. We are providing continued support for First Nations people to express, conserve and maintain their culture through languages and the arts, under the Indigenous Languages and Arts program. And we continue to invest in First Nations arts centres, as well as pivotal sector organisations, through the Indigenous Visual Arts Industry Support program to benefit First Nations communities. We are continuing to seek the voluntary and unconditional return of First Nations ancestors and cultural heritage material held overseas and domestically, particularly the return of First Nations ancestors and secret sacred objects held in eight major museums.
           </p>
           <p>
            Writing Australia will be a new body to support and promote Australian literature. It will be responsible for supporting authors, illustrators and publishers to create new works; investing in a network of key organisations; developing national industry initiatives; and increasing national and international markets. Technology is disrupting the landscape for writers—that's an understatement—and there is a need for government policy to be modernised. Writing Australia has been designed to reach into the commercial sectors where traditional grants funding models have had limited success. This body will become a policy engine for the sector, building partnerships and expertise that will both support artists directly and benefit Australian audiences.
           </p>
           <p>
            This bill marks the completion of legislative changes to Creative Australia to enable the delivery of commitments under Revive. It is consistent with the government's strong commitment to our First Nations art and arts workers and to ensuring that our literature sector is world class and sustainable. Revive demonstrates the Albanese government's commitment to improving the quality of investment in the arts sector and to strengthening and streamlining access to support, including for artists and arts organisations.
           </p>
           <p>
            As Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Communications and the Arts, I am pleased to say that I am currently heading an inquiry into the Australian live music industry, which is another arm again. Since COVID, live music has suffered several setbacks, and it is another area we are taking seriously. Big festival events have cancelled or postponed over the past few years. We seek to uncover both the threats and the opportunities. A report by Creative Australia, based on a 2022 survey, indicates that something shifted in Australia's arts sector when COVID hit in March 2020. For instance, while 97 per cent of Australians said they engaged with the arts, and 68 per cent said they attended live events, attendance has been less frequent than pre COVID. Another report by the arts body found that just 56 per cent of Australian music festivals in the last financial year made a profit, citing impact from factors such as rising costs of insurance and policing. I am looking very much forward to hearing from organisers, event-goers and other stakeholders as our inquiry proceeds.
           </p>
           <p>
            Our National Cultural Policy is a broad, comprehensive road map for Australia's arts and culture that touches all areas of government, from cultural diplomacy and foreign affairs to health and education. Under Revive, there will be a place for every story and a story for every place, and Tasmania wants more freedom to tell its own story, in particular. Our artists are both creators and workers. This sector is essential for our culture and our economy. As the sector recovers from years of neglect, followed by the pandemic, Revive is setting the arts sector on a new trajectory with fresh momentum. I commend this bill to the House.

             . The sector employs around 193,600 Australians. In 2021 the broader creative economy, which includes both creative and non-creative roles within creative industries, employed some 714,000 people, making up some 5.9 per cent of the total workforce, so this is huge.

             But, numbers aside, we always have to be mindful that Australia is home to the oldest surviving culture in the world. With more investment,

             s art has gained the potential to reach greater audiences both within Australia and internationally. But we should always remember as well that Australia is an amazing, multicultural country, and through creative industries we can and must celebrate and explore all of the cultures and traditions that we have within Australia. The arts bring people together. They help reflect our national identity and cultural heritage. They provide a platform for storytelling, innovation and dialogue, allowing us to connect more deeply. They nurture our communities, they promote mental wellbeing and they play a crucial role in education by fostering critical thinking and creativity. The bill before us will expand many opportunities by investing in

             It's important to acknowledge though that it has at times been tough for the sector. We can give the positive numbers, but we also have to paint the real picture right now. For the Australian arts sector it is sometimes dire. It has been seriously underfunded, and it needs more policy support. I know, for example, within Warringah that we have an incredibly strong philanthropic community when it comes to a lot of arts. Recently I went to the launch of the Mosman Art Walk, which shows incredible pieces of artwork displayed through modern technology, identifying iconic landscapes and areas of the Warringah and Mossman coastline. I invite people to go and do that walk and appreciate the arts, the artists' points of view, the display and the landscape that has been depicted.

             Around 74 per cent of artists have a university degree, yet they earn significantly less than other professions that require similar levels of, or tertiary, education. Working artists earn an average income that is about 26 per cent below the national average, at about $54,500 per year. Generally, they always have to consider additional sources of income. The average income based solely on creative work is estimated to be around $23,200, with almost half of professional artists earning less than $10,000 a year from their creative work. Clearly, we have a gap between appreciating and valuing that creative output and making sure we support opportunities for them and recognising the role the arts play within our communities and within our cultural development and how we are as a society.
