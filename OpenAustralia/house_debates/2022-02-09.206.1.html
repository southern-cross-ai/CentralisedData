        Today I rise to congratulate local hero Dr Cuong Bui, who was appointed a member of the Order of Australia in the recent

        , refugee advocate and multicultural leader in Queensland, Dr Bui is a true hero of our community, particularly among his fellow members of the Vietnamese community here in Australia. For over 40 years, as part of the Vietnamese Community in Australia Queensland Chapter, he's been a leader and champion. Dr Bui has previously been awarded an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and is recognised for his outstanding service to Queensland's Vietnamese community and to the medical profession. I was pleased to strongly support his new honours award.
       </p>
       <p>
        I count Dr Bui as a dear personal friend, someone who has assisted me, advised me with wise counsel and partnered with me to speak out on freedom and democracy for Vietnam, shining a light and making sure we never forget the trauma and horrific loss of life of those who suffered during the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" rel="nofollow">
         Vietnam War
        </a>
        . He has done so much to ensure that Vietnamese Australians and their families are such a vital part of our rich multicultural community. I'm extremely proud of his achievements, as are the people of Oxley and the wider community, and I thank both him and his gracious wife, Dr Kim, who have served our community so well. Well done, Dr Cuong Bui AM.

        On a much sadder note, it is with much sadness that I express my condolences to the family of Mr Pat Passfield, who passed away on Thursday 27 January 2022. Pat was known simply as 'Positive Pat' and has been referred to as a modern-day
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forrest_Gump" rel="nofollow">
         Forrest Gump
        </a>
        and a doctor's delight. But whatever his nicknames were, Patrick Passfield was a legend in our community. You see, when Pat arrived at Wesley Mission Queensland's Jacobs Court aged-care community in June 2012, he was in a wheelchair. He'd just been through brain surgery, but he was determined to be up and walking by Christmas. And, of course, anyone who had the pleasure of knowing him through the following years knows that he did just thatâ€”and much, much more. He clocked over 21,000 kilometres, walking to raise money for vital pieces of equipment for residents of Youngcare at Sinnamon Village in my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know from talking to Pat over the years that he was always first on the phone, making sure that his community was looked after and that those who were disadvantaged were always put first. Positive Pat will be sorely missed by our community. He was a great mate of mine and I valued his wise counsel. I send my condolences to all of his family, particularly his sister, to whom I spoke a couple of weeks ago. Rest in peace, Pat. You've earned a rest.
