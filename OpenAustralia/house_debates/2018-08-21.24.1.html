       <p>
        Chaos is the only word you can use to describe this terrible government. They are directionless. All they really care about are their own jobs. I read today in the newspaper that backbenchers were concerned that they could lose their jobs because they have mortgages and kids that they're worried about. What about every other Australian? What about every other worker who currently is stuck in insecure work? What about the women who are relying on penalty rates but have had their penalty rates cut? This Liberal-National government refuses to back in those workers and restore the cuts to penalty rates.

       <p>
        The Australian people deserve a government that will stand up for them, that will get on and do the hard work, that will bring in the reforms and that will improve lives and things in their homes and communities. There's a lot in this country that needs to be tackled. There are issues with energy prices, issues in workplaces and issues in the community when it comes to long waiting lists. People who are trying to get their pension are stuck waiting because this government won't employ people to work at Centrelink to do the processing and answer the phones. This government should acknowledge that they've failed, call an election and let the Australian people elect a government that will serve them.
