        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Albanese government is working every day to deliver on our positive agenda to boost economic inclusion and broaden opportunity for all Australians. And as a Labor government, we will always work to support the most vulnerable in our society, tackle disadvantage and provide more opportunities to boost economic participation.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is why, in November last year, the Prime Minister announced the establishment of the Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee. The committee was tasked to provide advice to government ahead of every federal budget, on ways to boost economic inclusion and tackle disadvantage.
       </p>
       <p>
        An interim committee, comprised of a diverse range of experts, has commenced this important work, and it has delivered its first report, including advice on policy settings, systems and structures, and the adequacy, effectiveness and sustainability of income support payments, which helped to inform the government's considerations ahead of the 2023-24 budget.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now, with the introduction of the Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee Bill, we're delivering on the government's commitment to permanently establish the committee as a statutory body. This will ensure there is an ongoing mechanism for the provision of independent, expert advice to government on these important issues.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill reflects the Albanese government's commitment to hear from experts, stakeholders and the community. We recognise the value in ensuring a broad range of views are considered in the design and development of policy.
       </p>
       <p>
        And disadvantage is a complex and systemic problem. That is why the government, in our 2023-24 budget, announced the overhaul of the way Australia tackles entrenched disadvantage—by investing almost $200 million to deliver a comprehensive agenda to target investment in those communities doing it the toughest. The Targeting Entrenched Disadvantage Package will better enable government to partner with philanthropy, to listen to and empower local leaders, and work with communities to direct services in a way that meets their needs in a shared decision-making framework.
       </p>
       <p>
        We've also taken action to improve the economic inclusion of people across Australia, with more support to help with cost-of-living pressures. The 2023-24 budget announced a range of measures to support those on low incomes, including increasing the rates of working-age and student payments, and, of course, an increase in Commonwealth Rent Assistance, and expanding access to parenting payment (single).
       </p>
       <p>
        And yesterday, I introduced legislation to implement two social security measures announced in our employment white paper, which are designed to smooth the transition between income support and employment, and give people more support to get into work.
       </p>
       <p>
        But boosting economic inclusion and tackling disadvantage can't be resolved in a single budget process or indeed, through a single portfolio. It requires sustained commitment over time and across government. This bill will ensure there is an enduring mechanism for government to benefit from independent, expert advice on ways to support Australians in need, broaden opportunity, and reduce disadvantage in our communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Similar to the arrangements in place for the interim committee, the bill tasks the committee with reporting to government annually with this advice. Their scope includes advice on income support payments, options to reduce barriers to work and economic inclusion, particularly for long-term unemployed and disadvantaged or disengaged groups.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is also within the remit of the committee to provide advice on the impact of economic inclusion policies on gender equality, as well as cohorts that face barriers to work—such as people with caring responsibilities, Indigenous people, and people with disability. In addition, the committee may provide advice on inequality markers in Australia, as well as international comparisons.
       </p>
       <p>
        To assist the government's consideration of its advice, the bill requires the committee to demonstrate regard in its report, to the government's economic and fiscal outlook and fiscal strategy, workforce participation, relevant existing policies, and the long-term sustainability of the social security system in the overall context of the budget.
       </p>
       <p>
        While this committee is independent, it is also important that the government can leverage the expertise and advice of the committee to deliver on its agenda and priorities. To this end, the bill enables the Treasurer and Minister for Social Services to seek advice from the committee on specific issues, with this direction power designed to ensure that governments can get experts from the committee to leverage their expertise and advice—for instance, with respect to certain groups of people, a specific region, or a particular policy area.
       </p>
       <p>
        The advice to government will be transparent, with the government to publish the findings of the committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important that the membership of the committee reflects the diverse experience and expertise necessary for considering the complex and multifaceted issues of economic inclusion and disadvantage. As is the case for the interim arrangements currently in place, the committee is to include representatives of organisations who work closely with and represent the diverse views of people who can inform the committee of their lived experience of disadvantage.
       </p>
       <p>
        A chair and up to 13 members will be drawn from key advocacy organisations, the community sector, academia, unions, and the business sector, appointed by the Minister for Social Services, in consultation with the Treasurer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Members will hold office on a part-time basis for up to three years; however, they will be eligible for reappointment once their term ends. The positions are not remunerated; however, the government is ensuring ongoing support for the important work of the committee by providing $8.7 million over the forward estimates and $2.2 million per year ongoing. This funding is there to support the committee to commission its own research, undertake consultations, and for secretariat services to be provided by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Social Services
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill provides a range of further provisions for the operation of the committee, including the role of relevant departmental secretaries, the termination of members, acting appointments and absences of members. It also provides for periodic independent reviews of the operation of the committee and the act every five years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, it is also important to remember that this is an advisory committee, and its advice is non-binding. The government will continue to make the decisions necessary to improve the lives of our citizens. That is what Australians elect governments to do.
       </p>
       <p>
        But these decisions should be informed by consideration of the best possible advice from a range of sources. With this bill, we are establishing an enduring mechanism to receive advice from experts, stakeholders and community views. It is part of the Albanese government's plan to build a better future for all Australians, to broaden opportunity and to make Australia more inclusive.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the bill to the House.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
