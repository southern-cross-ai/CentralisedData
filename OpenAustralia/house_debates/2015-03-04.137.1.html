        Like the member for Lilley, I rise to commend some of the citizens from my electorate who received
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        Awards. I am not going to name quite as many as the member for Lilley, but I do have three wonderful citizens who were awarded a medal of the Order of Australia. Australia Day is not only an opportunity to welcome new citizens but also a chance for the community and the nation to commend the actions of outstanding Australians. In my electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Connor" rel="nofollow">
         O'Connor
        </a>
        , I was proud to see three very worthy citizens awarded a medal of the Order of Australia. The purpose of the Order of Australia is to recognise, by national honour, those who have made outstanding contributions that benefit their communities and ultimately our country. The second purpose of the Order of Australia is that it serves to define; encourage and reinforce community standards, national aspirations and ideals by acknowledging actions and achievements and thereby identify role models at all levels and in all spheres of the community. In Esperance, Pastor Sonny Graham was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        for his lifetime of service both to the Indigenous communities and the wider community of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        . Sonny credits his success to the mission where he grew up. After completing his tertiary studies he returned to Norseman as the mission's superintendent. He then began a career in education that extended from the Pilbara to the south coast, working as a linguistics consultant, Aboriginal liaison officer and more. As a Ngadju elder, Sonny has been rebuilding his people's language. He also played a major part in their native title determination which was recognised last year.

        Keith Bradby from Albany was awarded his OAM for service to conservation and the environment. In 2002 Keith helped found the

        program, a program to protect and restore biodiverse bushland in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_West" rel="nofollow">
         South West
        </a>
        of Western Australia. Gondwana Link is a world-recognised initiative that has led to changes throughout Australia and around the world. Keith has been actively involved in conservation, biodiversity and community development for nearly four decades. He has held positions in numerous other environmental organisations, such as the Fitzgerald River National Park Association, the Ravensthorpe Land Conservation District Committee and the Western Australian Soil and Land Conservation Council.

        Patrick Scallan from Greenbushes has followed in the footsteps of his father, also an Order of Australia medal recipient. Pat received his nomination in recognition of 20 years of service to the Greenbushes community. Pat has had a hand in shaping nearly every aspect of the Greenbushes community: if he was not the president of the Bridgetown-Greenbushes Junior Hockey Club, he was the chairman of the Bridgetown Eco Cultural Discovery Centre, or the vice-president of the Greenbushes Ratepayers and

        Sub Branch when I attended the Vietnam Veterans Day celebration last year. Originally from Rhodesia, I think Pat hit the nail on the head when he said: 'It does not matter where you come from, your background, your race, your creed. If you work hard and get stuck in, you are an Aussie.'

        Congratulations to all three gentlemen on being recognised with an Order of Australia.
