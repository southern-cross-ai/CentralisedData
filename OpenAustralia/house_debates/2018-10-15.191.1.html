       <p>
        It was great to see the Minister for Sport launch the Move It Australiaâ€”Better Ageing Grant Program last month. With our ageing population, it's more important than ever to get older Australians up and moving. The Better Ageing Grant Program has grants of up to $2 million available to help deliver sporting programs to Australians over 65. I want to encourage local sporting, local community, local non-government and local government organisations in my electorate to apply.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are some fantastic sporting initiatives in Bonner for seniors. Walking football is one of them, and it's taking off in the electorate. Bayside United Football Club and Wynnum 60 and Better Program have organised walking only soccer matches for older locals. I played one of their matches recently. Players told me that it was great to be able to participate in a team sport that wasn't too hard on their bodies but kept them active, fit and social. I have to thank Bayside United president Greg Pascal for championing the sport and helping it grow in the electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bayside United plans to run two walking football competitions in the near future. One will be for 50- to 59-year-olds; the other will be for over-60s. I actually turned 52 last week, so you could say I have a shot at a soccer championship one day! Actually, seeing how the players walked rings around me on the field the other day, I'd have really no chance! Well done to Bayside United and Wynnum 60 and Better. I can't wait to see things kick off soon.
