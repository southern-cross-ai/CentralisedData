        This morning Tasmanians woke up to learn 36 clinics had been announced to roll out the vaccine from next Monday—36. There are five seats in Tasmania. Divide that and you get just over seven clinics in each electorate, you would think. There are five in Lyons. The population is about even in each seat. There are 11 in Braddon and 10 in Bass.

They are not being listened to. Labor supports the vaccination rollout, but this government is stuffing it up from beginning to end.
