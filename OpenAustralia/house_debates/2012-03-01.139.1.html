        I have the pleasure of presenting a petition signed by 5,294 people, with the Australasian Podiatry Council as the principal petitioner, regarding Medicare funded allied health visits for diabetes related lower-limb problems, which has been considered by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Standing Committee
        </a>
        on Petitions and approved as in order.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <i>
         The petition read as follows—

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The petition of the undersigned certain citizens of Australia:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Draws to the attention of the House that in 2011 4,300 Australians will suffer a lower limb amputation due to diabetes related causes adding to the over $612 million in Australian healthcare costs due to diabetes foot complications. We believe Australian and overseas evidence shows that properly funded podiatry-led foot health care for Australians suffering diabetes-related lower limb problems could avoid over 3,000 of these amputations saving the health system over $300 million per annum.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We therefore ask the House to support any new legislation, or proposed amendments to existing legislation, or administrative arrangements, that would have the effect of ensuring access to at least 12 Medicare funded allied health visits per annum for Australians with diabetes-related lower limb problems.
       </p>
       <p>
        from 5,294 citizens
       </p>
       <p>
        Petition received.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am very pleased that today in the chamber we have Mr Andrew Schox, President, and Peter Lazzarini,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vice_President" rel="nofollow">
         Vice President
        </a>
        of the Australasian Podiatry Council. This petition by the Australasian Podiatry Council received tremendous support from both the medical fraternity and patients. In fact, it actually attracted 7½ thousand signatures but unfortunately some of them did not meet the requirements for tabling in this chamber today. Nevertheless, the significant number of petitioners demonstrates the overwhelming need to increase funding so that diabetes sufferers can access up to 12 visits for allied health services through Medicare.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a harrowing fact that every year more than 4,300 Australians with diabetes will have a foot or a part of their leg amputated. But nearly 80 per cent—that is, over 3,400—of these amputations are entirely preventable. Indeed, 85 people will undergo diabetic amputations every week in this country. That is quite alarming.
       </p>
       <p>
        The preventative measures are relatively simple, though. In fact, last year on 13 October the Podiatry Council, in conjunction with the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group, held a foot-check clinic at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        to demonstrate the ease with which thousands of amputations can be prevented. I would like to thank all of those who participated, particularly some of the senior members in this parliament—the cabinet secretary the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Dreyfus" rel="nofollow">
         Mark Dreyfus
        </a>
        and the shadow health minister the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Dutton" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        amongst others.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have to say that Peter Lazzarini, who is here with us in the chamber today, conducted excellent foot examinations. For the check, participants were simply asked to remove their shoes and socks—their footwear—and Mr Lazzarini, the Vice President, painlessly tested foot sensitivity. It means prodding with a sharp instrument but I can testify that it does not hurt.
       </p>
       <p>
        This simple test can not only save people's limbs but also save the government millions of dollars. Extending the number of Medicare funded appointments for podiatrists costs only a few hundred dollars per person but for every amputation the cost to government is immense. It may, indeed, run to something like $100,000 per patient, taking into account the time spent in hospital and the follow-up treatment and care that is needed after an amputation. This is not to mention the productivity issue of these people perhaps being lost to the workforce or having to take up a different occupation at some time or to take on casual work rather than full-time work, and sometimes have to have a carer at home caring for them who is then taken out of the workforce as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a pretty simple remedy. The Australian Podiatry Council notes that across Australia the cost of diabetes-related lower limb amputation adds up to over $612 million per year in healthcare costs—over half a billion dollars—but, if the number of Medicare funded podiatry appointments is increased, more medical complications can be picked up earlier, saving over 3,400 amputations and up to $330 million in cost to the government. Such a saving is possible because people often do not appreciate the severity of problems that can arise from a simple cut or an abrasion to the feet, or even in some cases where someone tried to self-treat a corn on their toe. Diabetes often causes nerve damage and poor circulation. The nerve damage means that people may not feel a stone in the shoe or a small cut to their feet and such wounds take longer to heal due to poor circulation, severely increasing the risk of infection—in some cases gangrene, which of course then leads to amputation.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank the Australasian Podiatry Council for their efforts in bringing this issue to the attention of this parliament. On behalf of the Parliamentary Diabetes Support Group I would urge the government to increase the Medicare benefit for visits to a podiatrist.
