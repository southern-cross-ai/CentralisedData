       <p>
        Last Friday, I was honoured to host the 2018 Holt Local Sporting Champions grant presentation at the Arthur Wren Hall at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Hampton Park
        </a>
        . As members will be aware, the Local Sporting Champions program provides financial assistance for, in this case, competitors aged 12 to 18 who are participating in state, national or international championships. At the ceremony I announced the 13 successful recipients from round 1 of the 2018-19 grants. The grant amounts vary between $500 and $700, depending on the distance travelled to compete in their respective sports.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to take the opportunity to mention some really special people who helped with the presentation at the Arthur Wren Hall. People who know Hampton Park know that Arthur Wren Hall is an iconic hall in Hampton Park. When we contacted the organisers of the Hampton Park Progress Association, Vanessa Gerdes and Erika Maliki, they provided this facility at no cost, and they stayed there and helped set up the presentation area. Why do I mention this? Because it shows the real spirit of Hampton Park and of the people of Hampton Park. Those two people are great people. They're great residents of Hampton Park. To show their community spirit on a night like that, when we awarded these 13 young people the Local Sporting Champions awards, says a lot about them. It says a lot about the fact that they took time out to give of themselves to provide this facility for the community. I'd just like to thank them for what they're doing for the Hampton Park community, and the support they provide to Hampton Park in challenging circumstances for them both. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank them for what they do for the Hampton Park community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will mention the people who were awarded the Local Sporting Champions awards: Putu Giri, Liam Trevillian,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesse_Thompson" rel="nofollow">

        , Mitchell Shane, Daniel Van Hees, Melissa Woolf, Kurt and Koen Tchia—two very tall brothers who play volleyball—Mickey Mailelaa, Jamaine Sialau, Jeremiah Sialau, Tristan Little, Isopo Taunuu, Trinity Walter, Izaac Batey and Alanah Mison.
       </p>
       <p>
        Too often we hear about the bad things that young people do. It was great to host this event with 30 or 40 people with their proud family members celebrating the diligence and the dedication these young people have to improve themselves and perhaps be future sporting champions. Hopefully, the local paper will run this story. They should do it. They were very respectful and decent young people who came together on a Friday night to celebrate receiving these awards. I thank them and their families for attending and, again, I thank those two very special people from the Hampton Park Progress Association for organising the event.
