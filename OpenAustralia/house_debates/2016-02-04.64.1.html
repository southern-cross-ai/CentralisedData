       <p>
        I wish to speak again of the serious human rights situation facing communities in Ethiopia. Since November last year it is believed that more than 140 people have been killed by security forces after a new wave of protests began in the Oromia region, following the government's announcement relating to the expansion of the municipal boundary of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addis_Ababa" rel="nofollow">
         Addis Ababa
        </a>
        . The community feared this decision would result in the forced displacement of farmers, without adequate compensation. The protests, which have for the most part been peaceful, were responded to with mass arrests, brutality and the use of live ammunition. This comes as the government continues to arbitrarily arrest and prosecute protestors, journalists and supporters of opposition political parties. Nine weeks after the protests began the government halted its plan, but there continues to be daily reports of killings and mass arrests, with at least 27 people reported to have been killed since this time.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_European_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
         The European Parliament
        </a>
        adopted a resolution on 21 January 2016 condemning the situation, calling for an immediate end to violence, and urging the Ethiopian government to carry out a credible, transparent and impartial investigation into the alleged human rights breaches in relation to the protests. Last week in Perth people united on the steps of state parliament in an act of solidarity. I urge the Australian government show the same solidarity, especially at a time when we are seeking a seat on the

        Human Rights Council.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is evident that unless we see a change to the Ethiopian government's approach to development, which must involve genuine community consultation, the unrest is likely to continue as local communities unite to protect their rights to freedom, justice and equality.
