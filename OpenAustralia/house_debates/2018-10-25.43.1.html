        This week the Victorian Liberal Party became the first state political party to launch a campaign slogan that doubles as a direct attack on the federal branch of their own party. Every press conference held by the Victorian state Liberal Party is now accompanied by a banner brandishing the slogan, 'Get back in control'â€”awkward!

        is now promising to take back control. Who's going to be the first federal Liberal Party MP to hold a joint press conference with a state colleague in front of that banner? Will it be the member for Kooyong as he attempts to get back in control of economic policy in the face of the Liberal Party chavistas who want to force the divestiture of the assets of power companies that are insufficiently passionate in their love for coal? Or will it be the member for Deakin as he launches the member for Warringah's next comeback campaign for leadership? Whatever the slogan, a vote for the Liberals, at the state or federal level, is a vote for more cuts and more chaos.
