       <p>
        Just a few weeks ago, on 18 August, our nation commemorated and remembered the brave Australians who went to fight in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" rel="nofollow">
         Vietnam War
        </a>
        . Many Australians served our nation in the Vietnam War. However, today, I want to speak about one man in particular.
       </p>
       <p>
        This gentleman, Mr Alan Parr of Rockhampton, was recently awarded one of the highest distinctions, the Medal for Gallantry, by Queensland Governor Jeannette Young. Just a few weeks ago, Alan and his wife, Mary, joined me for afternoon tea so that I could thank Alan and recognise the incredible act of bravery he displayed in Vietnam. It was also an opportunity to celebrate this recognition after decades of our men who served in the Vietnam War not receiving the accolades they so rightly deserve. It was his story, not only of how he came to serve in the Vietnam War but also what he did in the middle of the action, which left me enthralled by his courage.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the seventies Alan was a humble primary school teacher who had just begun his career, educating the next generation of children. It wasn't long before, at the age of 21, Alan was on a ship with hundreds of other young, intrepid Australians heading to Vietnam.
       </p>
       <p>
        Shortly after Alan set foot on Vietnamese soil, he was sent to his first battle, the Battle of Coral-Balmoral, on 12 May 1968. Alan's platoon, 1
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAR" rel="nofollow">
         RAR
        </a>
        , consisting of 18 men, were flown into the wrong location and quickly found themselves surrounded by 200 to 300 Vietcong. Within hours the platoon was surrounded and under intense fire. There was no cover and minimal defences. It was during this attack that Alan managed to dig a small hole, just deep enough to protect himself from the onslaught of fire. With chaos surrounding him, Alan saw his mate was severely wounded. With bravery and courage, Alan managed to rescue his platoon mate and bring him into the hole he had dug. Unfortunately, his mate passed away beside him.
       </p>
       <p>
        Such was the intensity of the attack that night that in his role of radioman Alan was directing American aircraft to fire into their position to hold back the enemy soldiers. Within hours, five men were killed and eight were wounded. Alan was the only one of five men left standing.
       </p>
       <p>
        The battle would rage on for days, 26 days in fact. At the end of the relentless 26-day onslaught, 26 Australian soldiers would be lost and 108 wounded. Finally, after 53 years, Alan received the Medal for Gallantry. Lieutenant Colonel George Hulse described Alan in his citation as having a coolness under fire and a dedication to his duty.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you, Alan Parr, for your dedication and service to our nation. Your story of bravery and survival is one that will never be forgotten. May we never forget the sacrifices you and your fellow soldiers who served Australia made.
