        As members are aware, after today the House next meets on 12 May. During the recess, Australians will gather for Anzac Day as we do every year. But this Anzac Day will mark 100 years since the Gallipoli campaign. It will be a poignant milestone in our country's history because the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_War" rel="nofollow">
         Great War
        </a>
        was the crucible in which our national identity was forged. From a population of just 5 million some 400,000 enlisted, 330,000 served overseas, more than 150,000 were wounded and 61,000 never came back. Tens of thousands carry the unseen wounds with them for the rest their lives. Of men aged between 18 and 42, almost 50 per cent enlisted. It was the dominant event in the lives of all who lived through those times.
       </p>
       <p>
        This Anzac Day, I have invited the Leader of the Opposition to join me at the commemoration at Gallipoli. At home, I know that all members will be participating in local commemorations right around the country. When parliament resumes, a motion will be put before the House recognising this historic occasion. There will be subsequent debate here so that members can report for the record on the activities that took place in their own electorates. The
        <i>

        of the debate will then be given to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
         Australian War Memorial
        </a>
        so that Australians will always know how we commemorated the Centenary.
       </p>
       <p>
        I do look forward to reporting back to the House on our commemorations when the House resumes in May.

         On indulgence, I, on behalf of the opposition, would like to unreservedly as associate the opposition with the Prime Minister's remarks about the approaching Centenary of Anzac. Like the Prime Minister, I will have the remarkable privilege of attending Gallipoli on 25 April. I acknowledge the work that has gone into these very important commemorations and I know that right across Australia on that day as a nation we will pause and reflect upon what is arguably one of the most defining points in our nation's history. We will remember the lives lost and the changes to families forever made.
