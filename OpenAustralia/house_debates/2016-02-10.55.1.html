        I congratulate my constituent Cecilia Brooke on winning the City of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Perth" rel="nofollow">
         South Perth
        </a>
        Citizen of the Year and Premier's Australia Day Active Citizenship Award this year. Cecilia became well-known recently for her role in the local government anti-amalgamation campaign in South Perth. Her enthusiastic campaign resulted in an above 50 per cent turnout in the local referendum, which validated the result and surprised many commentators. Cecilia also has a long and proud history of volunteering that deserves to be recognised. She is currently involved in a campaign against high-rise buildings in the local area. Her community involvement started at the young age of 12, reading children's stories on a local radio station, joining the National Catholic Girls Movement and becoming a member of the state committee by 16. This sparked the beginning of Cecilia's involvement and active service within her local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the early 80s Cecilia joined
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soroptimist_International" rel="nofollow">
         Soroptimist International
        </a>
        supporting groups such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Flying_Doctors" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Flying Doctors
        </a>
        and many community activities. Cecilia founded the Chiropractic Assistants Association of Australia and was highly involved in organising events, including breakfast with guest speakers every three months, and in 1997 was awarded the Chiropractic Association Award. Cecilia has also been involved with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Vision" rel="nofollow">
         World Vision
        </a>
        , the Cancer Council and the Lotus Children's Orphanage, and is currently the chairperson of the City of South Perth Residents Association and is an active member of the Soroptimist International Club of South Perth. Congratulations to Cecilia on a well-deserved award.

        I see the former member for Deakin. I would like to see if the member for Moreton can prove to him that he can outlast question time today.
