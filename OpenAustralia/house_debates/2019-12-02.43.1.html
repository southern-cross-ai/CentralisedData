        I received my first Christmas card of the season this week from an energetic young man from Birchip named Blair Gould. Many people across Australia will understand the impact that type 1 diabetes can have an on individual's quality of life. Having been diagnosed with this disease at the age of 10, Blair and his family have firsthand knowledge of this reality. But Blair has never let his condition slow him down. Along with his parents, Blair started an organisation called Mallee Kids-
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T1D" rel="nofollow">
         T1D
        </a>
        , which provides welfare and emotional support for kids, teenagers and families living with this disease. At just 17 years old, he has also been active in lobbying politicians for funding towards continuous glucose monitoring products. These products are now fully subsidised for young people under the age of 21 years, thanks in part to Blair's hard work. When I met with Blair recently he asked that this subsidy be extended to everyone with type 1 diabetes, regardless of their age. I have sent a letter to Minister Hunt's office conveying Blair's views and requesting that his office assess the feasibility of extending this subsidy to people over the age of 21. I would like to thank Blair for his continued advocacy and acknowledge his outstanding leadership and determination. With young voices like Blair's, the future is bright indeed for Mallee.
