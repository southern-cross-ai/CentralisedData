        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, the government introduces the additional estimates appropriation bills. These bills are:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        These bills underpin the government's expenditure decisions.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriation_Bill" rel="nofollow">
         Appropriation Bill
        </a>
        (No. 3) 2019-2020 seeks approval for appropriations from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consolidated_Revenue_Fund" rel="nofollow">
         Consolidated Revenue Fund
        </a>
        of just over $3.310 billion. These bills ensure that there is sufficient appropriation to cover estimates variations related to existing programsâ€”for instance, changes in costs for demand-driven programs. These bills also pay for the first-year costs for measures announced in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook and subsequently announced new measures. This year these bills feature several bushfire-related initiatives that were announced after MYEFO.
       </p>
       <p>
        I now outline the more significant amounts provided for in this bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        Firstly, the bill will provide the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Home Affairs
        </a>
        with $948.4 million to continue implementing the government's border protection policies and support people impacted by the recent bushfires.
       </p>
       <p>
        Secondly, the bill will provide the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Social Services
        </a>
        a further $592.6 million for higher-than-expected participation in the Disability Employment Services program and additional emergency relief and financial counselling for communities affected by the recent bushfire emergency.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thirdly, the bill will provide the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Defence
        </a>
        with additional funding of $488.8 million, including $87.9 million for the Australian Defence Force's contribution to the bushfire response through Operation Bushfire Assist. Additional funding is also being provided foreign exchange supplementation due to movement in exchange rates, under 'no win/no loss' funding arrangements.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill also provides $287.5 million to Services Australia to support individuals, families and communities achieve greater self-sufficiency.
       </p>
       <p>
        Further, the bill proposes an additional $170.6 million for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Health" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Health
        </a>
        , including $53.2 million to support access to medicines and medical treatments, $68.2 million in departmental funding to support the delivery of government programs and $30.2 million towards mental, Indigenous and preventative health activities.
       </p>

         Department of Agriculture
        </a>
        , Water and the Environment, including for wildlife and habitat recovery in response to the recent bushfire emergency, busting congestion in the environmental assessment process, responding to African swine fever and strengthening the Australian Antarctic program.
       </p>
       <p>
        Details of the proposed expenditure are set out in the schedule to the bill and the Portfolio Additional Estimates Statements tabled in the parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend this bill to the chamber.
