       <p>
        My question is to the Minister for Communications. According to a recent analysis, the member of parliament who has accepted the largest amount of tickets and hospitality from the gambling industry is the minister. The total number of ticket and hospitality packages from the gambling industry accepted by the minister is 10. Given her role in regulating gambling advertising, does the minister think this is appropriate?

        <p>
         I thank the member for his question. The reason why the member knows that information is that I have declared it all, as required by the parliament, as every member of parliament is required to do. The reason why it is declared is that I follow those rules.
        </p>
        <p>
         I made it very clear some time ago in a public forum where the honourable member was also present that, although I did comply with all the rules, I understood there was community concern around this issue, and I made a conscious decision that I would no longer accept any donations from gambling companies nor hospitality from gambling companies. If the honourable member were asked the same thing—as I do recall, he was unable to answer that question. The member may wish to reflect on his own behaviour in this regard.
        </p>
        <p>
         The reality is this: the policy that this government and I, as minister, administer—along with a number of other ministers, including the Minister for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
          Social Services
         </a>
         —when it comes to this area is based on the solid principle of harm minimisation. This government will be judged on its delivery. The member may wish to reflect on the fact that, during their whole time, their nearly 10 years in office, they failed to make a dent in this area. They proceeded at a glacial pace when it came to the national consumer protection program, which was designed for this very purpose. They failed when it came to administering their own reports that they received about banning credit cards for online gaming. They failed to act and they failed to even release the Stevens review when it came to classification for simulated gambling in children's games.
        </p>
        <p>
         If the minister wishes to come here and ask any member of this parliament about their commitment to harm minimisation or in any respect—sorry, shadow minister. Sorry about that. If anyone wishes to come here and reflect on any member of this side, the reason that these matters are known is that (a) they were declared, and (b) they should be well aware that this government takes its responsibilities very seriously when it comes to that adherence. This is a government that will be judged on its record when it comes to harm minimisation. Those opposite failed to deliver in 10 years.
