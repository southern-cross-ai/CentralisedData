        The provision of federal government funding for an increased number of aged-care places offering a range of accommodation options to suit a range of residents' needs and choices is an important priority within my electorate as our population ages. There are currently two new aged-care facilities proposed, one by Southern Cross Care, in Currambine, and the other by Mercy Care, in Edgewater. However, these developments alone will not be sufficient to meet the future growth in demand for places. I am pleased to inform the parliament of a proposed development at lot 701, Collier Pass, Joondalup, on the former Wanneroo Wolves basketball stadium site, which will increase the availability of aged-care places in our local community. The 1.7 hectare site, recently sold by LandCorp, will be subdivided into three lots to facilitate an integrated development linked by shared public open space. The first lot will include a five-storey aged-care centre with 140 suites, to be owned and managed by Aegis Aged Care Group, with respite care facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second lot will cater for more-independent retirement living, with Carmel Group developing 74 independent living units in a six-storey building, to be managed by a specialist provider. There are also plans to develop on the third adjoining lot, with frontage to Collier Pass, a mixed-use eight-storey tower comprising 72 family apartments, 46 serviced apartments, a medical centre, hospitality and retail outlets, childcare facilities and office space. The development will be located practically 100 metres from

        </a>
        and the Joondalup train station and will be close to the medical facilities at Joondalup Health Campus. The $100 million development is scheduled to commence in 2020 and to be completed by 2024. This project will create construction jobs and ongoing employment for carers and support staff.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recurrent federal funding will need to be in place to fund the aged-care places, so it's important that our future needs are being planned for in advance. Many constituents have responded to my community survey by highlighting the availability of aged-care places as an issue of high concern for their families. Our seniors are looking for choice in living independently in their own homes for as long as they can before transitioning into low-level care, followed by progressively higher levels of care as their physical needs change. I am pleased to be part of a federal government team that is working cooperatively with the private sector aged-care providers in addressing the future needs of our local communityâ€”
