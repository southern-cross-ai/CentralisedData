       <p>
        Yesterday was Internet Safety Day, and I want to take this opportunity to talk about this incredibly important issue.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reid is made up of many families with young children, and as a developmental and educational psychologist—and also as a mother—I have seen just how difficult it can be for parents to grapple with the challenges and risks of technology when keeping their kids safe online. Social media, technology and communications move at such a rapid pace, and often it seems impossible to understand the tools that our children are using online. While parental controls exist, they can sometimes be hard to navigate. Whether it's Facebook, Instagram or TikTok, our kids are vulnerable to predator exploitation, inappropriate content and a whole range of concerns.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yesterday, the government's eSafety Commissioner launched a new initiative for parents, carers and teachers of children under the age of five to encourage them to 'start the chat' with their kids about safe internet usage. Having these conversations is really important, and helps to equip children with the necessary skills to stay safe online. One of the major functions of the eSafety Commissioner is to operate the world-first reporting tool for online bullying, working closely with some of the biggest social media providers to keep kids safe from online bullying.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is also an online image based abuse portal to assist Australians who have had their internet images or videos shared without their consent. The portal supports victims of image based abuse, as well as providing guidance on how to request the content to be removed. Another program, Cyber Report, is the first line of defence against illegal online content, taking reports from the public and all levels of law enforcement to remove child sex abuse material from Australia and around the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Morrison government is at the forefront of online safety policy, so we will continue to invest in the resources needed to prioritise the protection of all Australians in the online world, just as we do in the physical world. The content through the eSafety Commission is audience specific and highly targeted, to empower all age groups to take control of their online safety image—from schools, through teenagers and all the way to older Australians. There are also great resources for teachers to guide students to become responsible digital citizens. This Safer Internet Day, I particularly encourage parents, carers and teachers to access the information available on the eSafety website. The range of free resources offer practical advice about how you can help the next generation of Australians to stay safe online.
