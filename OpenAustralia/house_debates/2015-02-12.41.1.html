        On a lighter note, I enjoyed the tradition of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        this year, on 26 January. That tradition may have first begun in the 19th century, but Australia Day has evolved since that time as a day to acknowledge, commemorate and celebrate the first landing, to unify all Australians and to recognise all the people from different cultures, religions or walks of life who have chosen to call Australia home and become citizens. On 26 January I officiated at citizenship ceremonies at both the

        and the City of Belmont in my electorate of Swan, where I had the pleasure of welcoming 138 new citizens to our great nation. I attended the morning ceremony at the City of South Perth. In attendance was also

        young lady called Drisana Levitzke-Gray won the Young Australian of the Year award. Drisana is the fifth generation in her family to be born deaf, so she has used this personal experience to become an advocate for Australia's deaf community and their human rights. She is an outstanding example of what can be achieved in life, even with the disability that she has. I congratulate her on winning the Young Australian of the Year award.
