        students are finishing up the school year and looking forward to the Christmas break. I congratulate all of them on their hard work and hope their efforts have paid off. For those who have graduated this year, congratulations on reaching this milestone achievement. Many will be taking a gap year or continuing their education at university or undertaking vocational training. Others will be starting an apprenticeship or traineeship or entering the workforce. I wish the class of 2017 the very best for the exciting new adventures ahead. I thank their parents, teachers and mentors for shaping the young adults they have become and I look forward to the contributions they will make to their communities in the future.

        Speaking of strong communities, only last week I attended a seniors Christmas lunch in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Barker" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Barker
        </a>
        . It was hosted by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        of Mount Barker, with generous donations from the local co-op, primary producers, wineries, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bendigo_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         Bendigo Bank
        </a>
        and the Shire of Plantagenet. Most heartening was seeing the Mount Barker Community College students dedicated to spoiling their senior citizens who have contributed so much to the community. I met graduates who came back from their leavers celebrations to host and serve meals, students who were bussing tables and hospitality students who were slaving away in the kitchen. The primary schoolers sang carols and the Mount Barker Community College band played everything from festive tunes to toe-tapping old-time favourites. This event exemplified the strength of O'Connor's regional communities, and I am so proud to represent you, from the very young right through to the very old. I take this opportunity to wish you all a very merry Christmas and reaffirm my commitment to you in 2018.
