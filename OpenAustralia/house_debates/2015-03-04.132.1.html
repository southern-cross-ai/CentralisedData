        Last Sunday, I attended the Kilmore Country Music Festival. This year's festival was certainly a success with amazing country music performances, especially from two local acts: Tim Farren and Kaitlyn Thomas, who is only 14 years of age. There was a large turnout to the event with 400 people taking part in the festivities. The majority of attendees travelled from far and wide from places such as Berrigan in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Seaspray, Gippsland and Blairgowrie to name a few. All visitors came to relish the hospitality of our community and to enjoy some great entertainment.
       </p>
       <p>
        A further bow to the tie for the festival was the excellent local fundraising opportunities made possible with the Kilmore football club running the bar; the local

        The festival also hosts a ute competition, with categories such as best import, best 4x4, best street ute, best artwork ute and people's choice. It was a pleasure to participate in the competition as a judge, and I thoroughly enjoyed looking at each of the entries and having a great chat to everyone about their 'U beauts'. I wish to commend the organisers for putting on such a successful local annual event:

        ; Gay and Steven George; Taryn Kneebone; We Cole; and Lorraine Pointer. I have to say that, even if you do not like country music—it might not necessarily be your thing—the country music festival certainly has something for everyone.

        I also want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to a man who is a beacon of community spirit, a person who has over the past 33 years put his community first and foremost—Mr Allan Penaluna. Since 1972, when Allan started as a junior cadet with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_John_Ambulance" rel="nofollow">
         St John Ambulance
        </a>
        Brigade at Broadmeadows, Allan has always given his time to volunteer for the community in the best way he knows how. In 1988 he became a paramedic and in 1996 qualified as a mobile intensive care officer. Allan joined the SES in 1982 and spent 33 years in service leadership positions, including 7½ years as controller and nearly 45 years road accident rescue experience both with St John Ambulance and VICSES. He is Senior Instructor in all rescue disciplines. He developed rescue operational procedures, specifically for Road Rescue

        Allan has received many hard-earned awards and commendations including the Emergency Services Medal,
