        There is a road in Townsville that is a two-way street. It is quite a pleasant drive and is also a link between the major industrial suburbs of Garbutt and the Bohle. Townsville’s economy depends strongly on a strong industrial sector, and these two suburbs are the hub of that sector. From engineering works to transport, from auction houses to the busy

        </a>
        , from industrial retailers to construction companies, these two suburbs are a lifeblood for our city that is second to none, yet we treat them as a second-class citizens.
       </p>
       <p>
        This link, Blakey’s Crossing, is critical to the wellbeing both of Townsville and of the industrial sector of our economy. The problem is that this road continually goes under water. As my mate Richo says, ‘It goes under in a sun shower.’ I am not talking about during the peak of the wet season. I am talking about it being under water during the dry season. A simple storm can bring traffic chaos to Townsville’s industrial precinct. It has been under water on countless days every year. When the road is under water the major arterial road, Woolcock Street, becomes clogged with industrial traffic, and delays of hours occur. Some people just turn around and go home. The traffic at the Mather Street roundabout backs up for kilometres each way, and Duckworth Street is not far behind in experiencing delays caused by Blakey’s Crossing being impassable.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have an opportunity to fix Blakey’s Crossing. It is a small job requiring some $21 million. The alternative is to spend over $70 million to install a flyover at the Mather Street roundabout, which is the most impassable of the intersections hit during the rainy periods. If we do not act now, the incredible growth of our northern beaches suburbs will also make the Duckworth Street roundabout a clogged arterial road, and more surgery will be needed. The loss of productivity is obvious; the way to fix it is simple. This is an opportunity for local, state and federal governments to come together for a solution that will make our industrial hubs accessible 365 days a year. We could pick up on countless hours of productivity. We could lower the collective blood pressure of an entire travelling workforce. I urge the government to please fund the $21 million needed to flood-proof Blakey’s Crossing.
