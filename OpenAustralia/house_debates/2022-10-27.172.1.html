        I rise to speak on the sad passing of Peter Haffenden. The first time that I met Peter Haffenden, it was clear to me that he was an inspiring and impactful person. What was scheduled as a 30-minute visit to Melbourne's Living Museum of the West soon became a far longer discussion in relation to history, environmentalism and art and a tour around the precinct that bears testimony to Peter's intelligence, creativity, dedication and commitment to the local committee and its environment. Peter was a true polymath, with achievements in photography, journalism, history and museology.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Living_Museum" rel="nofollow">
         The Living Museum
        </a>
        is just one of his many achievements, although it alone would be a worthy lifetime accomplishment for most of us.
       </p>
       <p>
        The museum is a remarkable institution that preserves and celebrates the rich history of the Pipemakers precinct and the many phases it has been through. It does so in a way that draws in the community, engaging young and old alike through a range of mediums and interactions.
       </p>
       <p>
        Peter's impact was reflected in the wide range of people who sought the chance to see him in his final precious weeks. I feel privileged to have been among them. In a poetic and fitting twist, many of the museum's most prized treasures were brought to Peter's house and, indeed, around his bed as a refuge from the recent floods. My thoughts are particularly with Kerrie and Phoebe during this difficult time, and also with all of those who have worked with and been inspired by Peter in his many ventures. Vale Peter Haffenden.

        I also wish to pass on a message from a young person under the Raise Our Voice Australia campaign. It is from somebody in my electorate. She says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My name is Liv … I am 15 years old and I live in the Fraser electorate.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The new parliament should close the gender pay gap.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The changes that need to take place are an increase in women's workforce participation, an increase in the minimum wage in low paid female dominated industries and extending paid parental leave both for men and women.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia should have no gender pay gap in the future and the stereotype of women doing the caring should be broken.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Parliament can support this by increasing women's workforce participation, increase in the minimum wage in low paid female dominated industries and extending paid parental leave for both men and women.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This change is a social issue and this is an important issue because women deserve not to be discriminated against by the gender pay gap.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Parliament can achieve this goal by an increase in women's workforce participation …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Parliament needs to take action to close the gender pay gap now.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you to Liv for her message. It's very fitting that Liv has passed on this message to be read out in parliament on a day when a very important bill is literally being introduced in the main chamber as we speak. Thank you to the Raise Our Voice campaign for bringing the voices of so many young people from around Australia into parliament.
