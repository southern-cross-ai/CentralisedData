       <p>
        I rise to present a petition to the Australian parliament. One of my roles is to serve and to represent, and that is to re-present. Whilst I might not always agree with every detail in every petition, I am always proud to present petitions to the Australian parliament on behalf of the people I represent. This petition is about asylum seekers within Australia's jurisdiction. It asks the House to immediately appoint a parliamentary committee to examine and investigate the current situation and in doing so invite submissions by asylum seekers, refugee organisations and other welfare services, as they consider:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        The petition's principal was Rohullah Hussaini. Let me outline the process. This petition has gone through the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Petitions and has now been tabled in the House. It will go to the Minister for Immigration and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Border_Security" rel="nofollow">
         Border Security
        </a>
        and will be placed on the committee's website. The petition's principal will be informed of the petition's progress.
       </p>
       <p>
        This came out of a ride by the deputy mayor of the rural city of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swan_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Swan Hill
        </a>
        and Rohullah Hussaini, who rode over 700 kilometres from Swan Hill to Mildura to raise their concerns about our immigration and asylum seeker policy. I have a strong belief that we do need to have a strong border protection policy. People should not be allowed to profit out of other people's desperation. We do need to have a very strong border protection policy.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, I also commend Scott Morrison's movement towards safe haven economic visas. That encourages regional councils to wrap their arms around communities. It gives an opportunity for people to work 3½ years minimum out of five, and then they have a chance to apply for other visas onshore. I have always been a strong believer that the best thing you can give a person is an opportunity. This gives a person an opportunity to work. We find that when people work it actually breaks down barriers. It also gives rural communities a chance to participate in being part of the solution instead of standing on the outside and throwing stones at government.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend this petition to the House. I am always happy to represent the people of Mallee and to present anything that they choose me to hand to the parliament.
