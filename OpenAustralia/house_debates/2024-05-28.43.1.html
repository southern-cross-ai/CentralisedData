        My question is to the Prime Minister. How is the budget helping to deliver cost-of-living relief for Australians and building a better future? What is standing in the way of making our future here?

           McEwen
          </a>
          for his question. It was good to be in the member for McEwen's electorate, looking at infrastructure related to the very significant intermodal that will be built in his region, which will create many thousands of jobs, boost productivity and make an enormous difference to the region and, indeed, to the nation.

          We delivered a budget focused on the things that have driven us over the last two years—firstly, helping with the rising cost-of-living pressures that people are feeling. We did that by producing a tax cut for all 13.6 million taxpayers—not just some of them, which is what those opposite wanted. We did that as well by having energy price relief of $300 for every household, not just some, and by providing support for every small business as well. We did it by providing stronger Medicare for every part of the community, adding a further 29 urgent care clinics to the 58 that have been up and running. We did it by ensuring more homes can be built in every part of the country, with our $32 billion plan for homes in Australia.

            We also had a plan for a future made in Australia. That's where future economic growth will come from. How do we seize the opportunities from the shifts that are happening in the global economy? With the shift to clean energy, there is no country you would rather be in than Australia, with the resources that we have under the ground that will power global economies in this century but also the resources we have in the sky, the best solar resources in the world, as well as the opportunity that we have for green hydrogen, to be producing green metals and to be producing advanced manufacturing jobs.
           </p>
           <p>
            For some time those opposite have said no to cost-of-living relief, but now they're also saying no to a future made in Australia, to making more things here, including extraordinarily saying no to production tax credits, something that will reward the success of companies that invest in the industries of the future. Those opposite have nothing to offer, have nothing positive, are helping no-one and are taking our country nowhere. You can't build a better future out of saying no. We're getting on with building that better future.
