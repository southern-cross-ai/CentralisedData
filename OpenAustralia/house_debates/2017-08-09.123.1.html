        Fishing is more than a pastime in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        , it's a way of life. It's an opportunity to unwind, connect with friends and family and enjoy our magnificent outdoors. That's why it was great to celebrate the launch of the Parliamentary Friends of Recreational Fishers this morning. I am proud to be a co-founder and I am also glad that a group now exists for those out there, those fellow Australians, who love fishing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fishing is not just a great pastime. Fishing gives an opportunity to reach out and connect with mates. This morning we heard about the fantastic fly program. I would like to commend to the House the director of the fly program, Matt Tripet. The program uses fly fishing as a way to get people to unwind, relax, be with friends and talk about what's going on in their life, while they are fly fishing on a river somewhere. It was great to see the huge amount of support from our parliamentary colleagues for the establishment of this group, and we look forward to conducting events into the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        Everyone in the House would know the price of fish. Would you believe if it if I told you that there is a barramundi in the Northern Territory worth $1 million? There is. And there are 100 barramundi in the Northern Territory with $10,000 tags on them. They are all there ready to be caught. Now, you may think that I've lost my mind; it doesn't exist, it's not true—but you couldn't be more wrong. It does exist. This million-dollar fish has a name: Million Dollar Fish Season 3. That's right. The Million Dollar Fish Competition is back in the Territory for another season. But you need to risk it to win the biscuit. This means you need to register—so, go to milliondollafish.com.au. Then you need to get up to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NT" rel="nofollow">
         NT
        </a>
        . Good luck to all those who come up. You've got to come up to the Territory to be in with a chance to win.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tourism in the Territory directly and indirectly creates more than 15,000 jobs. The Million Dollar Fish Competition always manages to lure many tourists from the southern states to get warm and try their hand. Your odds have never been better. I want to congratulate the Northern Territory government and the sponsors—CrownBet,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCF" rel="nofollow">
         BCF
        </a>
        , Lion, Jayco, Shimano, Engle, Territory Discoveries and Territory Power Sports Group—for again getting behind this fantastic initiative. As I said, the tourism industry in the Territory supports a lot of Territorians and their families. This competition is held through the wet season, and that's generally a lower point in our tourism season. So it's a great opportunity for you to get up to the Territory with your family and catch a big one. Thank you.
