        I rise to speak about community radio in Millicent. Community radio stations across the country play an important role, providing a voice for communities, particularly in rural, regional and remote areas where access to commercial radio stations and genuinely local news may be sparse. One such radio station is 5THE
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FM" rel="nofollow">
         FM
        </a>
        in Millicent, which broadcasts to the surrounding areas, including Beachport, Southend, Furner and Hatherleigh, just to name a few.
       </p>
       <p>
        From humble beginnings in the mid-1980s, when $25,000 was raised from cake stalls over a four-year period to purchase the equipment needed to broadcast, the first test transmission was conducted in May 1987. The old Millicent railway station was transformed into a different sort of station and now broadcasts contemporary and specialist music, multicultural programs and community information 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, the station has recently experienced some difficult times. Those difficult times led to the transmitter being turned off in late 2022 due to a loss of its broadcasting licence. With a brand-new skill based board, chaired by Mr David Walshaw, a temporary 12-month licence was granted in July last year. I visited the station over the weekend to congratulate the committee and volunteers for being recently awarded a five-year community radio broadcasting licence by the

         Australian Communications and Media Authority
        </a>
        . This is a testament to the new board and presenters—their dedication, their professionalism—and I wish them all the very best for the future.
