        I want to alert my community to my new website, which will be launched next week: KevinHogan.com.au. I have designed this to be very much a community resource. There is one section that already a lot of people have started to contribute to, what we are calling the community hub section. On this part of the website, people can advertise a community event. We have got a lot of links from other websites, so, if you are having a fete, if you are raising money for a charity, if you want people to turn up to something on the weekend, you can put that event on this website. Hopefully, it will be one-stop shop for all the events that are happening in our local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another very important part of that is that there is a 'do something now in your community' part. We have linked to that every organisation in our community that is looking for volunteers. As we go around the community, one essence I get from the people I talk to is that people who volunteer in our community are essential. They carry a lot of organisations and provide a lot of services that government just could not do. We are very thankful for that. The other thing people say is that people who volunteer get as much enjoyment and value out of it as the people they are helping. So there is going to be a one-stop shop for all volunteer organisations. If you want to get involved in your community, please go and look at that. There is also a business hub to help all small businesses in the community. It has got a lot of local chamber news, workshops and training things that are on in our environment, also business news about what is going on. There will be a local history part of the website for school students or anyone else interested in what is going on in our community. It has great local history and is linked to education websites, so, if teachers are looking for information about different towns or our community in general, all that will be there: facts, figures and statistics. We will also have a local news section and links to local news providers about what is going on in our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Importantly, I get contacted a lot about what grants are available for different sporting clubs or other clubs in our community. There will be a one-stop shop area for community grants to go to that part of the website and how to apply, and the links to that will be there as well. There also obviously be a section where, if you want to contact me or you have an issue that you wish to talk about, you can use it. Again, any community organisation, anyone looking to volunteer, any small business, anyone looking for any information, I encourage you to go to KevinHogan.com.au, which will open next week.
