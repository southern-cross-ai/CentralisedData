        I know it is unusual, but I rise to speak on a matter of indulgence. I acknowledge comments made earlier today by my friend the member for Pearce. I wish to speak of the crash in Zambia of Cessna

        KOX on 9 September 2004. I would like to acknowledge family members listening to this broadcast and those present here this evening that have contributed to a search for justice: Her Excellency Koleka Mqulwana,

        during the time of the crash and provided advice to Mr Morton. Justine Watters, her husband, Matt, and Matt's mother, Shirley, from Perth, died in the crash. The others who died were Justine's friends from England, Justin and

       <p>
        Shirley, Matt, Justine, Justin and Rebecca were on a two-week holiday in Zambia and had flown from Mfuwe in Eastern Zambia to Livingstone to view

        . Shortly after the return flight began, the propeller fell off at 8,000 feet, and six minutes later the plane crashed, killing all on board. I have been informed that this is the first time a propeller has detached in this way in Southern African Aviation history. ZS KOX was a

        registered and maintained Cessna aeroplane operating temporarily in Zambia. It had flown approximately 30 operating hours since its maintenance service in South Africa 19 days earlier. The subsequent investigation, focusing on the maintenance company Nelair, has been one of missing files and missing evidence, much to the frustration of the South African National Prosecutions Service. The member for Pearce has in some detail earlier today highlighted the challenges investigators have faced in a search for truth, justice and safer skies in South Africa. Since the crash of ZS KOX in 2004, Nelair has been involved in two more serious incidents. On 22 August 2007, Nelair aircraft ZS

        </a>
        18/2/3/8354, the following findings were made: 'During the recovery of aircraft wreckage it was found that the hydraulic pressure door open hose was punctured by a screw, resulting in a hydraulic leak. The airframe log book was reviewed, and there were anomalies in relation to operating hours. The information about engine overhaul operating times was not entered into the appropriate pages and was found to be unreliable. When the hose wheel bay was checked for possible items that may have caused the hydraulic hose to rupture, it was considered that the identified hydraulic hose may have been slightly too long and thus rubbed against a screw or bolt. When requested to give information of the evacuation process that followed the accident, one passenger reported that the emergency door could not open. They were thus momentarily trapped inside the aircraft.'
       </p>
       <p>
        These findings led to the following safety recommendation in the report: 'It is recommended that the South African Civil Aviation Authority should increase its oversight activities in respect of small operators.' Again, on 23 July 2010, another Nelair aircraft, ZS
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KDX" rel="nofollow">
         KDX
        </a>
        , had a propeller separation similar to ZS KOX six years earlier. The following findings were made in the South African Civil Aviation Authority report into the incident CA18/3/2/0796: 'While in a straight and level flight, the propeller blades separated from the propeller hub. Various propeller maintenance organisations confirmed verbally that it was a norm in the industry that certain tasks were not carried out due to alleged cost implications to the owners. None of these
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMO" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        s were prepared to put this in writing. It is the investigator's opinion that the practice of not conforming to the manufacturer's requirements during a mid-life inspection could have contributed to this incident. Investigation of the blade root revealed that a crack had started from the outside of the blade root, progressing inward until the final failure occurred; and, though log books reflected that the aircraft was correctly maintained, it is the investigator's opinion that the propeller was not maintained as called for by the manufacturer.'
       </p>
       <p>
        These findings led to the following recommendation: 'In the interest of aviation safety it is recommended that the department of civil aviation should through the appropriate department ensure that all propeller overhaul facilities adhere to the mid-life inspection requirements as stipulated by the propeller manufacturer.'
       </p>
       <p>
        I extend my condolences to the families so sadly affected by these tragic events. I pay tribute to the family members and to the great humanity of Mr Sam Morton.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I table exhaustive documentation that I have compiled on the crash of ZS KOX. I know I speak for this parliament when we appeal to the South African Department of Transport to take appropriate action to ensure proper investigation and, if appropriate, prosecution of those responsible for those terrible and tragic event.
