       <p>
        Last week, Australia celebrated National Volunteer Week, a time to recognise the invaluable contributions of volunteers across the country. Today I rise to share the story of two remarkable organisations in my electorate of Gorton and the people who run them. These organisations are the heart of their communities, and volunteers are their backbone. Firstly, I'd like to highlight the Caroline Springs Scout Group who I recently visited in Burnside Heights. Led by the remarkable Claire Mouser, whose dedication spans 13 years, this group has blossomed into one of Victoria's largest and most active Scout groups. Claire's leadership has been instrumental. Lately, her focus has shifted to the eldest youth section of the scouts, known as Rovers. Claire says this group, between 18 and 26 years old, have faced unique challenges because of the pandemic. She's guiding them as they reconnect, rebuild, push their way into the community and develop their adult lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        Claire's commitment extends beyond scouting. She is also a cherished member of the Caroline Springs
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        sub branch. The partnership between Scouts and the RSL has been symbiotic, showcasing the power of intergenerational collaboration and community spirit. Claire's efforts have not gone unnoticed. Her recognition as the 2024 Melton Citizen of the Year is a testament to her unwavering dedication and service.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also had the privilege of meeting Cynthia Frane and her fellow members of the Horseshoe Bend Community Group, a collective of local volunteers devoted to revitalising the site formerly known as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_Bend_Farm" rel="nofollow">
         Horseshoe Bend Farm
        </a>
        . Through their tireless efforts, this group has been transforming the farm into a vibrant hub of community engagement and cultural enrichment. From working bees to educational workshops, they tirelessly collaborate with traditional owners to preserve and share the rich heritage of our land. Their outreach embraces schools, families, youth groups, aged-care and disability support organisations. They generously donate a significant portion of their produce to a local Foodbank. I'm proud to share that both these organisations were recent recipients of a volunteers grant by the federal government, a testament to their important work and the vital role volunteers play in shaping our society.
       </p>
       <p>
        As we celebrate these two remarkable groups, let us not forget the countless other clubs, societies and community organisations that rely on the selflessness and dedication of volunteers. They are the unsung heroes who labour tirelessly behind the scenes, enriching our communities, uplifting those in need. To all volunteers across my electorate of Gorton and indeed our nation, I extend my deepest gratitude. Your kindness, generosity and unwavering commitment embody the true spirit of Australian mateship. Together, let us continue to support and honour the invaluable contributions of volunteers, for they are the life blood of our communities.
