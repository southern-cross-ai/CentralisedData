        [by video link] My question is to the Treasurer. Can the Treasurer explain to the House how the Morrison government's strong economic management is empowering Indigenous businesses and supporting Indigenous workers and their families throughout Australia?

         I thank the member for Berowra for his question and note his longtime, genuine and deep interest in Indigenous affairs. Indeed, he is the chair of the House Standing Committee on Indigenous Affairs and the co-chair of the joint standing committee on constitutional recognition, and I note his extensive experience prior to this place in advancing the interests of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         .
        </p>
        <p>
         Since 2015, $4.3 billion in Commonwealth contracts have been awarded to more than 2,300 Indigenous businesses, including, over the course of the last year, 200 Indigenous businesses receiving their first Commonwealth contract. These contracts have been awarded across all sectors of the economy. Indeed, in research, technology and engineering, we have seen in the last five years a ninefold increase in those contracts being awarded: up to $90 million. We have seen in the broadcasting and telecommunications space over the last five years a tenfold increase in the amount of contracts being awarded, up to $45 million. And in this year's budget we have put more money into the skills and the training of Indigenous Australians, because workforce participation, economic empowerment, is absolutely critical to a person's wellbeing. So there has been more than $240 million for new skills employment programs, for Indigenous girls academies, for Indigenous entrepreneurs and for community organisations.

         The various programs being supported by this government are helping many individuals and communities across the countryâ€”like one Ashley Rayner, who, when he left school, became a tradie. He wanted to enter into starting up his own business in the engineering space. He is a proud Indigenous man. He established

         Engineering, and he participated in a developing Indigenous business and leadership capability project which helped his business secure the welding certifications that were needed for that business to go and secure larger sized contracts. Now he's also received a $40,000 grant and we have seen the number of employees in that business increase over recent times from 15 to 27 employees, including more Indigenous workers. Each and every year, with that support, he's been increasing substantially the revenue of his business. This is what's happening on the ground: substantial contracts being awarded to Indigenous businesses and economic empowerment improving the lives of Indigenous Australians.
