        in 1977. John worked as a poultry farmer and then as an agricultural economist at the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences. He was elected as the member for Macarthur in 1972. He lost in 1975 and then re-entered parliament in 1978 as the member for Werriwa, where he served until 1993. He was a giant of Australian politics, serving in the Hawke and Keating governments.

        He was a personal friend, and I was very grateful for the help that he gave me when I first came into parliament in 2016. He, his wife—June Verrier—my mate

        and I had several wonderful dinners together. Tragically, he died yesterday, but his legacy will stay on. The people of Macarthur are very grateful for his service, and he'll remain in our memory. He remains in the memory of all those who served in the Hawke and Keating governments as a man true to his word, an honest man and a highly intelligent, principled person who gave lots of very good advice to young Labor members like myself over many, many years. We lost a giant.
