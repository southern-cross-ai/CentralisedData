        On Wednesday, 9 November I attended the seventh annual Concept2Creation expo held at the Golden Grove Recreation and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arts_Centre" rel="nofollow">
         Arts Centre
        </a>
        . The Concept2Creation initiative is a secondary school program which began in 2005 and is now being delivered in 36 schools across
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        , with almost 3,000 students participating. The program is spearheaded by the Northern Advanced Manufacturing Industry Group and provides students with insight into the important role that mathematics, science and technology have to play in their future and in advanced manufacturing. The program is making a real difference in student attitude and choices is and proving to be invaluable in the development of young people's application of advanced technical skills, workplace understanding, employability and entrepreneurial skills.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the expo students from 26 schools, including Para Hills, Banksia Park,

        </a>
        , the university sector and the high schools involved. The expo was opened by the South Australian Governor and Patron of Concept2Creation, His Excellency Rear Admiral Kevin Scarce, and attended by education and industry representatives and state minister in South Australia Tom Kenyon.

       <p>
        Advanced manufacturing is an area where Australia can successfully compete with other countries. It presents Australia with extraordinary opportunities by developing and manufacturing new technological products and building on the existing opportunities presented through the defence and manufacturing sector in South Australia. Bringing this potential for career opportunities into our schools has been an overwhelming success both in terms of the schools now participating and the level of interest from amongst the students. It has also resulted in new maths and science facilities being established in many high schools across South Australia because of the importance of these subjects in career opportunities for young people.
       </p>
       <p>
        The range of ideas and creations on display at each of the expos never ceases to amaze me and highlights the extraordinary skills and abilities that exist in young people. I particularly congratulate Valley View Secondary School and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endeavour_College" rel="nofollow">
         Endeavour College
        </a>
        , two of the participating schools from my local area, for winning the key awards on the day. I also congratulate all of the schools who participated in the Concept2Creation expo and each of the students who were involved in the design and construction of all the exhibits and inventions on display on the day. Finally, I acknowledge the work of Bernie Fitzsimons, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Manager" rel="nofollow">
         General Manager
        </a>
        of the Northern Advanced Manufacturing Industry Group, who has been the driver of the Concept2Creation program and who has worked tirelessly to make the program a success.
