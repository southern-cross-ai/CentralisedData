        The issue of mental health has touched the lives of so many that it is important to see the work that is being done by both our professionals and our extraordinary volunteers. Last Sunday, Paul Gaffney, known as Gaff or Gaffa to his mates, was rewarded with a successful outcome for one year's effort. Twelve months ago, Paul decided to coordinate a Black Dog Day ride to raise money for Lifeline and raise awareness in the community. He has worked continuously and despite overcast weather, the Black 'Dogger' rode along with another 200 bikers. The group raised over $11,000 and most of that will be donated to Lifeline. Paul organised a gathering of different motorbike clubs and harnessed sponsorship from Jason at John Hills Signs, Wayne of Nowra Fujitsu and Manildra. You cannot imagine how truly startling it was to see all those riders travelling for a good cause down the

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Mental health is recognised as a significant community issue on so many levels and a large number of our local services and providers are stretched well beyond the demand, but they are working very hard. Recently, I attended a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman's_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Woman's Day
        </a>
        award event at Meroogal House, where Elizabeth Langdon was awarded for her involvement in the Nowra Youth Food Garden, which is located at the headspace facility and operated under the guidance of Jo Allsopp. This particular headspace is fabulous.
       </p>
       <p>
        We also have the Shoalhaven Suicide Prevention and Awareness Network, SSPAN, working very effectively under the guiding hand of Wendi Hobbs. They have recently received sponsorship from Kinghorn Ford Nowra. This sponsorship will support workshops on youth mental health literacy and finding help, which will delivered to our schools. Also, SSPAN has developed the blue card, which is the size of a business card and has on one side the message, 'It's okay to ask for help' with examples of people who can receive a blue card and the bottom line says, 'I need to use my blue card.' On the reverse side, there are three instructions: stay with the person; listen, really listen; get or call for help from Lifeline, 131114, or a suicide call-back service or even triple 0.
       </p>
       <p>
        Operation blue card is similar to programs that exist internationally and it aims to assist and promote young people seeking help in times of need. It is provided free in our region, thanks to a partnership with the south Nowra Rotary Club. The program is in trial phase with a distribution of 20,000 cards to youth centres, mental health facilities, emergency departments, police, crisis accommodation, schools and local businesses.

        There was a time when people with a mental illness were shunned or locked away. Society has certainly evolved to show more acceptance and a greater level of more compassion for those who are going through such episodes in their lives. At a recent gathering to raise awareness, Jon Strang, chair of the Shoalhaven Mental Health Fellowship and consumer advocate, said, 'There are few people in our community who do not have a lived experience of mental illness or at least know someone living with a mental illness.' The Gilmore community is raising awareness, fundraising for services and providing assistance to those with a mental illness.

        There is another community sector that is also being recognised as in need of assistance—that is, the service men and women in our defence forces who have experienced trauma and need help. The coalition accept this and are delivering steady and effective help. Last year, we announced a policy for uncapped funding for counselling and mental health services for them. This week, we announced the next initiative to assist past and current military personnel—a mental health app. It was launched by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Ronaldson, and the Assistant Minister for Defence,

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        This new mobile phone app is designed to help serving and ex-ADF personnel to manage stress and build psychological resilience. It will be available for them to download for free from an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS" rel="nofollow">
         IOS
        </a>
        app store and android Google Play. This high-res app is part of my government's approach to improve mental health outcomes for defence and younger veterans, to recognise their unique military service and to help every single one of them to achieve a better state. We all know what post-traumatic stress disorder is doing to our veterans and we have to offer every avenue of possible assistance.
       </p>
       <p>
        Every single individual can help with the mental health of those around them. Be a good listener. Show that you care. Seek trained guidance to help them or get help for yourself to help them. If you see a friend, whether it be at school or in your community, constantly on their own, talk to them and ask them how they are. For some, that simple act of kindness could make all the difference to their mental health.
