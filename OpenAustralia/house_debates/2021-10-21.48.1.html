        As part of Raise Our Voice's Youth Voice in Parliament Week, today I want to read to the House a speech written by 12-year-old Poppy Broomhall, who attends school at St Mary's College Seymour, which is in the southern part of my electorate of Nicholls. By way of background, young people across Australia were asked to detail where they would like to see Australia in 20 years.

        My vision for Australia in 20 years is there is support readily available for those suffering from mental health issues.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The uprising in mental health issues during COVID and the associated lockdowns has been significant, especially amongst the youth of Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The issue is that there has most definitely not been enough support for those struggling and the Government needs to step in and fix this.

         The Government
        </a>
        needs to encourage more people to study psychology to become therapists and or counsellors, so that when people are struggling, they have that opportunity to go and receive the help and support that they need.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To conclude, I think it is important that the Government prioritises the quality and quantity of help and support for those struggling from mental health issues.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If the focus isn't placed on this today, when will it ever be?
       </p>
       <p>
        This government, I know, has made significant investments in mental health during the COVID pandemic, but, like Poppy, I agree that more can always be done. I'd just like to take this opportunity to thank Poppy and the hundreds of kids who also contributed their messages as to where they want Australia to be in 20 years time.
