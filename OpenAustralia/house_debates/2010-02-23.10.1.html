        My question is to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. I refer the minister to the safety inspections that will now take place in up to one million homes across Australia as a result of his failed home insulation scheme. Can he confirm that the installers of the insulation under this scheme will now inspect their own work?

         I thank the honourable member for his question and I refer him to the announcement I made yesterday concerning further details of the government’s safety inspections and rectification work relating to the terminated Home Insulation Program. I said in the House yesterday that the government is prepared to check as many houses as necessary through this process and that the process of checking will be subject to the necessary scrutiny as has already applied to inspections under the program up to this point. The government will expand its proactive risk based, audited inspection program. It will be expanded to some 15 per cent of homes under the program. Over and above this audit, a hotline will be established for households that are concerned about the safety of their—

          On a point of order, Mr Speaker: the minister has been asked a very clear question about whether installers will be inspecting their own work and this minister is just—

            As I said to the House yesterday, there will be an expanded audit and inspection program focusing on households where there are significant concerns about safety risks, including a hotline which will be progressively rolled out from Wednesday. Additionally, where assessments show that there are significant potential risks, an onsite inspection by an accredited inspector will be arranged. Inspections will occur over time in priority order based on risk. The factors that will be taken into account will include the record of the installer, including any audits or inspections previously conducted; the location, age and nature of the home; roof space issues around ceiling fans; and the type and method of insulation installed—as would be the requirements expected under this inspection program. An accredited inspector is enabled to do the inspections under this program and, on that basis, the program of inspections will be rolled out.
