         I thank the member for Kingston for his question. I can confirm that this government does not just talk about Medicare; we invest the money needed to make a good system even better. As the Treasurer announced on budget night, in the coming year the Howard government will spend $51.8 billion on health and ageing. That is 22 per cent of the federal budget. It is a record and it is up from about 15 per cent back in 1995.

             <p>
              Some of the budget highlights include $291 million to give people with a chronic disease access to longer consultations with specialist physicians. Another highlight is $378 million to give people with a chronic disease and poor oral health access to up to $2,000 worth of Medicare funded dental treatment on referral from their

               GP
              </a>
              . I want to make it very clear that this government can only afford to spend this kind of money, the extra $4.6 billion that we have invested in health and ageing in this budget, because of a strong economy. If you wreck the economy, you wreck health spending too. The Leader of the Opposition knows that he is going to have to cut health spending if he ever becomes the Prime Minister of this country. He knows that. He admitted as much in his notorious
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Faine" rel="nofollow">
               Jon Faine
              </a>
              interview last month when he said:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              Well, when you look at the amount of money which is wasted in duplication overlap in the health and hospital system ... I believe there is great scope to extract significant savings.
             </p>
             <p>
              This is not just some obscure backbencher. This is not some professor at a university. This is the alternative Prime Minister of this country. This is the person who is arrogant enough to think that he is going to be Prime Minister by Christmas—and he says that there is great scope to extract significant savings.
             </p>
             <p>
              Health is very important to the people of this country and the Leader of the Opposition needs to explain himself. In fact, I think he should have a press conference. I think a press conference today would be an excellent idea. Questions on health might not be the first questions he is asked, but they certainly should be some of the questions he is asked. He cannot make these kinds of statements without explaining exactly how much he thinks is going to be saved and exactly where he thinks these savings might be made. If, as I suspect, he just got it completely wrong on John Faine—he was completely flustered—he should have the guts to say that he got it wrong. When the member for Barton got it wrong in the
