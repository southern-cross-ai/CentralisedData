        On R U
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OK" rel="nofollow">
         OK
        </a>
        ? Day, I want to give a shout out to all those who suffer or have suffered with mental health issues and to their families and friends. The daily rituals of living—the getting up and getting going—are taken for granted by those who've never known the torment, the struggle, of anxiety or depression or the countless other debilitating conditions, whether situational or ongoing. To those who know the struggle, because they live days where their bed is their only safe place, and to those who love and care for them and are often left painfully aware of the trauma but are unable to be of immediate assistance, today is about recognising that your pain is known to many and that there is help available, even if on some days it feels like there isn't.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today is an important day to acknowledge the legitimacy of the pain and to encourage people to start the conversations with those suffering and those we suspect are suffering. R U OK? is about asking the real question and listening to the real answers. It is a reminder to all of us to take the time to stop and listen and to check in on those we love or care for. In this place, it is a day to remind us that when we shape policy we need to remember the numbers suffering and the difficulties they might have in interactions on any given day or for whatever period they suffer.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want also to say to families of those suffering: are you okay? Because you too need support and to be part of a conversation as we all work together to build systems that support rather than punish.

         Tomorrow is the anniversary of my first speech in this House. My reflection is that in my role as the member for Chisholm I remain truly honoured and proud to have the opportunity to meet literally thousands of wonderful people. However, despite all of our daily interactions with people, be they friends, family, work colleagues or indeed constituents, one can often not really know if a person is okay. Anxiety, depression and other disorders are conditions that make people unwell and not okay. They are conditions that are often invisible to us as we go about our daily activities. Today is R U

         </a>
         ? Day. It is a question that can start an impactful conversation with our loved ones, friends and colleagues, and a campaign which encourages all Australians to reach out and check in with our mates and loved ones. Almost half of all Australians will experience mental health issues in their life.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm proud of the Turnbull government's investment package towards building a modern, 21st-century mental health system. I'm equally proud of the campaigns the universities in Chisholm are running on R U OK? Day. At Deakin University in Burwood and at

         </a>
         in Clayton, staff and students are encouraging conversations and connections that build community and support those who may be struggling. Today and every day I encourage all Australians to be proactive, be brave and ask three little words, 'Are you okay,' which can have an enormous impact.
