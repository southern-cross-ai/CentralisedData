       <p>
        It is with a heavy heart that I rise to pay tribute to father of three and Bonner local Michael Warburton. On the night of 26 September 2022, Michael passed away from a tragic hit-and-run incident in Hemmant. A victim of youth crime, Michael was driving his beloved Vespa home from the gym when he was hit by a stolen car being driven by a 15-year-old teen.
       </p>
       <p>
        Michael was only 59 years old and recently celebrated 33 years of marriage to his beloved wife, Anita. Michael had no greater love than his family, and it is heartbreaking to think that Anita; his mum and dad, Jean and Graham; and his three children, Jessica, Blake and Riley, will now spend the rest of their lives without their husband, son and father.
       </p>
       <p>
        Michael's other great love and passion after his family were the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrith_Panthers" rel="nofollow">
         Penrith Panthers
        </a>
        . He was ecstatic to watch his favourite team fight for another premiership win this Sunday, and he wore the Panthers jersey every chance he had. Michael was a Navy man and dedicated much of his life to the service and protection of this great country. Michael was known as a kind, generous and caring man who would go out of his way to help those in need. No family should have to go through this heartbreak. We wish his family all the very best.
