        examined an issue of great concern to me and the people of my electorate. I would like to reiterate a few points about the exploitation of seasonal and foreign workers in the horticulture sector. Firstly, ending exploitation starts with the supermarket giants who are squeezing our growers for every last cent. The supermarkets may be able to dodge responsibility and liability by pleading ignorance, but under the current law there is no such protection for farmers. Those using contract labour hire companies are equally culpable. Secondly, the majority of farmers do the right thing. A few bad seeds are giving the horticulture sector a bad reputation. Farmers are the backbone of this country. Appallingly, farmers' share of the selling price has declined from almost 90 per cent in the early 1900s to less than 10 per cent today.
       </p>
       <p>
        My office has taken calls from across Australia since the program went to air. People are desperate to show their support for young foreign workers. And so we have started a Facebook campaign called Support our Backpackers, to highlight the important contribution that they make to agriculture, tourism and regional economies. I would also like people to post their stories about farmers who treat their workers well. Most backpackers that I have spoken to say they have contacted government agencies, describing many of them as 'toothless tigers'. My office has experienced this firsthand. When we try to pass on allegations, my staff are bounced from one department to another. I can only imagine how difficult it must be to navigate three levels of government and multiple departments and agencies in a foreign country.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Fair Work Ombudsman's office regularly contacts my office looking for intel. Unless we can provide them with documentary evidence and detailed information, they say their hands are tied. They announce their visits in local media and visit legitimate hostels. They target the low-hanging fruit, with some of the bigger growers in my electorate audited multiple times. The Minister for Employment, Senator Abetz, last night told a budget function that he shared my concerns and that the government would be taking action.
       </p>
       <p>
        As outlined in the 2015 budget, the government will save about $550 million over five years from closing unnecessary detention centres. I would like to see a small portion of that money diverted to a multiagency task force and an effective one-stop-shop hotline for foreign workers and farmers. Last night the Treasurer also announced that from 1 July 2016, working holiday makers will pay tax from their first dollar earned. They will no longer enjoy a tax-free threshold. Treasury estimates this will raise $540 million over four years. While I share the Treasurer's view that anyone earning money in Australia should pay tax in Australia, can you imagine how much revenue could be raised if we ensured our foreign workers were being paid properly? At the moment, they operate in a black economy, where many workers get paid in cash or not at all. The time for inquiries and reports is over. We simply need to enforce the existing laws.
       </p>
       <p>
        While I am on my feet, I would like to thank the Treasurer and those ministers who have consulted and worked with the backbench this year to produce a budget that is responsible, measured and fair.
