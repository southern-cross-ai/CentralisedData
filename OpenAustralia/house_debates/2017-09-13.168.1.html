        Madam Deputy Speaker Wicks, as I am sure you and those in this place will agree, in this day and age, the sound and fury and clash of various partisan positions dominates much of the debate we see week in and week out, but one of the areas in which I am supremely confident there will be no such partisanship—and, if anything, a remarkable spirit of camaraderie and collegiality—relates to the support of Men's Sheds. Men's Sheds all around the country are where wonderful things occur with blokes who are usually of post-retirement age coming together not only to make terrific pieces of woodwork and other important structures for our community but also to bond, to share stories, to have a laugh, to have a cuppa.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my electorate alone, in the federal seat of Perth, I've visited a great number of Men's Sheds and have been overcome about the wonderful work being done—by the Men's Shed in Vincent and the Men's Shed in Bayswater. But what I would like to focus on today is the wonderful people, men and women, who run the Men's Shed in Bassendean. This Men's Shed deserves particular praise for a number of reasons. Firstly, despite the fact they are still struggling for a new home—they have recently moved out of their location in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eden_Hill" rel="nofollow">

        and, hopefully, with a bit of goodwill and heavy lifting by all levels of government, we can find a home for them in Bassendean so they can continue their good work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite those challenges, they maintain a great sense of collegiality. Despite not having a permanent location, they continue to meet and plan events that make a wonderful contribution to the community. They are ably led by President Robert Oakes, supported by Secretary Clive Brown. I would like to pay tribute to Clive Brown, who is here in the chamber today. Clive is not only a wonderful community contributor these days, but, as I'm sure those back home in the great state of

        will know, Clive was also one of the most hardworking members of parliament we have seen for over two decades. He was first elected as the member for Morley, in 1993, then, soon after that, became the member for Bassendean, where he served all the way through until his retirement, in 2005. During that time, as the Minister for State Development he played an enormous role in relation to the shape of the state's future. You would be forgiven for thinking you could have some rest time after that kind of history and being a hardworking member, but no such thing for Clive. Together with his wife, Sally, they continue to be tireless advocates for their local Bassendean community. We are very lucky to have him with us and to have the contribution he has made. With his help the Men's Shed will thrive and prosper. Thank you, Clive.
