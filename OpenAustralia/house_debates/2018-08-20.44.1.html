       <p>
        It's easy to be distracted by some of the shenanigans here in the House, but, while those distractions occur, let us never lose focus on exactly what this government has achieved. Its achievement for my region, on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        , is extraordinary. We've completed stage 2 of the light rail, with a $95 million contribution by this government. A billion dollars has gone into the M1 to see that completed right through to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tugun_Bypass" rel="nofollow">
         Tugun Bypass
        </a>
        . A billion dollars has been put forward. We're also committed to working with the opposition to duplicate the M1 through building the inter-regional transport corridor. I commend the state opposition for what they're doing. Three hundred million dollars was contributed to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games" rel="nofollow">

        , including $147 million in direct cash to build things. The Labrador Hockey Club was upgraded and there is a brand new Coomera Indoor Sports Centre, all built by the Commonwealth. Over $12 million has been spent on local roads under the

        and hundreds of thousands of dollars has been spent on local community programs. I run the nation's largest aged-care seniors forum run by an MP, with almost 3,000 elderly Australians learning about goods and services. Holistically, across the board, the government continues to keep our borders safe. We've turned around 33 boats. We continue to prosecute our war on terror. We're balancing the books. We're nine months away from the budget being balanced after such a long time. We've delivered on personal income tax. This is a great celebration of what's happening.
