        My question is to the Minister for Trade and Investment. Will the minister update the House on the vital contribution that Australian exporters make to our economy across a wide range of areas and the importance of recognising their efforts?

         I acknowledge the accomplished private-sector career of the member, which has given him a strong trade and investment understanding. Australian exports have been a major reason why Australia has enjoyed 24 years of uninterrupted economic growth. In fact, through to June this year, exports contributed 1.4 to 2.4 per cent growth. We have got some wonderful and innovative exporters out there, and their efforts were celebrated on Friday night at the 53rd Australian Export Awards in Melbourne. From 74 finalists there were 12 category winners. The finalists generated more than $1.9 billion in export sales in 2014-15 and employ more than 16½ thousand Australians.

         The free trade agreements we have concluded with Korea, Japan and China, as well as the transformational Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, are unlocking unprecedented access to major markets for our exporters, and we have been and are a proud trading nation. To the winners of the Australian Export Awards, along with other category finalists: we salute you.
