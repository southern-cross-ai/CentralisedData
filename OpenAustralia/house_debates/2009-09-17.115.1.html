        On 1 September 2009, I attended the inaugural St Vincent de Paul Vinnies Social Justice Awards presentation, where around 200 schoolchildren from public, independent and Catholic schools from around
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        were presented with awards for their exceptional humanitarian work. It was most heartening to hear of the diverse range of social justice contributions the young people were making as each of them stepped up to be presented with their award. Their contributions highlighted exceptional levels of compassion and care for others, both within Australia and overseas. The acknowledgement of these qualities in young people by the St Vincent de Paul Society serves to encourage social values in others, including adults, who often become drawn into the efforts of their children.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was particularly pleased to see many young people from the Makin electorate receiving awards on the night. I take this opportunity to recognise them in this place. Recipients of the Blessed Frederic Ozanam Awards were Meggan Blagg, Vanessa Nocera, Laura Shelley and Brittany Warren from

        and Cassandra Mawson from Gleeson College. I congratulate each of the recipients and commend them for what they are doing.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the following Sunday, 6 September, I attended a special church service at St Francis Xavier’s Cathedral in Adelaide, where Dominic Lagana was commissioned into his new role as head of the St Vincent de Paul Society by Archbishop Philip Wilson. The work of St Vincent de Paul is well known and I do not need to elaborate on it. However, I expect that the appointment of Dominic Lagana, a young, articulate and energetic person, to the position of state president can only extend the valuable work of the society. I wish him well in his new appointment.
