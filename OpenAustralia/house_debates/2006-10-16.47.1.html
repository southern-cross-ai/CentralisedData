        My question is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. Would the minister update the House on the government initiatives to reduce greenhouse emissions while maintaining economic growth? Is the minister aware of any alternative policy approaches?

         I thank the member for Gilmore for her question and also for her strong advocacy in ensuring that greenhouse gas emissions are lowered while at the same time protecting economic growth. When it comes to greenhouse policy, this government has the balance right between emissions reduction and economic growth. Consider for example our $500 million investment in the Low Emission Technology Demonstration Fund and our $100 million energy fund announced as part of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate—a global partnership which particularly involves countries like India and China. As well as that, there is the $75 million Solar Cities program, which recently saw both Adelaide and Townsville announced as the nation’s first solar city hosts—a signal of real determination from this government to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through technology. These initiatives are all part of the government’s $1.9 billion strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions—a strategy which unashamedly focuses on technology to deliver real and economically sustainable greenhouse gas solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, any discussion on low-emission technology cannot ignore nuclear power. Across the world, nuclear power accounts for 16 per cent of the energy produced and it is already saving, in CO emissions, some 2.4 billion tonnes every year. The government believe Australia is ready for a debate on nuclear energy—a debate based on facts, not fear. We are looking forward to seeing the results from the

            They hide behind their ideology. They do not have the courage to come out and debate the energy issue. They think that by signing Kyoto and putting taxes on Australians they will solve the greenhouse gas emission issue. They will not. Under the reign of Kyoto, emissions globally will increase by 40 per cent. What is needed is technological solutions. Imposing carbon taxes, as the Labor Party proposes, will simply export Australian industry and jobs to countries not bound by greenhouse targets. Labor is simply not prepared to do the hard work or make the difficult decisions to find the real answers to climate change concerns. By contrast, this government gets on with the job, taking a world-leading role in developing lasting technological solutions to the greenhouse challenge.
