        Today is a momentous day. The community wanted action on climate change, the business community wanted action on climate change and the government wanted action on climate change. The community spoke at the federal election last year, and said that they wanted to see our country move to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and, for decades, the business community has said that they want business certainty. And today, this week, we've seen that the 47th
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament of Australia
        </a>
        also wants action on climate change. The safeguard mechanism bill is about today and tomorrow. I note that there are students here, and it's really important that they're here. It's important that the students are here and witness what it is that members of parliament are doing in this place.

        Many people know that I was born and bred in a mining town. I'm an engineer who has worked on the mines, and I spent the last 10 years working with companies to help them to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. The thing that I saw through the decade when I worked in that area is that the policy uncertainty was awful. There was so much chopping and changing; companies were trying to adjust to what they needed to do and it just wasn't there. What today signifies is that we're sending strong signals to businesses so that they know we expect them to pull their weight.

        I have a friend who works in

        , which many people would know is one of Twiggy Forrest's companies. FMG has two arms: its iron ore business and also its hydrogen business. The thing that's really interesting when I speak to my friend is that she talks about how excited people are to work in the clean energy sector. If we think about what motivates people, it's autonomy, mastery and purpose. What people want is purpose in their vocation and purpose in clean energy jobs. This policy, along with the National Reconstruction Fund, will unlock clean energy jobs.

        knew that we needed action on climate change; that's why he introduced the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act. I'm shocked that today the coalition did not vote for climate action. Did they not get the memo? Did they not see the election results? Are they trying to be irrelevant? Have they not had a look at the crossbench? I'm wondering what their election strategy will be for the next election.

        I know that, historically, climate change has been quite political; it has blown up political leaders and parties. But the thing that I want to assure people of is that this policy is tight and the Labor Party is united. I also have to take my hat off to the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Change
        </a>
        and Energy; I cannot imagine the complexity of balancing the input from different people, from the crossbench to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGO" rel="nofollow">
         NGO
        </a>
        community and to business. Somehow, we've done this.
       </p>
       <p>
        And I want the children of Australia to know that this parliament wants to make sure they inherit a liveable planet. I think that is critical, and it's something everyone deserves to be part of. I remember that when I was studying my university course there was a young woman who was quite brilliant—she ended up getting dux of the year. There was an oil and gas company which wanted to court the most brilliant students. This was the first time they had provided a job offer, but this young woman said, 'Actually, I'd like to work in a different area.' It was the first time they'd seen that. I imagine the thing we're going to see now is decarbonisation of the economy across the board. This is going to be really exciting. The truth is that now we'll see our large polluters reducing their emissions—and I'm glad there's also an absolute baseline associated with that.

        To Swan, it is such a privilege to be elected to this place and to work for you and deliver good policy. I remember knocking on doors in Swan and people wanted action on climate change, and I remember one day when three neighbours all in their own words explained that they wanted action on climate change. Please know I do not take one day for granted. To Lincoln and Felicity, know that this is one of the reasons why I've stood in this place, and I'm really looking forward to creating great policy and creating that positive future.
