        On indulgence: Mr Speaker, the day before yesterday there was a visitor in the gallery with a young child. The young lady raised with me the issue that she was embarrassed about the child crying in the chamber. I said to her that she should not be embarrassed at all. It is a great sound, in fact. I was reflecting on what she said and recalled there are closed-in galleries here, some of which are not used. I was wondering if you could consider over the break whether there would be the capacity for parents with young children to go into some of those galleries to observe question time in a more family-friendly environment, particularly with a little toddler running around or something. The ones up above the chamber would certainly provide a good opportunity for that, even though a lot of the closed-in galleries are used for schoolchildren.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, Mr Speaker, merry Christmas! To the Leader of the House, thank you for your cooperation last night. To all members of parliament, I hope you have a really safe, happy and blessed Christmas, a wonderful new year, good health and that all your dreams come true.

         In response to the comments of the member for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         , I totally agree that the mother concerned should not have been in any way embarrassed. A crying baby in the gallery, from the point of view of those in the chair, is the least of our worries. On the serious proposal, there has from time to time been discussion about the matters raised by the member for North Sydney. Regrettably, the access to the galleries used by the schools presents challenges for wheelchairs, prams and the like. But I think it is an apt reminder, and we can revisit the proposal that the member for North Sydney has raised.

          when it comes to the issue of babies and young children. I think that we should be doing whatever we can practically to make this a family-friendly environment. So I commend the comments of the Manager of Opposition Business and look forward to your consideration of that. I wish you in particular, but also all members and senators, a merry Christmas and a happy
