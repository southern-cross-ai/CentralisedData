        It was an exciting weekend in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarra_Ranges" rel="nofollow">
         Yarra Ranges
        </a>
        , with many fantastic community events that I had the pleasure to attend and hold stalls at. I started with the Upwey Belgrave
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        's inaugural Family Fun Day and Volunteer Expo. It kicked off in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandenong_Ranges" rel="nofollow">
         Dandenong Ranges
        </a>
        . It was great fun. It was wonderful to see so many locals there looking at how they can support community organisations in Upwey, Dandenong and the surrounding areas.

        Then on Sunday it was the Wandin North Harvest Market, fun for the whole family, with lots of stalls and lots of fresh produce—a great fundraiser. Congratulations to Principal Paul Bailey, Megan and all the Wandin North Primary School community volunteers on another successful harvest market.

        Then it was Celebrate Mooroolbark, where I had the opportunity to abseil, thanks to the Mooroolbark Scouts group. Ten metres was high. I did survive, and it's good to be here—I didn't need the member for Robertson's medical expertise, luckily! But it was great fun. It was wonderful to see how empowered the Scouts were as abseilers. They were great coaches. I was in good hands. I got to spend some time with my family. My daughter was wrapped to be the judge in the baking competition. She was a very harsh critic, but there was lots of great food there. It was a wonderful time for our community to come together, so congratulations to Renae, the committee and the volunteers on another successful Celebrate Mooroolbark event on Sunday in our community.
