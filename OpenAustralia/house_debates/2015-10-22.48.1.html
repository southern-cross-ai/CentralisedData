       <p>
        I would like to take this occasion to congratulate Ivan Sulfaro, the winner of the 2015 Australian open 18s singles table tennis championships. Ivan was born and resides in my electorate in Manningham. He was educated locally at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Gregory" rel="nofollow">
         St Gregory
        </a>
        the Great Primary School and then at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xavier_College" rel="nofollow">
         Xavier College
        </a>
        in Kew.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ivan has had over 20 international caps, representing Australia at international table tennis tournaments right around the world. Indeed, he is currently ranked the No. 1 junior player in Oceania, and his Australian senior ranking is No. 4, which is a tremendous effort.
       </p>
       <p>
        He was selected to represent Australia at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITTF" rel="nofollow">
         ITTF
        </a>
        World Junior Championships in France in December, where he will be competing. Indeed, he is currently in training in Europe and playing for a team in the Polish table tennis league. Ivan is also preparing for the Olympic selection or qualifying trials to be held in Australia in February of next year.
       </p>
       <p>
        It has not always been plain sailing for this very elite athlete. He had to overcome a number of quite serious injuries and operations to get back to the No. 1 junior ranking which he currently holds. So I would like to congratulate him and indeed his whole family on what has been a great achievement in the sport of table tennis.
