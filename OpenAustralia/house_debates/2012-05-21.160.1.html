        It gives me great pleasure to acknowledge six incredible Territorians who volunteer their time to the Duke of Edinburgh Awards or, as it is affectionately known, the 'Dukes Mob' program. I have spoken in this place before about the Dukes Mob. Like any organisation, volunteers are the backbone and, without volunteers, the Dukes Mob would cease to exist.
       </p>
       <p>
        Kerry Scappini is involved with the Dukes Mob through
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henbury_School" rel="nofollow">
         Henbury School
        </a>
        . It was great to meet Kerry last year when she bought some of her Dukes Mob team to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        . Kerry has been involved with the Dukes Mob for five years. She became involved because Henbury needed someone and she thought it would be an interesting challenge. Kerry says she loves setting challenges for the students and watching them succeed. Her message to our youth is: 'You are capable of amazing things; don't let people's thoughts stand in your way.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Spencer Harvey is from the Essington School Darwin, which is another wonderful example of a school with exceptional staff and students. I also have met Spencer and the students love him. He has a great attitude and a fantastic outlook on life. Spencer has been involved with the Dukes Mob for over four years, becoming involved with the Dukes Mob because he believes in what the program offers young people. Spencer's message to our youth is: 'Get out and get involved.' For me, that sums up what Dukes Mob is all about.
       </p>
       <p>
        Emily Corso from Sanderson Middle School has been involved with the Dukes Mob for seven years. Emily first got involved with the Dukes Mob in 2002 as a participant in the program herself. She enjoyed it so much she became a coordinator. Emily says she believes so strongly in the joy and opportunities that the Dukes Mob offers. Emily's message to our youth is: 'Take hold of the opportunities life throws at you.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Shaun Theiber from the Essington International Senior College at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Darwin_University" rel="nofollow">
         Charles Darwin University
        </a>
        has been involved in the program for five years. Shaun says he got involved with the Dukes Mob because it seemed like a worthwhile program that the school should be involved in. Shaun's message to our youth is: 'Everyone's destiny is greatness. All you need to do is go out there and define it.'
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge Nicholas Tait from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kormilda_College" rel="nofollow">
         Kormilda College
        </a>
        and Majeed Mogharreban from Ambrose Business Solutions who are also involved with the Dukes Mob. I am proud that we have such dedicated volunteers who support and inspire our youth. On behalf our community, I thank all of these people for their contribution to the Dukes Mob and to the young people in our community.
