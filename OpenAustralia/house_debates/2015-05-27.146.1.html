        One could feel the spirit of the great English Christian William Wilberforce at the recent unification service that I attended at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mary's" rel="nofollow">
         St Mary's
        </a>
        and

        </a>
        , which have combined into Oaktree Anglican in Glen Eira Road. In the case of St Mary's, the beautiful old bluestone church across from Shelford's Helenslea Manor, this is literally true, as the church was established by descendants of Wilberforce, particularly Sir George Stephens

        for he is abolitionist endeavours. Choral music in churches varies greatly in its quality, as I am sure you know, Deputy Speaker. But I have seldom heard a more beautiful rendition of the hymn
        <i>
         Hallelujah
        </i>
        . Wilberforce's descendants, who established St Mary's in 1871, would be pleased at the muscular faith of its congregation and its senior pastor, the Reverend

        Just a few weeks ago I stood outside the sandstone facade of a church on the island fortress of Gallipoli in the heel of Italy. The church walls are covered with the friezes of the victory over the Turks at the sea battle of Lepanto. Gallipoli is the first place that the Christian fleet anchored after that victory. With hatred for no other creed and with a positive attitude to his own religion, Mark Durie is one of those rare churchmen who speaks confidently not only of his own faith and church but of Western civilisation and why our way of life is worthwhile and worth defending. He is unusual in understanding both the contemporary and historical context of modern faith. I want to pay tribute to the well organised celebrationâ€”what captivating music and a stirring and intellectual sermon.

        The Reverend Mark Durie said great credit for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentecost_Sunday" rel="nofollow">

        service is owed to his colleagues: Executive Pastor Rowan Fairbairn, Arlene Muys, Susan Wraight, Linda Allison, Meg Coppin and Jen O'Brien.

        Many of us have to attend many functions which are sometimes hard work to go from beginning to end, but this was not one of them. It was one of the most enjoyable religious services I have attended for intellectual content, historical presentation and artistic high standards.
