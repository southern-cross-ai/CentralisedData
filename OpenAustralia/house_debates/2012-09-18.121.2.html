       <p>
        Today I would like to take the opportunity to remind members of the House about the impact of the cost of living on households in my electorate and across the nation. What has become apparent in recent years is that, while the headline inflation rate has remained within the two to three per cent range, the real increase in the cost of living for Australian families is much higher. We all know about the increase in the cost as a result of the carbon tax, but the reality is that power price rises and increases in the cost of fuel plus more government fees, charges and taxes have delivered a cocktail where many people struggle to afford life's basic necessities. Indeed, this was reflected in a survey which I conducted earlier this year where 4,100 of my constituents responded. The cost of living was a major cause of concern. Some 37.3 per cent blamed the federal government for the rise in the cost of living; 21.7 per cent blamed state government; and 14.4 per cent, local government.

        I recently received a letter from a pensioner from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nambucca_Heads" rel="nofollow">
         Nambucca Heads
        </a>
        in my electorate. The 75-year-old lady requested that I table a list of her annual expenses so that parliamentarians are aware of how difficult it is to live on the age pension. The lady asked that I not name her, which of course I will respect. But I would like to read members a short letter and table the breakdown of her personal expenses. The letter reads:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Dear Mr Hartsuyker
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I am an old age windowed pensioner, 75 years old. I receive $735 per fortnight.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I have bad arthritis. I was losing my eyesight and paid up front for implant operations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The Labor Government says keep the elderly in their homes but I'm sure they don't know how much that costs. … you should table the expenses an old aged pensioner has.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I receive around $5000 income and Centrelink says my pension and interest plus $300 from a few shares are all taxable. So I have to pay tax—what a joke.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This is what I paid out for the full year.
       </p>
       <p>
        And I will table the list, Madam Deputy Speaker, which I have.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Would you like to add this up and table it in Parliament. When I draw on my investment Centrelink wants to know what I have done with the money.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is certainly of concern, so today I would like to take the opportunity to table a copy of this letter and the list of expenses of this 75-year-old lady. This list provides a comprehensive breakdown of the expenses, which amount to $19,130. Given that this lady received $19,110 in payments from Centrelink, one can understand how hard it is to make ends meet. This is something that all members from both sides must consider when they have an opportunity to vote on increasing the cost of living for families. For many Australians every cent counts and any additional impost the government places on household budgets succeeds in inflicting more pain and despair on those who are most vulnerable. This is an area of concern right across Australia and it is something that we—
