       <p>
        I may be late to the party, but I extend my congratulations to you, Speaker, on your ascension to the chair.
       </p>
       <p>
        Before I get to the meat of my submission, I will just reflect on the comments by the member for Wright. The government's taking foot-and-mouth disease absolutely seriously, with swift, decisive action by the minister. There was a nine per cent chance of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FMD" rel="nofollow">
         FMD
        </a>
        coming to this country a few months ago. It's now just over 11 per cent, so the risk has increased, absolutely. There's an outbreak in Indonesia. We are absolutely taking it seriously.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last month, the north-west of Tasmania was hit by a devastating storm. One woman, whose name has not been publicly released, lost her life. Other locals suffered injuries, and thousands of properties suffered damage. In my electorate, people in and around the town of Sheffield were most affected. People were left without power for as long as 10 days during some of our state's coldest weather. That's no reflection on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora_Energy" rel="nofollow">
         Aurora Energy
        </a>
        , which is Tasmania's state owned power company, nor its workforce. They worked very hard in challenging conditions to restore power as quickly and safely as possible, and I extend my gratitude to them. Tasmania's power workers and state emergency services personnel are often called out in awful weather to deal with downed lines and to reconnect electricity, and they deserve our thanks.
       </p>
       <p>
        The storm resulted in badly damaged properties, with homes losing roofs, fences flattened, equipment broken and livestock scattered. After the storm, I visited numerous properties in and around Sheffield, kindly hosted by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Harris" rel="nofollow">
         Brian Harris
        </a>
        and Wally Crosswell from Kentish Lions. I saw firsthand both the damage and the incredible efforts that the community had made to repair that damage.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thousands of trees were toppled, many of them towering giants literally ripped out of the ground by wind. They took out power poles, roofs and fences. They blocked roads. Elderly residents were left to face repairs, and farmers were confronted with rounding up wayward livestock. Brian and Wally explained that after the storm it was the Lions, alongside the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kentish_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Kentish Council
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">
         SES
        </a>
        and fire brigade, who were first on the ground. Together, they went house to house, talking to residents, examining damage and offering food and fuel vouchers to those in need. The council offered showers. An Airbnb owner offered their investment property free of charge for emergency housing. Local business Tas Pumps Pipes &amp; Rural Supplies offered the use of generators for free. And there were many more similar examples. This was a community that came together in a time of need, and it was a privilege to see it as their federal member.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was clear, though, that government assistance is also required to ensure the region fully recovers. I reached out to the Minister for Emergency Management,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Watt" rel="nofollow">
         Murray Watt
        </a>
        , to determine what assistance may be available and how that may be accessed. He immediately got back to me to say that under Commonwealth-state disaster relief arrangements federal funding was being made available. I'd like to express my thanks to the minister and his office for the timely and compassionate way in which they have dealt with this when they've got a lot of other things on their minds. I've got Senator Watt on speed dial because he's also the minister for agriculture, so he'll no doubt soon know and fear my number, if he doesn't already!
       </p>
       <p>
        The federal funding being made available will assist the north-west to get back on its feet and begin the next step in the extensive rebuilding process. We've seen this decisive action happening across the country under Minister Watt's leadership, most notably during the flooding on the mainland and in recent days with the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Indonesia. He identifies a problem and he takes action. It's a stark and welcome contrast to what we saw previously.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Albanese government knows extreme weather events are becoming more frequent, whether they be floods, droughts, fires or storms. It's a challenge we are prepared and equipped to face, and we will not hide from it. Our communities need us, and we will be there when they do. My thanks again go to the many organisations and locals who assisted their neighbours and friends affected by this extreme weather event. I'm very pleased that as their federal member I was able to confirm that federal assistance was forthcoming.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've taken the opportunity to wear the green and gold. At 4.45 am tomorrow our time it all gets underway in Birmingham. You can watch it on Channel 7.

          I'm not going to say it, Member for Riverina—oi, oi, oi! There are 72 nations taking part and more than 4,000 athletes, more than 400 of whom are Australians. There's no better way to spend your weekend. Get onto the

           Commonwealth Games
