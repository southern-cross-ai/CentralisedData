        My question is to the Prime Minister. An estimated 17,664 Aboriginal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        children were living in out-of-home care last year, compared with 9,070 when
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">
         Kevin Rudd
        </a>
        issued the apology to the stolen generations a decade ago. Will the Prime Minister join Labor in convening a national summit on first nations children to urgently address the alarming number of Indigenous children living in out-of-home care away from family, community and culture?

         I thank the honourable member for her question. Despite our occasional differences here in the House, I want to pay respect to the honourable member for the extraordinary role model she provides as the first Aboriginal woman elected to the House of Representatives. Of course, sitting opposite is the Minister for Indigenous Health,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wyatt" rel="nofollow">

         —if I may be forgiven for using his first name—the first Aboriginal man to be elected to the House of Representatives.

         Again, the opposition has proposed to have a summit on this matter. We obviously consult. We are consulting more thoroughly and comprehensively than ever before. When
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Sarra" rel="nofollow">
          Chris Sarra
         </a>
         said to me—at a football match originally, I might say—that we've got to do things with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         , not to them, it absolutely cut through. He was dead right. That is what we have to do. We need to engage more and consult more, and we've done that. I would just say, in terms of what the honourable member raised, all suggestions are gratefully received. We've just had a special gathering here. I look forward to doing more. The critical thing is to get as much power, authority and accountability, as well informed as possible, as I said in my remarks earlier today, devolved to as local a position as possible—in other words, to make sure the people who are closest to the problems and the challenges are most empowered to deal with them and ensure that the funds, resources and so forth that government provides are best employed. I will consider the honourable member's question. I want to thank her for the spirit in which she asked it.
