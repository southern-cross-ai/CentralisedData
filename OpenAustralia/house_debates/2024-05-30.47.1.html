        This Albanese Labor government has lost complete control of Australia's national security, and that sits squarely at the hands of the hapless, incompetent Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multicultural_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Multicultural Affairs
        </a>
        . Those hands were quick to sign direction 99 but then did nothing to deport so many hard-core criminals. The Prime Minister's close, personal friendships continue to take priority over the safety of the Australian community, and that is totally unacceptable.
       </p>
       <p>
        If you listened to this weak Prime Minister, it's everyone else's fault: it's the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AAT" rel="nofollow">
         AAT
        </a>
        , it's the department, it's the High Court, it's everyone except the minister for immigration. This weak Prime Minister continues to treat the Australian people like they are mugs. He refuses to sack the minister for immigration because the truth is he has always relied on him politically. He has relied on him to vote against boat turnbacks at Labor conferences; to undermine the members for Maribyrnong and Sydney when they led Labor; and to do his leadership numbers in 2019. He has relied on him factionally and as a close, personal friend.
       </p>

        Prime Minister, your loyalty to your factional mates cannot continue to outweigh your loyalty to this country. We know that if the Deputy Prime Minister were
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Mr Albanese would be moved to the backbench. We know that if the Minister for the Environment and Water were PM, Mr Albanese would be moved to the backbench. We know that if the Treasurer were PM, Mr Albanese would be moved to the backbench, probably sitting next to a sacked industry minister. Prime Minister, how many Australians need to be bashed, stabbed, or attacked before you remove this hopeless minister?
