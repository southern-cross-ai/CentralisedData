        My question is to the Minister for Jobs,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Relations" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Women. Will the minister update the House on how the government is helping to combat the scourge of family and domestic violence to try and keep families safe in their homes?

        <p>
         I thank the member for her question on what is a very deeply serious issue for our nation and for this parliament and which continues to have a very devastating impact on far too many Australians across our nation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Yesterday we learnt of the truly shocking murders of five members of one family in suburban Perth. On behalf of the government and the representatives in this parliament, I want to extend our deepest sympathies to the relatives and friends of this grief-stricken family. I know, from speaking to my WA colleagues, that the people of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         are very saddened and shaken by this tragedy, as we all are. On behalf of the MPs of WA and the members of this parliament, I also want to extend our thoughts to the people of WA and express our gratitude to the police, ambulance officers and others who were called to the crime scene and who are helping the family. Any attempt to describe the horror of this tragedy that ended the lives of three small children, the children's mother and their grandmother is futile. It is incomprehensible. A man has been charged with these murders, and the WA police are continuing their investigation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Sadly, it marks the third terrible family killing in WA this year. It is clear that family and domestic violence remains far too prevalent. In WA alone, there have been 23 deaths from family and domestic violence, 19 of whom have been women and children. In Australia, we are rightfully proud of our gun laws introduced by the Howard government in 1996. They are a beacon to the world. But there is no law that can eliminate all violence.
        </p>
        <p>
         As representatives of the people of Australia, together with our colleagues on the other side of the chamber and in the state and territory parliaments around this nation, we must redouble our efforts to stop these tragedies and improve support for those people who are affected. The government has committed well in excess of $300 million towards women's and children's safety. This includes $54 million in the most recent budget for services for women affected by violence and online safety initiatives. Later this week I will also be introducing legislation providing all Australians covered by the Fair Work Act with the right to receive family and domestic violence leave, ensuring up to eight million workers have access to leave during their deepest time of need. And, later today, the parliament will vote on a bill brought on by the Attorney-General which will improve the protections offered through the family law system by preventing perpetrators of violence and abuse from directly cross-examining their victims.
        </p>
        <p>
         On behalf of the parliament, I extend my sympathies to all of those who've been touched by these awful and tragic events.
