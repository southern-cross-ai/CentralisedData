        I rise to speak about a new program that really will help those experiencing domestic violence in our community. We know that the statistics are far too high and that the experience is all too common. Certainly, I know all of us around Australia are saying no to domestic and family violence. Certainly, the Morrison government is absolutely committed to ending domestic, family and sexual violence.
       </p>
       <p>
        We know a lot about physical abuse in relationships. We are learning more and more about the emotional abuse, about gaslighting, about coercive control, about the many ways that women, and men, who are experiencing this sort of abuse are made to feel worthless, less than a sense of self and an inability to control even their most basic of circumstances: safety in the home. Something like economic abuse, which might involve interfering with work, or controlling or withholding money, really reduces a woman's ability to leave a violent or an abusive relationship. That's why the Morrison government has established the escaping violence payment. From July 2020 to June 2021, there were almost 1,500 reported incidents of domestic violence on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        . I do want to emphasise that these are reported incidents, not a total of the unreported incidents, which means that, per 100,000 people on the Central Coast, around 415 people have experienced domestic violence in this last year. The escaping violence payment will mean that anyone in our region leaving a violent relationship with have access of a one-off amount of up to $5,000 to help them live a life free of violence.
       </p>
       <p>
        When a woman is fleeing violence, we know that the size of the house that she's fleeing doesn't matter. Often she will bundle the kids and maybe the family pet into the car. Often they leave with not a lot more than the clothes on their backs. Under a two-year trial of this payment, applicants will receive financial assistance of up to $1,500 in cash, with the remainder available for goods and services or direct payments of bonds, school fees or other support to help establish a safe home. It's important to note that this new payment is not means-tested in a traditional sense, because we know that women from every walk of life can experience violence and we want to encourage them all to reach out for support. The payment isn't taxable. It's not reportable income, and it won't impact on any other social security payments that someone may be receiving. Importantly, the payment is available right now. UnitingCare Australia Consortium has been selected as the service provider to deliver the payments. They'll also support women to engage with other relevant services that support those fleeing violent relationships, and their children.
       </p>
       <p>
        We know that ending domestic and family violence will take more than speaking about it in this place and in these corridors. We need to shift the attitude and culture in this nation. This is certainly a good step forward.
