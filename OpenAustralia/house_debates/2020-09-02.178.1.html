        Many stories have been shared to mark the 75th anniversary of the end of World War

        , and I'd like to share the stories of some veterans I was fortunate enough to meet a few weeks ago. On 20 August, I had the privilege of meeting Max Christmas, Don Bayles, Marie Brearley, Harry Reeve and

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        , presenting them with the commemorative medallions to mark their service and to say thank you for their significant contribution. I'd like to take the time to thank retired Major Peter Williams, secretary of the Launceston RSL Sub-Branch, for all his work in arranging their attendance and for the lovely afternoon tea. It's significant to speak of these veterans today as we mark Battle for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , a time to acknowledge those who served in campaigns to the north of Australia and on the home front in protecting our nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Meeting ex-servicewoman 96-year-old Marie at the event was especially wonderful. Marie joined the Navy at the age of 18, leading the way at a time when women were just starting to join the forces. Marie worked as a telecommunications operator, decoding messages sent across the world. Cementing her place in history, Marie was on duty when the message was sent through that the war was won and, after six years, was finally over. There's a section in the Launceston RSL highlighting Marie's service during the war, and I highly recommend that those interested in the history of our local veterans pay a visit.

        , Melbourne, and seeing his brother. It was the first time they had seen each other in close to five years. Both of Don's brothers had served in the war, one in Darwin and one at Kokoda. Thankfully, all three returned home safely.

        Leading Aircraftman Ronald Jones, his deployment to Darwin after arriving as a third engineer at 3 pm on 19 February 1942 took an abrupt and dramatic turn. Just one hour after he arrived in Darwin, the Battle of Darwin, regarded as one of the largest single attacks ever mounted by a foreign power in our country, began. Almost 80 years later, Ronald recalled being somewhat unfazed by the bombing, stating it never bothered him. He said:

        It was no worse than being anywhere else really, you just had to watch your step, and be a bit more careful.

        Continuing to missions in the Pacific islands, including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
         New Guinea
        </a>
        and Borneo, Ronald was in Borneo when the news came through that the Allied forces had won in the Pacific. 'I remember exactly the moment the war ended,' Ronald said. He then participated in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VJ" rel="nofollow">

        march in Sydney and spent three months in hospital recuperating before moving to Tasmania, where he established a paper mill.
       </p>
       <p>
        Army Private Max Christmas joined the Army when he was 18, as it was the right thing to do. Despite the fact that 75 years has passed since the end of the war, receiving the medal just a few weeks ago meant a great deal to him. I don't take the opportunity to meet with him or those other veterans that day for granted.
       </p>

        But perhaps my favourite moment of the day came when presenting 100-year-old Harry Reeve with his medal. I leant closer to hear him, and Harry whispered, quite sheepishly: '
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darren_Chester" rel="nofollow">
         Darren Chester
        </a>
        has already sent me one of these.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
         Can I
        </a>
        keep this one too?' Given his service, I told him I certainly had no problem with him having two of the medallions. I was very chuffed to learn that Harry has his handwritten 100th birthday card from me on his wall.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the war Harry was a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Navy
        </a>
        , conducting convoy work in the Pacific—chiefly in the New Guinea area. He has previously described this work as 'terribly monotonous—she wasn't all beer and skittles'. The day after the ceremony, Harry wrote a letter of thanks to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Darren Chester, and asked me if I could get it to him. Harry, I look forward to personally delivering your letter to Minister Chester. To Max, Don, Marie, Harry and Ronald: thank you for sharing what stories you were willing and able to.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are just some 12½ thousand surviving
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" rel="nofollow">

        veterans left in this country. To each and every one of them I say thank you, we are forever in your debt. Lest we forget.
