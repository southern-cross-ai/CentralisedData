       <p>
        ) ( ): I congratulate one of the great sporting figures of Ipswich, Mr Murray Rogers, who was recently awarded an Order of Australia medal for services to sports administration in the community of Ipswich. Murray is a familiar and a welcoming face at Ipswich Central State School in my electorate of Blair. He has worked at the school for 12 years, where he is a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PE" rel="nofollow">
         PE
        </a>
        teacher and a regular acting vice-principal. He is one of those terrific teachers who can walk through the playground at lunchtime and greet students by name. I have observed him at sporting assemblies and at regular school assemblies in the school that, when Murray speaks with authority on sport, the children listen with respect.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was on the sporting oval, as a student, that Murray developed his skills and talents. He began his teaching career in 1980 and his work seems to provide students with the same opportunities to sport that he had—and he loved sport. Sport builds confidence, resilience and teamwork, and Murray's contribution to administration, to the coaching of junior sport at school, district and state levels has been immense. Think of any sport—athletics, swimming or others—Murray has participated and coached children in those sports.
       </p>
       <p>
        How many kids have hit a ball because Murray has instilled the value of having a go? How many champions have been set in motion after Murray has told them to do their best? How many futures has Murray inspired? He has been a great sporting champion and administrator at Ipswich, and I congratulate him for his service to the community.
