       <p>
        I rise today to speak on the very important issue of television reception. It seems incredible that, in the 21st century, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
         TV
        </a>
        reception in many areas in my electorate is just not up to scratch. Moonee resident Joanne Beresford recently contacted my office to confirm a problem which exists in the area of Moonee, only 10 kilometres from the major regional centre of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffs_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
         Coffs Harbour
        </a>
        but where the reception is grossly inadequate. It seems incomprehensible that, with a major regional centre, we can have places just on the outskirts of that centre that are unable to access quality TV reception.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wrote to the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Economy" rel="nofollow">
         Digital Economy
        </a>
        back in 2008 about this black spot. The minister advised that the only realistic option for the residents was to apply for satellite television through
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Cross_Central" rel="nofollow">
         Southern Cross Central
        </a>
        or Imparja. Installing satellite television would require an initial outlay of well over $1,000 and that installation can take months. As well as a broadbrush satellite approach to television people also want local content. They want to be able to watch their local news. They want to watch local programs that reflect local communities. Services that are more focused on a national level or on larger regional levels do not meet that local need. So it is vital that we have a response that caters for local needs of local communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        When in government the coalition initiated the $35 million
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Spot_Program" rel="nofollow">
         Black Spot Program
        </a>
        , which provided quality TV reception where it was unavailable in local areas. In addition to that program was a program for some $13.3 million, which was a flexible program providing alternative technical solutions, such as digital retransmission, direct home-to-satellite solutions and various cabling solutions, in black spot areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think it is important in the 21st century that people have access, as I said, to quality TV reception. It is important that the government focus on finding ways to deliver local content to people no matter where they live. We believe in equity of access to a whole range of services. We believe in equity of access to health and education. In the 21st century, which is an information century and a century in which it is vital that people be kept up to date, quality TV reception needs to be part of that. This government need to focus on developing solutions to meet local needs in local areas where television reception is currently not up to standard.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have seen with regard to broadband that the government have left people in rural and regional areas in the lurch. They cancelled the OPEL contract with the rollout of broadband but to date have put nothing in its place. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Broadband_Network" rel="nofollow">
         National Broadband Network
        </a>
        is languishing. It will be years behind by the time that network is delivered. What are people in rural and regional areas to do in the meantime? They are to wait with inadequate broadband services. People should not be abandoned by the government. The government must take up the cause of television reception and provide quality television reception to people no matter where they live.
