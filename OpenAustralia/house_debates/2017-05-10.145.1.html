       <p>
        Today is a special day. Joining us is Terrence John Wand
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        . On behalf of my community, and especially my home town of Wyong, it is an honour to welcome Terry and to share some of his remarkable story. Today would not have been possible without the member for Tangney, my friend
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Morton" rel="nofollow">
         Ben Morton
        </a>
        . Ben and I were a tag team, as two Wyong kids, on this speech.
       </p>
       <p>
        Terrence John Wand was born in 1941, a descendant of two of Wyong's pioneering families. He married his beautiful wife, Wendy Margaret Whitfield of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Macquarie" rel="nofollow">
         Lake Macquarie
        </a>
        , in 1962, and they had their two children, Trudy and Gavin. Terry often reminisces of his childhood in Wyong and reckons it is still a great place to grow up—and I agree with him. During the 1940s and 1950s, Terry and his mates raided orchards, helping themselves to watermelons, and cooled off in the hot summers in beaut swimming spots. Terry fondly recalls being at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wyong_Public_School" rel="nofollow">
         Wyong Public School
        </a>
        in the post-war years and receiving the first flavoured milk in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        , as the Wyong dairy, in Alison Road, experimented with chocolate and strawberry flavours.
       </p>
       <p>
        Terry has always been a hard worker and when growing up he had no shortage of casual jobs, his first paper run paying one pound a week—good money in those days. Terry loves sport and often says that sport must not be left out of Wyong's story. Terry, it cannot be left out of the story, and it will not be now that you have been awarded an OAM for your contribution. Terry knows how lucky the whole town is to have had a group of men establish sporting clubs in the early 1900s. Those clubs are now over 100 years old. Terry loves sport—including rugby league. The Wyong Rugby League Club, the Roos, holds a special place in his heart. Terry's playing career lead to a fine coaching career, highlights being winning the New South Wales Rugby League Harold Matthews Cup, in 1980, and coaching many premiership-winning teams. I like his coaching strategy of not wearing you out in the off-season, so keeping you fresh for the main game.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is arguable, however, that his greatest contribution is as a sports administrator, working with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Bishop" rel="nofollow">
         Joe Bishop
        </a>
        , Morrie Breen and Mr Vaughan to salvage the club, which was formed in 1910, and make it one of the most successful sports clubs in Australia. Terry's heroic efforts as honorary secretary in endeavouring to gain a certificate of registration and liquor licence and build a clubhouse for, I think, the sum of $68,000, is the stuff of Wyong folklore.
       </p>
       <p>
        Terry is a life member of both Wyong Rugby League Club Group and the

        <p>
         I am very pleased to join the member for Dobell in congratulating Mr Wand on his
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
          OAM
         </a>
         . I have known Mr Wand all of my life, and he is very dear to me. Mr Wand's contribution is not just to rugby league. Mr Wand is very much involved in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masonic_Lodge" rel="nofollow">
          Masonic Lodge
         </a>
         on the

         </a>
         , an organisation that he joined on 21 March 1991.
        </p>
        <p>
         On Masonry trips Terry is known to provide travellers with a history lesson on local information and landmarks. People refer to him as a walking encyclopaedia. On trips to places like Muswellbrook, Dunedoo, Tamworth, Scone, Katoomba, Coonabarabran and Vaucluse, Terry and the Masons would raise money for charities and local organisations, like the Wyong hospital, surf lifesaving, prostate cancer and the men's shed at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bateau_Bay" rel="nofollow">
          Bateau Bay
         </a>
         . Terry progressed through committee positions and became a junior warden in 1997 and a senior warden in 1998, the second-most senior of the lodge. He also became heavily involved in the lodge's Anzac commemoration service. Terry became Master of the Wyong Tuggerah Lakes Masonic lodge in 1999 and, at the request of the grand master, held this position for two years, a position that is normally held for only a 12-month term.
        </p>
        <p>
         In 2008, Terry became involved in the Grand Officer Committee and was elected to the board of management as operations chairman. Terry excelled himself in this difficult role and is responsible for a number of very important changes to the Masonic reporting system.
        </p>
        <p>
         In 2009, Terry became Secretary of Lodge. He still holds that position today and he remains actively involved in the local masonic widows association.
        </p>
        <p>
         In 2010, the district honoured him by electing him to the position of district grand inspector of workings. He also became a member of the grand lodge administration team.
        </p>
        <p>
         Terry has made a very strong contribution to his community. One of his proudest achievements is that of being the under-16 Central Coast breaststroke champion. His selfless commitment to his community, to the Masons and to the Wyong Rugby League Club Group, and his charitable work, his friendship and his compassion for so many people in the local Wyong community are recognised and applauded today by the parliament of Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         It does not just happen, and I would like to mention Mrs Wendy Wand for supporting Terry in his work for the Wyong Rugby League Club Group and his work as a Mason.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am very pleased to be a close friend of Terry and his family. I am pleased that he is here today to share this occasion with us. Terry, congratulations on being awarded the honour of the

          I thank both the honourable members for their contribution. I think it is very prudent that we acknowledge, in the way of affirmation, their subject here today. May I join in the affirmation and congratulate you on the contribution you have made to our nation. We are pleased that you are present with us here in the chamber. Thank you.

          If no member objects, three-minute constituency statements will continue today for 60 minutes. That being the case, I call the honourable member for Makin.
