        I rise today to express my dismay at the decision by the Queensland Labor government to cut the 8c a litre fuel subsidy. During this time of economic uncertainty and with the unemployment rate forecast to hit one million unemployed by 2010-11, it is inconceivable that the Bligh Labor government would take away this subsidy that has underpinned support for families and for motorists in the transport sector in Queensland. The Bligh Labor government’s removal of the subsidy is essentially the introduction of a new tax on Queensland motorists and the transport sector. The respected

        estimates that by removing the subsidy of 8.35c per litre, plus
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">

        , the price of petrol will increase by 9.2c a litre. That is a 9.2c a litre tax on petrol, compliments of the Labor government in Queensland.

        It takes some 20 hours to drive non-stop from Birdsville in the west of my electorate to Blackbutt in the east. This gives you some idea of the tyranny of distance in Queensland, particularly in regional areas. Often people have to take their children over long distances to school, or to get to town or to a doctor. Not all Queenslanders have access to subsidised urban public transport. This will have a negative impact on Queensland transport industries, which travel across our vast state from border to border. These costs will be passed on to families in the cities, who will incur the costs when they line up at the supermarket checkout. The removal of the fuel subsidy comes as Queensland vehicle registration cops a further increase of up to 15 per cent on 1 July this year. This will cost Queensland families several hundred dollars extra per year.

        -National coalition government in the 1970s and 1980s refused to put a tax on fuel when other states did, because we understood the impact this would have on Queensland families and Queensland industries. We understand the difficulties for people living in rural and remote areas who pay higher prices for fuel than their city counterparts. But this city-centric Bligh Labor government’s actions are showing that they have no such consideration for Queenslanders who live outside the south-east corner. After mismanaging the economy of Queensland, Queensland Labor is now in panic mode, selling off everything, such as the rail corporation, for example. We understand that electricity is on the agenda and we think that perhaps water is too—whatever they can find. The household silver is now going to be put on the market in these very uncertain times. Queensland motorists and families should not suffer because of the Beattie-Bligh Labor government’s epic failure to manage the Queensland economy. I condemn the Queensland Labor government—
