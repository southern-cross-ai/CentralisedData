        Today I recognise the recent passing of Bill Redhead, a long-time resident of Para Hills. Bill came to Australia from England with his wife, Rene, and in the early 1960s settled in Para Hills. At the time, Para Hills was being transformed from farmland to a housing estate by Reid Murray Developments Pty Ltd. The lack of community facilities saw the emergence of an active progress association, of which Bill Redhead was a key driver and office holder. The efforts of the progress association resulted in the preservation of a considerable area of land for recreation and sporting facilities; the Para Hills Community Club, which today is a thriving community asset; and several other community initiatives.
       </p>
       <p>
        A clear thinker and always prepared to speak his mind, Bill became a successful negotiator in pursuing the interests of his community. At his workplace at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_Ltd" rel="nofollow">
         News Ltd
        </a>
        , Bill became a spokesman and defender of workplace rights for his fellow work mates. Even in his latter years, Bill's interest in the community did not wane, and he remained an active member of the local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neighbourhood_Watch" rel="nofollow">
         Neighbourhood Watch
        </a>
        group. In 2002, as Salisbury mayor, I had the privilege of naming Bill Redhead as Salisbury's Citizen of the Year for his many years of community leadership.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bill was supported to the end by his wonderful wife, Rene. The two were inseparable. His legacy will be his contribution to the development of Para Hills and, more particularly, the enduring community facilities which today stand as testament to the foresight and determination of Bill and his fellow pioneers, the new settlers of the era. To Rene and the Redhead family members, I extend my condolences and my appreciation for Bill Redhead's notable contribution in making our local area a better place than he found it.

        On a separate matter, on Thursday, 27 February I attended an information session on eye health at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tea_Tree_Gully" rel="nofollow">
         Tea Tree Gully
        </a>
        council offices. Referred to as the My Eye Health Program, the information session was sponsored and organised by the Freemasons Foundation in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        with the support and partnership of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Society" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Society
        </a>
        for the Blind, RANZCO and the Sight For All Foundation. I understand that the Freemasons Foundation has already sponsored over 30 similar events throughout South Australia. The purpose of the information sessions is to raise community awareness and education around the issues of eye health, intervention and rehabilitation.
       </p>
       <p>
        With almost half of all Australians affected by vision issues at some stage in their lives, eye health is a major national issue. We also know that early diagnosis, intervention and appropriate treatment can make a huge difference in correcting disorders and preventing blindness. If detected early, eye diseases such as macular degeneration, cataracts, diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma can, with professional care, be well managed. It is therefore important to get the message out to the community that regular eye examinations—preferably once a year—by an eye health professional are a must, particularly as a person gets older. That is the key message of the eye health program. I commend the Freemasons who, through their Freemason Foundation, are raising funds to support the My Eye Health program and raise community awareness about this important health issue.
