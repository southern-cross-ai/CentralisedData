       <p>
        I rise to congratulate the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove_Mountain" rel="nofollow">
         Mangrove Mountain
        </a>
        community and its community leaders, who pulled together to celebrate life on the mountain at the annual Mangrove Mountain Country Fair on Saturday, 24 October. The fair is a celebration of community that brings together people from right across the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        . People flocked from all over our region to attend the fair. It is testament to the organising committee that attendance is increasing every year. I congratulate the president of the organising committee, Neil Berecry-Brown, his fellow committee members and all those who arranged events and stalls; Rowena Wilcher, who organised the stage appearances; Dr Christine Wade, who organised the very entertaining pig races and the livestock displays; and Dennis Fisher, a school farm assistant, who ran the petting farm and who was also ably assisted by several local students. I am pleased to inform the House that Somer, the Somersby school pig, was the winner of the pig race, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mud_House" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        won the Battle of the Bands. So, if members want to be as happy as a pig in mud, I recommend they visit next year’s Mangrove Mountain Fair.
       </p>
       <p>
        Importantly, this year’s event raised $24,000. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CWA" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        stall alone raised $2,400. All this money will go back into the community—into local schools, community organisations and sporting clubs, including the local bush fire brigade. I warmly congratulate the organisers and supporters of the Mangrove Mountain Fair for their enterprise and community spirit. I look forward to supporting their event and their community for many years to come.
