        I rise in support of the primary producers and small businesses in northern Victoria to express my outrage at the way the Baillieu Liberal government is failing the families of the north. Last year, the Baillieu Liberal government put the Epping fruit and vegetable market under a taxpayer funded review—one of the hundreds across the state. Traders told the
        <i>
         Age
        </i>
        their businesses and their lives have been up in the air since the November election of the Baillieu government and its decision to review the market move. Twenty-year market veteran Fred Pascale said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I can't make investment decisions; I have been left in limbo.
       </p>
       <p>
        Traders were told in December that a decision on the market's future would be announced 'over the next few weeks'. This sham review is 165 days overdue and with the future of the project on hold there is uncertainty among investors and businesses in the north.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 2 March,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denis_Napthine" rel="nofollow">
         Denis Napthine
        </a>
        , Minister for Major Projects, released a statement which said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Coalition" rel="nofollow">
         The Coalition
        </a>
        will announce a decision on how it will proceed with the project within a matter of weeks.
       </p>
       <p>
        What was meant to be a matter of weeks has now been some seven months. It is an absolute disgrace, an absolute sham and an absolute disregard for the people of Victoria. A review will not pay the bills, it will not support families and it will not support our local businesses.

         Order! It being 2 pm, the time for members' statements has concluded. Earlier, the Leader of the Opposition was foot-faulted by the Deputy Speaker when he was trying to send best wishes to the member for Bennelong for his birthday. I am sure that the House—begrudgingly in some cases but with great glee in others—wishes the member for Bennelong all the best for what I understand is a significant anniversary.
