        <i>
         Superannuation funds offering employer MySuper products
        </i>
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1A) A default fund term of a modern award must permit an employer covered by the award to make contributions, for the benefit of a default fund employee, to a superannuation fund that offers an employer MySuper product that relates to the employer.
       </p>
       <p>
        These amendments implement changes to default superannuation arrangements for employees to whom a modern award applies. The new schedule 3 of the bill amends the Fair Work Amendment Act 2012 to allow an employer to make contributions for default fund employees to whom a modern award applies to a superannuation fund in respect of an employer MySuper product—that is, a tailored or corporate MySuper product—subject to the product being approved by the Fair Work Commission.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments would establish a two-stage approval process under which an expert panel of the Fair Work Commission will assess employer MySuper products to determine whether they are in the best interests of the relevant default fund employees. This approval process, including the legislated criteria for both stages of assessment, is largely consistent with the process for generic MySuper products that was established in the Fair Work Amendment Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments will also increase the maximum number of funds that can generally be specified in a modern award from 10 to 15. This addresses concerns that employers covered by multiple modern awards could be prevented from using employer-specific subplans of generic superannuation products. This could arise because, to use a subplan for all employees, the generic product must be included in every modern award covering the employer. There was a concern from industry—from corporate funds—that the existing limit of 10 funds might see some high-performing funds not being included in particular modern awards where there are more than 10 funds with highly suitable generic superannuation products. The proposed amendments ensure that high-performing funds have reasonable prospects of being specified in modern awards for which the FWC—the Fair Work Commission—assesses them as highly suitable for employees covered by the award. The measures will also provide certainty that stakeholders have sought regarding when arrangements may change by not requiring any changes to existing arrangements before at least 1 January 2015.
       </p>
       <p>
        These amendments have been developed following an extensive Commonwealth consultation with employers, unions and superannuation industry stakeholders following the passage of the Fair Work Amendment Act last year. I would like to thank those stakeholders who have invested a significant amount of time and effort into working with the Labor government to develop the amendments. This measure fulfils the commitment made by the government to introduce any required amendments to ensure appropriate arrangements are in place for corporate funds. It will ensure that those employees whose default superannuation contributions have been directed to high-performing employer MySuper products are not made worse off by the new default superannuation system and it will prevent unnecessary disruption for employers with employer MySuper products.
       </p>
       <p>
        Applications and the assessment of applications by the expert panel and the Fair Work Commission could consider a range of factors including but not limited to the features of the superannuation arrangement and whether they best meet the interests of the employees—for example, the variations in features of generic MySuper products, such as insurance arrangements or employer scale fee discounts that benefit particular groups of employees covered under specific modern awards. The Fair Work Commission has expertise in managing issues that affect multiple employers and industries. Superannuation is an industrial issue. It always has been and it remains that way as it goes towards the remuneration of employees by employers. It is appropriate that the Fair Work Commission has a role but also that we make sure that systems that are working continue to be able to do so. This government is confident that the process will ensure reasonable and practical outcomes for all stakeholders. I commend the amendments and also acknowledge that the opposition is supporting these amendments.

         Just very briefly, the coalition is not opposing the government's amendments, as the minister said. On behalf of the shadow minister, Senator Cormann, I make one point—that is, to reconfirm the coalition's position that we want to see genuine competition in the default fund market by letting any MySuper product compete freely. I point out that, once products comply with the default consumer protection requirements, there is no need for an additional process through Fair Work Australia. But I will not labour the chamber any longer. As I said, the coalition will not be opposing these amendments.
