        The total additional appropriation being sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2011-2012 is a little over $341 million, the more significant amounts of which I now outline.

        The government will provide $29 million of capital funding for the establishment of the Clean Energy Regulator which, as outlined in the second reading speech for Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2011-2012, will administer the carbon-pricing mechanism.

        and its parent company Howe Automotive Ltd. The loan is to be fully repaid over 10 years with annual interest and principal payments. The provision of this loan and its subsequent repayment have no impact on the government's fiscal balance but affect the composition of the government's assets.

        The remaining amounts that appear in Appropriation Bill No. 4 relate to estimates variations, minor reclassifications and other minor measures.

       <p>
        I would like to turn now to the general drawing right limits for the nation-building funds, which specify the maximum limit on payments from the funds in a financial year exclusive of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        . The general drawing rights limits for the Building Australia Fund, the Education Investment Fund and the Health and Hospitals Fund proposed in this bill will replace the limits declared in Appropriation Act (No. 2) 2011-12. The limits for the Building Australia Fund and the Health and Hospitals Fund have been increased. The limit of the Education Investment Fund has been decreased. These changes recognise adjustments in the timing of payments to better reflect project milestones and previously announced funding.

        The remaining amounts that appear in Appropriation Bill (No. 4) relate to estimates variations, minor reclassifications and other minor measures.
