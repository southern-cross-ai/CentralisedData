        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. Will the Deputy Prime Minister update the House on how the government is building infrastructure which connects local communities and creates local jobs? Is the Deputy Prime Minister aware of any roadblocks to our positive plans?

         I thank the member for Murray for his question. He is a passionate advocate for the people of regional Australia and certainly for the Victorian seat of Murray.

         and National government believes your postcode should not limit your potential. No matter where you live, we believe that regional people and their communities deserve essential services, and the recent budget is proof positive of that. It's helping to deliver those regional services and connect communities like never before. These are essential services, such as the ability to make a phone call or use the internet; safer and better roads on which to drive, getting you home sooner and safer; reliable water infrastructure; jobs for families and young people in the regions and in the seat of Murray; and opportunities for those who want to get ahead, building our future.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mobile communication is a service many people take for granted, but this government believes country people deserve it, and that's why we are delivering. Just last week the Minister for Regional Communications, Senator Bridget McKenzie, announced $25 million for yet another round of the Mobile Black Spot Program. This builds on the success of the Mobile Black Spot Program to date, which is on track to deliver 867 base stations nationwide by June next year. So now we will listen to communities again, and we will hear from those people who need a better mobile service.

         . He bleats, he belches, he huffs and puffs whenever we talk about mobile phone services. He goes on about Craigieburn, Sunbury, Kilmore, Seymour and all of those communities, but let me tell you, Mr Speaker, when he was in government, sitting on this side, Labor did not deliver one single cent for mobile phone towers, and he knows it. He comes in here and he goes crook. He knows he didn't deliver one single cent.

         This is one part of this government's infrastructure connecting country communities. Around Australia we're developing and building safer roads, such as the upgrade to the

         from Echuca to Yarrawonga, in the member for Murray's seat—he asked me the question—and the Echuca-Moama Bridge. Certainly we're getting on with the job of more mobile phone towers.
        </p>
        <p>
         In Braddon, in Tasmania, we're investing in upgrades to the

         , has called Labor out, because $6 million is all they were spending on the Bass Highway through Braddon. Let me tell you now, it's $60 million, but we're investing $400 million. That's what the Liberals and Nationals are doing. That's why we're delivering for the people of Victoria, the people of Tasmania and regional Australians. Regional Australians know it, but they're onto this shifty Leader of the Opposition. They've found you out. They've called you out, but I tell you what—
