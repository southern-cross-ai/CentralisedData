         International Women's Day
        </a>
        with a small gathering of women and their families for the Meroogal Awards. Women deserve more than one day to celebrate their significant contributions to culture, social wellbeing and support for others. Meroogal House, normally the traditional venue for this event, was home to four generations of womenâ€”all skilled and well read. Their old house has become a focus for recognising women working for women. This year, fifteen local women were presented with a certificate and we learned of a small part of their service in the community. The awards were given to: Karen Anstiss, a tireless advocate for disability employment; Kelly Arnold and Louise Williams, for supporting victims of domestic violence; Sister Beverly Cassidy and June Hendy, for helping migrants and refugees settle and learn English; Auntie Wendy, for promoting cultural awareness for children at Wreck Bay; Betty Dale from Currarong and Jean Huckell from Shoalhaven Heads, both volunteers for Meals on Wheels as well as participants in committee work; Maria Firkin, for volunteering at the East Nowra Neighbourhood Centre; Wendy Hobbs, who is involved in so many partnership building ventures and takes time for the homeless youth living in the caves; Lynda Mayo, who volunteers for many community groups; Tania Morandini, who assists local artists at the Shoalhaven Arts Centre;

        , who established Squid Studio for emerging artists; Sylvia Timbery, who is dedicated to increasing access for women's services; and Fay Worner, for creating, maintaining, and helping to grow partnerships and employment opportunities for Indigenous women. Each one of these fantastic women is an inspiration to the rest of us, with their tireless giving to others, and this is a moment to recognise the work they do in our community.
