They have come to see how this place operates.

        , Attorney-General's Department, Defence civilians. There are 48 of them in total; 27 Australians and 21 from other countries all around the world. They are the best of the best; they are the best of their countries; and, from an Australian perspective, they are the future of our

        We have a former commander of Australian submarines, a former commander of the Special Air Services Regiment, a former Australian Defence Attache to Indonesia. We have

        officers, a Tongan naval officer, the next chief of staff to the Timor-Leste Defence Force, a former commander of Taskforce Taji in Iraq, Afghanistan veterans, including those who have felt the grief of losing soldiers under their command. They are the best of the best. I commend them to the House.
