        I rise to acknowledge the work of the local support services available to small businesses in my electorate of Bonner. I would like to speak about the important work they do in helping local small businesses get on their feet, and the enormously beneficial networking events and workshops they hold in our community, including a very special event this weekend. As a passionate advocate for small business, I have been so pleased to see the growth of the coalition government's Australian

        Advisory Services program from its announcement last year to now.

        Greater Brisbane Small Business Advisory Service has gotten off the ground running. I must applaud Alice Langford for her fantastic work managing the team here. Her enthusiasm and commitment really shines through in everything this new services does. I have heard great feedback about the work this new service does in helping local businesses establish and grow themselves. They provide businesses with specialist mentoring, seminars and events. This includes the CLICK! Digital Expo 2015 next month. This will be a great event for businesses looking to expand their digital presence. Another small business event that I have been looking forward to is the Bayside Business Expo. Bayside Women in Business are holding the expo this Saturday in Wynnum. It is going to be an excellent opportunity for locals who are looking for expertise in starting a small business or growing their existing business. I am always impressed by just how close and supportive the business community is in my electorate, and the Bayside Business Expo is another example of this. I would like to thank Bayside Women in Business for organising this wonderful event, and the assistance they provide year-round to women running small businesses. It has been encouraging to see membership for Greater Brisbane Small Business Advisory Service and Bayside Women in Business go from strength to strength. I wish them the best with their upcoming events, and I look forward to catching up with them and everyone else at the Bayside Business Expo this weekend.
