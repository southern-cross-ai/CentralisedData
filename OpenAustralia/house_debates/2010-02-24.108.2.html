       <p>
        Today is Ovarian Cancer Awareness Day. Over one year, ovarian cancer can affect the lives of 1,500 women. That is a considerable issue, when 92 women have died of ovarian cancer in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        . Of the number of women who are diagnosed, 75 per cent will struggle to live beyond five years of their diagnoses. However, if the cancer is detected early, the majority of these women will survive and that is why awareness and early detection are so very important
       </p>
       <p>
        The Ovarian Cancer Australia Support Group is a national not-for-profit organisation that not only seeks to provide support networks for those affected and their families but also aims to promote awareness of ovarian cancer and, most importantly, promote its symptoms. The National Breast and Ovarian Cancer Centre explained that, prior to the commencement of their campaign, 61 per cent of women incorrectly believed that an abnormal pap smear test may be a sign of ovarian cancer. Post the campaign, only 16 per cent of women still believe that a pap smear test could detect ovarian cancer. Prior to the commencement of the campaign, 48 per cent of women surveyed were aware that feeling full or bloated can be a sign of ovarian cancer. This increased to 71 per cent of women, post the campaign. The number of women who are now aware that back pain can be a symptom of ovarian cancer increased from 33 per cent to 61 per cent. These are key messages for women and key symptoms that they should not ignore.
       </p>
       <p>
        These statistics show just how important campaigns that promote the symptoms of ovarian cancer are. Women need to be aware of the condition, especially women of a certain age. Like most cancers the risk of ovarian cancer increases with age. About nine out of 10 cases occur in women over the age of 40. They may have had few or no pregnancies. They may never have taken the contraceptive pill. They may have endometriosis and/or a history of cancer in the family, especially ovarian, bowel, breast or uterine cancers.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is for these reasons that I am wearing the teal coloured ribbon today. I am sure there are women not only in this parliament but right throughout Australia who, like me, are encouraging every woman to consider the symptoms and make very good decisions. If you do not like the first decision that you get from your doctor and you feel as though you have symptoms that need a second opinion, then get it.
