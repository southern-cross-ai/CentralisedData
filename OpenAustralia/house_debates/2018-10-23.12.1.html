        Like so many born during the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         Second World War
        </a>
        and so many in our labour movement, Jeanette Condran was humble, selfless and compassionate. She had a stirring sense of fairness, social justice and fun. She cared deeply about the rights of workers in particular. We are so sad to lose such a wonderful and caring friend. Four years ago this Sunday, Jeanette and Kevin sat up in that gallery when we farewelled

        , and now they're both goneâ€”Kevin last year and Jeanette last week. Her life took her from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Valley" rel="nofollow">

        in Gough's electorate to Logan in my electorate and then up north. We farewelled them from Teresa Lane's backyard.

        I first met Jeanette in 2013. She became such a dedicated friend and supporter. She and Kevin would put 20 or more election signs on their front gate on Wembley Road for me. My daughter, Annabel, and I facetimed her in the hospital. When she told us that she wouldn't be going home, I had no idea of the pace with which the cancer would take her. It was less than two weeks from diagnosis until we lost her. Her family were there and they told her, as the cancer took hold, that it was okay for her to go and find Kevin. She leaves behind eight kids, 22 grandkids, 12 great-grandkids, with another on the way. Like them, Mrs C, we love you, we miss you and we won't ever forget you.
