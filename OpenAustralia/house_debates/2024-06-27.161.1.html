       <p>
        I'm not going to sing for you today, but I am going to sing the praises of the many cultural groups that bring joy to my community in Gilmore. Whether it's through live gigs in local venues, community choirs, orchestral performances or the magic of musical theatre, music and live performance are so important, especially in regional communities on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         South Coast
        </a>
        that have been heavily impacted by bushfires, floods and COVID-19 isolation in recent years.
       </p>
       <p>
        From a young age, I have played and performed music locally. I regularly attend local concerts and theatrical performances, and I have seen how significant music has been for not only entertaining but reconnecting our local communities. Playing or listening to music is uplifting. It brings people together across the boundaries of culture, age and ability, which is why I'm pleased to have been able to support a number of organisations in Gilmore through a series of Albanese government grants programs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our government's volunteers grants have provided the Nowra Town Band with $3,000, the Milton District Band with $3,500 and the Albatross Musical Theatre Company in Nowra with $3,000 to ensure they can continue to enrich our society through social and cultural experiences. These small grants help volunteer organisations to purchase things like music stands, sound gear and storage containers. They help with the cost of training volunteers and even supply fuel vouchers for transporting equipment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The funding is one way the Albanese government is making a real difference to grassroots volunteer organisations that have such a vital role to play in our communities—groups like the Albatross Musical Theatre Company, which presents a number of fabulous live shows at the Shoalhaven Entertainment Centre stage each year. The shows are really magnificent and provide a wonderful space for performers of all ages to showcase their talent and for young singers and actors to develop their skills and confidence. I am a proud supporter of AMTC and their junior ensemble,

        .

        The magnificent Milton District Band performs at community events around town throughout the year, from festivals and markets to school fetes. Our government's volunteer grant allowed the Milton District Band to host a collaborative two-day band workshop with wind bands from Shoalhaven and Wollongong in February, which culminated in a public concert at the Dunn Lewis Centre in Ulladulla. It was fantastic to receive a letter from the bandmaster, who said the event provided an opportunity for 40 musicians of all levels to interact and connect before pulling off a public performance with only a day's intensive training. How good is that?

        In Batemans Bay, the Eurobodalla Chamber Orchestra was the recipient of a $2,748 grant through the Foundation for Rural and Regional Renewal's Strengthening Rural Communities program. The orchestra provides chamber music at community events such as the River of Art Festival and Children's Week and performs Christmas carols. They also perform at local aged-care facilities. Many of these performances are in the outdoors, so I'm thrilled that this grant will allow the orchestra to purchase wind-resistant music stands and perspex sheets to protect music scores. These relatively small things can make a big difference during a live performance.

        Just this month, the owner of Fillmore's Garage in Kiama,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Lewis" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , was walking on air after receiving a $45,000 Live Music Australia grant. The Revive grant will assist Fillmore's with purchasing equipment, as well as with production costs and artist fees to support the development, growth and innovation of Australian contemporary live music. The funds will provide 12 months of music programming at Fillmore's and will allow the venue to offer a financial guarantee for touring artists, giving them more confidence to travel to Kiama. Morgan is extremely passionate about live music and provides a fabulous space for up-and-coming musicians to fine-tune their craft in a supportive local venue.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is vital that we continue to support our Australian live music industry and encourage local musicians to perform in local venues like Fillmore's—venues where people come together to wine, dine, dance, sing and just have fun. We all know that playing music, listening to music and singing together are powerful tools for developing the mind, building relationships and connecting community, from the local pub to the big stage, and from preschools to nursing homes, which is why I am proud to support, and will continue to support, the wonderful organisations and businesses that are bringing music and so much joy to my community.
