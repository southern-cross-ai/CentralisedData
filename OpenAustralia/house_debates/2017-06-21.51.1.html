       <p>
        I rise to speak in relation to the Medicare Guarantee Bill, which was debated in the chamber earlier this week. I am hoping that today I will be able to continue on with parts of my speech without the Leader of the House attempting to gag me. Indeed, with the government constantly talking about freedom of speech, it quickly became clear to me that the government only wishes to offer freedom of speech to those who seek their political purpose. This government no more guarantees Medicare than the spider guarantees safety to the fly. I cannot help but wonder why the government would want to waste over an hour trying to gag Labor from raising some of these very valid concerns. Perhaps it is because those opposite know that this legislation is farcical—proof that the government cannot be trusted to defend Medicare. This bill is a blatant attempt to mislead the public into believing that the conservatives share Labor values. They do not.

        I reiterate that this government should not be allowed to sell off our health data as they have done with the Australian bowel cancer register. Our health data will determine our treatment, health management and outcomes in the future, and it will be disastrous if this is sold off to private enterprise. This can all be managed through the Medicare system. We need Medicare to be strengthened and reinforced—not hollowed out and destroyed, which is what this government wants to do. I cannot tell you how important this is for our health futures. This government must not be allowed to sell off any more of our health data and our health gold for the future of our children and grandchildren.
