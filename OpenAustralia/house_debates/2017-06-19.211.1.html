        . The challenge started in my electorate on the Central Coast back in 2000 as a one-day event. Seventeen years on, it has become a nationwide program, thanks to collaboration between the wonderful

         University of Newcastle

        , Rotary, local sponsors and our community. I am proud to say that this year the event will reach more than 21,000 students across 800 schools nationwide.

        Barry Henwood from Gosford Rotary told me the idea for the challenge began when the engineering faculty from the University of Newcastle noticed that enrolments in engineering were beginning to decline, but the challenge is now so popular that there is a waiting list for schools on the Central Coast and the university employs a full-time team to take the challenge around the nation. The challenge is about engaging students in science, engineering, technology and mathematics, or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM" rel="nofollow">
         STEM
        </a>
        , subjects. The challenges designed by the University of Newcastle are focused on creativity, innovation, problem solving and teamwork. We know that STEM skills are vital for jobs of the future and it is outstanding to see our local community working with our local university to inspire so many students. I would like to pay tribute to the 14 local Rotary clubs who make this event possible year after year, helping to fund the program and also providing the volunteers needed to ensure that the day goes smoothly. Congratulations to every student involved in this year's event, to Barry and the team at Rotary and to the University of Newcastle on what I know will be another successful year.
