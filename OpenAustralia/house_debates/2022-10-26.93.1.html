       <p>
        My question is to the Minister for Communications. During the election, Labor made a number of commitments to Mayo, including $1.5 million for mobile coverage in

        upgrades to 20,000 Mayo homes and boosted farm connectivity. Would the minister please provide an update with respect to these announcements?

        <p>
         I thank the member for her question. I acknowledge her longstanding advocacy on the importance of communications right across the portfolio in her electorate. I can inform the member for Mayo that this government is delivering on all its election commitments in the communications space and that includes making sure that Australian families and businesses are better connected than ever. We have invested in this budget over $2.2 billion in regional communications. that represents one of the most major funding boosts to regional comms since the national broadband network was announced.
        </p>
        <p>
         To the specific issues the member raises, I can go through and itemise the Better Connectivity for Rural and Regional Australia Plan, which is in addition to the $480 million already committed to the upgrade of the fixed wireless network, which in turn improves satellite connectivity as well for those constituents of hers who may also be on the satellite network. We have committed $400 million to improve regional mobile coverage but also to harden communication networks against natural disasters. I know the member is familiar with that. We have $200 million to run further rounds of the Regional Connectivity Program and that funds a broad range of place-based communications solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have $30 million to expand on-farm connectivity and drive productivity through machine-to-machine networks, which will be keenly felt by farmers. We have $20 million for an independent audit of mobile coverage to see where the true black spots really are so that evidence-based decisions can be made on that basis. We also have $6 million to extend the regional tech hub, which provides expert advice to regional customers on how to connect and stay connected. This is in addition to our announcement of $2.4 billion to upgrade full fibre access for 1.5 million additional premises right across Australia and they include 660,000 premises in the regions.
        </p>
        <p>
         This government is committed to making sure that more than ever Australians can be connected, they can be informed and they can experience the best improvements in productivity that can be provided through these communications investments. I would note also the Nationals like to talk about being the friends of the regions. There was one party that went to this last election with a policy of improving on-farm connectivity. It was this Prime Minister who will be delivering substantial upgrades, not only in terms of connectivity but also in terms of ensuring that every Australian, irrespective of where they live, where they work or what they earn, have exactly the same opportunities right across the regions.
