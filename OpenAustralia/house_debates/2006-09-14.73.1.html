        Mr Speaker, under standing order 103 I have a further question to you. Are you aware that, up to the end of question time today, the member for Oxley was the 91st person asked to leave the chamber under the standing order for one hour’s leave? Of those 91 members who have been asked to vacate the chamber, 89 have been from this side of the chamber and only two have been government members. Further, are you aware that three
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
         ALP
        </a>
        members, and only three ALP members, have been named and suspended for 24 hours up to this point? Are you also aware that under Deputy Speaker Ian Causley, a more balanced figure here—

          I was reflecting positively on the Deputy Speaker, Mr Speaker—20
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
           ALP
          </a>
          members have been excluded—ordered to withdraw for one hour—and two government members, making a total now of 109 ALP members and four from the government. At the same time, there have been three ALP members and one Independent named and suspended for 24 hours. Mr Speaker, do you think that accurately reflects the behaviour in this chamber, or is it about as fair as

           I think the last part of that question was frivolous, but I will take the rest of the question and respond to it as follows. The first point I would make is that when members are asked to leave under standing order 94(a) it is not a punishment; it is in the interests of maintaining order. If the member for Grayndler believes it reflects on the behaviour of the members, well, that may be his interpretation. I just repeat: it is administered on the basis of maintaining order. Those who feel that they have been asked to leave might reflect on how responsibly they are behaving in the chamber.
