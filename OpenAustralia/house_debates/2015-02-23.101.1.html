        My question is to the Minister for Industry and Science. Would the minister outline how the recent antidumping reforms and other industry measures will help to level the playing field and provide stability for manufacturers and producers in my electorate and across Australia?

         I thank the member for Grey for his question and congratulate him not only on the strong advocacy that he provides as the member for Grey. I think Grey covers over 90 per cent of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          South Australia
         </a>
         and takes in a wide range of industries. I also congratulate him on a successful career ,which I hope is not over yet as a farmer on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyre_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
          Eyre Peninsula
         </a>
         . As a farmer, he knows how important trade and globalisation, and the liberalisation that goes with that, are to enable farmers and all industry to gain access to markets. But it is important that in gaining access to markets and opening Australian markets up that we have a level playing field. The member for Grey knows that from time to time industries based in Australia are put under pressure by other countries importing here, sometimes at dump prices. The steel industry in his electorate is a great example of that.
        </p>
        <p>
         What we as a government have done is we have introduced a significant reform package to deliver on our election commitments and improve Australia's antidumping and countervailing measures. We have strengthened and streamlined the regime. We have made improvements not only in antidumping and countervailing but also in the investigation process. The package includes greater onus on overseas businesses to cooperate, more rigorous enforcement of submission deadlines, cracking down on uncooperative exporters, better assistance and information for Australian businesses, addressing circumvention and reducing red tape, providing greater certainty, and improving the merits review process.
        </p>
        <p>
         This has all been very well received. The Australian steel industry said, 'These reforms will assist in levelling the playing field through a tougher approach to time frames and remedies, and improve the process for Australian steel manufacturers through expanded information and support services.' I know that pleases the member for Grey and the steel industry in his electorate. As well as that, the Australian Forest Products Association said, 'The imposition of higher dumping duties and interim measures for those that do not comply with the Anti-Dumping Commission is particularly welcome.'
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian government are implementing these reforms as part of our industry innovation and competitiveness agenda as well as our economic action strategy. It is targeted at giving Australian industry every opportunity to perform and excel. Along with our innovation processes and the support that we are giving them through the growth centres, this better antidumping process gives them a good chance to create even more jobs in Australia.
