        I'd like to acknowledge Dr Sue Velovski from Lismore. She received the 2022 Rural Doctor of the Year award at the Rural Medicine Australia conference dinner. Dr Velovski was recognised for her work during the pandemic, where she advocated for cancer patients to receive access to surgery at a time when COVID impacted the ability for patients to receive vital surgical treatment. She also played a significant role in the medical response to the flooding natural disaster that hit our community. She worked tirelessly to assist flood impacted patients with medical supplies and wound management wherever she could reach them. This included service stations at night when they were out of the floods and many other easy-to-find locations that had appropriate lighting to treat patients. Congratulations and thank you, Sue, for your tremendous work in our community.

        I'd like to acknowledge the Alstonville Public School debating team on its recent victory at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        debating championships in Sydney. Known as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_Blue" rel="nofollow">
         Cool Blue
        </a>
        debating team, they progressed through from the regional zone, advancing to compete at the state championships. In a competition that comprised 871 teams, they made it to the final to compete against Randwick Public School. They came out the unanimous winners, successfully arguing that kids should be given a second chance to complete their assignments if they get a bad mark. Congratulations to Hannah Clark, Liberty McKenzie, Ruby Douley, Frankie Dooley and Finn Thirkell. This is the second time that Alstonville Public School has won the state debating title. The first time was in 2011. Big thanks to Mrs Wheatland for all of her hard work and dedication to the program and congratulations to Mr Frangos for his efforts this year. Well done, Alstonville Public School.

        I'd like to acknowledge a wonderful family business in my community, Lombardo's Fruit Market in Goonellabah, which recently transferred ownership after trading for 50 years. The business started in 1973, when Vince and Joan opened the store. When Vince, sadly, passed away in 2005, his son Frank became the next integral part of the daily running of the business. It was an icon and a popular stop for residents. Joan, now 78 years old, was there on the final day, with the same attitude, and delivered exceptional service, as she has always done for 50 years. Congratulations to the Lombardo family: Joan, Frank, Kazia, Felicia, Simon, April, Luca, Vince, Gabrielle, Bella, Ruby, Arlo and Gianna. And good luck to the new owners, Dan and Laura Sproule. They're establishing their new business, the Smashed Avo, in the same premises. Good luck to you.
