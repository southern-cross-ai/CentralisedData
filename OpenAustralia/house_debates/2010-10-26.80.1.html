        I take the opportunity tonight to rise to congratulate the town of Lancefield on its celebration of its 150 official years of establishment and its recent 25th agricultural show, which I had the pleasure of opening, along with my state colleague
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joanne_Duncan" rel="nofollow">

        , the very hardworking member for Macedon.

       <p>
        Lancefield, like many areas in the electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McEwen" rel="nofollow">
         McEwen
        </a>
        , is a community orientated town which truly epitomises the essence of the word ‘community’. This is in part due to the town’s very strong volunteering attributes. I have always believed that volunteers are the backbone of our community, donating their time for the causes they so strongly believe in and, in turn, enriching the lives of and benefiting so many others around them. I believe that volunteering is vital in building strong communities, and Lancefield is proof of that, with many volunteer organisations such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFA" rel="nofollow">
         CFA
        </a>
        , Lancefield Neighbourhood House, the park management committee, the historical society, our schools, the Lions clubs and the Lancefield Agricultural Society. You know that it is an active, energetic and caring place. These local volunteers commit and dedicate themselves to the betterment of our society. Together with the great work of many in the community, we are now celebrating, as I said, the town’s 150th official anniversary. Local volunteering groups are also great for the volunteers themselves, as they provide them with opportunities to meet new people and develop new skills and friendships, and in turn that builds a stronger community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lancefield is also a town rich in history and rich in culture. It is home to the very popular Lancefield and District Farmers Market, which is held every fourth Saturday of the month and attracts people from the region and across Victoria alike. You will find local produce, from local spuds and veggies to livestock, organic meat, fresh honey, olives and much, much more. The town’s history is encapsulated in its art galleries, like the Mad Gallery and the Bankart Gallery, and buildings like the old
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         National Bank
        </a>
        and, in particular, the iconic Macedonia Hotel. The Indigenous history of the area is another highlight of the region, with a very significant greenstone flint quarry at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_William" rel="nofollow">
         Mount William
        </a>
        , which is just outside the township.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I said, the town held its 25th Lancefield Agricultural Show, and I believe its success is a tribute to the volunteers like those of the Lancefield Agriculture Society, who since 1984 have contributed so much to local agriculture and the community. The society works all year to put on this show, which entails all the fun and excitement of a true country show. There are cattle competitions, horse events, art and craft competitions and dog events, and you get chooks, goats, alpacas and sheep events, motorcycle-riding competitions, Rural Ambassador Awards, Junior Ambassador Awards, carnival rides and various stalls from local businesses. These agricultural shows are a vital part of keeping communities connected with each other.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank the members of the Lancefield Agricultural Society for their ongoing work, particularly the president,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sheehan" rel="nofollow">
         John Sheehan
        </a>
        , who has been with the society since its inception in 1984. John was very welcoming to me at the show and even gave me some great tips on learning how to judge cattle and sheep. I thank Ken Notman too, who has also put in many, many years as the president, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bev_Harris" rel="nofollow">
         Bev Harris
        </a>
        , who is a founding member and after so many years still continues to assist the cattle section. Of course, the show would not go on without people like Kate Coulter, the secretary of the agricultural society. I know that Kate worked extremely hard in organising this show. Sadly,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Parks" rel="nofollow">
         Greg Parks
        </a>
        , one of the instigators of the stud breeders association, had recently passed away and was not able to enjoy the benefits of his hard work on this show. These people are only a few of the many who have served the society and the community in their capacity as local volunteers.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am honoured to join the community of Lancefield in the town’s celebrations this year and I congratulate all involved in achieving these two milestones, the 150 years of the town’s continuous existence and the 25th anniversary of the show. I am proud to represent such a fantastic community and I invite all members of this place to come and enjoy the unique experience of Lancefield, from its vibrant arts scene to its gifts and antiques shopping, the great food, particularly the award-winning wineries, and, importantly, the great community spirit.
