        Australia's rugby community lost a legend with the passing of Jeffrey Sayle. In Coogee last Friday, I joined thousands of people to say farewell to 'Sayley', the local legend everyone knew and loved. He played for Randwick rugby club, the Waratahs and the Wallabies and won an Australian surfboat title with the Coogee surf club. Most importantly, Jeff was a mentor to so many young sportspeople in our community. With over 60 years of service, he was the heart and soul of the Randwick rugby club. He could do everything at the club, and he gave everythingâ€”a larger than life character, full of passion and humour.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jeff was a 10-time premiership winner with the Galloping Greens, claiming four as a player and six as a coach. He also helped to nurture and develop emerging talent at the club with the likes of the Ella brothers,

        and others who would go on to play for Australia in rugby. He was also instrumental in establishing the Randwick Rugby Junior Academy, which is providing support for so many junior rugby players in our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jeff was awarded the

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of our community, I offer my deepest condolences to Jeff and his family. Vale Sayley.
