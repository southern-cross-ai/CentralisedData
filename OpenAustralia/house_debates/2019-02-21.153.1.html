        I want to talk about Peter and Jenny Fry—two absolute stalwarts of the tiny community of Benger in the south-west of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        . For over 60 years, you could say that almost nothing happened in Benger that Pete and Jen weren't a part of—whether it was the Benger school P&amp;C, the community centre or the Benger cricket club—the list is endless. They both contributed to the nearby towns of Harvey and Brunswick: the Harvey Agricultural Society,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BPW" rel="nofollow">
         BPW
        </a>
        , Landcare in Brunswick and arts and crafts—you name it, they were part of it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jenny passed away at the end of 2017, frustrated beyond belief because in her later years she was virtually unable to speak because of a series of serious strokes. The first major stroke took away her speech. It robbed her of her speech. For such an articulate, strong woman, it was absolutely devastating. Peter passed away just two weeks ago, and I extend my deepest sympathy to Don, Julie, Tim and their families.
       </p>
       <p>
        Peter and Jenny were a wonderful couple, who were committed to their family, their community and the dairy industry. Peter was the quintessential quiet achiever, who, like Jenny, contributed so much to his community. At his recent funeral, his family and friends acknowledged and celebrated his life as one of giving and sacrifice. He was one of those rare people with an open heart, an open mind and a gentle soul. His life was filled with love for his family, his strong faith and his church, particularly
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Peter's" rel="nofollow">
         St Peter's
        </a>
        in Brunswick. He was a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiger_Moth" rel="nofollow">

        pilot. He loved music and played the organ and piano. He had a wonderful ear for music and played from memory. Our community has been so lucky to have Peter as part of it. He volunteered countless hours playing music for community groups and organisations, in aged care facilities and to seniors groups—anyone who asked. He was always in places where often others weren't. He lived by the motto of 'Treat others how you would like to be treated'. Not long before he died, he gave a concert for his children and grandchildren of his favourite songs.
       </p>
       <p>
        I now turn to the indomitable, strong and passionate Jenny Fry. Jenny was born in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bell" rel="nofollow">
         Big Bell
        </a>
        and moved to Benger when she married Peter. They finished their lives in Bethanie Esprit village in Eaton. Jenny enjoyed sewing, patchwork, quilting and tapestry. She was passionate, forthright, determined and loyal. When we worked together in the dairy industry together for 40-odd years, she was the person to have on your side. She stood in front of you, not behind you. She was fantastic. She worked countless hours taking milkshakes everywhere around Western Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pete and Jen had over 60 years together. Their lives were well lived, and they were well loved by their family and friends. Jen had a saying that really meant a lot. She said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        When I think of life I think of it as like a road as they were in the Murchison in days gone, sometimes smoothly on the bitumen and then you hit those awful corrugations, drive a bit further and then that wonderful bitumen again….. That bitumen around the corner has kept me together in times of family illness and stressful times.'
       </p>
       <p>
        She said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I have been very privileged in my life, been part of many great teams, made many great friends and had many fun times.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pete and Jen passed away peacefully, over 12 months apart, and both were listening, would you believe, to their favourite hymn,
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/How_Great_Thou_Art" rel="nofollow">
          How Great Thou Art
         </a>
        </i>
        . They both passed away listening to the same hymn. They are absolutely typical of the grassroots heart and soul of our rural and regional communities. They volunteered countless, countless hours in selfless service. The one thing they did so beautifully was being caring and welcoming to people whether they lived in the area and had been there forever like them or whether they were newcomers, new people, to our community. Theirs was an open heart, an open mind and a gentle soul.
       </p>
       <p>
        So I want to pay tribute to two amazing people. In their later years, Pete and Jen would go along as a couple to the aged care facilities in our communities right around the south-west, where Jen would tell jokes—sometimes a bit blue!—and Pete would entertain on the piano. They were a wonderful duo, who gave so much. I think it is appropriate that in this place we acknowledge those people who contribute, but we don't always see what they do. I love those two people.
