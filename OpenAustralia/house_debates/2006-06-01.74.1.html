        On 26 April 2006 Ray Babbage was tragically drowned at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffs_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
         Coffs Harbour
        </a>
        ’s Diggers Beach at the age of 53. Ray, a much loved teacher, sports coach and family man, is sadly missed by many in the Coffs Harbour community. Ray loved the sea. He was an expert surfer who was known as the ‘wave magnet’. He would surf the break at Diggers every day when there was the slightest swell, and when there was no swell or if the wind was up he would go fishing in his sea kayak. He would catch the waves that no-one else could, but on the morning of 26 April the sea was rough and the circumstances behind Ray’s drowning remain a mystery. It serves as a timely warning to all beach goers of the power of the ocean and the very real risks present on our beaches.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ray taught first at Coffs Harbour primary school and for the last 12 years at Boambee Public School. He loved children and rejected the lure of promotion to remain a classroom teacher. He gave much to his teaching, and as a result he was held in the highest regard by many present and former students and their families. Ray sought and achieved a high standard. ‘Never leave the bar at average,’ he would say, ‘Aim above that.’
       </p>

        Despite initially knowing nothing about
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        football, Ray coached Boambee Public School to the state semifinals of the Paul Kelly Cup, held at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebush_Bay" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        —a great achievement for a small country school. He was a champion sailor and a winner of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Sports_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Sports Medal
        </a>
        and coached many Coffs Coast youngsters to success at state and national sailing championships in a range of different boats. His son Scott won national championships in several classes, including Moths, 29ers and Flying 11s, and is also a world championship winning sailor on 29ers.
       </p>
       <p>
        A memorial service was held for Ray at his beloved Diggers Beach. Tributes were paid by the principal and students of Boambee Public School. Boambee is a fine school with a dedicated principal, in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Gates" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and a devoted staff. At that service the children of Boambee Public School paid tribute to their teacher and shared their memories:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Dear Mr Babbage, you were more than a teacher. You were a good friend and I wish you were here. I miss you.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He was nice to be with when you were sad.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He loved his sport like surfing, sailing and fishing.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        He was a really good teacher to us. He was happy and kind. He was the best teacher we ever had.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr Babbage you were the best teacher. Catch a wave for us up in heaven.
       </p>
       <p>
        The students from kindergarten also offered their comments. They said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr Babbage liked to dress up and be funny.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr Babbage was good at lots of things.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a final tribute to Ray, a plaque was placed in the dunes overlooking the beach and a large group of surfers paddled out to cast floral tributes on the water. Teaching is a great profession. It is indeed a valued vocation to shape the development and character of young Australians. I believe the most lasting tribute to Ray is the influence that he has had on the many children that he has taught over his 30 years of teaching in Coffs Harbour.

        said, ‘In the end it’s not the years in your life that count. It’s the life in your years.’ There was much life indeed in Ray’s 53 years. He will be fondly remembered by his wife, Rosie, and his children, Scott and Tina, and his passing is a tragic loss for us all.
