        I rise today to voice the concerns I and a number of others have about the conduct and practices of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         Football Queensland
        </a>
        and their management. Football Queensland, like a number of other organisations in similar positions, holds a special place in our community not only in terms of sport but also in terms of its special status in business dealings and competition rules in the commercial world. I am deeply disappointed and concerned about the conduct and competency of Football Queensland in its business dealings, which have been the subject of an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
         ACCC
        </a>
        inquiry, particularly in relation to Veto Sports.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is my understanding that the relationship between Football Queensland and Veto Sports has broken down over an allegation that has not been proved or verified. The response from Football Queensland has been unparalleled, unjust and without regard for due process of natural justice. When an organisation has special powers and exemptions under law, it also has special responsibilities. I believe Football Queensland has breached those responsibilities and, perhaps more, acted in a manner inconsistent with it duties and responsibilities in relation to Veto Sports and others and their contract.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have spoken to the President of Football Queensland and will be meeting with Football Queensland this Friday to discuss further some very serious issues and matters that I believe are at odds with the proper conduct and exercise of its powers. Football Queensland, like other not-for-profit organisations in sport or in the community, occupies a very special place that carries with it special responsibilities to exercise power dutifully and ethically.
