        I would like to congratulate the Brighton Bombers football club on their
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Ribbon" rel="nofollow">
         White Ribbon
        </a>
        Day event held on Saturday, 29 April. It was an honour to address the players, their families and spectators on the day. The Bombers raised money for the White Ribbon campaign, and we all pledged our respect for women. As we are sadly aware, too many Australian women are victims of domestic violence. This is why the Turnbull government has committed over $200 million in federal funding through many programs to address violence against women. To see one of my local footy clubs raising funds and awareness is a credit to all at the club, from the male and female players to the coaches, leadership team and volunteers.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Brighton Bombers were supported by my state parliamentary colleague the member for Mitchell, Corey Wingard MP, and the Mayor of

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        From our footy clubs and community groups through to our senior leaders, we are all addressing the issue of domestic violence and respect for women. I again congratulate the Brighton Bombers; their president, Kym Steer; and all at the club on this important event.
