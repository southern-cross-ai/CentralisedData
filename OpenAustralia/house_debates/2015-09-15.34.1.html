        I rise to share with the House the achievements of Lauren Moore. Lauren has been a junior netball player in the Wyong District Netball Association for many years, having played for the Bateau Bay Dolphins since she was five years old. From the age of 11 Lauren was selected to play representative netball for the Wyong District Netball Association. At 13 she captained Wyong at the state championship titles. Lauren was also selected to participate in the Central Coast Academy of Sport netball squad. Utilising the outstanding pathways provided by the academy, Lauren gained selection last year in the under-17s

        team.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lauren's other achievements include selection in the under-17s Australian squad and obtaining a netball scholarship with the

        . Lauren has continued to hold her position in these teams for the previous two years. Success has continued for Lauren, as this year she was selected as a replacement player for the

        and more recently Lauren was offered a contract to be part of the 12-member team for the Swifts in the 2016

        Netball Championships.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lauren has achieved outstanding results in pursuing her dreams. To achieve such high aspirations at a young age is a credit to her determination and ability. We are all very proud of Lauren and wish her every success for many years to come. We hope one day we will see her playing for the Australian Diamonds. Congratulations to Lauren and all the outstanding young sportspeople in the electorate of Dobell.
