        I rise today to detail three very welcome announcements in the recent round 2 of the Community Sports Infrastructure Grants Program. This funding forms the second part of a $60 million community sport infrastructure program. Last Friday, I had the pleasure of personally joining the Lower Great Southern Hockey Association President, Simon Whitfort, his committee and players, along with the

        Mayor, Dennis Wellington, and

        , Andrew Sharpe. They were thrilled at the announcement of $183,000 for the resurfacing of the pitch, which has reached the end of its useful life. This half a million dollar project is supported by the City of Albany, and over $100,000 has been raised by the club itself.

        of West Arthur received $45,000 for the upgrade of the Darkan oval facilities. Shire CEO, Nicole Wasmann, said the re-invigorated West Arthur-Wagin football club will be training once a week and playing two home games this season, under the guidance of their coach, ex-Fremantle Docker and local farmer,

        Sport is part of our national identity. This is never more true than in our regional communities where it brings people of all ages together through a mutual love of a game. Sport has not only health benefits for the individual but wider social and economic benefits for our regional communities. That there were 2,400 applications throughout Australia for this grants program indicates the massive demand that exists for infrastructure to cater for grassroots participation in a huge range of sporting pursuits. I thank the Minister for Sport and this government for making the funds available.
