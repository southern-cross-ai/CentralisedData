        Christmas is fast approaching. Decorations are lining our local shopping strips and front yards as Australians prepare for the festive season. I was very pleased to host again my annual Higgins Christmas card competition at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_Gallery" rel="nofollow">
         Metro Gallery
        </a>
        in Armadale last week. We received over 600 entries from primary schools right across Higgins. I invited students to draw or paint their Christmas wish. The overwhelming theme of their entries was the importance of family and giving to those who are less fortunate, as well as requests, of course, for a puppy and the latest

        set. The fantastic drawings and paintings were brightly coloured and filled with Christmas cheer. Many of them are now brightening up the windows of my corner office in Malvern. Local award-winning artist, Vicky Watts, and editor of

        I congratulate the recipients of the 12 Days of Christmas Award. They are: Max Dorey,

And, of course, I'd like to congratulate the winner of this year's competition, Isabella Benvenuto from Sacre Coeur. Isabella's painting had an Australian theme and a tribute to our coat of arms, with a kangaroo and an emu overlooking a beautiful Christmas tree. I'm delighted to feature Isabella's work on the front of my official 2018 Christmas card.

        Christmas is, of course, a time to think of others, especially those who are less fortunate than ourselves. For many families, this time of year can be especially difficult. That's why I'm pleased to again partner with St Joseph's Outreach Service and local bookseller Jeffreys Books to help local families in need through our Higgins Christmas Appeal. Books will be donated again to the Smith Family. Over the past two years, more than $7,000 worth of books—hundreds and hundreds of books—have been donated. I want to thank everyone who has contributed to this year's appeal and those who have contributed to past years appeals as well. It is truly amazing to be part of such a generous and thoughtful community. For those who are thinking about it, if you go to my website, you can, in fact, donate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to wish everyone a very happy, a very merry and a very safe Christmas. I want those who face challenging times at Christmas to know that we're thinking of you and that we will be there to support you as well. Thank you.
