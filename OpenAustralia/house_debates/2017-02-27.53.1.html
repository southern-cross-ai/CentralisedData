        The Defence Housing Authority has announced plans for a new development in the north-east area of Toowoomba, on the edge of the escarpment, the site of a historic rifle range, bounded by Rifle Range Road, Martini Street and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Street" rel="nofollow">

        . It was previously under the control of the

        . I encourage neighbours and all interested parties to have a say in the consultation process, which will continue for some time.

        has commenced discussions with the

        , just like any other body would do in order to seek a development approval. As the local member and a former neighbour of this site, I would like to say that it will not be a massive development, as some have suggested. I understand this site is about 350 hectares, with two-thirds of that over the edge of the range. Only 30 to 40 per cent would likely be for Defence housing, with the rest on the public market. It has an interesting history, having been a police horse paddock early last century. Development would address unexploded ordnance concerns and Defence families are welcome and valued in our community. A

        expansion, mountain bike tracks, improved fire trails and tourism escarpment walks. The area has already been developed to the south and the north-west, so this should come as little surprise. No plans have been lodged at this stage, so now is the time for locals to engage through the consultation processes that are underway and have their say.
