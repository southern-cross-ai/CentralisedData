        2 Funding for public schools: Resumption of debate (from 18 February 2019) on the motion of Ms Ryan—That this House:

        (1) acknowledges that our public schools are at the heart of our education system;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) public schools teach two in three of all school students, and the overwhelming majority of Australia's neediest children, including:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) 82 per cent of the poorest children;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

        (iii) 74 per cent of children with disabilities;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) under the current Government, almost nine in ten (88 per cent) of public schools will never get to their fair funding level because the Government has capped federal funding for public schools at just 20 per cent of the Schools Recommendation Scheme;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) after spending a year trying to deny there were cuts, the fact the Government has restored funding to Catholic and independent schools was finally an admission that it is cutting billions of dollars from schools;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) Labor has announced a plan to restore funding to public schools; and
       </p>

        (e) Labor's plan will transform public schools across Australia and give all children the opportunity to reach their full potential, no matter where they live, or what amount their parents earn; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) calls on the Government to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) immediately adopt Labor's plan to restore funding to public schools to ensure every public school reaches its fair funding level; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) work with school systems to get every school to its fair funding level.
