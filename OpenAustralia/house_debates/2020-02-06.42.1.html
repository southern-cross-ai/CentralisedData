        Aunty Jude Breckenridge was born in Maclean on 26 January 1947 to be a blessed part of the strong Yaegl and Gumbaynggirr family. Aunty Jude was the second daughter, a dearly loved sister to Lenore. Then came Wallace, Elizabeth, Lois, Keith, Beris, Stuart, Neil and Kaylene. Aunty Jude had strength and courage and has done much work in Maclean and the lower Clarence to shape the reconciliation movement. She did this in her own constant and unwavering way simply by participating in everything. Aunty Jude was a woman of many talents. As a child, she was a great athlete. She was an excellent swimmer and would win the Maclean public swimming competitions and was crowned 'grand champion athlete' at school titles.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the age of 16 Aunty Jude met her future husband, Arthur Breckenridge, and they had six childrenâ€”Dwayne, Steven, Cheryl, Gary, Bevan and Deborah. She was a loving and devoted grandmother to Merinda, Nghaeria, Jesse, Jacob, Mahli, Jirra, Zac, Charles, William, Isaiah, Noah and Myah. She was also very blessed to be the great grandmother to Jessirrah, Ella, Joyce, Korbin, Elijah and Bruce.
       </p>
       <p>
        Aunty Jude has been a very important leader in our community. She was loved at Maclean High School, was loved in the Clarence and Lower Clarence, was a very important part, as I said, in the reconciliation movement. She died late last year; may she rest in peace.
