        My question is to the Prime Minister. Your Labor government has over 1,300 autonomous sanctions on Russia because of their violation of international law yet, even with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        confirming the Israeli government has committed war crimes in Palestine, you failed to impose any sanctions at all. Will you impose any sanctions on the government of Israel? Why have you put more sanctions on a senator for speaking out about Palestine than on the extremist Netanyahu government for invading Palestine?

          I thank the member for Melbourne for his question. I inform him that 101,000 of his constituents got a tax cut this week—101,000 of them.

          I'm asked about the political party that I belong to, and which I have been loyal to for my whole life, and about people making a decision to distance themselves from their former party. The cross-section there is full of people who used to be members of the National Party or members of the Liberal Party. Senator Thorpe, of course, was elected earlier, in the last election, as a member of the Greens political party and chose to depart from that. From time to time, that happens. And that has happened in terms of the senator making a decision that she wished to be able to take an independent position when it comes to the

            I'm also asked about events in the

             Middle East
            </a>
            and our position. Our opposition has been very consistent. Our position has been consistent with the motion that was moved by Senator Wong in the Senate—one which people need to explain why it is that they objected to such a motion. It was about the need for the Senate to recognise the state of Palestine as part of a peace process in support of a two-state solution and a just and enduring peace. That's the view of those of us on this side of the House, that those in the Greens political party in the Senate and the coalition voted against. I don't understand what's objectionable about it.
           </p>
           <p>
            The key to what needs to happen in the Middle East is that there needs to be support for President Biden's peace plan. There needs to be a ceasefire and an end to what has occurred in Gaza. There needs to be, therefore, a release of hostages. There needs to be increased humanitarian support for the people of Gaza, and there needs to be a lasting and enduring peace. That means the people of Palestine and Israel living side-by-side in peace and security. That is our position. That is something that we work towards.
           </p>
           <p>
            It won't be achieved by resolutions in the Senate and stunts by the Greens. It won't be achieved by those people who choose to desecrate war memorials.
