       <p>
        Today I wish to raise the issue of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Bureau of Statistics
        </a>
        Time Use Survey. This survey requires people to account for every five minutes over a 48-hour period. This is an onerous survey that would take somebody a significant amount of time to complete. People refusing to participate in this survey leave themselves open to a $200 fine, and I think this is outrageous. A number of constituents have contacted me to complain about this and I agree with them. They have received visits from ABS officials and were told that unless they participated they would be fined $200. I recognise that this survey does provide valuable information for the government, but I think the ABS needs to be convincing people to participate instead of forcing them to.
       </p>
       <p>
        The participants in this survey need to account for every five minutes of their time, and there is a sample survey of things that they are required to report. For example, at 6.20 it is recommended that they write ‘toilet’, at 6.25 ‘had a shower’, at 6.35 ‘got dressed’, at 6.40 ‘put on a load of washing’, at 6.45 ‘made breakfast’ and at 6.55 ‘ate breakfast’. This is a Kafkaesque survey which has been forced on people who have absolutely no interest in participating. At the beginning of the survey, people are asked how often they feel rushed or pressed for time and, if they do feel rushed or pressed for time, they are asked why, and there are some options given: trying to balance work and family responsibilities, not good at managing time, too much to do and unpredictable working hours. I think there should be another option: filling in silly and onerous surveys which are made compulsory by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is not like the census, which most people accept and understand. They appreciate why the census is compulsory. There is a significant community information campaign which goes into letting people know about the census, but there is very little understanding and acceptance of this survey and why it should be compulsory. Frankly, I think that is because it should not be compulsory. I call on the ABS to reconsider its approach to this survey and to give people the freedom to choose whether they participate or not. Perhaps the libertarian streak of members opposite could mean that they find it in the goodness of their hearts to support my call and say that Australians should not be forced to participate in surveys such as this against their will. Regardless of which party they represent, I think there is a libertarian streak on that side of the House, as there is on this side of the House. If honourable members opposite would be so good as to support my call for the ABS to drop this silly, onerous and ridiculous survey, I am sure the Australian people would appreciate it.
