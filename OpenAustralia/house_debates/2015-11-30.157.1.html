        I rise to speak today regarding the Western Sydney Airport, which will be developed in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Greater Western Sydney
        </a>
        at

         Badgerys Creek
        </a>
        . I rise to assure residents I represent that I have heard their concerns and I have been and will continue to advocate strongly on their behalf. An airport is needed for Greater Western Sydney. It is, after all, our nation's fourth largest city, and the economic outcome for the region in both business and employment opportunities is significant. In fact, it will provide some 60,000 jobs in the three decades following the airport's opening. Labor wants this airport too. However, I understand residents move to the lower
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains" rel="nofollow">
         Blue Mountains
        </a>
        for lifestyle choices and for many, pending flight paths directly overhead were not part of the equation.
       </p>
       <p>
        What have I been doing to advocate on your behalf? I requested the public consultation period for the draft
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EIS" rel="nofollow">
         EIS
        </a>
        to be increased beyond 20 days. I immediately requested an information session in the lower Blue Mountains, the first of which was held in Blaxland on 31 October which I attended. Brochures regarding the sessions were handed out at lower Mountains train stations, businesses, to the local paper, facebook and my website. Some advised that they were still not aware of the session, so I requested another which will take place at the Glenbrook School of Arts on 9 December from 4 pm to 7 pm. I have met with and made representations to the Deputy Prime Minister and minister for regional development, advising of my and the community's concern about the flight paths, and requesting clarification that operations would not interfere with firefighting or other emergency air procedures. I met with representatives from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Blue Mountains City Council
        </a>
        , including the mayor, the deputy mayor and the general manager, to discuss their concerns, together with a senior member from the office of the Minister for the Environment. As difficult as it was to arrange in this last parliamentary sitting week, today the Blue Mountains City Council will meet with the

        and Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Truss" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        . I have met and spoken on several occasions to the Minister for Major Projects, Territories and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government
        </a>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Fletcher" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and have again arranged meetings for representatives from the Blue Mountains City Council with the minister in the Blue Mountains in the coming weeks. I have spoken regularly with senior members of the offices of the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, and the Minister for the Environment. I have met and spoken directly with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airservices_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        .

        I will be meeting with Minister Hunt, the Minister for the Environment, following the close of the EIS and once submissions have been received. I will be making my own submission regarding the flight paths on behalf of the community before the close on 18 December, to find a possible alternative route that will not compromise residents or the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage" rel="nofollow">

        status of the national park. I will be requesting emission-free vehicles to be utilised in the airport site and genuine biobanking to preserve our environment, and I will be advocating for a rail link for airport passengers. I was pleased to see the scoping study announced regarding this.
