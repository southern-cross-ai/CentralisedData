       <p>
        I love my sport, but as time goes by, it's becoming harder to get out onto a football pitch and kick a ball around. Last Friday I spent time with one of the fantastic local sporting clubs in my electorate, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bribie_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Bribie Island
        </a>
        Tigers Football Club. While these ageing legs don't work as well as they once did, they didn't stop me getting out onto the pitch for a game of walking football.
       </p>
       <p>
        Walking football is becoming increasingly popular among men and women who want to keep active and participate in sport, like I do, but prefer something that's a little bit more slow paced. It is a low-impact, modified version of the game, which is suitable for all levels of ability and fitness. Games are played at a slower pace, which reduces the risk of players getting injuries. It offers many health benefits like reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke. It can also improve balance, bone density and blood pressure, while lowering cholesterol. Of course, the social benefits of participating in a team sport cannot be overstated.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank the Tigers for a fun night and for providing an opportunity for us on the other side of the Pine to keep active.

        are a true community club that has endured some significant hardships in recent years. Despite this, they just get on with it and play an important role in bringing the Bribie Island community closer togetherâ€”and the beers afterwards certainly helped with the pain in my legs!
