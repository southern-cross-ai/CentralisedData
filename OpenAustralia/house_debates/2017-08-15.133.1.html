        . As co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of India and as a parliamentarian with 6,300 constituents with an Indian background, or roughly 4½ per cent of my electorate, I'm pleased to acknowledge this important day for India and for the broader Indian diaspora.

        Independence Day commemorates the passage of the Indian Independence Act through the British parliament on 15 August 1947. This action transferred legislative control over the Indian subcontinent from the British parliament to the Indian people. The following day, commencing a tradition that carries through to this day,

        , has recently finished participating in the same ceremony. The Prime Minister called for India to be 'bharat jodo', a united India. He said, 'We should celebrate 15 August 2017 as Sankalp Parva or the Day of Resolve. We have to take a pledge to quit uncleanliness, poverty, terrorism, casteism and communalism from India.'

        Independence Day is observed all over India as a national holiday with flag-raising ceremonies, parades and cultural events. Schools and government agencies give out sweets to commemorate the sweetness of freedom. On Saturday night, I attended the Council of Indian Australians' annual Independence Day celebrations at Blacktown, organised by Mohit Kumar and Sanjay Deshwal. As part of the celebrations, the council produced a Bollywood-style video with local Indian members of the community retelling important moments from India's history, from the

        India is of growing importance to Australia today. Two and a half per cent of Australians, or roughly 600,000 people, have an Indian ancestry. India is the world's largest democracy; it's a major regional and strategic power. India is Australia's fifth-largest export market and our 10th-largest trading partner overall. Investment has grown significantly over the past decade, as have tourist flows between the two countries. Over 200,000 Indians came to Australia as tourists last year. India is the largest source of skilled migration to Australia and the second-largest source of international students, with over 60,000 Indians enrolled to study in Australia. India is the world's fastest-growing major economy with forecast growth of seven per cent in 2017 and between 7.5 and 7.8 per cent growth to 2020. By 2030, India is projected to be the world's third-largest economy. I want to take the opportunity on this
