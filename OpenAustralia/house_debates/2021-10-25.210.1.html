        I recently attended the 4 Aussie Heroes Foundation community dinner at the City Golf Club, Toowoomba. The dinner was held to celebrate the efforts of all those who competed in the 2021 Pedals 'n Medals fundraising bike ride that wended its way through the beautiful
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darling_Downs" rel="nofollow">
         Darling Downs
        </a>
        and into the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockyer_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Lockyer Valley
        </a>
        . The foundation exists to aid and support first responder and military personnel, past and present, who are suffering and struggling with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTSD" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and related mental health issues. Groom's strong military community makes it an ideal place for organisations like this to get in and make a real difference.

       <p>
        I very much thank the co-founders, Gerry and Renita Garard, for everything they've done in setting up this wonderful organisation. The guest speaker of the evening, Cathy Nielsen, is a true Toowoomba hero. The insights she shared of her experiences as a frontline police officer, particularly during the terrible tragedy that led to the death on duty of her partner, Brett Forte, reminded us all of the need to support those whose duty it is to serve and protect us. The pride in the eyes of her parents as they watched Cathy speak was evident to all. Indeed, as she spoke of her journey after the event, it was very clear that this wasn't a superwoman but, rather, very much one of usâ€”a regular person who'd been put through the most trying of circumstances and who, like us, had needed a little support to get back up into the saddle.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was very proud to watch Toowoomba's generous heart get behind her and the foundation. I look forward to supporting them again as they continue their very good work.
