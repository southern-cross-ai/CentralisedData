        I rise today to pay tribute to the

        and congratulate them on the recent opening of the Wolf Blass Community Centre at their home ground,

        in Norwood. Very unfortunately, nearly 20 years ago, the Norwood Football Club's clubrooms, just adjacent to the oval, had to be sold off because of some financial challenges the club had, that I won't delve into today, given the controversies at the time. Thankfully, less than 20 years later the club has a proper home again.
       </p>
       <p>
        I particularly pay tribute to Mr Wolf Blass. The centre is named after him thanks to the enormous contribution that he made financially. Equally the Commonwealth government made a very significant contribution to that. The Norwood Football Club community came together. So many members of the club are making financial contributions and others are doing so much to ensure that the club has a home again.

        It was a great thrill to be at the first event. Unfortunately it was a meal before the last game of the season, which was an unsuccessful outing for the club, and we didn't make the finals this year. But we are focused on next year now. Very soon, in a few weeks time, the official opening of the venue will occur. So many members of the club, who have been so loyal to it and supported it all their lives, are so thrilled that now we have a proper home again. It changes game day significantly. It's also a great asset to the local community in Norwood.
