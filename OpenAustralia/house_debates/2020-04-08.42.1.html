        My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. Given the JobKeeper wage subsidy has been supported by both sides of this chamber to maintain the relationship between employees and employers, will the Prime Minister extend the wage subsidy to the 1.1 million casual workers who are currently excluded?

         The package of measures that we announced before the JobKeeper program was for the jobseeker program. The jobseeker program ensured that through the jobseeker supplement—the COVID supplement—we were doubling the level of jobseeker support to Australians who found themselves in a situation where they were no longer in work. Those arrangements were the first layer we put down to ensure that our social security network was strengthened and expanded to ensure that it could capture more and more Australians who found themselves the victims of the economic crisis that has hit Australia as a result of the coronavirus. In addition, people who are eligible for those payments don't just receive the jobseeker payment and the supplement for the coronavirus. They are also able to get access to a range of other social security supports, whether that be rental assistance or the Family Tax Benefit part B and A and a range of other measures that can support people through these situations. Now, it would be a mistake—

           The point of order is on relevance. The question was very specific. It went to the relationship between employees and employers being maintained—that's at the heart of the government's scheme. What the Prime Minister is talking about is once that's severed and people are unemployed. That's what we're trying to avoid here.

            <p>
             As I was just about to remark, we put the jobseeker payment and its increased capacity in place because we knew there would be those who would not be ultimately eligible for other measures we may consider. What we have done with JobKeeper is ensured it's extended to casual employees for those who have been with their employer for 12 months or more, a status that is already recognised under Australia's taxation system. In putting together the $130 billion package, that is where we ultimately drew the line. When you're putting these lifelines in place, you have to draw lines somewhere. When we drew that line, we knew we could do it, knowing full well that we had already acted to put the jobseeker safety net in place for those who wouldn't be eligible under the JobKeeper program. So we have put our arms wide out as a government and as a country to support those who have been impacted by the devastating effects of the coronavirus in our economy.
            </p>
            <p>
             The jobseeker program and the JobKeeper program work together. They work together to provide the foundational supports in our economy and in our community to ensure that we can help Australians get through these crises. That was the reasoning behind our decision, and we will continue to ensure that that support is in place. But, as I've said on a number of occasions, it is so important we find our way through and out, because these lifelines cannot be in place indefinitely. That is why we are working on the health issues, to ensure that we get back to a position as quickly as we can and, subject to the health advice, to ensure that we get our economy moving again.
