        My question is to the Prime Minister. How is Australia building on our history with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
         Papua New Guinea
        </a>

         I thank the member for Solomon for his question and for his distinguished service. As an Australian, there are very few experiences that could be more humbling than to walk a part of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokoda_Track" rel="nofollow">
          Kokoda Track
         </a>
         , to be in the same place where Australians and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
          Papua New Guinea
         </a>
         ns fought desperately for the same thing at the time, which was home. Last month, in the lead-up to Anzac Day, I had the privilege of walking in the footsteps of giants. I was joined by the

         prime minister to walk part of the Kokoda Track. I was joined by the governor of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oro_Province" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         , Gary Juffa.
        </p>
        <p>
         We started at Kokoda and we received welcomes at all of the villages that were just as warm as those people familiar with PNG would expect. This friendship between our two nations is about more than geographic proximity. It was cemented literally on the Kokoda Track all those decades ago—a friendship nurtured across generations.
        </p>
        <p>
         Throughout our journey, which was a relatively short one, I had the pleasure of meeting many Australians walking the Kokoda Track for the entire journey in what has become a pilgrimage in memory of and respect for those Australians who fought for our country. The landscape is beautiful, but it is challenging, as every member who's walked there knows so well. But at every step you reflect on those who were up against something unimaginably harder. In 1942, 625 Australians were killed along the track. The great artery of mud and suffering and perseverance holds such a special place of such power in Australia's shared memory and, indeed, the memory of PNG. So many Papua New Guineans helped Australians: troops, coastwatchers, shipping pilots, nurses and carers, villagers and stretcher bearers—angels, as they became known, walking tall through the hell of war.
        </p>
        <p>
         All this was certainly on my mind when we reached Isurava, the scene of the battle that claimed 99 Australian lives and wounded another 111 Australians. It was a solemn privilege to be there on Anzac Day to utter those important words: lest we forget.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to acknowledge the ADF personnel and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
          AFP
         </a>
         and others who supported the trip. I want to acknowledge the porters who made the expedition possible, especially Bela. I couldn't have done it without him—that's for sure. PNG is our nearest of neighbours. It is an important relationship. We are the closest of friends, and spending that time with Prime Minister Marape was a part of demonstrating what a crucial element that relationship is in peace and stability in our region.

         On that note, I ask that further questions be placed on the
