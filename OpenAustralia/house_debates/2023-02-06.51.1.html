        Last week customers of Westpac's Kin Kora bank branch in Gladstone were notified that their local branch was closing. This bank branch closure joins over 550 branches that have been closed by the big four banks since January 2020. Bank branch closures have occurred all over the Flynn electorate in

        available at the secretary's office. Theodore's Bulls'n'Barrels Bonanza hires two ATMs, as it can't use EFTPOS due to poor communications and internet reception. The same thing happened at Jambin's Australia Day ceremony. Too many people were trying to access the wi-fi, which crashed the system and left people unable to purchase anything.

        On many occasions, the big banks have advertised for customers to use online services. While this may be viable for some people, I have serious concerns for our elderly and those who rely on local bank services. Constituents in some communities have to drive hours to visit their nearest bank branch because of branch closures. It is simply not good enough. It's time for the big banks to put their money where their mouth is and continue their banking services in rural Queensland.
