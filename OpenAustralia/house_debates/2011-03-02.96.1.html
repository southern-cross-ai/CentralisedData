        I rise today to inform the House of some of the great
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_the_Education_Revolution" rel="nofollow">
         Building the Education Revolution
        </a>
        projects being completed in my electorate. I cannot talk about them all because I have over 60 schools in my electorate but I would like to update the House on a number of important projects that I have had the pleasure to visit recently. A couple of weeks ago I attended the opening of Woodcroft
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_School" rel="nofollow">
         Primary School
        </a>
        ’s new gym facilities and their refurbished performing arts space. This is a particularly exciting project. When I walked into the new performing arts space, I saw something that I had never seen before at the school—year 3s in pairs in this performing arts space working on wireless laptop computers making very creative movies. It was a dynamic learning environment. This performing arts space has facilitated that opportunity.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodcroft_Primary_School" rel="nofollow">
         Woodcroft Primary School
        </a>
        is a growing primary school with 800 to 900 students, from reception to year 7. The gym is a much bigger gym and more appropriate for the school. Everyone at the school was very excited and I certainly shared in that.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was also pleased to go to a much smaller school, Old Noarlunga Primary School, which has a very close-knit school community, where I was able to open a new multipurpose hall. This hall has enabled all the primary school children and the community to meet in one place for the first time. This has been particularly important for the local school community. I was also very pleased to visit the Seaford 6-12 School and see their new performing arts space and refurbished classrooms, which will really enhance their learning environment. I was also pleased to travel to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatachilla_Lutheran_College" rel="nofollow">
         Tatachilla Lutheran College
        </a>
        , where they have opened a new multipurpose gym, which will strengthen the delivery of education programs.
       </p>
       <p>
        These are just a few of the schools I have visited, but these projects have not only delivered wonderful facilities but also supported jobs in our local community. The Woodcroft Primary School project supported 100 jobs in our local community; Old Noarlunga Primary School supported 20 workers in the local area; and the project at Seaford 6-12 School supported 30 workers. This is a very important thing. These projects were good projects that the schools wanted. They were value-for-money projects, were important and will have a long-lasting effect on the local school communities. I would like to congratulate everyone involved in these projects and wish them the best for the future.
