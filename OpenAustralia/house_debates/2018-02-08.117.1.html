        My question is to the Minister for the Environment and Energy, representing the Minister for Education and Training. Will the minister update the House on how many families across the country will benefit from the coalition government's new childcare package, including, Minister, those in my electorate of Barker? Minister, could you compare it to alternative approaches?

         . More than 80 per cent of those families using child care in his electorate will benefit from the Turnbull government's reforms. Indeed, they're the most significant reforms in 40 years.

         An additional $2.5 billion has been added to child care, and around one million families are benefiting. Our emphasis is on the lower- and middle-income families, and those where parents are working, studying, volunteering. They're the ones who will benefit from our childcare reforms.

          <p>
           We're delivering a fairer system. There are 370,000 Australian families with an income of less than $65,000 using child care. They will see their subsidy go up from 72 per cent to 85 per cent. We're delivering a more accessible system. Of the families using child care, 85 per cent have an income of less than $185,000, and we are abolishing the annual cap on the rebate. We will deliver a more affordable system, by introducing an hourly rate cap, which will deliver lower prices compared to when the Labor Party were last in office, when childcare prices went up by more than 50 per cent. A family in Australia with an income of $80,000, with two children under six years of age in child care five days a week, paying $100 a day, will be $8,000 a year better off under the Turnbull government's reforms.
          </p>
          <p>
           What do you think the Labor Party did? Do you think they voted for that legislation, for that reform? No; the Labor Party voted against it, despite the fact that 75 per cent of families using child care in the member for McMahon's electorate would be better off, despite the fact that 72 per cent of families in the member for Maribyrnong's electorate would be better off, despite the fact that 75 per cent of families in the member for Port Adelaide's electorate would be better off, and despite the fact that, in the electorate of the member for Kingston—the shadow minister responsible in this area—83 per cent of families would be better off under the Turnbull government's reforms.
          </p>
          <p>
           When it comes to child care—like with education, company tax, free trade and energy—don't look at what Labor says, look at what Labor does. Only the coalition can deliver a more affordable and reliable childcare system for Australian families.
