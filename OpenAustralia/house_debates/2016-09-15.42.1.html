       <p>
        Like many in Bendigo, I was outraged to learn yesterday that the new member for Calare is claiming that his community is the home of the Chiko roll. If we do not have to contend with the member for Riverina, it is now the member for Calare who is claiming that his area is the home of the Chiko roll. It is just simply not true.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let me correct the record once again. Bendigo is the true home of the Chiko roll. The Chiko roll was created by a Bendigonian. It was invented by Frank. Frank wanted to be able to drink a beer at the footy and eat a snack at the same time. This is the folk legend about the Chiko roll, to the extent that it is on the back of the packet of the Chiko roll.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the back of the packet it clearly states: born in Bendigo. Now, for a party that is always on their feet about food labelling, for a party that is always on their feet about the country of origin and region of origin, you would think they would pick up the back of the packet of the Chiko roll and read, clearly labelled: born in Bendigo. I am here today to correct the record and remind the member for Riverina and our new friend in this place that Bendigo is the true home of the Chiko roll. Read the back of the packet. Be learned before standing up in this place. Bendigo and Frank, we are proud of your efforts with the Chiko roll.
