        I was honoured to open recently the senior school extension at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Hills_Christian_School" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific Hills Christian School
        </a>
        in my electorate in Dural. I want to acknowledge Stephen Trew, the chairman of the council; Dr Ted Boyce, one of the legendary figures of education in my area—he has had 32 years as principal there—Tina Lamont and Andrew Waters, assistant principals;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_Stanton" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , one of the great institutional architects of our country; David McInnes, who was the builder; and the school captains, Georgia Goulet and Ivan Yip. The school extension involved a gym, five new general learning areas, and science facilities, including a lab and research areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        Science, technology, engineering and maths will provide the jobs of the future, and it is very important that our school students have a background in these areas. I want to congratulate Dr Boyce, Stephen Trew and the entire school leadership on raising an extraordinary $2.9 million for the development, and I am pleased to say that the federal government was able to contribute $300,000 through the Capital Grants Program. While we are talking about federal funding, it is important to note that as a result of the federal budget, Pacific Hills Christian School will receive $72½ million over the next 10 years. That is an increase of $6 million. New facilities are always a cause for celebration, but it is the teachers, students and parents who give the spirit to the school. From the sacrifice of the parents, to the education provided by the teachers, to the Christian principles of service on which the community and school focus on, Pacific Hills Christian School ensures that graduates go on to become productive and engaged members of our community. I wish the staff and students well.
