       <p>
        It may not surprise you to learn that in my electorate of Fairfax there are many men and women who are far better human beings than I. I rise today to pay credit to a few who have been acknowledged through this year's

         Queen's Birthday
        </a>
        honours. In particular, Pastor Dale Dowler received a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medal_of_the_Order_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Medal of the Order of Australia
        </a>
        for his services to the community. Dale and his wife, Donna, created the Shack, which provides service to our community's most vulnerable. To him it is not a profession but a vocation of life that he lives every single day. Then there's Rod Forrester, who also received a Medal of the Order of Australia. Rod has created a legacy you might expect from 100 people, not just one. He is a giant. Indeed, his intellect is matched by such a deep humility, and that's what sets him apart. Then there is Detective Senior Sergeant Daren Edwards, who was awarded an

        </a>
        after 35 years of distinguished service. Our community is safer because Daren is in charge. Finally, Marie Mahon was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia for her service to dance as a teacher and a person who has really led in the field. Each and every one of these people contribute to society not because they want a gong but because they give of themselves. I say congratulations to them.
