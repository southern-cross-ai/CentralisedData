        I rise to acknowledge
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Dillon" rel="nofollow">
         Tom Dillon
        </a>
        , who has announced his retirement from the Bunbury City Council at the age of 65. Tom is truly a colourful character, larger than life, full of energy but with genuine commitment to his community. He served the city council for more than 10 years over the past 30 years. He was first elected in 1978 and saw Bunbury become a city during his first term. He was the deputy mayor and spearheaded the Graham Bricknell Music Shell project, raising $300,000 in external contributions for a project to honour a former deputy mayor who died in tragic circumstances.

        There have been many significant progressive projects completed during Tom’s time on council. He is a major mover and shaker, capable of organising very successful and well-planned events and functions. Tom has never been afraid to tackle controversial issues. The community was always very aware of exactly where Tom stood on any given issue. He has been a vigorous, strong advocate and a master with the media. Tom himself has said, ‘While I might not have always been popular, I have always given it my absolute best shot.’ This epitomises the man who is Tom Dillon and it is why he is a well-respected and highly valued community member. He has been and continues to be vitally interested in issues and projects affecting Bunbury, including the Bunbury speedway. He is also keenly interested in boxing and he is a personal friend of
