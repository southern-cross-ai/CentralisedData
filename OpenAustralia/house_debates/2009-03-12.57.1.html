         I thank the member for Moreton for his timely question. The government is investing $26.4 billion—Commonwealth funds on the table—for our nation-building program. There will be record investment in road and rail projects right around the nation. In Queensland alone, that investment is worth some $6.5 billion.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is on the table through a memorandum of understanding with each of the state and territory governments. Every state and territory government has signed up to the nation-building program. Because Queensland is in election mode, it is unable to at the moment, but the Bligh government has indicated that it would sign up and therefore get Labor’s record $6.5 billion of funds for road and rail in Queensland.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Leader of the Opposition in Queensland, Mr Springborg, said last week that he would honour the offer that was there and sign up and be part of the plan. But, of course, this lasted two days, and then he made a demand: ‘We don’t want $6.5 billion—we want half of that amount for Queensland.’ He said he would sign up if he got the same offer that Queensland got under

            The Prime Minister went to this road in the electorate of Moreton and made that election commitment. Last week Mr Springborg went to the same venue and said that it should not proceed and that they would intervene to stop the federal government spending federal funds to build roads in Queensland. What they do is—

               One of your best, Pete! The fact is that the Bligh government have said yes to partnership with the federal government in road and rail and nation building. But the Queensland opposition have said that they want a carbon copy of the Howard government’s plan from 2007, which is to have an election commitment cancelled on the Mains and Kessels intersection, to go back to the drawing board and to do nothing—just like when it comes to economic policy. They have one thing in common with the federal opposition, whether it is the

               in Queensland or the Liberals or the Nationals or whatever they are called here: their strategy when it comes to nation building, when it comes to jobs and when it comes to economic stimulus is to do absolutely nothing.

                . I refer the minister to the government’s recent debt package which included funding for maintenance of Australia’s national highways. As minister with responsibility for Australia’s two major links between Sydney and Melbourne, is the minister aware that the

                  Mr Speaker, I rise on a point order centred on relevance. The question was asked about mining under the

                    I got asked about the

                    and I am answering about the Rudd government’s proud record of record investment in the Hume Highway—just like we have record investment in the Pacific and the Bruce highways. In May, I will be visiting the Hume Highway to open a number of projects with the member for Riverina—who has a much more constructive attitude towards that important highway than her colleague the member for Hume.
