        saw many wonderful members of the Forde electorate receive recognition for their contribution to the community. I am very pleased to share with you the community spirit that was demonstrated on that day and the great contributors that keep our electorate on track. Australia Day awards honour the outstanding achievements of recipients and nominees, celebrating Australian excellence in our community.

        The Forde community was fortunate to celebrate the achievement and contribution of unique Australians who were recognised with a special award. I would like to take some time to name some of these exceptional community members and to sincerely congratulate them. A Neighbour of the Year Award and

        were given to June Hintz, a wonderful artist who lives in the Forde electorate and co-runs Mothers Against Drugs, a much needed group that assists young carers in the community. Her warm and caring nature combined with her artistic flair ensure her work remains an integral part of the carers community. Yet, we are struggling to obtain renewal of their funding for the next three years. I will continue to pursue that on her behalf.

        resident Wendy Ive was the recipient of the mayor’s Spirit of Logan Award and is well known in the community for her work in helping others in need. She supports many charities in the area and is always around to lend a hand when needed. Wendy’s community spirit and positive attitude truly embodies what it is to live in Logan and the Forde community. Also, Mr James Hall was nominated for a community service award for his services: volunteering for Meals on Wheels, mentoring students in
