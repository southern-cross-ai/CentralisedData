         The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (1) and (2). Yes. The Minister can also advise that he has not received any representations from the

         on this matter.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Minister also notes that while historical Small Area Labour Market data at the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGA" rel="nofollow">

         falls) rose from 3.9 per cent in November 2007 to 7.0 per cent in September 2013, before remaining steady over the period to October 2014. It is noted that the Honourable Member did not express any concern for the doubling of the unemployment rate under the government of which he was a member.

        <p class="italic">
         (3). It is clear that some Australian regions are currently experiencing difficult labour market conditions, which is why the Government will be increasing employment opportunities right across the country by:

          The Government
         </a>
         is also implementing a range of other measures to help job seekers move into work. Young job seekers aged 18 to 30 will benefit from the Job Commitment Bonus which will provide up to $6,500 to eligible job seekers if they get and keep a job for 24 months and remain off income support. Unemployed Australians who move to take up a job will benefit from the new Relocation Assistance which will provide up to $6,000 to eligible job seekers who relocate to a regional area, and up to $3,000 for eligible job seekers who relocate to a metropolitan area. Families with dependent children will also be eligible for up to a further $3,000 to meet the costs of relocating to take up a job. Older job seekers and employers will benefit from the Seniors Employment Incentive Payment which will provide up to $3,250 to employers to hire eligible workers 50 years of age or over.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         The Government recognises that job creation needs to be matched by measures that ensure that job seekers have the skills employers need, which is why it has announced changes to employment services which commence in July 2015. These changes will reinvigorate employment services for job seekers and employers and deliver a system that is more responsive and focused on results. Combined with reforms to vocational education and training, job seekers will be work ready, ensuring that Australia's workforce is skilled and flexible.
