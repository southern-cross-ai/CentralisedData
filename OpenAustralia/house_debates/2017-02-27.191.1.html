        , but every member of this House and every member of the other place knows a John Lang. John Lang is a stalwart of my

        John was awarded his Order of Australia medal in 1999 for services to the community through charitable and service organisations. John is active and innovative and when asked to serve cannot say no. Despite his years, John shows no sign of slowing down. Not everyone knows John Harold Albert Lang
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        , but we all know a John Lang—a person who puts the service of others first, a person who is about their community and makes a difference to the world of those around them. Australia needs more John Langs, not fewer. I was sad to hear that recently John injured himself in a fall after a Brookvale Rotary meeting and is recovering. John, I wish you a hasty recovery and look forward to seeing you soon.
