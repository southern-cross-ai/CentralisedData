        I rise on a matter of privilege. I recently undertook to send through
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Post
        </a>
        ’s Nepean business centre 20,987 invitations to the screening of a documentary film,
        <i>
         The Men Who Saved Australia
        </i>
        , to be introduced by Major-General Ian Flawith and cohosted by me and the Rooty Hill
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        sub-branch. I have received an invoice from Australia Post dated 30 May 2006 which claims that they have all been delivered. I have received a couple of complaints in my office about the failure of some of my constituents to receive this invitation. I did make inquiries at Australia Post and initially felt that the problem may have been relatively minor. I have now been advised that between 3,000 and 5,000 of these unaddressed mail items were shredded, apparently at local management direction, and, furthermore, management have claimed when challenged by other Australia Post staff that I had provided these items in excess of the required number. This is not correct, as these are batched in my office and the required numbers were advised by Australia Post.
       </p>
       <p>
        The mail items were collected from my office on Monday, 29 May 2006, with the delivery period being from 5 to 9 June 2006. Furthermore, I understand that some of the delivery staff were not provided with sufficient material to complete their deliveries. I understand that the shredded material was in locked security bins at Nepean delivery centre, and I was concerned that any subsequent approach to Australia Post would result in their removal. I contacted the office of the Commissioner of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Federal Police
        </a>
        requesting that the matter be investigated prior to any of the physical evidence being removed. I have been made aware that the security bins have now been removed. As I have had no response from the Federal Police, I am unable to advise whether or not the physical evidence has been intercepted by them.
       </p>
       <p>
        I believe that tampering with mail is a serious offence of itself. I am at a loss to understand why, apparently, management of Australia Post’s Nepean centre would wish to tamper with invitations to view this documentary. I consider it to be un-Australian. Every Australian must have confidence that their mail will be processed and delivered. Mail is one of the important ways for members of the House to communicate with their constituents. Any tampering with mail is a direct and significant interference with a member’s ability to do their job.
       </p>
       <p>
        Accordingly, I would ask that you consider these matters that I have raised and, in particular, the actions complained of and whether or not they amount to improper interference with free performance of my duties as a member. I table the invitation, the invoice from Australia Post, the map of the distribution area and also my request to Australia Post for the delivery of these items.

         I thank the Chief Opposition Whip. He raises a serious matter. I will look at it closely and make further investigations.
