        This year marks the 40th birthday of KinderGym, which was pioneered in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        by Dr Carole Pinnock. KinderGym started in Unley with 47 children. Today, it operates around Australia, helping 40,000 children under the age of five develop socially, cognitively, emotionally and physically. KinderGym provides children with the building blocks they need for fundamental movement patterns and physical development. KinderGym is also enormous fun. I know this because I've had the privilege of visiting my very popular local KinderGym at the Seacliff Recreation Centre, seeing children and their parents, grandparents, carers, staff and volunteers having a wonderful time. On my many visits, long-term KinderGym coach Clare Moase has told me how much she loves her job and her part in helping children learn and grow. It was therefore fitting that Clare accepted the award for meritorious service to the community on behalf of Seacliff KinderGym last week. At the same ceremony, Marilynn Rayner was recognised for meritorious service to the community for her almost four decades of volunteer service to Seacliff KinderGym, and I want to thank and congratulate Marilynn for her incredible contribution. Another one of our wonderful local volunteers, Graham Dodd, was recognised for his decades of work for KinderGym with a meritorious service award for strategic administration and promotion of KinderGym. As is so often the case with local volunteers, they never just give to one cause, and Graham is also an active volunteer with the Hawthorn Bowling Club. Congratulations to Clare, Marilynn, Graham and the Seacliff Recreation Centre, for their tremendous service.
