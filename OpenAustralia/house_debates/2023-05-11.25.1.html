        When the COVID lockdowns began, we were told we were all in this together. But residents of public housing towers in Flemington and also

        , in my electorate, quickly found out this wasn't the case when the Victorian government sent in the police to lock them down without notice. People told me they understood that extraordinary measures were necessary but they felt like criminals in their own homes. Around 3,000 people were immediately trapped, unable to leave for a walk, medicine or food for days. The police presence was excessive and it intimidated. For those inside staring out, it was incredibly distressing and a complete disregard for their humanity.
       </p>
       <p>
        But the residents fought back. They took the government to court, and the government reached a $5 million settlement. Divided by the 3,000 residents, it's just over $1,500 each. I congratulate them on what they have achieved, but they deserve more because these people were denied their freedom and are now even being denied an apology. I'm glad they were able to get compensation, and I back those who brought the class action and also those who are seeking other legal options for further compensation. However, it is awful that the Andrews government is still unable to simply say sorry, that a mistake was made and that they regret the harm it caused.

        During the lockdowns, the community stepped up to help. I would like to acknowledge the incredible role played by the Australian Muslim Social Services Agency as well as countless others who assisted the residents throughout this horrible period. The community did their part, and now the Victorian government should do theirs and apologise.
