       <p>
        In my community, the winter seasons of the local sporting codes are in full swing, and it has been such fun to attend so many games rain, hail or shine. However, many of our sporting facilities are falling behind modern standards for disability access and gender inclusiveness despite our volunteer committees. I will say that many of our facilities have been upgraded over the last three years, and it has been a privilege to work with those committees to get those upgrades over the line. However, there is always more to do. What we find is that many of our facilities were built in the fifties and had some renos in the seventies, and now they're in a desperate state of need.

        I'd like to thank all the clubs whose have approached my office in upgrading their facilities. I will give a bit of a shout-out to Clarendon Netball Club, who I visited just last Saturday. They have two sheds that are in desperate need. They have been flooded and are no place for an umpire to change. Honestly, if you saw them, they're worse than any garden shed of a suburban home.
       </p>

        It's a tough job for volunteers to turn a vision into a viable project. I recognise that, and so I will continue to hold grant-writing workshops so we can build our capacity. To all the clubs in Mayo: I want you to know I will continue to advocate for you and for our projects and support you in your grant applications. I'm very keen to continue talking with government on every single one of our projects.
