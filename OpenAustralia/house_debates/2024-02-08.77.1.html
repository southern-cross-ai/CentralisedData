        My question is to the Prime Minister. Could the Prime Minister outline the government's actions over the summer?

         I thank the Chief Government Whip for her question. Of course, she was a big supporter of the legislation introduced this week to give a tax cut for every Australian taxpayer and to make sure that these tax cuts were squarely aimed at middle Australia to make a difference for working people.
        </p>

         But that wasn't all that happened. We had the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
          ACCC
         </a>
         investigating pricing and competition in supermarkets. We appointed Dr Emerson to do work as well on those issues, including the Food and Grocery Code of Conduct review. Over the summer, all 58 Medicare urgent care clinics that we promised are now up and running. We had a major Border Force crackdown on the importation of illegal tobacco. We banned importation of disposable single-use vapes. We saw an increase in bulk-billing rates as a result of tripling the bulk-billing incentive—the biggest investment in Medicare that we have seen since it was first introduced 40 years ago—and we celebrated the 40th birthday of Medicare, which is so strong it even survived this bloke as health minister.

        <p>
         We improved metastatic cancer data collection. We had an agreement, signed by the education minister, for school funding in WA.We hope this is the first from right across the states and territories. We heard the result of our cheaper childcare. It has resulted in an 11 per cent average reduction for centre based daycare. We opened applications for the first round of funding for social and affordable housing under our Housing Australia Future Fund.
        </p>

         We travelled to

         We announced hydrogen hubs in Townsville, and
