        I rise to present a petition concerning Turramurra
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_Office" rel="nofollow">
         Post Office
        </a>
        . The petition has been approved by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Petitions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The petition read as follows—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This petition of the residents of Bradfield draws to the attention of the House the announced closure of the Turramurra Past Office in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

       <p class="italic">

       <p class="italic">
        * causes enormous inconvenience with this closure and the relocation of private postal boxes out of the area and *Turramurra Post office is a profitable

        outlet
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We therefore ask the House to: urge the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Digital Productivity to use his power under the Australia Post Act to consult with the Australia Post Board regarding the closure of the Turramurra Post Office, located in Bradfield, on the grounds of the demographics of the members of the community and the inconvenience it causes local residents and businesses,
       </p>
       <p>
        from 811 citizens
       </p>
       <p>
        Petition received.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have previously raised the issue of Turramurra Post Office in this chamber. The petition concerns the community’s reaction to the decision taken by Australia Post to shut the Turramurra Post Office. This decision first became known to the community when a ‘for lease’ sign appeared outside the front of the Turramurra Post Office. At that point, I contacted Australia Post to ask what was happening with the Post Office in response to inquiries by a number of concerned constituents. Australia Post advised me that they were indeed planning to shut down the Turramurra Post Office on 28 January. In response, among a range of actions, I initiated a petition and there was a substantial response in the community. At the same time, my state colleague Barry O’Farrell, the member for Ku-ring-gai, also initiated a petition and that will be tabled, I understand, in the New South Wales parliament later in the year. Barry has some other priorities in the next few weeks.
       </p>
       <p>
        The petition draws the attention of the House to the announced closure of the Turramurra post office. It notes that it is located within a retail, commercial and banking precinct, it provides a range of postal services and, amongst other things, the closure would cause enormous inconvenience and the relocation of private postal boxes out of the area would also cause enormous inconvenience.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to the petition that I tabled today, the community has supported me in a range of other actions. Nearly 300 residents of Turramurra and concerned local businesspeople attended a community meeting in mid-January. I thank everybody who made the effort to turn up. Quite a few people were unable to fit into the hall we had booked on fairly short notice for the event and so listened to proceedings through a loudspeaker on the lawn outside. A senior executive of Australia Post attended at my request and she heard directly from the community about their concerns. Subsequently, Australia Post made written commitments in regard to continuity of service and has now established a new community postal agency at Eastern Road in Turramurra.
       </p>
       <p>
        With the assistance of community representatives we formed the Turramurra Post Office Action Group and that group is continuing to monitor the performance by Australia Post on its written commitments. I thank all in Turramurra who have been involved in this and all who have signed this petition. I am very pleased to table this petition to inform the House of this important matter.
