       <p>
        I am very pleased to inform the House of two great local schools in the electorate of Charlton that are currently celebrating their 150th anniversaries. Both Plattsburg
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_School" rel="nofollow">
         Public School
        </a>
        and Lambton Public School were opened in 1865, and this year both these school communities are celebrating a very special 150th birthday.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the first European settlement in Newcastle was established only in 1804, these two schools are amongst the oldest in the entire Hunter region. Both schools are in the northern part of the electorate I represent. Indeed, Lambton Public School is located on the border with the seat of Newcastle, and many residents of my neighbouring seat—Madam Deputy Speaker Claydon's seat—go there. Plattsburg Public School is in the suburb of Wallsend, and this very month both schools mark their 150 years since opening. The Plattsburg school community recently marked the special occasion with a dinner at South Leagues Club and will also celebrate with a spring fair, which will include tours of the school, memorabilia displays, classic cars and a market stall.
       </p>
       <p>
        One notable alumnus of Plattsburg is my state colleague
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonia_Hornery" rel="nofollow">
         Sonia Hornery
        </a>
        , the member for Wallsend, who is very proud to have started her primary education at the school. On behalf of the people of Charlton I send our best wishes to Principal Ellen Bax and the Plattsburg school community at this special time.
       </p>
       <p>
        The staff and students of Lambton Public School will celebrate their special anniversary this Friday, and the Lambton community will commemorate the anniversary with a special parade along Elder Street. The parade will showcase the current staff and students and will be followed by a special formal assembly. The celebrations will continue over the weekend, with a dinner for 500 guests on Friday night, a fete on Saturday and an open day on Sunday. Lambton Public also marked the occasion with the publication of a special commemorative book, Celebrating 150 Years, which can be ordered online from the school's website.
       </p>
       <p>
        To my mind, the proudest and most significant alumnus from Lambton Public School is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Charlton" rel="nofollow">
         Matthew Charlton
        </a>
        , for whom my electorate was named. Matthew Charlton, a miner, was educated at Lambton Public School, went on to be a coalminer and an official for the mighty mineworkers federation and then led the Labor Party during its darkest days post the split over conscription. He is a great alumnus from Lambton Public School and one of the many notable figures to come out of this excellent school.
       </p>
       <p>
        Again on behalf of the people of Charlton, I acknowledge and congratulate Principal Jan Partridge and all of the Lambton Public School community on its very special occasion. I am very proud to have some great public schools in my electorate, and Lambton and Plattsburg are two such examples. Thank you.
       </p>
