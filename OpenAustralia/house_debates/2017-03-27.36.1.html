        After the weekend, some may remark that footy is back. Whilst we enjoyed a great game, seeing the Crows beat

        Women's league with that sell-out and lockout game in Melbourne. We have seen a huge success, and I want to stand here today and congratulate the AFL and all of those in the AFL Women's league, who have worked so hard to make this not just a reality but an overwhelming success.

       <p>
        I stand here today happy to admit that I used to be embarrassed to confess that my childhood dream was to grow up and play the sport that I loved, footy, for the team that I loved. Of course, I realise that that was not possible, but it is so nice to think that there are generations of young girls and women who are growing up today knowing that that is indeed a reality and something where they can look to their heroes and aspire to be just like them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Speaking of heroes, of course, it was the grand final of the AFL Women's league on the weekend, and I am happy to report that the mighty
