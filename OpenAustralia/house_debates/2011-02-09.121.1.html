        On 28 January, the recipients of the 2010 Shortland awards were presented with their awards. This year it was a little different because we also gave awards to three groups. The first is the Belmont Neighbourhood Watch. The second is the

        Surf Lifesaving Club, which was formed in 1923. It was originally known as the Wallarah Surf Club. It reformed in 1927 and it has cared for that community and that beach and been involved in a number of very important rescues. The third is the Charlestown Caring Group, which was formed in 1979. It is in

        , Charlestown. It was first funded by a Hunter Area Assistance Scheme grant as a neighbour aid group and it provides a number of services, including home visits, home respite, shopping, group activities, bus outings, transport to medical appointments—a fantastic group. Three people from that group received awards: Eileen Steel,
