        My question is to the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction. Will the Minister outline to the House how the Morrison government's plans are delivering on its responsible emissions reductions target whilst ensuring lower energy costs and reliability in energy generation? Is the minister aware of any alternative policies?

            He knows that we went to the last election with a plan to deliver a fair deal on energy for all Australians while we reduce our emissions. He also knows that we are delivering. Indeed, just today we've announced that, from 1 July, the dodgy late-payment penalties that were inflicted by energy companies on many Australian families and small businesses will come to an end. A new rule will ensure that can't happen. Any company that doesn't comply will pay penalties of up to $100,000. This builds on strong action we've already taken: establishing price caps, establishing reference prices to make it easier to get the best possible deal, and getting more supply of electricity and gas into the marketplace. And we're all doing all of this while we ensure that the grid is reliable, with projects like Snowy 2.0 and Marinus Link, and emissions are coming down. Just in the last year, we've seen domestic emissions in Australia down by 2.3 per cent and, indeed, over three per cent in the electricity market.

            I was asked if there are risks with alternative approaches, and there are. There are risks with having a target without a plan. On Sunday, on
            <i>
             Insiders
            </i>
            , the opposition leader was asked about his target, to which he replied:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            ... if you have a considered plan, over the long-term, you do it in a way which is measured, which is organised, and which transitions you through ...
           </p>
           <p>
            Fine sentiments, indeed. But then, when asked by Speers:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            ... does it also mean ...we’re going to have to do less livestock farming? Are we going to have to eat less meat and consume less dairy?
           </p>
           <p>
            the opposition leader responded:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Oh look David, these things will be worked out on the way through ...
           </p>
           <p>
            They are making it up as they go along. They change their position depending on which town they're in, the day of the week and who they're speaking to. They can agree on anything except a carbon tax. This is not considered by the opposition, it's not measured, it's not disciplined and it's not organised. It is not a plan. The opposition is telling Australians that their future is going to be worked out on the way through.
