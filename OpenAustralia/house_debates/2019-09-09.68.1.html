         I thank the member for New England for his question on this very important issue that is affecting so many Australians at this particular time. I also thank the member for Wright, whom I had the opportunity to speak to on the weekend about how the fires are affecting there, particularly around

         , which has been terribly traumatic for those who have been directly involved. I also spoke to the minister for water resources and other matters in his electorate in southern Queensland. I thank them for their interest in this and the work they've been doing with their communities to support them at this very, very difficult time.

         </a>
         have experienced unprecedented fires since Friday. It is only September, and every indication is that a hot, dry summer is ahead. There are over a hundred fires burning across Queensland and New South Wales. However, those fires that were of greatest concern over Friday and Saturday—the fires at Tenterfield in New South Wales and at Stanthorpe, Applethorpe and Sarabah in Queensland—no longer threaten lives and property, I am pleased to report, on the advice I have. However, the forecast of dry and windy conditions until Tuesday means that the fire situation does remain volatile. Fire danger ratings are 'very high' for north-eastern New South Wales and South-East Queensland.

         Fortunately, no lives were lost, though a

         volunteer firefighter was seriously injured, and is still in recovery, while fighting a fire near Tenterfield. Our thoughts are with him and his family. In terms of property, five houses were destroyed and another five damaged, and 25 non-residential structures have been destroyed in the New South Wales fires. I spoke to the Premier earlier today again about the response and cooperation being provided. I have also been in contact with the Queensland Premier's office; the Premier is currently travelling. In Queensland, 52 houses were damaged, including 15 houses that were completely destroyed. Fire has also destroyed the historic Binna Burra Lodge in the

           New South Wales
          </a>
          . As of 8 am this morning, some 55 fires were still burning in Queensland and 47 across New South Wales. These are the worst fires at this time of the year in some 130 years. Disaster has been declared in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binna_Burra" rel="nofollow">
           Binna Burra
          </a>
          , Canungra and Beechmont. More than 3,600 hectares have burnt in Sarabah, approximately 2,000 of those hectares in Greater Stanthorpe. There have been 17 houses destroyed in Queensland and 24 houses damaged. Eighty-five-year-old Binna Burra Lodge has been extensively damaged. Lush tropical rainforest has been burnt. Conditions, we hope, should ease on Wednesday. Hopefully the worst is behind us, but it certainly is not all over.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is very early in the season, but conditions are dry and there is very little rain forecast over the next four months. Queenslanders are bracing for the most catastrophic fire season in recorded history. I spoke to Premier Palaszczuk on Saturday and certainly offered my support and Labor's support, and I'm sure we are all united in offering support across the parliament to people at this difficult time.
         </p>
         <p>
          In New South Wales five homes have been destroyed. The Armidale fire covers more than 55,000 hectares and has a perimeter of some 100 kilometres. The Shark Creek fire is running out of control, and the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Rural_Fire_Service" rel="nofollow">

          has given an emergency warning. Volunteer firefighter

           Neville Smith
          </a>
          suffered burns while fighting a fire near Tenterfield, in the member for New England's electorate. It's a reminder of the incredible work that not only emergency services workers but also volunteers do at this critical time. He's in a critical but stable condition in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Brisbane_Hospital" rel="nofollow">

          . We send all our best wishes to him and, of course, his family at this difficult time.
         </p>
         <p>
          The opposition stands ready to offer support to whatever the government, through the Prime Minister or the minister responsible, Minister Littleproud, deems worthy. This is a real challenge and at this time of the year points towards an ominous spring and summer coming up. We just hope that the worst of predictions do not come true.
