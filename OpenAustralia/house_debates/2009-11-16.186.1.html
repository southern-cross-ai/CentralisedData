       <p>
        Like many residents of southern Adelaide, I was very pleased to learn that the state government proposed and committed to building an underpass, taking
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Road" rel="nofollow">
         South Road
        </a>
        under Sturt Road at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedford_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Bedford Park
        </a>
        , at a cost of about $140 million. This commitment was made in their 2006 roads policy document

        . Unfortunately, this is one area where

        does not get results. Subsequent media releases were also issued by the federal government minister in September 2008 and in February and July 2009, all saying that funding would contribute towards grade separations along South Road at Sturt Road. The announcement last month of the superway means that residents of southern Adelaide have been short-changed and there is very little money left for the grade separation at Sturt Road and South Road. There is now only $48 million left for a project which four years ago was calculated to cost $140 million. This means that this project has now been pushed out beyond 2014. It is a selling out of the residents of southern Adelaide. They have been short-changed on this and duped by the promises of both the state Labor Party and the federal government. It is very detrimental for residents of Kingston but also for residents of southern suburbs such as Marino,
