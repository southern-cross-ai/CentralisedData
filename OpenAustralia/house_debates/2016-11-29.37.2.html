        My question is to the Prime Minister. An hour ago the Premier of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        confirmed it is the position of his government that negative gearing reforms should be considered. Given that the Premier at the state of the heart of Australia's housing affordability crisis has put negative gearing reform on the table, why does the Prime Minister continue to rule it out, and is getting rich parents still his only policy on housing affordability?

         I think I will check exactly what the Premier said before I take the Leader of the Opposition's word on it. He has a bit of a track record for misrepresentation.

            Yes, he is free to wave around whatever he likes. But the one thing he is not very good at is sticking to the facts. Normally, the glass jaw takes a bit longer to appear than this. I mean, really! Seriously, I think we would all be sensitive to charges of misrepresentation if we were so assiduous at it as the Leader of the Opposition. One day after another, any resemblance between what he says and the truth is a matter of coincidence. It is absolutely a matter of coincidence. I am not saying he is never accurate; I am saying he is only accurate when it suits him—when it suits his own political purpose. We have seen him distort and misrepresent and spread falsehoods on one issue after another.

            It is so touching to see the way he wants to be the ferocious class warrior. Oh yes,

                 No. In fact, while the Manager of Opposition Business is on his feet he might remain on his feet. There is a line here and we are very close to it, so the Manager of Opposition Business can grab that bit of paper back. The Leader of the Opposition has already sought leave to table it. It has been rejected.

                 . The Prime Minister was asked a question about negative gearing but with a preamble and a fairly broad tagline. I am listening to the Prime Minister carefully. He is only about half way through the answer, and I will keep listening to him.

                  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Yes, the Leader of the Opposition, in his unlikely pose as a tribune of the people, a champion of the pressed and the downtrodden—yes, this is the person who stood up for the workers at Chiquita mushrooms, didn't he. He absolutely sold them down the river. And what about Cleanevent and his friend
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cesar_Melhem" rel="nofollow">
                   Cesar Melhem
                  </a>
                  ? Did he ever call up Cesar and say, 'Cesar, that was disgraceful'? No, absolutely not. He is his best friend, champions him, parachutes him into the Victorian parliament. It is competing between Cesar Melhem, who sells workers down the river, takes payments for the union and who was talking about kickbacks yesterday—no doubt, kickbacks were on his mind, when you read what is in the paper about Cesar Melhem being investigated for corrupt practices as recommended by the Heydon commission.

                  But then, of course, not content with promoting Cesar, he comes on Kimberley Kitching and puts her in the Senate. This is somebody who is filling in safety forms, safety examinations, for other people and putting workers' lives at risks. What is her reward? A seat in the Senate from the Labor Party.
