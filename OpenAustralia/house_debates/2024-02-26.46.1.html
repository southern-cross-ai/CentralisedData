        I'd like to talk about a couple of recent outings down in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Vales" rel="nofollow">
         Southern Vales
        </a>
        region of my electorate. The first was to the Aldinga Sharks soccer club. Now, 2023 was a landmark year for the club, in which it completed a comprehensive upgrade of its facilities. I was really pleased to assist the club in landing a $2.2 million federal funding grant to establish the soccer facilities at Aldinga, a very busy and fast-growing part of my electorate. We recently had the season launch, and I was there to hand out bags to all the junior players. It was such a great day. It was wonderful to see such a family affair. I wish all these players all the best for the 2024 season, which kicks off in just a couple of weeks.

        I'd also like to talk about the McLaren Flat Primary School. I recently visited the school to present their flags, and it's a credit to the teaching staff that the students were so knowledgeable about their flags. I was also there to be part of the announcement of their leadership roles. They have five portfolios: sport, environment, wellbeing, performing arts, and social inclusion and community. It gives me such great comfort to know that we have young people who are dedicated and willing to step up and take on leadership roles, and I have no doubt that they will be an absolute asset to the school this year as they serve in those roles, and to our wider community.
