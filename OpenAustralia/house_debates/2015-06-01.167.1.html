       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) recognises that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the Coalition's Economic Growth Plan for Tasmania dated 15 August 2013, committed the Government to creating a Tasmanian Fruit and Vegetable Industry Taskforce focusing on the growth of the fruit and vegetable sectors in Tasmania;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the Taskforce will develop an industry-led plan to promote competitiveness, investment and jobs growth in these sectors; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) the terms of reference prescribing the scope of the Taskforce included reviewing existing work, drawing conclusions and developing a unified and agreed plan for the Tasmanian fruit and vegetable industries to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) increase grower returns and reduce their costs;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) increase competitiveness, investment and jobs growth across the supply chain; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) develop domestic and export markets;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) acknowledges:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the vital importance of the agriculture sector to Tasmania, and for all Tasmanians;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) that Tasmania is an important producer of fruit and vegetables, mainly potatoes, onions, carrots, cherries and other stone fruit, pomefruit and berries;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) that in 2011-12, the gross value production of fruit and nuts in Tasmania was $100.8 million, vegetables $213.4 million, and nursery production (nurseries, cut flowers and cultivated turf) $28.4 million, with Tasmania also being an important producer of the special poppy and pyrethrum crops;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) that in contrast to other states, exporting and direct sales to processors are the predominant sales channels for fresh produce, for example:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) in 2011-12, an estimated 70 per cent of Tasmanian vegetable growers sold their produce directly to a processor (this includes the manufacturing of canned, bottled, preserved, quick frozen or dried vegetable products, dehydrated vegetable products, soups, sauces, pickles and mixed meat and vegetable cereal products, processing and packaging of fresh salads and pan-ready vegetables, as well as bulk packaged and cleaned vegetables); and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) approximately 10 per cent for export, which compares with the national average of 26 per cent and 4 per cent, respectively;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) that in 2011-12 only 5 per cent of Tasmanian vegetable farms reported selling direct to state capital wholesale, compared to the national average of 62 per cent;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) that Tasmania exports significant volumes of onions and cherries, for example:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) in the 12 months to June 2013, it exported $44 million of fresh fruit and vegetables, 6.7 per cent of the total value of national exports of fresh fruit and vegetables, and of this, 98 per cent of the fruit were cherries and 94 per cent of the vegetables were onions,
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) Tasmania accounted for 52 per cent of all cherries and 86 per cent of all onions exported from Australia in 2012-13; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (iii) in 2012 the Australian exports of fresh onions and fresh cherries accounted for 0.9 per cent and 0.4 per cent, respectively, of global exports of these products;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (g) that an independent assessment of the economic development potential of sectors of the Tasmanian economy found that the wine, dairy and aquaculture sectors had the greatest economic development potential;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (h) that horticulture also presents opportunities for growth in employment, though not as great as those in the wine, dairy and aquaculture sectors;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) that the challenges and opportunities faced by Tasmania's fruit and vegetable industry have been well documented and the industry has been subject to many reviews and planning processes; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (j) that, to assist the deliberations of the Taskforce, the Commonwealth Department of Agriculture, as the secretariat to the Taskforce, has identified and summarised a collection of previous work and in so doing, is mindful that individual Taskforce members would be familiar with a number of these documents, in some cases contributing directly to their production; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) notes the continuing importance of investment in the Tasmanian agriculture sector, as a traditional and ongoing source of economic development, including employment, in that state, and one which continues to enjoy a relatively high national and international profile for the reliability and quality of its primary food production.
       </p>
       <p>
        Part of a commitment that was encapsulated within the Economic Growth Plan for Tasmania, which was an election commitment prior to the 2013 election, was the establishment of the Tasmanian Fruit and Vegetable Industry Taskforce, and we have delivered on that commitment. The report was released by Minister Joyce and the parliamentary secretary to the minister, Senator Colbeck, on 1 October 2014. It was a privilege for me to be involved as a member of the government on the task force, and I will endeavour to summarise some of the outcomes of that report here today.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first task was to review the previous reports, and there were numerous reports that have been conducted over the years into the horticultural industry—the fruit and vegetable industries—within Tasmania. But this for the first time summarised all of those documents and highlighted the good work that had been done by many in the past, and that became the starting point. We were not simply reinventing the wheel; we were availing ourselves of that good work that had been done previously. This was indeed an industry-led plan for the sector to promote competitiveness, investment and ultimately—which is the desire of all of us in Tasmania and certainly all of us in this government—jobs growth. The horticultural sector—the fruit and vegetable sector—make an important and valuable contribution to the Tasmanian economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        The task force met three times between May and July 2014. To summarise the vision that came out of the task force, we want a more prosperous Tasmanian fruit and vegetable industry. We outlined the opportunities for Tasmania to be an innovative, profitable and sustainable supplier of fruit and vegetables to the world and to grow the annual sales of same to $750 million by 2020.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the heart of the task force and everybody sitting around the task force in this process was sales. It involved, of course, funding and investment to support that, but key as well are the people involved in the sector, be they research people, producers or processors. It is about understanding our markets. At the end of the day, customers are ultimately the most important people in all of this equation. Like any other business, they are the only people who actually put money in at that end of the chain that feeds back down to the people who grow the things. Of course, innovation is a key part of growing this sector away from the more traditional land uses there.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another recommendation is to establish the Tasmanian Horticulture Market Growth Project, including a facilitator. I am certainly in the ear of the minister and Senator Colbeck every day to make sure that this position is funded and delivers on the expectations of the task force. It was interesting to see the opportunities that have flowed out of the task force. Some of the participants there had looked at exporting as a real opportunity as a result of being part of this task force. Of course, there are some in the fruit sector that are already exporting—for example,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Reid" rel="nofollow">
         Tim Reid
        </a>
        from Reid Fruits. Lucy Gregg was a representative on the task force. As a result of the free trade agreements, they have grown their exports into
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" rel="nofollow">
         South Korea
        </a>
        from five to eight tonnes annually up to 180 tonnes this year—an extraordinary result. People like Houston Farms clearly identified a desire to expand to markets that have a higher yield, because Tasmania enjoys an enormous reputation for high-quality and safe foods from practically the cleanest place on earth.

         <p>
          It is good to have an opportunity to stand up to talk about the importance of the agriculture sector in Tasmania because, as the member for Lyons has talked about, we are having a resurgence in our agriculture sector in Tasmania and our fine produce is being recognised not just in Australia but around the world. Indeed, I wanted to update some of the figures in the motion that the member for Lyons has moved about the agriculture sector in Tasmania because the latest data out for 2012-13 says the gross value of the agriculture sector in Tasmania has now exceeded $1 billion. Milk is about 26 per cent of that and vegetables account for about 20 per cent of that. Interestingly, the figure for the 20 per cent that vegetables account for is $237 million, and of that $120 million is potatoes. Fruit and nuts are about $130 million of that. So they have certainly grown over the last few years and I think that shows the bipartisan investments that have occurred over the last few years in the sector in Tasmania.
         </p>
         <p>
          I particularly want to talk about irrigation in Tasmania when we talk about the agricultural sector and its importance. People may recall that state and federal Labor some time ago set up Irrigation Tasmania. Irrigation Tasmania has been a phenomenal success in identifying appropriate irrigation schemes in the state and then going to state and federal governments to get support for those irrigation schemes.
         </p>
         <p>
          Indeed, state and federal Labor invested more than $220 million in irrigation systems in Tasmania. In 2013 we had on the table two more investments for irrigation in Tasmania. We had $15 million to further the Southern Highlands Irrigation Scheme and we had $9 million for the Dial Blythe as part of our Tasmanian jobs and growth plan. Unfortunately, the $15 million committed 18 months ago for the Southern Highlands Irrigation Scheme was not delivered by the current government. I am pleased to see that it has been delivered now in this budget, where we have seen some extra money for irrigation in Tasmania come from the state and federal Liberal governments. I do support those investments.
         </p>
         <p>
          I am a bit concerned that the funding for this, as confirmed in Senate estimates, has come from freight rail, which is also very important in terms of the future economic development of our state. The money has been taken out of freight rail and put into irrigation, and I am just putting on the record—

           <p>
            That is what the secretary of your department said in Senate estimates. I am concerned because they are both critical investments for our state and both are needed.
           </p>
           <p>
            I would like to highlight that state and federal Labor actually developed an economic development plan for the state that some years ago identified the growth that was going to occur in the state, that growth being in agriculture, aquaculture, viticulture and in dairy. Of course, that is when we then invested in the Tasmanian jobs and growth plan and invested in those industries in our state. Indeed, we invested in programs at the Longford strawberry farm. We invested in projects for dairy's sustainable development on the north-west coast. We invested with Reid Fruits so they could get a sorter to get more of their cherries to market faster. We invested in organic juices with Juicy Isle. We invested in
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_Moon" rel="nofollow">
             Harvest Moon
            </a>
            , Greenham, blue onions, Costas—a whole range of investments—because these industries are important to our state and do deserve bipartisan support. They have had that from state and federal Labor in the past, and I would like to see that continue.
           </p>
           <p>
            We also, of course, invested in funding of a gas extension from Port Latta to Smithton to help reduce business costs for Tasmanian dairy products.
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCain" rel="nofollow">
             McCain
            </a>
            and Greenham are also very important companies for which Labor announced that investment some time ago, so it is good to see that that has been delivered. These investments, as I said, do need to be bipartisan, and it is good to see people actually recognising the critical investments that are required and the long-term strategy of investments that are needed for these sectors to grow. I am sure that the following speaker from our side will talk more about the long-term stuff that is required for this such as an agriculture white paper, for which we have now been waiting more than six months.

            <p>
             I congratulate the member for Lyons for this excellent motion. As he has so eloquently explained, the future of Tasmania and agriculture are very closely tied indeed. It is therefore my great pleasure to champion this reality on behalf of the state that I am so privileged to partly represent.
            </p>
            <p>
             Let me first of all acknowledge that industries like mining and forestry have made a major contribution to Tasmania's prosperity and will play an important part into the future. But it is also important to acknowledge that greater economic diversification is the key to fewer economic bumps in the road. In the case of Tasmania the twin pillars of agriculture and tourism will add strength and diversity to our state's future wellbeing. Investment in state agriculture in particular has a disproportionately positive effect on Tasmania and mainland Australia. That is why the Abbott government has recently committed another $60 million to tranche 2 irrigation schemes.
            </p>
            <p>
             Tasmania is an important producer of a wide variety of fruit and vegetables—mainly potatoes, onions, carrots, cherries and other stone fruit, pome fruit and berries—and I note the important contribution to gross state product of fruit, nuts, vegetables, nursery products and special poppy and pyrethrum crops, as the member for Lyons has mentioned. Moreover, in contrast to other states, exporting and direct sales to processors are the predominant sales channels for fresh produce. For example, in 2011-12 an estimated 70 per cent of Tasmanian vegetable growers sold their produce directly to a processor, with approximately 10 per cent for export. This compares most favourably with a national average of 26 per cent direct sales to processors and four per cent for export. In the 12 months to June 2013, Tasmania also exported $44 million worth of fresh fruit and vegetables or 6.7 per cent of the total value of Australian national exports of fresh fruit and vegetables—and that is not bad for a state comprising just over two per cent of the national population. It is certainly an example of a state punching above its weight.
            </p>
            <p>
             I note also that an independent assessment of the economic development potential of sectors of the Tasmanian economy found that the wine, dairy and aquaculture sectors have the greatest economic development potential. All of this attests to the reality that, with the right support and attitude, Tasmanian agriculture produces both abundant and reliable harvests. The irrigation schemes the member for Lyons has talked about are going to produce 95 per cent water certainty. They are going to allow for the conversion of marginal land, currently not of much use for any other purpose, into something far more productive. That is something we should very much welcome.
            </p>
            <p>
             The coalition has long recognised the overall importance of state-based agriculture, and has acted practically and constructively for the benefit of both Tasmanians and mainland Australians. The member for Lyons has mentioned the coalition's economic growth plan for Tasmania, which was announced by the Prime Minister on 15 August 2013. It is a clear, unequivocal commitment by the coalition government to create a fruit and vegetable industry task force, focusing specifically on the growth of the fruit and vegetable sectors in Tasmania. The task force is acting to develop an industry-led plan to promote competitiveness, investment and jobs growth in these sectors. The terms of reference for the task force will result in the development of a unified and agreed plan for the Tasmanian fruit and vegetable industries, designed to achieve three things: to increase grower returns and reduce their costs; to increase competitiveness, investment and jobs growth across the supply chain; and to develop domestic and export markets.
            </p>
            <p>
             In closing, I call on the parliament to note the continuing importance and vibrancy of the Tasmanian food and agriculture sector. But, most importantly, I can advise the House of the Abbott government's steadfast determination to continue nurturing this immense potential by continuing to invest in it. Doing so will not only create local jobs but will further support Tasmania's economic prosperity. It will also continue to support Tasmania's relatively high national and international profile for the reliability and quality of its primary food production, which in turn will have flow-on benefits for all Australians and for those to whom we export. I commend the member for Lyons' motion to the House.

             <p>
              There is no doubt that Tasmania is a state and an island in economic transition. That transition has been taking place for some time now, and there is no doubt that transition has created some economic and social pain in the island state. It must be true that, if Australia has a significant opportunity feeding the growing middle classes of Asia, then Tasmania must also have before it an enormous opportunity—maybe more than most. I am sure all of us in this debate this morning will agree that the best way for Tasmania to make the most of those opportunities is for us all to be working together, in harmony, in the best interests of those who live in Tasmania.
             </p>
             <p>
              Tasmania, more than anything, needs a plan—a strategic plan for agriculture generally and, of course, a strategic plan for its fruit and vegetable industry. Indeed, Australia needs a plan. It has become more and more apparent in the last half-a-dozen years that, if we are to make the most of those opportunities in Asia, industry—which will, in the end, produce the wealth and the jobs, not government—will need strategic direction and strategic guidance from the government of the day.
             </p>
             <p>
              That is why the former Labor government produced this very comprehensive document—the National Food Plan—which is designed to both set objectives and goals for the future and where we might need to be in terms of output, productivity and profitability out to 2025 and set forward how we as a nation might get there. We also did a lot of work on the
              <i>
               Feeding the future
              </i>
              report, with a focus on the relationship between Australia's agriculture sector and that in China and, indeed, how we might work together to address the looming global food shortage. It focused on how China and Australia, including Tasmania, might work together to ensure that, as we grow to nine billion people, we do not face increases in starvation around the globe. We started that process in government. The Asian century white paper was also a significant component of that ongoing work in developing a national plan.
             </p>
             <p>
              The National Food Plan included a commitment that it be reviewed every five years so that we could keep our eye on the ball, move with the times and stick to those objectives. Unfortunately, since the election of the Abbott government—

                Oh, sorry—they did finish Labor's very good work on the free trade agreement, although there are some matters to be tested there on the net proposition.

                On 13 August 2013, during the election campaign, those opposite announced a policy. Their policy was to form a committee. This is what this debate is about today. In March 2014, the now minister,
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barnaby_Joyce" rel="nofollow">
                 Barnaby Joyce
                </a>
                , announced the committee six months after the election. The committee was a little bit more productive. I congratulate the quality people on the committee for all their work. They were a bit more proficient. They delivered their report just under six months after the event.
               </p>
               <p>
                But now, 10 months on, the government is still sitting on the report. This is what we are trying to acknowledge today. Whilst this motion at first glance seems to be about Tasmania and fruit and vegetables in particular, it is really a motion to cover up for the fact that 20 months into this government we have had a committee and a report and nothing else.
               </p>

                We hear about the agriculture white paper. It was supposed to be delivered before Christmas last year. Here we are in June and the clock is ticking and we are still waiting. In the meantime, our competitors are on the march, improving their market access—

                      The reality is that they had six years to deliver an enhancement to help the exporters of Tasmania to get the greatest produce in this country to some of the greatest markets in the world—and they failed to do it. I take on board the comments of the member for Franklin—who also gave due credit to Tasmanian Irrigation, who have done a great job. There has been some degree of bipartisanship there. And we have just delivered $60 million towards five projects that will greatly enhance the productivity levels in Tasmania.

                      reflect, just for a moment, on some of the great stories that are coming out of the agricultural sector in my electorate. The week before last, I attended an amazing opening of an amazing facility: a specialty cheese facility built by Lion in the heart of the city of Burnie. That represents $150 million of investment—I have never seen more stainless steel in my life! It is the biggest such facility in the southern hemisphere. They are voting with their dollars in the confidence they have in the region. The great dairy products that are being produced out of my electorate in Braddon are something to behold. There is also the great story about Costa in my electorate and the way in which they are advancing their cause into the markets—into the local markets, but also having an eye to export markets in the near future with some of the funds that we have invested; where they can keep much greater stocks of berries and sell them into a market where the seasonal conditions are not there. I want to pay particular attention to

                      , who are doing everything they can to resurrect their own local economy in the midst of the Tasmanian economy—and they are doing a great job. International investors are showing tremendous appetites for what is going on in that part of the world, and great confidence. Can I also talk about the reality of the reduction of red tape for producers—we are getting out of their way. I will also say that we are now offering a great opportunity, through the budget of just a few weeks ago, to these small businesses—called farms. We have 3,600-odd farms in the state of Tasmania: whilst we may only have two per cent of the country's population, we have over three per cent of the country's farms. That is a great credit to the people of Tasmania.

I noticed the member over there—he is a delightful member of the opposition—he was using some sorts of movements over there a moment ago, about winding it in; I will tell you what we are winding in—we are winding in free trade agreements! That is what we winding in. And Tasmania is well placed to take full advantage of them.

                        <p>
                         The member for Franklin is right about one thing: that there really needs to be a bipartisan, or maybe a multipartisan, approach to the Tasmanian economy. We would make more progress. It is refreshing though, to see a consensus of sorts this morning.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         I am sure we would all agree that agriculture is vitally important to Tasmania. In some ways, it is our mining boom. When we look forward, into the future and at what is happening the rest of the world, there is an endless appetite for the wonderful produce of our home state. In particular, as the world becomes more affluent, and as the middle class grows, it will be our mining boom. So it is good to see that some very positive things have been done to capitalise on that mining boom. The irrigation work is first-rate, and that will pay big dividends over time. So too, the $202.9 million in the budget to assist international exporters is a good thing, and I applaud the government for going down that path; I want to see more, but that is a good first step. I have got to give a plug for my neighbours, the Wolfe brothers, who live across the road. The Wolfe brothers are famous in southern Tasmania for the quality of their berries and other fruits—undoubtedly the best berry farmers in the state—however, we are kidding ourselves if we think the job is done or almost done, because there are so many other things that we can do in this place to let Tasmanian farmers realise their potential. There are so many environmental and commercial risks that we have within our power to address.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         One environmental threat is fracking. To the state government's credit, they have put in place another moratorium on fracking, but we really need a permanent ban in Tasmania. And I also say to the federal government: we need a permanent ban across the whole country. There is widespread concern about the way it tramples on farmers' rights, the way it contaminates water, the way it has gone wrong overseas. One thing we could do in this place is put a permanent ban on fracking. Another thing we could do in this place is put a permanent ban on oversized freezer factory vessels. The fact is that the super trawler

                          Geelong Star
                         </i>
                         is another thing that puts Tasmania's reputation at risk.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         There are so many commercial threats. I notice the member for Braddon has made much of the fact of the government's free trade agreements. That is all well and good, but it does appear that the
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPP" rel="nofollow">
                          TPP
                         </a>
                         still includes investor-state dispute resolution provisions. That is a threat to Tasmania. What happens if Monsanto takes the Tasmanian government to court over our

                        </p>
                        <p>
                         I hope everyone would agree there is still so much more we can do on
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_Strait" rel="nofollow">
                          Bass Strait
                         </a>
                         too. I have given credit to the government—$202.9 million to assist international exporters—but, frankly, the job will not be done until we have an effective subsidy for all people, vehicles and freight in and out of the state to bring the cost of crossing Bass Strait down to the cost of moving a similar distance on the mainland. That is what is needed, and until we achieve that we will not have cracked Bass Strait.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         I tell you what the federal government could do, and I was pleased that the Prime Minister spoke positively about this when I asked a question of him the other day in the House, either it or the state government has to take the Victorian government to task over the port licence fee. The fact is the Victorian government requires the
                         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_of_Melbourne" rel="nofollow">
                          Port of Melbourne
                         </a>
                         to pay $75 million a year to the Victorian state government as a port licence fee—and it is indexed, so it is going up. That is clearly a tax on interstate trade when money is recouped from any goods in and out of that state to or from Tasmania. So until the federal government or the Tasmanian state government—two Liberal governments—muscle up and are prepared to deal with this, there will still be this unconstitutional tax on interstate trade. I am talking about the Tasmanian state government needing to take the Victorian government to court. Or perhaps the federal government could intervene, so there is another role.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         Yes, I have given credit where it is due—I try to do that—but I have also laid out some serious threats and risks to the Tasmanian rural sector, which we have within our power to address: ban fracking, ban super trawlers, get rid of investor-state dispute resolution provisions from the TPP and fix Bass Strait. Those are the sorts of things we must do if we are to unlock the potential in our great state, and in particular our great rural sector.

                         <p>
                          I rise to speak on the motion moved by the member for Lyons. This is a matter of importance to all of us, and particularly to those of us from regional areas. We understand how important the issues like this are.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The points raised in this motion before the House by the member for Lyons are indeed valid: growth plans for the regions are a very, very good thing, and Labor certainly recognises that. But the member's motion today is an attempt to try to claim some sort of credit or to create a smokescreen that the Abbott government has actually done something so far for the Tasmanian fruit and vegetable industries. In reality, this motion does not say much about what the government has done except that it set up another task force, which came up with the eight recommendations.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The eight recommendations are not surprising, and acknowledge there has been a large amount of research already undertaken into how to further grow the fruit and vegetable sectors in Tasmania. I support the member for Lyon's sentiments in that the continuing importance of investment in the Tasmanian agriculture sector remains a traditional and sustainable source of economic development. So Labor recognise, and we have heard the speakers say this today, that agriculture in Tasmania is vitally important. As the member for Lyons points out in this motion before the House, in 2011-12 alone, the gross value production of fruit and nuts in Tasmania was over $100 million and vegetables over $213 million. Indeed, Tasmania is an important producer of fruit and vegetables, and we acknowledge how important agriculture is to sustaining the economy, particularly the Tasmanian economy.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The previous, Labor government recognised the importance of agriculture through strategic and long-term investments. They included our massive irrigation investments throughout Tasmania, which have resulted in increased production, security of supply and value-adding opportunities. The previous state and federal Labor governments also invested $220 million in 10 critical schemes across the state which are now enabling thousands of new jobs across Tasmania. In 2013, we committed $15 million to the Southern Highlands Irrigation Scheme, which would have secured a viable and sustainable water supply. This was of course abandoned by the current government. But we on this side of the House will continue to show bipartisan support for investment in irrigation in Tasmania, which is why we have been supporting the government's recent announcement of new irrigation infrastructure, building on the good work of the previous, Labor government. But it is very disappointing that, as the Department of Infrastructure and Regional Development told Senate estimates recently, the Abbott government had chosen to use a $60 million cut to rail projects in Tasmania to pay for new irrigation projects in Tasmania. That is quite a disgrace.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The member for Lyons also speaks in his motion of the economic development potential of industries such as wine, dairy and aquaculture. In fact, it was the previous, Labor government that made significant strategic investments across Tasmania to ensure that we supported these emerging industries. Through more than a dozen investments, we unlocked significant jobs growth. These investments in Tasmania included $3.5 million for Huon Aquaculture to expand its Parramatta Creek factory and expand employment or the north-west coast—and I understand the factory will be open soon. What a fantastic achievement.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Another fantastic aquaculture project is by Tasmanian company Tassal. This company also secured funding under the same Labor jobs and growth program to help build a new factory. Another investment through the Tasmanian Jobs and Growth Plan was $400,000 for the Into Dairy Sustainable Dairy Development Project, supporting the state's dairy industry and creating 550 new full-time jobs—a great achievement.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          The Tasmanian fruit and vegetable industry, like all agricultural industries, is seeking certainty and long-term policy settings, something the Abbott government promised before the last election but that just did not happen. This is another broken promise by the Abbott government, as farmers and industry await the long-expected agriculture white paper.

                         <p>
                          Well, we are still waiting. The white paper process so far has cost the taxpayer over $3 million and, quite frankly, appears to be on the never-never now. This is really disappointing. We have repeatedly seen the coalition and especially the Nationals continuing to abandon, in so many ways, regional Australia, which is calling out for this white paper that never appears.
                         </p>
                         <p>
                          Labor acknowledge there is great potential for the fruit and vegetable industry in Tasmania; however, that requires genuine policy settings, not just a task force review which is yet to apply any practical measures on the ground. That is what we want to see. I also believe it is time that the Liberal-National government stopped taking credit for the great work of their Labor predecessors in Tasmania and started acknowledging the fact that Labor have a proud and strong record in agriculture, not just in Tasmania but right throughout the nation.
