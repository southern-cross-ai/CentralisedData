        Last week I joined our community to farewell a remarkable Australian. Aunty Mary Hooker passed away on 30 September 2019. Her funeral was held on the banks of Lake Windamere last Friday afternoon. Aunty Mary endured more than her fair share of hardship during her life. She suffered sexual abuse at the hands of a family member. One of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stolen_Generations" rel="nofollow">
         Stolen Generations
        </a>
        , she was forcibly removed from her family as a child. She was sent to the now infamous Ormond Training School at Thornleigh and then to Parramatta Girls Training School. As the royal commission into child sexual abuse was to hear, they were places of evil, where horrific crimes were committed. Aunty Mary was adamant that the nation know of these crimes, and she never gave up the quest to bring the criminals responsible to justice. She was courageous and determined that the truth be told. Her evidence to the royal commission shocked Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yet, despite having gone through all of this and more, she refused to be consumed by hatred. In fact her life was marked by the love and compassion that she showed to others. A proud Bundjalung woman, she loved the Indigenous communities of Australia and was a strong advocate for Indigenous health and the vision-impaired. She was committed to reconciliation and bringing Australians together.

        I was privileged to spend time with Aunty Mary here at

        during the National Apology to Victims and Survivors of Institutional Child Sexual Abuse in October last year. A photograph of the moment she met the Prime Minister on the lawns of parliament that day was to take pride of place in her home.

       <p>
        Aunty Mary was a woman of faith who lived the values she believed in. She loved her family and was extremely proud of all that they had achieved. She also loved Elvis and country music and had a terrific sense of humour. She was a talented artist. The achievements of her life were simply extraordinary. She inspired us and she was my friend. Aunty Mary made our community and our country a better place.
       </p>
       <p>
        She had a turbulent and traumatic early life, and the peace and tranquillity of

        is a beautiful and fitting place for Aunty Mary to rest. Our condolences to her husband, Rodney, and also to Alan and Heather, Sarah, Chris, Tracey, Violet, Dylan, Darren, Jackson and Corey. Farewell, Aunty Mary. Those of us who had the privilege of knowing you will never forget you.
