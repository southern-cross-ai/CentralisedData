        at the age of 80. Satts was the toughest person that has ever walked onto a rugby league field, but he was an absolute gentleman off the field. He had a magnificent playing record: 195 games for Souths. He played in six grand finals and won four premierships as captain: 1967, 1968, 1970 and 1971. He famously played 77 minutes of the 1970 grand final against Manly with a broken jaw, pushing his bottom jaw back into place and clamping down with his mouthguard to just keep it there. He represented, prior to

        . He was captain of Australia. He was a leader who made his teammates walk taller. For all the courage and inspiration he provided in the front row during his career, he showed that same determination when he was one of the leaders of the marches through Sydney to

        He was a gentle and a generous person. One of my deeply cherished mementos that I found when I was moving house after last May was my autograph book with the signature from John Sattler. I've now had a look at the date, in 1970, when he went, as many sportspeople do, to the local school,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Joseph's" rel="nofollow">

        , Camperdown, for the presentation of trophies. You've got to remember, Mr Speaker, that these people were paid almost nothing. They worked full time. They had to work so hard. But he was greatly respected, he was deeply loved and he will be long remembered.
       </p>
       <p>
        I pay my sympathy, as well, to his family, including, of course,

        , who followed in his footsteps and took a memorable tackle in the grand final for Penrith all those years ago. He will be missed. I pay tribute to him today—to a legend who bled red and green or, more accurately, cardinal and myrtle.

         epitomised what sport is all about in Australia. He was as tough as nails on the field, and in that premiership of 1970 he stoically played on after his jaw was broken, as the Prime Minister pointed out and as has been graphically detailed in the newspapers. It was stomach-turning to read it in the newspapers this morning, Prime Minister, and I could hear some stomachs churning on the other side as you went into some of the detail, so I'll spare further detail. But he was seemingly immune to pain. He stayed on after the siren to give a speech. He received cheering, roars and applause from the crowd, but he took no prisoners himself. His style of play earned him 15 send-offs and 30 weeks of suspension. There are some in this chamber who go close to that record, but not quite.

         He captained Souths for four premierships and led the Kangaroos on three occasions. He was rightly named in the 100 greatest players list. He was a giant of his era. He helped rugby league become the great game that it is today. Importantly, off the field he was known as Gentleman John—a man who stayed loyal to his beloved

         until he tragically lost his toughest battle, with dementia, on Monday at the age of 80. It's an opportunity to give a shout-out to all of those families who are going through the same torture with that evil disease for somebody that they love.
        </p>
        <p>
         Our sporting champions are heroes to many. Many Australians lost a hero this week. On behalf of the coalition: we remember a man who was mighty on and off the field. Our thoughts are with John's family and friends and all those who support the beloved Rabbitohs.
