        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to reports that the Prime Minister has made a captain's call to support an effects test and to put the National Party in charge of water policy as part of a new dirty deal with the National Party. Is this what 'traditional cabinet government' and 'making decisions in a thoughtful and considered manner' looks like?

         Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I hate to interrupt the flow of question time, but today the opposition has made the same mistake again and again of not making their questions fit within the standing orders. The Prime Minister is more than happy to answer questions on a whole range of issues, but he cannot answer questions on a hypothetical matter. He is not required to answer questions about internal party matters. This question goes to internal party matters, hypothetical matters and things that have not even been reported in the press. Therefore, the question is out of order and cannot be rewritten.

           Mr Speaker, on the point of order, questions go to ministers in the area of their responsibility. There is only one person in this House responsible for ministerial appointments, and he sits in that chair opposite. He is the only person to whom that question can be asked.

            <p>
             Mr Speaker, one of the reasons this question is hypothetical is that the current ministerial arrangements are all entirely in place until they are changed by some potential reshuffle down the track. So asking about ministerial arrangements that have not even been canvassed is obviously hypothetical. If the opposition want to ask a question about a specific matter within the responsibilities of the Prime Minister, I am sure he will deal with it. But this is not such a question. Therefore, it should be ruled out of order.

               Mr Speaker, the matter that the question refers to has been reported. It is public. Apparently, the Leader of the House is unaware of it, but, apparently, there is a full agreement between the new leader of the Liberal Party and the National Party. It goes to the machinery of government for which the Prime Minister is responsible.

                   My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to reports on

                    ABC Rural

                   at 3.32 pm today that the Prime Minister has done a deal with the National Party to introduce an effects test and give the National Party responsibility for water policy. Are these reports accurate?

                    <p>
                     Mr Speaker, your patience with the opposition as they try to frame an acceptable question is really admirable. The honourable member will be well aware that any decision about amending the Competition and Consumer Act relating to the so-called effects test will be a decision of the cabinet. That is not a decision that is made by me as Prime Minister. It would be a decision by the cabinet. In terms of machinery of government, whichâ€”the honourable member is rightâ€”is a responsibility of the Prime Minister, ministerial arrangements will be reviewed and announced later in the week or early next week.
