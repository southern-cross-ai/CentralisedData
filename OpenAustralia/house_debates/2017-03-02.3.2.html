        155â€”Enhanced Gap Crossing Capability Facilities project.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Defence is proposing to build new and upgraded facilities to support the sustainment and maintenance of, and training in, the enhanced gap crossing capability at four locations across Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project will deliver facilities and infrastructure at Wallangarra and Townsville, in Queensland; Darwin, in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory

        for deployment on operations to enhance Australia's security.
       </p>
       <p>
        The estimated cost to deliver the project is $23.38 million, excluding

        The Department of Defence is proposing to upgrade the infrastructure in the Australian Signals Directorate's premises in Canberra,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Capital_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Capital Territory
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian Signals Directorate maintains operations 24 hours per day, seven days per week to provide signals intelligence and information security to the Australian government and the Australian Defence Force. The base building engineering infrastructure, particularly mechanical and electrical engineering services, has reached the end of life and is performing inefficiently. This has increased running costs, maintenance costs and downtime, and there is an increasing risk of the failure of the systems supporting the critical Australian Signals Directorate capability.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project will deliver reliable and efficient services which are fit for purpose and compliant, and provide value for money to support the mission-critical operational requirements of the Australian Signals Directorate for the next 20 years. The proposed works encompass a number of specific elements of the engineering services, including mechanical, electrical, hydraulic, fire protection and control systems. The proposal also includes reconfiguration of the main foyer and upgrades to the security systems to address functionality and compliance.
       </p>
       <p>
        The estimated cost to deliver the project is $75.4 million, excluding GST. This includes management and design fees; temporary facility costs; construction costs; information communication technology; furniture, fittings and equipment; design and construction contingencies; and an allowance for escalation. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is scheduled to commence in mid-2017, with completion anticipated by mid-2020. I commend the motion to the House.

        (East), Critical Infrastructure Recovery Program, Sydney.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Defence is proposing to upgrade two existing wharves at Garden Island in Sydney.
       </p>
       <p>
        Stage 1 of the Garden Island Critical Infrastructure Recovery Program will address severe condition and capacity issues with the existing cruiser and oil wharves. The cruiser wharf has deteriorated to the point that it is now fenced off to restrict pedestrian access, and cannot be used to conduct critical ship maintenance activities or berth ships, except in low-wind conditions. The proposed works involve demolishing the existing cruiser and oil wharves and rebuilding them as a single wharf in a new alignment. It is also proposed to extend an adjoining wharf to reduce the new, realigned wharf's protrusion into
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
         Sydney Harbour
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The new realigned wharf will be equipped with a new crane; engineering services, including electricity and water; and wharf furniture, including ladders and fenders. These works will enable more maintenance work to be conducted away from residential areas, reducing the noise and visual impacts. This capital investment in infrastructure at Garden Island will bring economic benefits to the local New South Wales economy, with opportunities for local subcontractors over three years. That will be good for small business.
       </p>
       <p>
        The estimated cost to deliver the project is $213.4 million, excluding GST. This includes construction costs, escalation allowances, professional service fees, design, and construction and design contingencies. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is scheduled to commence in mid-2017 and is expected to be completed by late 2020. I commend the motion to the House.
