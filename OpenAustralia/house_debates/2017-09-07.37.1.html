        I would like to congratulate members of the Cairns Rifle Club for their outstanding gold medal wins at the world championships in Canada last month. Marty Lobert,

        and Steven Lazarus were all part of the winning Australian F-class rifle team. This is back-to-back gold for these men, and this has never been done before by any country in the team event. Australia won gold at the same event in the world championships at Raton in

        four years ago. Thirteen countries competed this year, including America, Germany,

        and Ukraine. Each team is made up of 17 people firing 720-scoring shots over two days. The rifles used by the Cairns representatives were seven-millimetre SAUMs, short-action ultramagnums, that weigh around 10 kilos each.

        from the Cairns Rifle Club won gold for the individual event. These men are incredible. They practice most weekends at Wangetti Beach rifle range north of Cairns. They travel around the globe carrying a multitude of gear and reloading on site, which is very taxing and costly for them. They are self-funded; they don't receive any government support, unlike so many other sports. Still, they are world champions. Congratulations, Marty, Peter, Steven and Rod. Cairns is very much punching above its weight in this sport because of you. I just want to say thank you very much indeed and well done for what you have achieved. We are very, very proud of your achievements.
