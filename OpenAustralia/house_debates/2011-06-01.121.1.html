        I rise this morning to thank and pay tribute to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Evelyn" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        community who last week, like many other communities, hosted a morning tea for the Cancer Council of Australia. They raised approximately $2,500; they served Devonshire tea and scones at the event, held at Mount Evelyn Station House last Thursday, 28 May. The event was supported by the Mount Evelyn Chamber of Commerce, the Mount Evelyn branch of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bendigo_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         Bendigo Bank
        </a>
        , Morrisons and many other local businesses in the Mount Evelyn community. Over 50 local businesses contributed to the morning tea, and the major raffle prize had in excess of $1,000 worth of donated goods or services. Over 200 people attended throughout the morning. There were 230 cups of coffee and tea sold courtesy of the Functional Beverage Co. In addition, many locals dropped in on the day to also donate raffle prizes—including a lady who walked up on the morning and donated a patchwork quilt for the raffle because she had lost her husband to cancer.

        The committee coordinated students—predominantly
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCAL" rel="nofollow">

        students and high school students—to serve the food, do the face painting and provide beauty services such as nail polish for the patrons, for a gold coin donation. A special mention must go to Meaghan Grace from the Functional Beverage Co., who gave up her time to coordinate the event. The Functional Beverage Co. is based in Mount Evelyn and was founded by Meaghan Grace and Garrick Hicks in 2007. The company donated all the profits from the sale of their certified organic teas on the morning. As I mentioned, many local businesses contributed to the morning tea—too many to mention here with the time restrictions we have. I would like to thank each and every one of them for their generosity.

        At the same time as this morning tea was occurring in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt_Evelyn" rel="nofollow">
         Mt Evelyn
        </a>
        , 114 people were attending another morning tea hosted by Jan and Norman Bettess from Wesburn. They raised $6,500—the fourth biggest morning tea they have organised. I want to also take the time to pay tribute to them for their effort and their community service in organising their wonderful event. It would not have been possible, they have said, without the help of family and friends and many local businesses as well. Jan did not want to single anyone out but I do want to pay tribute to her and to Norm and to all of those who contributed to that wonderful event on the same day.
