        My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure. Is the Deputy Prime Minister considering abandoning his support for the government's $80 billion handout to big business so he can actually allocate funds for the

         I thank the shadow minister for his question. One thing I'll say about the Nationals is that, when we say something, we put our names to it. We're backing the tax plan of the government.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberal" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         government—are backing the tax plan of the government. And I'll tell you why we're backing it: because it's a blueprint for our economic future. It's a 10-year enterprise tax plan just like we've got a 10-year infrastructure investment pipeline. There is $75 billion in investing in the infrastructure that this country needs, that Australians want, demand, expect and deserve. That's what we're doing.
        </p>
        <p>
         But I'll just go back to his little point about the newspaper article today and I'll say again that, at least when National Party members make a comment to the press, they put their name to it. I tell you what: we often hear shadow ministers, Labor sources and Left sources making comments about the leadership of the man opposite—the leadership of the member for Maribyrnong. And do you know why? Because he's on borrowed time, and the member who asked the question knows it because he's going to be the biggest beneficiary when the member for Maribyrnong falls over. But I say again that the Nationals and the Liberals are in lock step with the tax plan.

               , who run Warehouse Cafe in Bunbury, in the member for Forrest's electorate. She's right behind it because she knows that the tax reduction that she's going to get is going to help her business, just like the instant asset write-off. Another is Rick Casagrande of Hotweld Engineering in Bunbury, in the member for Forrest's electorate. There are a whole host of them. Warners Fine Jewellery in Bundaberg, in the member for Hinkler's electorate, is another. They're all behind the Ten Year Enterprise Tax Plan. Jason McPherson of

              </p>
              <p>
               When it comes to more jobs, there's no way better of doing it than the Liberals and Nationals' Ten Year Enterprise Tax Plan. We've achieved, through the help of small and medium family enterprises and big business, a million jobs in less than five years. We said we'd do it in five years. We achieved it five months early—because that's what we do. We've got a plan; we're creating jobs; we're lowering taxes. All these opposite stand for is more taxes and fewer jobs.

                    Even the member for Griffith is yelling and she hasn't even got a voice, Mr Speaker! The

                    Road interchange upgrade is a $120 million Commonwealth commitment to a new six-lane overpass. It increases safety; it reduces travel times; there will be less congestion. This is a congestion-busting budget, championed by the member for Petrie. He's getting on with the job, just like all Liberal-Nationals are doing. The Deception Bay project is part of a wider package of works on the

                    , where we've just committed funding to section D. I know how much that means to the member for

                    and, moreover, the people he represents. Our commitment is now up to $10 billion, a historic amount. Communities along the entire Bruce will benefit from our record $75 billion 10-year pipeline of investment. This is nation-building infrastructure, building our future, boosting productivity and creating local jobs—50,000 direct and indirect jobs, including in communities in Longman, where a substantial part of the more than $1.4 billion

                    to Caloundra Road interchange upgrade will be built. It's a 60-kilometre corridor and the most heavily trafficked section of the Bruce Highway. This funding is going to create hundreds of jobs in that particular region, improving travel times, flood immunity, road standards and, of course, safety.

                    We've also committed to rail development in Queensland, particularly the Beerburrum to Nambour rail upgrade to the north of Longman, which is set to benefit—

                    I hear team Queensland saying 'Hear, hear!' The members for Fisher and Fairfax are right behind it, as all Queenslanders should be, including the member for Griffith, who has lost her voice. Long called for, won by team Queensland and

                    I'm asked what the alternatives are. Well, it's the banana republic over there on the opposition side, who build absolutely nothing anywhere near anything. What they stand for is higher taxes and fewer jobs.
