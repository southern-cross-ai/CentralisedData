            I do thank the member for Cowper for his question. He knows, as all of us do, that the jobs figures were very good today. They're strengthening, they're being bolstered and they're doing that on the back of the infrastructure that we're rolling out across this nation. Whether it's on the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid_North_Coast" rel="nofollow">

            of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
             New South Wales
            </a>
            or wherever, we've got the infrastructure programs and projects happening right now: workers on the ground, shovels in the ground. They're building the infrastructure that local communities need, want, expect, demand and deserve.
           </p>
           <p>
            Communities know that there is a need for immediate and direct and ongoing funding for these programs—for local roads, for local infrastructure and for local communities—which then provides, of course, local jobs. Part of the government's economic stimulus to our recovery from the global pandemic is the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program. Now, with the Roads to Recovery top-up mid last year, this is providing a huge boost to communities right across the country—and certainly in Cowper, where 30 major community projects across five councils have been funded to support local jobs and local communities.

           <p>
            Bellingen council received $1.3 million as part of these upgrades.

            received $2.7 million.

            -Hastings Council, which extends into the member for Lyne's electorate, $5.2 million. I see the member for Lyne nodding. He also knows how important this funding is for local jobs. Indeed, Coffs Harbour mayor Denise Knight welcomed the funding for her local government area:

            for this further investment in our region.
           </p>
           <p>
            Councillor Knight knows how important it is for these local jobs to happen on the back of the local funding that we are putting into that fine city.
           </p>
           <p>
            Every council in Australia, all 537 of them, is benefiting, is receiving a share of the $1.5 billion of Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program funding, putting direct stimulus where it's needed. In every corner of this nation, we are getting on with the job of making sure that those jobs figures, as the Treasurer talked about earlier, are going to be further bolstered by this stimulus, by this ongoing and direct funding. The

            is creating jobs—indeed, 10,000 jobs. It's a good program, creating local jobs and benefiting local communities.
