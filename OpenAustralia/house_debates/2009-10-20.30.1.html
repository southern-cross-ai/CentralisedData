        Mr Speaker, with your indulgence: during the course of question time I had a discussion with the member for Capricornia and with the Attorney-General on the question of the bushfires in Rockhampton. I take this opportunity to advise the House that the Attorney-General today announced that the Commonwealth government will provide disaster assistance to communities affected by recent bushfires in Queensland. This follows declaration by the Queensland government of Bundaberg, Maranoa,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Burnett" rel="nofollow">

        and Rockhampton regional council areas as disaster areas. Currently there are a total of 36 fire incidents in Queensland, with over 310 personnel involved. A

        unit and an

         Ambulance Service
        </a>
        of New South Wales unit have been deployed to Queensland. All available fire crews in the

        </a>
        area are engaged in property protection at Norman Gardens. Three aircraft are also conducting water-bombing activities behind houses in the area. Fire is expected to impact the Norman Gardens and Frenchville areas today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Commonwealth assistance is being provided to the Queensland government through the Natural Disaster Relief and Recovery Arrangements. Funding will include assistance for the restoration of essential public infrastructure and relief operations, as well as personal hardship and distress assistance including emergency assistance payments of $170 per person and up to $780 per family; essential household contents grants of $1,660 per individual and up to $4,980 per couple or family; essential repairs to housing grants of up to $10,250 per individual and up to $13,800 per couple or family; concessional loans of up to $250,000 to eligible primary producers who have suffered physical loss as a result of the bushfires; and freight subsidies of up to $5,000 to assist with the cost of transporting livestock, fodder or water, and building or fencing equipment or machinery.
       </p>
       <p>
        Inquiries in relation to personal hardship and distress assistance should be made to the Queensland Department of Communities. Inquiries in relation to the freight subsidies should be made to the Queensland Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries. Inquiries in relation to the concessional interest rate loans should be made to the Queensland Rural Adjustment Authority.

        , will continue to work closely with Queensland authorities, local government and community organisations to ensure that affected communities have all the support they need during this difficult period. I am sure that all members in the House would join with me in wishing well the affected communities, particularly the community in Rockhampton, as they fight these fires. I would also note that we are aware of fire incidents in New South Wales and

         Mr Speaker, on indulgence: the opposition associates itself with the good wishes passed by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acting_Prime_Minister" rel="nofollow">
          Acting Prime Minister
         </a>
         to the communities affected. Bushfire is a tragic part of our very volatile climate here in Australia. It threatens communities every year right around the country and the response of local, state and federal governments to it should always be prompt and generous. The governmentâ€™s response has our full support. We encourage the government to do as much as it can to support the communities and the courageous men and women who are fighting these fires.

          Mr Speaker, on indulgence: on behalf of the people of the Rockhampton region, particularly those who have been directly affected by the fires surrounding our city, I thank the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acting_Prime_Minister" rel="nofollow">
           Acting Prime Minister
          </a>
          for her announcement and the Leader of the Opposition for his comments. I know it means a lot to our
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
           Central Queensland
          </a>
          communities that so many Australians have expressed their concern for our situation and that all three levels of government have pledged support and now this relief funding.
         </p>
         <p>
          I take this opportunity also to sincerely thank all the firefighters, the regulars and the volunteers, the pilots and all the emergency service workers who have responded so magnificently to this unprecedented fire emergency. Of course the local media have also played a very valuable role over the last few days. We will not forget what you have done to keep people safe and to defend their homes. I thank the Acting Prime Minister and all members of the House for keeping the people of Central Queensland in your thoughts.
