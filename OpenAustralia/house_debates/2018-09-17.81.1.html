        My question is to the Minister for Jobs,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_Relations" rel="nofollow">
         Industrial Relations
        </a>
        and Women. Will the minister update the House on how the government is supporting mature age workers? Is the minister aware of any threats posed by alternative approaches?

         I thank the member for his question. He knows that Australians are living longer lives and, given that all of us are getting older, this is indeed a very good thing. But the government recognises that, as Australians get older, we want to make sure that they lead healthier, safer and more independent lives, and they need to be able to be free to take advantage of all of the opportunities that a longer life brings, which means that we need to focus on the opportunities for mature age Australians who want to work and who want to be able to get a job.
        </p>
        <p>
         Pleasingly, we have seen the employment figures for mature age workers increase by more than 73,000 over the last year, consistent with the record jobs growth that we have been able to deliver under our stewardship of the nation's economy. But we are not resting on our laurels, because we on this side of the House know that those that want to work should be able to get a job. If you are older, you are not only valued but you are valuable. That is why, on this side of the House, we are creating the new $2,000 Skills and Training Incentive to support the retraining, reskilling and upskilling of opportunities for mature age workers. We are increasing the pension work bonus to give pensioners the opportunity to earn more income before any of their pension payments are reduced. We are providing Restart wage subsidies of up to $10,000 to encourage businesses to hire and to retain mature age workers. The government recognises the great benefits to our economy from the experiences, the work ethic and the skills of mature age workers, and we know the great benefits that they bring to their communities and to their families from their contributions. We will continue to support all Australians who want to get a job to get a job.

         asks about threats. Well, it will probably come as no surprise to the member that there is an alternative approach, a high-taxing, job-destroying approach, from those opposite that poses a very significant impact and threat to the ability of businesses, particularly small businesses, to continue to offer job opportunities to so many Australians. Those opposite would in fact have a mega-regressive retiree tax that would hit more than 900,000 older Australians and leave them worse off. We will stand with older Australians. Those opposite will attack older Australians, and that is why they cannot be given the opportunity to be trusted with their livelihoods.
