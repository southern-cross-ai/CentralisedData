       </p>
       <p class="italic">

       </p>
       <p>
        I thank the member for Wentworth for seconding this motion before the House—I also thank and acknowledge the member for Berowra, for his co-chairmanship, along with the member for Wentworth, on our parliamentary committee—on the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance.
       </p>
       <p>
        Earlier this year, by the beautiful shoreline in my community in Macnamara, we witnessed an ugly display of hate. A group of neo-Nazis in my electorate, in Elwood, gave a Nazi salute while posing for a photo. It was an awful contradiction, set against the welcoming, inclusive and quiet suburb of Elwood.
       </p>
       <p>
        We know from our security agencies that more and more resources are now devoted to addressing the threats posed by far-right fringe groups. Unfortunately, antisemitism is on the rise again, occurring far too frequently and increasing in hostility. It's why the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance came up with a definition of antisemitism.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_University" rel="nofollow">
         The University
        </a>
        of Melbourne recently adopted this definition of antisemitism, and, alongside it, they adopted a definition of Islamophobia, another form of discrimination that has no place in our great country.
       </p>
       <p>
        The IHRA definition is not legislation. It is simply a framework to help identify and combat this particular form of racism. Just as the British parliament formulated a definition of Islamophobia, IHRA created a definition of antisemitism. The IHRA definition of antisemitism was created by international holocaust and genocide scholars to academically understand what antisemitism is.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, the Greens are opposed to recognising the IHRA working definition, and they cite the contemporary examples that accompany the working definition as their justification. So what are the contemporary examples—that are, frankly, pretty straightforward—that the Greens are unwilling to support? Let's go through them, so we can better understand exact what the Greens are opposing.
       </p>
       <p>
        According to IHRA, one cannot call for aiding or justifying the killing or harming of Jews. That seems pretty straightforward—but, apparently, not for the Greens. You cannot make mendacious, dehumanising, demonising or stereotypical allegations about Jews, such as the power of Jews as a collective. It seems straightforward—apparently, not for the Greens. You cannot mention a myth about a world Jewish conspiracy or Jews controlling the media, economy, government or other societal issues. It seems pretty straightforward. You cannot accuse the Jews, as a people, or Israel, as a state, of inventing or exaggerating the Holocaust. Are the Greens really trying to argue that they want to engage in Holocaust denial? IHRA also states that you cannot accuse Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel or to the alleged priorities of Jews worldwide than to the interests of their own nations. I am an Australian, and proudly so. This is a clear definition to better understand what antisemitism is.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now, some people try and argue that a few of the working examples try to shut down criticism of Israel, but this is not true. Let me read clearly from the IHRA website:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic.
       </p>
       <p>
        In other words, as clearly set out in the IHRA definition, you can be critical of Israel. Being critical of Israel is not antisemitic, nor does this definition shut down debate or limit freedom of speech. It simply creates a framework about how to engage in free and robust debate without descending into bigotry. There are more working examples that people can and should read, and then you can make up your own mind.
       </p>
       <p>
        But let me say this. It sits extremely uncomfortably with me that the Greens presume to know more about the manifestations of antisemitism than the Jewish community themselves. By opposing the IHRA definition, what message does that send when one examines the examples of what the Greens are actually opposing? After all, it is unfathomable to imagine the Greens, or anyone else, imposing their own definition of racism on any other minority in this country, yet they do this to the Jewish community. I sincerely hope the Greens reconsider their position on this matter and I hope that all of us, across this parliament, work together to oppose all forms of bigotry and racism.

           The ECAJ monitors instances of racial hatred and racial abuse directed at the Jewish community. For 10 years, Julie Nathan has produced the ECAJ's annual

           </i>
           . The 2022 report found that antisemitic incidents had increased by more than 40 per cent over the last two years. Many of those incidents involve the growth in politically motivated extremism from neo-Nazi groups, like the National Socialist Network and the European Australian Movement. But there was another sort of antisemitism that Julie Nathan identified: 'Ostensibly left-leaning, progressive groups including so-called antiracism activists are mainstreaming antisemitism and are actively undermining the fight against antisemitism. Some perceive Jews as wealthy and powerful and, therefore, excuse any attacks on Jews as 'punching up' and not racism. Some ignore anti-Israel discourse which crosses the line into hateful conceptualisations of Jews.

           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Baddiel" rel="nofollow">
            David Baddiel
           </a>
           , a British author on the political left, wrote a book called
           <i>

           . His book chronicles the blind eye that is turned to antisemitism on the Left and the double standards of progressives, including minimising antisemitism as a form of racism. Most often, it's hidden behind double standards and a demonisation of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Israel" rel="nofollow">
            State of Israel
           </a>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           In 2019, Australia became the 33rd member of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance. I'm proud that Australia has joined this movement. This union of nations underscores the importance of confronting evil and educating the next generation of Australians. The Parliamentary Friends of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IHRA" rel="nofollow">
            IHRA
           </a>
           is encouraging the adoption of the IHRA definition of antisemitism in all aspects of government and acknowledged by institutions across the public and private sector. That definition of antisemitism includes examples such as making mendacious, dehumanising demonising or stereotypical allegations about the Jews; accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel than to the interests of their own nations; and holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of the State of Israel.
          </p>
          <p>
           Sadly, today the epicentre of antisemitic activity is our universities. The situation on campus for Jews is particularly bad. In 2022,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRC" rel="nofollow">
            SRC
           </a>
           s at Sydney, Melbourne,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANU" rel="nofollow">
            ANU
           </a>
           , Adelaide and Wollongong passed motions supporting the antisemitic Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. At Sydney university, when Jewish students spoke out against the motion, they were shouted down.
          </p>
          <p>
           In Adelaide, the student publication
           <i>
            On
           </i>
           <i>
            D
           </i>
           <i>
            it
           </i>
           published multiple articles calling for 'death to Israel' and 'glory to the Intifada, may it be merciless'. Jewish students expressed concern to the university and were told that it was 'a student issue'. One student was told they were just 'more sensitive' because they were Jewish. At an SRC meeting at Adelaide university there was a motion put forward condemning
           <i>
            On
           </i>
           <i>
            D
           </i>
           <i>
            it
           </i>
           . Jewish students attended the meeting to express their concerns. They were not treated with respect. Instead, several students shouted them down with the words 'death to Israel'. In response, on social media Jewish students were accused of old antisemitic tropes of divided loyalties, creating 'an unnecessary holocaust industry', and having sinister money, power and influence.
          </p>
          <p>
           At
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUT" rel="nofollow">
            QUT
           </a>
           an academic posted comments on Facebook, with respect to a student, that included references to 'Nazi Jews' and 'your lies and propaganda make you even more hated in the world'. Those examples, from 2022, which are by no means an exhaustive list of disturbing antisemitic incidents, are the reason why the first step of the Parliamentary Friends of IHRA has been to write to all university vice-chancellors encouraging them to adopt the IHRA definition. Already, the University of Melbourne has agreed to adopt the definition, and I commend and thank them. We're calling on other universities to follow suit.
          </p>
          <p>
           I was on university campus in the 1990s, and while there was some antisemitism in those days, it was certainly a minority view. You could be publicly Jewish on campus and feel a sense of belonging. But all that has changed now. As the national President of the Australasian Union of Jewish Students, Alissa Foster, told me:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Many students don't feel safe being identifiably Jewish on campus, and part of that is because our experiences of antisemitism aren't yet recognised by our Universities. Adopting the IHRA definition is not only a way for University's to show their Jewish students that they are listening but it's a way for them to tangibly work with us to address these concerns.
          </p>
          <p>
           Alissa Foster is right: Jewish students should not have to put up with this sort of behaviour on campus. All too often, universities speak the words of diversity, inclusion and acceptance, but they don't live it. When confronted by their failures, these same universities continue to hide behind banal bureaucratic language.
          </p>
          <p>
           There should be no place for antisemitism on Australian campuses. It's time for Australian universities to live their values again. That's why we need all universities to follow the lead of Melbourne university and adopt the IHRA definition of antisemitism, call out antisemitism where it occurs, take action against it and send it back to the dark place from whence it came.

            I rise to speak in favour of the motion moved by my good friend the member for Macnamara. I would also like to acknowledge the member for Berowra's fine contribution. Most importantly, I rise to speak in favour of a motion that seeks to stamp out hate. Hate is something that we should abhor, whether it exists as a flashpoint or festers, whether it occurs in the hearts of our communities or abroad. Antisemitism has existed throughout the centuries in varying forms, though with many common similarities and themes. Antisemitism is something that exists right here in Australia, and its prevalence is increasing in a number of ways.
           </p>
           <p>
            Speaking against antisemitism in a place like this is important. It is important that the community sees its leaders, its elected representatives, condemn discrimination and hatred. It goes to the heart of who we purport to be as Australians. At our best, we are a people who go out of our way to be inclusive. At our best, our society is one that looks to eliminate negative forms of discrimination wherever it takes place, whether it be due to someone's race, their sexual orientation, their gender, the colour of their skin, their ethnic origins, their religion or lack thereof. We as a people, at our core, hate hatred in all of the insidious forms it can manifest in.
           </p>
           <p>
            Sadly, antisemitism is not something of the past. It is not something happening in a faraway place. It is something that happens every day. It happens in our backyards, in our communities and on our doorsteps. With the prevalence of antisemitism rising at home, it beggars belief that we should be importing it from abroad. The

             Executive Council

            of Australian Jewry is keeping score on this. We cannot stand idly by while the number of antisemitic incidents here continue to rise.
           </p>
           <p>
            I look towards a recent example, straight from my home state of
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             South Australia
            </a>
            , at the Adelaide Writers Week. Adelaide Writers Week is a regular fixture amongst what is affectionately known as 'Mad March'. In this case, that name could not be more spot on. In short, the festival organisers decided to bring in two international authors who are well known for their antisemitic views. This has had wide media coverage. I will not name them, as doing so in this place provides them with the notoriety that they crave. As such, I have no intention of validating their business model, which is one of outrage merchantry. It is not a business model that I intend to reward, not here, not now. Quite plainly, I wish the organisers of Adelaide Writers Week had the cognisance to have the same level of good judgement. They may say that they have zero tolerance for hate speech, and I most definitely believe their sincerity in this, but this explains the importance of maintaining an established definition of what antisemitism is. This is what the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IHRA" rel="nofollow">
             IHRA
            </a>
            , has endeavoured to do across several countries and jurisdictions across the globe. Whilst it may not be as simple as it's set out, a number of examples are provided to encompass a number of different circumstances where this definition would apply. Some who are against the IHRA definition point to the broad based nature of this, almost as if 'includes but is not limited to' is not regularly incorporated in some form or another in laws we make.
           </p>
           <p>
            I wish there was more time permitted to speak to the contention used by many that the IHRA definition is an affront to academic freedom and an affront to free speech. To that point I'd ask them a simple question, one which I hope is seen as being about animus without rancour: what is it that, when looking at this definition of what antisemitism is, you would like to say? What is it that they would condone being said that would otherwise be prescribed as antisemitic by the IHRA definition? I'd like to think we have moved on from saying, 'Everyone has a right to be bigots.' We are a little bit better than that, or at least I'd like to think so.
           </p>
           <p>
            You will find me standing up to speak out against this form of hatred every time it rears its ugly head. You will find me standing up against any form of hatred where it exists, in plain sight or in the bowels of Telegram channels by people who we would walk past on the street without thinking anything insidious about what values they hold in their hearts. Hatred, if left unchecked, undermines our values as Australians and undermines the success we have in being such a successful multicultural nation of so many different cultures and creeds, which is what makes us special. Most importantly, if we don't stand boldly against hate we run the ever-present risk that we normalise it.

             I'd like to thank the member for Macnamara for moving this motion and offering me the opportunity to second it, and to speak as to why I believe the work of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, or
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IHRA" rel="nofollow">
              IHRA
             </a>
             , is so important. I also want to acknowledge the member for Berowra for also speaking on this motion and for being co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of IHRA.
            </p>
            <p>
             Australia's society has come a long way in my lifetime in many ways but not in this. Certain behaviours and views which were once considered acceptable are now increasingly considered unacceptable as they perpetuate attitudes and stereotypes which are not just wrong but harmful. Australians should be proud our community is more open, tolerant and respectful in so many ways now than it was historically. But that is not the case in terms of antisemitism. The member for Berowra spoke personally about his time and experience at university 20-odd years ago and how, as a Jewish student, he felt there were elements of antisemitism but he felt broadly accepted. Sadly, talking to Jewish students in my community of Wentworth, that is not the case. Many of them that spoke to me talked about some of the horrors of trying to live with expressions of antisemitism, of money being thrown at their feet, of abusive notes being put into their pockets, of hiding their identity or jewellery or other things that might give away that they are Jewish because they do not feel welcome, most particularly on our Australian campuses. This is most concerning because universities have always been at the forefront of social progress, but on this particular issue, of antisemitism, it seems we have gone backwards, particularly at universities.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is why the work of IHRA is so important. By proposing a working definition of antisemitism, it provides a tool for organisations, including government and universities, to frame what constitutes antisemitism, to set clear expectations and to help ensure the behaviour of individuals in these organisations is appropriate and respectful. I note there has been some criticism of the IHRA definition both in the other place and from members of the community, including the Jewish community, but I believe this criticism is misplaced. The strongest criticism against IHRA has been that the definition is there to stifle reasonable debate, and I really take issue with that. You can't have a conversation about IHRA without talking about the state of Israel, and criticism around the state of Israel goes to the heart of this because many say the IHRA definition stops criticism of Israel. However, the IHRA definition explicitly notes that any criticism against Israel that is similar to that levelled against any other country cannot be described as antisemitic. So if Israel is seen and judged on the same conditions as other countries, then it cannot be described as antisemitic. But I will say—thinking of the example from the member for Berowra—that if somebody in a university screams, 'Death to Israel,' you can see that that would be deeply disturbing to Jewish students, because Israel has been the home of the Jews for over 3,000 years and is the one place in the world where the land, name and language are essentially the same as they were 3,000 years ago.
            </p>
            <p>
             I commend the University of Melbourne for adopting the IHRA definition, alongside the definition of 'Islamophobia', as part of its four-part antiracism commitment, because individuals who are subject to racism should be listened to as we try to define what racism is in relation to these people. My vision, and the vision of other people, is for universities to continue to be places where everybody feels welcome, safe and that they belong. This is a goal I think that every university and institution in Australia shares.
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_University" rel="nofollow">
              The University
             </a>
             of Melbourne should continue to commit to embedding this value throughout their work, their actions and their words, and other universities should follow their guidance.
            </p>
            <p>
             I also commend the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Council" rel="nofollow">

             of Australian Jewry for the work they have done on this, particularly the work they are doing in measuring antisemitism, because it has had significant rises in the last two years. It is through this continuous vigilance, through examining these issues and through seeking change at universities that we will make the greatest difference.

             <p>
              I too rise to speak on this important motion on antisemitism. I thank the member for Macnamara for moving it. I want to say first and foremost that all of us in this place should think—I certainly do and my colleagues do—that any form of racism or discrimination based on race, religion, gender or sexuality, including antisemitism, is bad. We need to call it out. We shouldn't stand for it, ever. But it is a problem that persists. We've seen a very worrying trend in recent years. Just in the past year there has been a 6.9 per cent—nearly seven per cent—increase in antisemitic incidents logged in the Australian community. This comes on top of the 35 per cent increase over the 2020-21 reporting period. This is extremely worrying, and it should be inexcusable.
             </p>
             <p>
              What can we do? As a government and a parliament we can take every opportunity to raise this, as we're doing today, and have good legislation that prevents it. We can also work together with other parliaments, international groups, international bodies and organisations—for example, Australia became a member of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IHRA" rel="nofollow">
               IHRA
              </a>
              , in 2019.
             </p>
             <p>
              We can also take a clear stand against antisemitism and any form of racism, just as the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
               EU
              </a>
              did last year when it outlawed the Greek political party
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Dawn" rel="nofollow">
               Golden Dawn
              </a>
              , a neofascist political party that used its status to legitimise its own aggressive antisemitic, anti-immigrant, xenophobic and anti human rights agendas. I was vocal at the time, in particular, because there was a branch of this particular party operating right here in Australia. This party had been deemed illegal overseas and it actually had a branch here in Australia.
             </p>
             <p>
              As a government we can also take steps to protect Australia's strong social cohesion. It is the cornerstone of what makes us one of the most successful liberal democracies and multicultural societies in the world. This is why the Australian government has committed $7.5 million to fund the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Human_Rights_Commission" rel="nofollow">
               Australian Human Rights Commission
              </a>
              to complete its national antiracism framework and implement a comprehensive national antiracism strategy.
             </p>
             <p>
              As members of parliament, we can also support our local groups and institutions that promote understanding and counter discrimination. For example, in
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
               South Australia
              </a>
              , my own home state, we have the Adelaide Holocaust Museum and Steiner Education Centre. It is a fantastic centre. It has schoolchildren coming through learning about what took place during the Holocaust, the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
               Second World War
              </a>
              et cetera. The South Australian Jewish community, particularly Andrew Steiner, fought long and hard for the establishment of this museum and education centre. They do amazing and valuable work in South Australia. Its mission is to tell the story, as I said, of the Holocaust to inspire and educate South Australians to stand up against antisemitism and racism.
             </p>
             <p>
              It's important to remember that Holocaust denial and distortion are also forms of antisemitism. Holocaust denial and distortion generally claim that the Holocaust was invented or exaggerated as part of a plot to advance Jewish interests. This is why places like the Adelaide Holocaust Museum and Steiner Education Centre plays such an important role in fighting antisemitism and those sorts of notions.
             </p>
             <p>
              I sincerely commend the centre's supporters, staff and volunteers for their dedication and commitment. I support them at every opportunity. As individual members of society we also have a role to condemn antisemitism and every form of racism and discrimination. We must do this whenever and wherever we witness it. It's never funny. It's not a joke. It's not just somebody throwing a line at you. It should never be tolerated.
             </p>
             <p>
              In addition we can ensure that we educate ourselves, and we can do this by visiting the museums and centres and speaking to people who have been directly affected by antisemitism. This can help us recognise antisemitism and racism and call it out when we see it. It can also help dispel unhelpful and potentially dangerous stereotypes that we may not even know that we hold. Antisemitism, and indeed any form of racism, is possible because people or a group become dehumanised to it and accept it. History has taught us that this is so much harder to do if we meet and get to know people and hear their stories. Standing up to and condemning antisemitism and any form of racism and discrimination is something we can and must all play a part in.

               On several occasions in this job I have had the fortune of going to Israel. I visited the Yad Vashem Holocaust museum in Jerusalem. That was a very emotional time for me as well. I'm not Jewish; I'm Catholic. I think people of the Judaeo-Christian faith all share the horror of what happened to the Jews in World War

              <p>
               On a brighter note, only a few months ago I joined the Jewish community on the

                Sunshine Coast

               The Judaeo-Christian ethic of community mindedness, of service above self and of truth in love is one which is deeply ingrained in Australia's culture and our institutions. That's why the idea of antisemitism is so repugnant to our Australian egalitarian way of life. It is an assault on who we are as Australian people, and yet antisemitism is rife within our community. I've been shocked by some of the reports from even within my own electorate and from schools across the country that students are being recruited and radicalised by Neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups through social media, where they're often disguised as recreational clubs. I reported one such group in 2021, and, at the time, I said that there's no place in Australia for hate groups, whether they be ideologically or religiously based.

Just last week, I was pleased to see the New South Wales Liberal-National government announce that it will take steps to eradicate hate and antisemitism from schools, as part of a landmark 10-year partnership between faith communities, government agencies and schools. We all have a role to play in calling out and uprooting antisemitism.
