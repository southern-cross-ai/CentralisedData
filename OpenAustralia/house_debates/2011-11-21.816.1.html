       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) Iran has stepped up its crackdown on human rights workers, women's rights activists, journalists and government opponents;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) since the beginning of 2011, Iran has seen a notable increase in the use of capital punishment for political and juvenile prisoners;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) Iran has increased discrimination, in some cases amounting to persecution, against a number of religious and ethnic minority groups;

       <p class="italic">
        (f) since May 2011, security forces conducted raids on the home of individuals involved in the activities of the Baha'i Institute for Higher Education and arrested 15 of its members in various cities;

         (1) notes that as National Asbestos Awareness Week is formally recognised, it makes earnest representation to the Government to continue to call on Canada to ratify the listing of chrysotile asbestos in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotterdam_Convention" rel="nofollow">

          Australian Government
         </a>
         in mitigating the possible spread of asbestos related diseases through continuing bans on the production and use of asbestos as well as strict controls on the removal and disposal of existing material;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (3) commends the Australian Government on a number of measures that have been put into place to manage and compensate the victims of asbestos related diseases which include:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (a) the recent ratification of the

          International Labour Organization
         </a>

         , as one of the first ILO Conventions to be ratified by the Commonwealth Government since 2006;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (b) Australian leadership on a strong closing declaration by 66 countries at the 2011 Conference of the Rotterdam Convention, which expressed deep concern that the listing of chrysotile asbestos had been prevented by a small number of parties and resolved to move forward to list chrysotile asbestos in Annex III;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (c) the $5 million grant made to support the Asbestos Disease Research Institute Bernie Banton Centre;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (d) funding for the new Australian Mesothelioma Registry, which was launched in 2010 to gather more detailed and accurate information on mesothelioma and asbestos-related diseases;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (e) support for the harmonisation of health and safety legislation which will provide, for the first time, a uniform framework for the minimisation of exposure, the removal of asbestos, and the management asbestos materials in the workplace;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (f) the establishment of the Asbestos Management Review in late 2010 to recommend strategies for the development of a national strategic plan to improve asbestos awareness, management and removal;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (g) the loan agreement with the

         </a>
         Government to ensure asbestos victims and their families continue to receive payments through the Asbestos Injuries Compensation Fund; and

        <p class="italic">
         (h) the $1.5 million Comcare Asbestos Innovation Fund which sponsors programs and research to prevent and better manage asbestos exposure, as well as improve treatment for asbestos-disease sufferers;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (4) notes the unwelcome inheritance that asbestos has left on the Australian community, which sees Australian citizens suffering one of the highest rates of asbestos-related diseases in the world, with the effects of asbestos mining still being suffered by many, mostly Indigenous and past employees of James Hardie's operation at Baryulgil in the electoral division of Page, and the poor health and mortality they and their families suffer;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (5) extends its profound sympathies to all individuals suffering asbestos-related diseases as well as their friends and families and the friends and families of those who have passed away as a result of asbestos-related diseases;
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (6) notes the current and potential damage that imported asbestos is creating to the people in the

          Asia Pacific
         </a>

        <p class="italic">
         (7) calls upon the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Government" rel="nofollow">
          Canadian Government
         </a>
         to recognise the potentially catastrophic health and social implications of Canada's production and sale of asbestos and products containing asbestos to these lower socio-economic markets; and
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         (8) supports the Australian Government in using strong diplomatic efforts to convince the Canadian Government to cease both production and trade in asbestos.

           Government of the United Kingdom

         <p class="italic">
          (a) children are growing and developing against the backdrop of a culture of increasing commercialisation and sexualisation;
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (b) parents are concerned about clothing, services and products for children which reinforce gender stereotypes and portray children as being more sexually mature than their chronological age would indicate;
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (c) children are under considerable pressures to be consumers; and
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (d) parents often feel their concerns are not being listened to despite the fact that they are often in the best position to decide what is appropriate for their children;
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (2) welcomes the Ministerial Statement in respect of this review by the Government of the United Kingdom which acknowledges the need to protect children from excessive commercialisation and premature sexualisation, and accepts the recommendation that efforts to address this are focused on industry and regulators with government monitoring progress and legislating to protect children if necessary;
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (3) notes with concern that the sexualisation of children is a growing issue not just in the United Kingdom but also in Australia;
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (4) recognises that the sexualisation of children, and in particular girls, has been associated with a range of negative consequences including body image issues, eating disorders, low self esteem and mental ill health; and
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          (5) urges governments, industries, regulators and the wider community in Australia to take note of the Letting the Children be Children report and to work together to address the commercialisation and sexualisation of childhood.
