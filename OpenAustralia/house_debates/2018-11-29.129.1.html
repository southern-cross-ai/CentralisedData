        I wish to place on record three priority projects that will benefit my electorate of Moore and that require funding in the next federal budget cycle. The Sorrento Surf Life Saving Club has a membership of 1,768 financial members, including a junior base of 640 nippers. In order to meet the needs of current and forecasted membership, support the development of junior and youth members, and provide the necessary training and community services, a redevelopment concept plan has been proposed by the committee to increase the internal building floor area of the clubhouse from 1,335 square metres to 2,124 square metres, with 885 square metres of external courtyard, deck, and wash-down areas. It is estimated that the renovations will cost approximately $8 million. As patron of Sorrento Surf Life Saving Club I am actively working to bring all three levels of government—local, state and federal—together to work cooperatively with the private sector to secure the necessary funding and corporate sponsorship required to upgrade our local surf club.

        The Sorrento Bowling Club, located at Percy Doyle Reserve, is an extremely successful and recognised bowling club, fielding more lawn bowls pennant divisions than any other bowling club in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Sorrento is also one of the largest bowling clubs in WA in terms of its five quality grass bowling greens and croquet courts. Sorrento Bowling Club's outstanding performance has been recognised, with the club being awarded Clubs WA's Medium Club of the Year award in 2013, 2016 and 2017 and Bowls WA's Metropolitan Club of the Year award in 2014-15 and 2015-16. The club's current membership capacity is limited to approximately 780 members, based on the size of its clubhouse, which is restricted by its land area, playing areas and facilities. In order to meet the needs of the current and forecasted membership base, support the development of junior and youth members, and provide the necessary training and competition facilities, a strategic plan to 2025 has been proposed by the committee. An integral part of the plan includes the construction of a sheltered green, at a cost of approximately $2 million, that will enable play to occur in all weather conditions. I look forward to working with the

        and the WA state government to bring all three levels of government—local, state and federal—together to work cooperatively with the private sector to ensure that the necessary funding and corporate sponsorship is available to upgrade the facilities at the Sorrento Bowling Club.

        The extension of the northern suburbs metropolitan railway 14 kilometres northwards, from Butler to Yanchep, is a priority. I fully support the efforts of my colleague the member for Pearce in advancing this cause, together, for the greater region, which spans several electoral boundaries. The Western Australian Public Transport Authority has already completed a business case, which highlights both the importance and the value of extending the railway to Yanchep. The cost-benefit analysis clearly demonstrates that, on merit, the railway extension should be Western Australia's highest priority major public transport project.

        My electorate of Moore is located in the suburban north-west corridor of Perth, with the City of Joondalup as its main regional centre. The area represents the primary metropolitan growth region, forecast to continue developing for many decades into the future. Therefore, efficient transport systems, especially public transport in the form of the extension of the northern suburbs railway, are vital to the future development of the corridor as a whole. Perth is predominantly a linear city, with the majority of commercial activity focused around the central business district. Traffic congestion, in particular, is getting worse as transport infrastructure struggles to keep pace with the growth in the suburban population of Perth. Developing Yanchep as a strategic metropolitan centre is critical to the development of not only greater Perth generally but also the north-west corridor specifically, including Joondalup as the main regional city.
