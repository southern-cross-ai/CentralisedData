        My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that, in this House, the government voted down an amendment to his JobMaker legislation that was designed to stop workers over 35 being sacked in favour of younger workers? Does he acknowledge that workers over 35 are not just being left out and left behind but singled out and sacrificed?

         Our economic recovery program from the COVID-19 pandemic is working. More than 59,000 full-time jobs were created in January. On this side of the House, we support the measures that are getting Australians back into work. The Labor Party is having an each-way bet on pandemic politics. They play it each and every day. They oppose it as much as they support it. They oppose the measures that are getting Australians back to work just as much as they support them. They cannot be relied upon to support the Australian people at their time of greatest need. Instead, they come into this place and spread mistruths about what the government is doing.
        </p>
        <p>
         The reality of what the government is doing is it's getting Australians back into work. The reality of what this government is doing is ensuring that the health needs of Australians are being addressed in a way that few countries anywhere around the world can speak of. That is why Australians are growing in confidence. So the Labor Party can come in here and make all sorts of false claims and seek to spook people in the middle of a pandemic, but those are the irresponsible actions of a Labor Party that have no clue and take an each-way bet on everything.
