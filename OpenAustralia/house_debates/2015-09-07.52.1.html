        I rise to share with the House a local small businesses success story in my electorate of Dobell. Family owned and operated, SpotGo recently burst onto the national scene with its new and exciting range of cleaning products. Brendan, Nancy and their staff have been working tirelessly since 2000 to build their small family business into the successful enterprise it is today. Located in idyllic surrounds and operating out of the family home, SpotGo's success story demonstrates what can happen when you have a strong foundation and drive to succeed. The SpotGo team's hard work has recently paid off, with the inclusion of their products in Woolworths stores around the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        . Recently, at the invitation of SpotGo, I met with Woolworths representatives as SpotGo acknowledged Woolworths's efforts in assisting this Central Coast business gain national status. SpotGo products are also distributed through selected IGA stores. Brendan and Nancy are appreciative of the initiatives being implemented by this government and the positive outcomes the government has provided to small business. I would also like to pass on my very best to Brendan, Nancy and their team and wish them well as they continue to grow and become one of the many successful businesses on the Central Coast. Opportunities are also provided by the
