        The grey skies of Monday suited the mood as veterans from Jerrabomberra, Cooma, Bega and beyond gathered on the lawns in front of this place. Those women and men slept easier last night knowing that a motion calling for a .royal commission into veteran suicide passed the House of Representatives unopposed. For too long we have been aware that the suicide rate amongst our veterans is nearly twice that of the general population. As we approach Anzac Day, the Prime Minister needs to respect the will of this parliament, do the right thing and give grieving families of veterans the proper investigation they deserve.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's been my privilege to listen to MPs on both sides of the chamber talk about their own experiences. I particularly acknowledge the member for Solomon, Luke Gosling. Gos shared the words of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russ_Swan" rel="nofollow">
         Russ Swan
        </a>
        , a Vietnam veteran from Darwin. 'Consider this,' Russ said. 'You sign up to serve your country and, as a result, afterwards you are so disillusioned you would rather die than live and enjoy being a grandfather or grandmother.' Those are simply heartbreaking words that need to galvanise our work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those efforts start with this royal commission. As we stand at dawn this Anzac Day, as always, let us acknowledge those who have served in our defence forces. But, with special focus, let's remember those women and men who have suffered the despair that Russ from Darwin points to and the people they leave behind. To the veterans still living with that sadness, know that you are loved and needed. Please reach out and get the support that is rightfully yours.

         I rise today to affirm my support for veterans. Ryan is home to the

         </a>
         and almost 8,000 serving personnel. We are also home to many former serving personnel who have chosen to stay on and live in our wonderful community of Ryan after finishing their service. We have close to 2,500 veterans in our community, and we are so lucky to have them continuing to make a contribution locally, often in a role that directly supports other veterans in our amazing
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
          RSL
         </a>
         s and local veteran groups. It is a priority for me to make sure that they are well supported. I want to thank them and reaffirm to them that I am listening, that we in the government are listening and that we all in this place are listening.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to commend the courage of my colleagues on both sides of the chamber, like the members for Herbert and Braddon, who shared their powerful and incredible stories in this place. Those of us who have not worn the uniform will, I am sure, never truly fully understand the sacrifices made by our serving personnel, but we can commit to helping them in any way we possibly can. We have already put in place measures in this place for free lifetime health care for ADF personnel, immediate income support for those with mental health claims, assistance dogs for veterans with
