        With the upcoming
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        state election this Saturday, I rise to draw the state’s attention to the use of public resources by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         Premier of New South Wales
        </a>
        . He has faxed to all the schools in my electorate his Labor policies on schooling. I would like to table that. It is a statement on Labor’s ‘strong record on new technologies’.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is the document in which
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_Iemma" rel="nofollow">
         Morris Iemma
        </a>
        claims that he will be connecting classrooms. Yet in the third round of the Investing in Our Schools Program for my area, 12 schools had
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICT" rel="nofollow">
         ICT
        </a>
        upgrades, which is basically the installation of computer labs. In the last two rounds it would have been a similar number. As usual these promises will only be delivered in the fourth year of a Iemma government—by which stage the federal government would have fully kitted out every school in my electorate with ICT upgrades. It is this fraud by the New South Wales government that has got people so frustrated. It is the most unpopular New South Wales government in my memory.
       </p>
       <p>
        Further to that, Bernie Riordan is mailing out, to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Department_of_Education_and_Training" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales Department of Education and Training
        </a>
        ’s mailing list of students, letters against the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NECA" rel="nofollow">
         NECA
        </a>
        Group Training company, saying: ‘Don’t vote for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWA" rel="nofollow">
         AWA
        </a>
        s.’ So this government is in cahoots with the union movement in defeating legitimate negotiations on AWAs, and yet no investigation has been conducted by the Iemma government into who gave Bernie Riordan that list. Was it an authorised disclosure? How did the union get hold of such information and why wasn’t that made known to the company?
       </p>
       <p>
        Further to that, we also saw the Leader of the Opposition visit my electorate today on a last round of beating the stumps. They must think they are in trouble in Penrith because there he was, pumping the pump with Morris Iemma today. He breezes in through the back door. There was a welcome committee there for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">
         Kevin Rudd
        </a>
        . A number of people were out the front. They included media, local constituents who wanted to meet him, schoolkids and a few protesters. But Kevin Rudd came in through the back door and he left by the back door before Morris Iemma had even finished speaking.
       </p>
       <p>
        This man is a coward and he should be held accountable. How many times have I had the Prime Minister come to my electorate and, when there are protesters,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">

          I withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker. He went in the back door. This man behaved like a little furry animal running through a pipe to scurry away from possible or imagined dangers on an empty highway. These were constituents who had given up their time this morning; they had flagged that he was going to be there. They thought they could at least meet the member.

            the Leader of the Opposition—was that they have given up on Lindsay. Basically they have written it off as a safe Liberal seat. He does not care to meet the constituents there. He does not care to meet the media there. He does not care to meet the protesters there. He does not care to get into discussions about issues in Penrith. He breezed in the back door, out the back door, saw the inside of a hall; he did not even visit my electorate, which has wonderful things to visit. We have the wonderful
