        Today I rise to commend the Treasurer on delivering a budget that will help the Chisholm community come back stronger from the COVID-19 pandemic. Firstly, this government is making sure that Chisholm residents keep more of what they earn. My constituents regularly speak to me about the steep cost-of-living pressures they face. Tax relief will make an immediate positive difference. This year, lower- and middle-income earners will receive tax relief of up to $2,745 for singles and $5,490 for dual-income households. Chisholm's young people have suffered more than most this year. In July I spoke with Kira, Mitha and Tanna from the Foundation for Young Australians. They fear that they may become a lost generation. The Morrison government is making sure that this won't happen. The JobMaker hiring credit guarantees that young Chisholm residents will be more competitive in the labour market. Yet this government has also created another 12,000 Commonwealth supported places, ensuring that Australia's young people have the skills they need to join the workforce.

        I am particularly excited to see a further $22.7 million put aside to deliver another round of the Stronger Communities Program. This program helps everyday community groups like the Blackburn Vikings to upgrade their facilities and equipment. When restrictions allow, I can't wait to play a game of horse with Glenn, the president, on their upgraded basketball rings.

        , and their team, who are thrilled to see the project started. This is another great example of the Morrison government delivering for Chisholm's veteran community. The Morrison government will continue its support of local government through the Financial Assistance Grants program. Monash

        will receive just over $5.5 million and the Whitehorse Council will receive $4.8 million. These funds are key.
       </p>
       <p>
        This budget is about supporting Australian jobs, households, local businesses and the community. This budget truly supports Chisholm.
