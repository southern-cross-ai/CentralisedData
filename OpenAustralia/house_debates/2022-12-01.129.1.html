         HIV
        </a>
        /AIDS epidemic on our country and the world. Since its first appearance in 1979, HIV/AIDS has killed around 40 million people worldwide, including about 8,000 in Australia. There are still over 20,000 people in Australia living with HIV. My electorate of Macnamara was one of the hardest-hit areas during the height of the epidemic during the eighties and the nineties. Many of my constituents are still living with the legacy of HIV/AIDSâ€”a legacy of chronic illness, loss and bereavement. This is because my electorate covers much of the residential, social and business centre of Melbourne's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTIQ" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        community and it was gay and bisexual men who were hit hardest by HIV/AIDS during its initial onslaught. Others groups affected in my electorate were injecting drug users and sex workers.
       </p>
       <p>
        The story of HIV/AIDS in Australia is not just one of grief and loss; it's also the story of how Australia fought back against this disease. The LGBTIQ community mounted a highly successful education and prevention campaign which saved literally thousands of lives. They worked with governments and medical professionals to reduce transmissions and care for those living with the disease. We saw the LGBTIQ community mobilise again this year as they worked to educate and protect each other against the emergence of mpox. This is a community whose members care deeply about each other, and continuing to work with community led organisations is the best way for government to combat new health challenges. I feel privileged to represent many of the people who led the fight against HIV and AIDS in Melbourne.

        I want to make a special mention of David Menadue
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        , who was diagnosed with AIDS in 1985 and has been one of the most prominent advocates for people living with HIV. I recently had the pleasure of attending David's 70th birthday celebrations at the Pride Centre in Victoria. It was a great night full of people who, frankly, were worried about the future of the next 10 years, let alone what the rest of their lives were going to looking like. Many of these people who were there had known David for decades. We were celebrating his 70th birthday, something we were nervous he wasn't going to make, but he was there and he was proud and he was having a wonderful time. I would also like to mention Dr Adam Carr. Adam is a member of my team and, during the early years of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, he was a brave and outspoken journalist and activist. He was also a founding member of the Victorian AIDS Action Committee, now known as Thorne Harbour Health. Thank you, David and Adam, for your immeasurable contribution to Australia's response to the HIV/AIDS crisis.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today we reflect on the success of this response, as well as remembering the many young lives that were cut too short by this disease. The story of HIV is one of devastation but also one of immeasurable hope and of people working together to save each other's lives, often in front of government and the medical fraternity. It is a great story, and I'm proud of those who led that fight.
