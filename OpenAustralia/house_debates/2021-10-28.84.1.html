        My question is to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has refused to release the modelling of his net zero policy, showing its full economic impact, before he goes to Glasgow tonight. Why?

         As I've said on a number of occasions, the government will be releasing the modelling in the next few weeks, and it will be there along with our plans, which go through, quite methodically, how we intend to achieve that target. I'm looking forward to being able to point to the commitment that we're making, the target that we've set, of net zero emissions by 2050 and, of course, the update to our 2030 target, which was 26 to 28 per cent, which is what we took to the last election. We've kept faith with that commitment. We said we'd meet that commitment and we'd beat it, and that is exactly what we're going to do. I'll be able to inform them that we now expect that we will be able to see a 35 per cent reduction by 2030. That is our expectation. That is what the work shows. I think that's an extraordinary achievement by the Australian people, by Australian industry and, I've got to say, particularly by the agricultural sector.

          <p>
           Yes, on relevance. It was a really specific question. There was no rhetoric. It was just about modelling and why it is isn't being produced now. Why?

            I've been listening carefully to the Prime Minister. I think he is being relevant to the question. He certainly was in the first couple of sentences. It mightn't be the answer that those on my left wanted, but I'll keep hearing the Prime Minister.

            <p>
             That's what we'll be doing when we go to Glasgow. We as a coalition have worked solidly together to understand fully the implications of these nationally determined contributions that we've made. We have worked through these issues. We've considered what is happening in the global economy and the impacts, particularly on rural and regional areas, and we have developed a plan which enables us to achieve this and at the same time see our economy continue to grow and the way of life of rural and regional communities continue to go forward. That is what our plan achieves. Our targets are clear: 26 to 28 per cent by 2030, which we'll meet and beat, and, by 2050, to achieve net zero emissions. We still don't know what the Labor Party's 2030 target is, and the clock has been ticking on them for a long time.
