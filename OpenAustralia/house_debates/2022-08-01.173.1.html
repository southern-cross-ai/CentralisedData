        My father's grandparents lived in a place called Dagworth. Now it's called Testers Hollow. They had a little wooden boat, and when the rains came, they would have to row the boat because there was no road—they were isolated. Let's roll forward over 100 years. The people of Gillieston Heights in my electorate still need a boat to get out of Gillieston Heights, except now there are 3½ thousand people who live in this mushrooming suburb of the Paterson electorate. Thousands of people have moved from Newcastle and

        In 2016 I ran on a campaign of raising Testers Hollow. We put forward $15 million. The New South Wales state government could find only $2 million to do the job. I say to that government: Stump up some more money and do Testers Hollow properly so that we don't have a once-in-25-years flood proof level for the road but a once-in-50-years or once-in-100-years level. It needs to be fixed. I say to the New South Wales state government: Come on, fix Testers Hollow. In this day and age, we can't be having the New South Wales
