        I would like to echo the words of my colleague from across the chamber, the member for Makin.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity to thank the representatives from a number of community organisations who attended a recent round table with Senator Michaelia Cash, the shadow parliamentary secretary for the status of women, and me. The round table was attended by representatives from the following organisations and the following individuals: Beenleigh

        , represented by Mayor Pam Parker and Councillor Jennie Breene; Beenleigh, Eagleby and North Gold Coast Family and Domestic Violence Outreach Service; Faith Revival Christian Church; the Eagleby Community Association; and also the Twin Rivers Centre, which provided a written submission.
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of the round table was to seek a better understanding of the issues affecting women in the Forde electorate. Some of the most pressing issues raised were: domestic violence as a major cause of homelessness; the fact that there is nowhere for women and their children to go once they become homeless; and the fact that, currently, the onus is put on the victims of domestic violence to leave, not on the perpetrator to stop the violence or leave.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was also pointed out that a framework is required whereby collaborative work can be legally, fairly and professionally carried out between services and organisations which deal with domestic violence issues to enable better protection, conviction and intervention in these cases.
       </p>
       <p>
        There was also a suggestion that some national legislation on violence against women be created and made effective across all states and territories of Australia and a recommendation that a national campaign combating the issues also be undertaken. It was also pointed out that financial stresses are being felt hugely by the middle class and, increasingly, this sector needs to access emergency assistance for food, accommodation, medication and a range of other items.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another issue was raised regarding changes to parenting payments. It was pointed out that there was either inadequate warning or inadequate support provided. Mention was made of the fact that there appeared to be a lack of framework and funding around assisting mothers back into the workforce and the fact that women affected are operating at high levels of stress and anxiety, directly affecting their own and their children's wellbeing.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was also pointed out that most women want to work but have little or no support, so maintaining work is difficult, particularly for single mothers. They need a supported employment option—something to help them break that cycle—perhaps an in-home option as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Affordability around the costs associated with seeking and sustaining work such as child care, fuel, vehicle costs, public transport, clothing et cetera was also raised; also, juggling casual work where the hours of work and income are changeable, making it difficult to manage a household budget. The issue of greater flexibility in childcare options was also raised—the availability outside standard hours; casual childcare options for those working casual hours; and an increase of in-home care options.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was very evident during the day that there are many dedicated organisations throughout my electorate which work unceasingly to make a difference in many women's lives, often with none or very little funding and few resources. One of those organisations, Soroptimists International Beenleigh, runs a program called
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dating_Game" rel="nofollow">
         The Dating Game
        </a>
        , which educates young women on what is and is not acceptable in terms of controlling behaviour or dangerous behaviour when dating.
       </p>
       <p>
        We also took the opportunity to call into a women's pamper morning, conducted for the sixth year in a row by Twin Rivers Church. This was a free event to show women in the community that they are valued and was attended by over 200 women giving or receiving manicures, pedicures, hairstyles, shoulder massages and makeovers. And we had a wonderful morning tea!
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to, again, thank all the participants for their insight and willingness to bring to light the issues which they see facing women in our community today. Following the round table, I now have plans underway to conduct a more in-depth forum in the near future to further address the issues raised. The complexity of these issues requires a whole-of-community effort. They will not be solved overnight. I am committed to working with the community to ensure that the women of Forde receive the support and acknowledgement—
