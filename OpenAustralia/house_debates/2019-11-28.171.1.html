       <p>
        I think I speak for many of us when I say one of the greatest sources of pride for all us here are the children and the young people that we get to meet in our electorates carrying out our duties. Today I want to talk about some of the amazing young children that I met at Beechboro Primary School in my electorate of Cowan. The year 5 Hass class taught by Mr James Davies recently wrote a series of letters to me with their thoughts on ocean pollution where they also offered some solutions to their concerns. After watching videos and reading about ocean pollution, the children were concerned about what the government is doing about reducing plastic waste and increasing recycling.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the common themes throughout their letters was the sheer volume of plastic finding its way to the ocean and the impact this would have on sea life. Solutions that they offered included higher levels of recycling, with more recycling bins for households; replacing plastics with other materials where possible, such as glass; more clean-up days; and providing more opportunities for new technologies and new ideas that could help with recycling.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was struck by the passion and the clarity that these children spoke with about the issues that they see as an existential threat to their lives. The children were also inspired by the fact one of the other solutions to sea pollution—a floating ocean boom which collects rubbish—was also designed by a young person. In his letter to me, Mr Davies also explained a little more about why the class had written. He said that the children in his class believe that what they have to say is important and that if they express their concerns to an elected representative it would make a positive difference to the world and to their future.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Davies also asked if I might be able to write back to the class and thank them for their letters. I can confirm that I went one better: a couple of weeks ago I spent an afternoon with the young people at Beechboro Primary School to hear more firsthand about their concerns and solutions. I could not be more proud of the young people in Beechboro. In turn, I hope to make the kids at Beechboro Primary School proud and help them see a positive difference for their future. I hope I can make a difference for Fatima, Matthew, Ethan, Diaz, Jessica, Bella, Harrison, Mason, Ashton, Matin, Kayla, January, Tyson and all the other children in year 5 Hass and all the great kids in Cowan. It was very clear from the letters that our children, who will have to face the consequences of our actions today, want to see a government that will take a tougher stance on the environment.
