           Strong, safe and together. That's how, under my government, and as has been the case under the coalition government, we will be dealing with the challenges that Australia faces. We are reminded on this day, 11 September, of the very real threats and the serious nature of the challenges that not only our country faces but all countries face today. Those challenges come in many forms. Our world is changing. The economy is changing. The pressures in the global economy, on our environment, that are faced in households all around the country, in small businesses and in family businesses are all pressures and challenges that Australians face. The way our government will deal with those challenges is to ensure that Australia is strong, that Australia is safe and that we are bringing Australians together and keeping Australians together to meet those challenges.
          </p>
          <p>
           Over the past five years, as a government we have been building a stronger and more resilient Australia. More than a million Australians now have a job that didn't have one at the time of the 2013 election. The level of youth unemployment has fallen to its lowest level in over five years: 11.1 per cent; 95½ thousand young people getting a job and their lives having been forever changed. Bulk-billing rates have risen to their highest level and they continue to be supported by a government that believe in a Medicare that delivers for all Australians with our Medicare guarantee—a government that are rolling out the programs that make a difference to the everyday lives of Australians.
          </p>
          <p>
           Our focus, as a new generation taking on the mantle of the achievements of the last five years, is to keep our economy strong so we can guarantee the essentials that Australians rely on right across the board: lower taxes; support for small business; support for new industries, and more markets for them to engage in around the world; cheaper electricity prices and infrastructure investments that build our regions and bust congestion in our cities; keeping Australians safe in our homes, in our schools, and on our streets; and ensuring that children are safe online. These are the priorities that we are pursuing and have done for five years, and we will continue to pursue them—standing around the world with those who share our beliefs and values to protect freedom and to protect liberty wherever we are called to do so. And we will do it by keeping Australians together, not setting one Australian against another, not saying that one group has to be punished with higher taxes so others can be helped, and respecting the contribution that all Australians wish to make. Strong, safe, together—that's our plan.
