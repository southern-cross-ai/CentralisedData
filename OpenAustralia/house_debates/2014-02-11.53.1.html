        My question is to the Minister for Justice. Will the minister update the House on the current bushfire situation and the ongoing support the federal government continues to give to Australians in the case of natural disaster?

         at the moment to battle what is a significant bushfire emergency. And we thank them for it.
        </p>
        <p>
         Over the weekend, dozens of bushfires burnt across south-eastern Australia. More than 26 bushfires continue to burn in Victoria alone, and in South Australia firefighters are working to stop the Bangor fire reaching towns in that area. Sadly, these communities are very familiar with the ferocity of bushfires, and our thoughts are with those whose homes have been destroyed or damaged.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have again been in contact today with the Victorian Minister for Police and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergency_Services" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         . In Victoria alone more than 6,000 firefighters from across
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_and_New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          Australia and New Zealand
         </a>
         have been mobilised, and they are supported by widespread aerial support. To assist impacted communities, individuals and families, Minister Wells and I have announced jointly-funded assistance for emergency accommodation, food, clothing, personal items, and personal and financial counselling. We have also announced the establishment of emergency re-establishment grants, which will assist towards the clean-up, repair and replacement of household contents for residents whose homes are now deemed unfit for habitation. Assistance is also available to local councils to respond to the fires and in cleaning up and repairing essential public services.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition to this, the Commonwealth contributes $14 million for firefighting aircraft in the states and territories. Seventy aircraft are currently being deployed in Victoria, and the beauty of the national aerial firefighting arrangements is that aircraft are placed all around the country and then deployed where they are needed to deal with particular emergencies.
        </p>
        <p>
         Twenty-one homes have been confirmed destroyed in Victoria, although that figure will certainly be significantly higher once we know the full extent of the damage. Heatwave conditions continue to be forecast across south-eastern Australia over the coming days, with temperatures expected to increase towards the weekend. I would urge all communities impacted by the current fires to make preparations for their families, houses and businesses and listen to their local radio for advice from emergency management authorities.
        </p>
        <p>
         National cooperation in responding to bushfire emergencies is deeply impressive.

         works seamlessly to provide whatever assistance the states need, and cooperation between states is also very extensive. As always, the Commonwealth stands ready to assist the Victorian and
