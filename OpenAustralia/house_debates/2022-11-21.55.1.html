         Youth Voice
        </a>
        in Parliament Week: an opportunity for our next generation of leaders to have their voice heard in our Parliament. Dawson's winning speech was written by a student from Cannonvale State School. I present you the winning submission:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My name is Georgia and I am 11 years old. My electorate is Dawson and I am passionate about road safety. I think Australia's new parliament should definitely consider adding new lanes to make a double highway in rural and regional areas such as the Whitsundays to accommodate for the safety of others while overtaking slower vehicles like caravans. If you are thinking this is a major change to road rules, you are wrong. Because it's just like an overtaking lane the whole way up the highway. I think this issue is important and needs to be addressed urgently, and it also will reduce travelling time for users. I think Parliament can help achieve this goal by organising this with council or state government builders. So, in summary, I absolutely believe that this issue should be resolved to better rural and regional communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you, Georgia, for your outstanding contribution. I would also like to thank all the youth who made fantastic submissions. I am truly inspired and encouraged by our next generation of leaders. G'day to all the great kids from Cannonvale State School. Study hard. All the best.
