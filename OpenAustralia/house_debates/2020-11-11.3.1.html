        (1) notes:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the importance of the Auditor-General, who is responsible for auditing Commonwealth entities and reporting to the Parliament, providing crucial accountability and transparency regarding Government administration, and scrutiny of the expenditure of public monies;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) that as an independent officer of the Parliament with responsibilities under the
        <i>
         Auditor-General Act 1997
        </i>
        , the Auditor-General reports not to a minister, but directly to the Parliament via the

        </a>
        of Public Accounts and Audit;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) that unlike similar entities such as the Parliamentary Budget Office, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_National_Audit_Office" rel="nofollow">
         Australian National Audit Office
        </a>

         ANAO

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) the potential conflicts inherent in these arrangements, given the Auditor-General exists to scrutinise the performance and actions of the executive;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) declares that independent scrutiny of Government spending to get maximum value for every taxpayer dollar is more important now than ever, given:
       </p>

        (a) the Government is racking up one trillion dollars in debt;

        (b) Australia's budget deficit is now at a record high; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) Government spending has blown out to the highest percentage of gross domestic product since 1970, the earliest year that records are available in the budget papers;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) further notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the ANAO's budget has been in structural deficit for years because of this Government's cuts, recording unsustainable operating losses of $3.1 million in 2018-19 and $4.8 million in 2019-20;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the Auditor-General wrote to the Prime Minister prior to the 2020-21 Budget requesting $6.3 million in new funding so he could continue to undertake his role, related to the accumulated budget pressures and COVID-19 cost pressures; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) without new funding the Auditor-General is forced to reduce his program of performance audits which is projected to fall rapidly below the longstanding target of 48 performance audits per annum to around 38 per annum;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) condemns the Government for its ongoing efforts to hide rorts, waste and corruption from scrutiny and avoid accountability by:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) taking revenge on the Auditor-General and making further cuts to the ANAO's budget and staffing, with a $1.28 million cut to revenue, a reduction in resources of $14 million in 2020-21 and a reduction in the average staffing level allocation; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) failing for years to introduce a National Integrity Commission; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) calls on the Government to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) immediately reverse its cuts to the ANAO's budget and provide the Auditor-General with the funds he has requested, by having the Minister for Finance provide an immediate advance, and making a commitment to boost funding over the forward estimates in the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) apologise for the Prime Minister's failure to protect and support the independent Auditor-General, as the Prime Minister has proven that he cannot be trusted to protect the integrity of the office;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) consider introducing legislation to remove the ANAO from the Prime Minister and Cabinet portfolio and establish the ANAO as a parliamentary department, cementing the Auditor-General as a truly independent officer of the Parliament; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) stop stalling and introduce legislation to establish a National Integrity Commission.

        That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) agrees that effective politics requires constructive debate and consensus building on policy challenges and roadblocks that, if left unresolved, undermine the national interest;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) commends the Menzies-Calwell club for facilitating consensus-driven, cross-parliamentary policy discussions that do not regress into ineffectual, politically polarised rhetoric;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) reaffirms that establishing a robust federal integrity commission during this parliament well before the next election is essential to arresting the declining public trust in institutions and restoring Australians' faith in the democratic system;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) notes that, according to the Beechworth Principles and the motion agreed to by the Senate on 9 November 2020, a federal integrity commission must have:

       <p class="italic">
        (a) broad jurisdiction to investigate corrupt conduct within the public sector;

        (c) strong investigative powers and procedural fairness safeguards;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) an ability to hold public hearings when in the public interest;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) direct avenues for public referrals and an ability to commence investigations independently based on those referrals;

       <p class="italic">
        (f) strong whistleblower protections;
       </p>

        (g) adequate and secure funding to be able to fulfil its purpose; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (h) oversight by a multi-party parliamentary committee, including of the appointment of commissioners, and an independent parliamentary inspector to ensure accountability to the people; and
