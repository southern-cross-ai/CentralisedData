        I would like to acknowledge the achievements of Lisa Butson, a young woman, who went to school at Swansea High School and who has been chosen as a New Colombo Plan fellow. Lisa is an outstanding young woman. The first time I met her, she was competing in the Lions Youth of the Year at Swansea. At that time, I could see what a fantastic young person she was, what great values she had, how she had a big future in front of her. As members of parliament, we all meet special young people but Lisa is one of those very special young people. She has done some volunteering with me in my office and she has even come in on a casual basis and worked because she is just so talented.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will tell you a little bit about Lisa. She is at Newcastle university. She is studying a Bachelor of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_Studies" rel="nofollow">
         Development Studies
        </a>
        and she will do an honours year after she has completed the bachelor course. She has a grade point average of 6.6 out of seven. She has achieved distinctions and high distinctions in all courses. She has been placed on the Faculty of Science and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology" rel="nofollow">

        commendation list for outstanding academic performance in 2014. She is a student mentor at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Newcastle" rel="nofollow">
         University of Newcastle
        </a>
        ; she assists new students in their transition to university life. Lisa is the kind of person who understands what it is to provide support. She is just a beautiful, beautiful human being. She received a scholarship from the University of Newcastle to attend the University Scholars Leadership Symposium, in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong" rel="nofollow">
         Hong Kong
        </a>
        , in August this year. She volunteered in Nepal in 2012-13.
       </p>
       <p>
        She has a long history of commitment to volunteering, providing support to people and academic achievement. She has a career objective to work in international development and diplomacy and I think she would do a great job in that area. While she is in the Philippines she will be looking at water and water waste. She will be concentrating on access to clean water and sewerage. Lisa knows how vital water is in nations that are developing. Lisa will give a lot to the project while she is involved in the New Colombo Plan, and I know that she will get a lot from the New Colombo Plan.
