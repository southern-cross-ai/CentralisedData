       <p>
        Men have a tendency to neglect their health. As a group, we generally do not visit the doctor as often as we should. We do not like talking about our problems; we particularly do not like talking about mental healthâ€”things like depression, isolation, anger and loneliness. There are some wonderful programs out there focusing on men's health, including some excellent campaigns by beyondblue, but one of those great grassroots men's health initiatives is the Men's Shed movement. At first glance, a local Men's Shed may not appear to be a health initiative, but, tucked away in industrial estates, down alleys and in old sheds, they are making a difference to the health of thousands of Australian men. Men's Sheds provide a space for men to make friends, talk about blokes' issues and learn new skills. They provide a safe, comfortable place for men to talk about issues that would often not be discussed in other settings. Men's Sheds reduce social isolation, particularly for older men and men living in rural and remote areas, enabling positive social interactions and enhancing health and wellbeing in the men who attend. It is not just men who benefit from the presence of a vibrant Men's Shed in the community. When men are physically and mentally healthier, families are stronger and our entire community benefits.

        Men's Sheds also give back to their communities. Many Men's Sheds use the skills and equipment they have to support the community that supports them. The Grafton Men's Shed, which is located just outside the electorate of Cowper in the electorate of Page, recently manufactured 40 nesting boxes for native Australian animals that will be used along the new

        upgrade north of Woolgoolga. I have visited a number of local Men's Sheds in the Cowper electorate over the years, and I have always come away impressed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government recognises the value of the Men's Shed movement through the National Shed Development Programme. The outcome of round 10 has just been announced with about $400,000 awarded to 115 Men's Sheds around Australia. Three Men's Sheds in the Cowper electorate have secured funding. The Nambucca Men's Shed will receive $2,200 for the purchase of a new laser engraver and cutter to produce shapes, letters and pictures. I want to commend

        for his leadership of the Nambucca Men's Shed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Stronger Men's Group in Bowraville will receive $7,000 to help set up a new Men's Shed with a thicknesser, drills, tool boxes and safety equipment. The funding will also help with repairs to the shed and the installation of a disabled access toilet. The Woolgoolga Men's Shed has secured a grant of $6,000 to build a better work area with a new concrete floor, improved roofing and fencing and an upgraded electricity supply. I commend Ray O'Keefe and his team at the Woolgoolga Men's Shed. I know the men at that shed are excited about the opportunity to improve their facility.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased to highlight the great work done by Men's Sheds in the Cowper electorate. I encourage other sheds to apply for funding through the next round of the National Shed Development Programme.
