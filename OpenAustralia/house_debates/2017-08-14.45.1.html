       <p>
        I would like to pay tribute to Sergeant Owen Harms and Leonie Creed.

        lost two respected identities in the past week. Sergeant Owen Harms served 30 years in the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miriam_Vale" rel="nofollow">
         Miriam Vale
        </a>
        . Words describing Owen include: a true blue Aussie, gentle, generous, popular, an outstanding citizen and a mate to everyone. Owen battled cancer, heart attacks, strokes and the demons of his police force service. He was a decorated officer who was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Police_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Police Medal
        </a>
        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Medal" rel="nofollow">

        and a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_of_Merit" rel="nofollow">
         Certificate of Merit
        </a>
        from the

         Royal Humane Society
        </a>
        of Australasia. He had community passion. He was well connected with the Gary Larson Oval and the Miriam Vale Rodeo. Owen was farewelled by 350 police officers, who formed a guard of honour, and some 3,000 people from the community. I give my sympathies to his family—Lyn, his wife, and his children, Brendon and Breanna.
       </p>
       <p>
        I extend my condolences to the Creed family. Leonie Creed was a remarkable woman. She had a just-do-it attitude, a generous heart and was part of the Creed Grazing family, which includes the Old Station and Langmorn Station. She was famous for holding the Old Station Fly-In and Heritage Show—a regular annual event for the aeroplane bus. She is now reunited with her late husband George, who was a former mayor of Gladstone. I give my sympathies to Leonie's sons, Ron and Andrew, and their families. Rest in peace.
