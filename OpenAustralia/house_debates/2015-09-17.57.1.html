       <p>
        This week, the nation woke up to the news that the Liberal Party had sacked the previous Prime Minister and we now had a new Prime Minister, the former Minister for Communications. Australian women and the women of Newcastle, in particular, have asked, 'What difference is this going to make, given the extraordinary track record of the last two years, the appalling attack on services for Australian women?' I note, in particular, that this new Prime Minister was part of a cabinet that oversaw the savage cuts to funds for women's refuges and services. He was part of a cabinet that had few voices for Australian women. He was part of a cabinet that consistently ignored Australian women's calls for action on the elimination of domestic violence in this country.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let us look at the information that came from a leaked cabinet document, which makes very clear that this new Prime Minister's track record in appointing women to boards is one of the worst ever. The document shows that Mr Turnbull has outstripped Mr Abbott, the former Prime Minister. It shows that, of the last 16 appointments made to boards in his former portfolio area of communications, only one was a woman. Well, is this new

         Thank you for the unexpected opportunity. Unfortunately, I sat through all of the contributions from the other side and all I heard were complaints, complaints and complaints. If there was a shadow ministry for complaints, it would fill the entire frontbench for those opposite. They have absolutely nothing.

         I hear an interjection from my good friend the member for Charlton over there. I am surprised you are still here, Pat! Question time has not yet started. We know that those opposite have no plan at all. Their only plan is to complain. Their only plan is to continue to complain. Their only plan is to spend more of the taxpayers' money than they actually have.
