        At the start of this month Very Special Kids launched its Piggy Bank Appeal. This year it is celebrating their 15th anniversary and in that time has raised over $14 million. The objective this year is to raise a further $1 million. Very Special Kids does remarkable work with families of children with life-threatening illness. Often when a family is faced with the overwhelming challenge of having to care for a sick child the family finds it very difficult both emotionally and financially. The strain can test the fabric of the family unit. That is where Very Special Kids helps by providing both practical and emotional support for the children, their parents and the entire family.

        Located in my electorate in Malvern, Very Special Kids House caters for those families in need. However, these services come at a cost. It costs more than $1.7 million per year to operate and maintain Very Special Kids House at an average of around $6,000 per family per year. A single night in the hospice can cost up to $900. In order to keep these services free of charge Very Special Kids needs to raise more than $3 million per year from the community. The Piggy Bank Appeal goes a long way to raising these much needed funds.

        Finally, I recognise and acknowledge the amazing work done by the outstanding team at VSK—the staff, the doctors, nurses and volunteers—so capably led by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        David Agnew and Very Special Kids patron and force of nature Sister Margaret Noone AM, someone whom I greatly admire and respect for her undeniable commitment and contribution to our great community.
