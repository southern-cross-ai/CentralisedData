       <p>
        I rise to congratulate Paralympic gold medallist Todd Hodgetts. Todd recently won the F20 division—the intellectual disability division—of the shot-put with a massive 16.29-metre throw. Todd, who has been a victim of bullying during his life, described the win as the best day of his life. He said it was just like being in a Hollywood movie.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the age of 14 Todd has been training three times a day with some great coaches. In the eyes of his father, Kevin, and his mother and brothers Todd did not have to win a medal to be a special person. Todd has a Tasmanian Institute of Sport scholarship and is a former weightlifter. He will be going to Rio to defend his title.
       </p>
       <p>
        Todd's dad believes that there must be many more Olympians out there; they just don't know it. As Kevin said: 'If Todd can do it, anyone can do it.' This is a fantastic message for any budding athletes out there: don't be afraid to take a risk; don't be afraid to take a chance. You will never know if you don't have a go.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations, once again, to Todd on his fantastic effort. It is extremely well deserved. I am sure that we will be seeing you again, defending your title in Rio, Todd. I look forward to that. I encourage all Tasmanians to get behind our Paralympic superstar when he returns home and let him know that we are all very proud of his efforts and achievements. Well done, Todd!
