       <p>
        On Wednesday, I had the pleasure to meet with 140 grade 5 and grade 6 students from Benalla P-12 College on the final day of their Canberra camp. I was delighted to talk to them about the importance of democracy and the role of this parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity in making this speech to particularly acknowledge the role of the Parliamentary Education Office and the terrific job they do in making visits from students, particularly from my electorate, such a wonderful education and learning experience for them. Thanks, guys; you do a really good job.
       </p>
       <p>
        Benalla P-12 College was established in January 2013 as a result of four schools merging. It is headed by Principal Barbara O'Brien, who does a fantastic job. The school's vision is to inspire and support students to reach their potential. Yesterday, meeting and talking with teachers and parents Sam, Stefanie, Rick, Brad, Emily, Brooke, Tali, Louise and Ross, reinforced to me how important it is to have a great education locally available in our communities. Well done to Benalla.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thoroughly enjoyed answering the quality and incisive questions of the students. They were obviously well briefed. They were across their topic. And I know that they are going to make a great leadership contribution to Indi.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you, Benalla P-12 College, for visiting

        , and I look forward to seeing you—staff, students and parents—when I visit the school in the next few weeks.
