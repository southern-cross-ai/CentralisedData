       <p>
        I rise today to speak of the Rudd government’s Economic Security Strategy and in particular of the impact this plan for the future will have on thousands of pensioners in my electorate of Bass. I have spoken before of the plight of pensioners not only in Northern Tasmania but across the country. As a government, we have recognised for some time that they have been doing it tough. That is why I welcome the Rudd government’s Economic Security Strategy and applaud its architects. This is a $10.4 billion plan to strengthen our nation’s economy and, at the same time, support Australian households as all around us what can only be described as a global financial crisis unfolds. Ten thousand, seven hundred and seventy-two aged pensioners, 4,561 disability pensioners, 5,925 pensioner couples and some 803 carers across Northern Tasmania will benefit as a result of the Rudd government’s plan to safeguard our nation. In total, more than 29,500 people in Bass will reap the benefits of the government’s decisive action.
       </p>
       <p>
        These are uncertain times. The world’s economy, the global financial system, is in the throes of the most significant upheaval in living memory. Confidence is low, consumer sentiment is falling and the Rudd government is acting. For pensioners in particular across my electorate I can say that there is relief on the way. This relief builds on the additional support already provided in the government’s first budget and is recognition that, for many, additional relief is needed now. Single pensioners—and I stress that this assistance is for all pensioners, not only single pensioners as mooted by the opposition in a desperate grab for votes—will receive $1,400, while couples will receive $2,100.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is not the government’s final statement on reform. We are committed to pension reform. However, as the government has said consistently, this is a complex area. We need to make sure that we get it right. Making this down payment as a part of our economic package to support sustained growth recognises that many pensioners are doing it tough now. This down payment is intended to provide additional support in the nine months between now and when long-term reforms are introduced from the beginning of the next financial year.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government recognises that many pensioners are struggling and that reform to the pension system is necessary, but it is important that we get the long-term arrangements right. The government’s pension package will be finalised following receipt of the report of the Harmer review in February. The final shape of pension reform will be detailed in the budget context. This assistance package provides a down payment on the longer term reform package.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government’s Economic Security Strategy provides lump sum payments of $4.8 billion to assist aged pensioners, veterans, disability support pensioners and carers. And, recognising that the global financial crisis has eroded the value of retirement savings, we are also extending these lump sum payments to self-funded retirees who hold a Commonwealth Seniors Health Card. As well, people who are receiving Carer Allowance will receive $1,000 for each eligible person they care for. This is much-needed across-the-board assistance for the pensioners and carers in my electorate, who I know are finding it difficult to make ends meet.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I have said before, this is not news to me or to the government. We have recognised the need to act, and that is what we have done. I am aware that there has been criticism from those opposite, who say that the only reason that we are helping pensioners now is because of the economic situation. To them I say that that is absolute nonsense. When the time came to develop a strategy to assist the economy, all pensioners and carers, I stress again, were top of our list. They were our first priority and as a government we make no apologies for that.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I have mentioned previously, this in no way means that we are not still reviewing the entire pension structure. The assistance offered this week through the decisive action of both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer is on top of budget assistance and separate from the pension review. I congratulate them both for their action and look forward to the implementation of the strategy in Northern Tasmania.
