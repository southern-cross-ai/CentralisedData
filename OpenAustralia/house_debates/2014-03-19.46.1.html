        I was very pleased to present an Australian flag to the team at Bedford-Heritage in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt_Gambier" rel="nofollow">
         Mt Gambier
        </a>
        last week. The flag was accepted by an employee Brenton Thomas on behalf of the not-for-profit organisation. Mr Thomas is a long-time member of Bedford-Heritage and is a passionate about his role of raising the flag every morning.

        The manufacturing plant which provides job opportunities for people with disability or suffering disadvantage is just one of the many organisations and community groups in Barker that has been presented with an Australian flag since last year's federal election. Of course I have welcomed all requests for flags over my first six months as the member for Barker. In my role as member of this place, I am pleased to be able to provide Australian flags for not-for-profit organisations, schools, sporting organisations and other community groups in my electorate. It has been a great pleasure to present flags to the likes of Bedford-Heritage over the past six months, and I look forward to many more opportunities.
