       <p>
        I would remind the member for Wakefield that his policy is going to see unemployment increase by one per cent and that that is not really a fair go for working families.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, you will know that in Queensland on Saturday there was a fantastic result in the local government elections. Across the state, Labor administrations were thrown out lock, stock and barrel. Why were they thrown out? Because they had lost relevance to their local community. In Townsville the longest serving Labor administration in the country got thrown out lock, stock and barrel. A new council has been installed, and we are looking forward to great things. In Brisbane city, Labor lost control of the council, and that is a great outcome.
       </p>
       <p>
        The change in Townsville will see a bit of sense come back in relation to proposed developments at the port. The previous administration supported a canal estate in front of the casino, out in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Cleveland Bay
        </a>
        , right next to the port of Townsville. It was totally inappropriate to put 1,000 dwelling units in the port, and sense has prevailed. The new council said, ‘No, we’re not going to do that,’ and I support them 110 per cent. I would like to see the new model that has been proposed, with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Creek" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        being diverted in front of the casino and the port being sealed off to improve the security of the port. It would allow the new cruise ship terminal and the new defence wharfage to be constructed. Services to the new cruise ship terminal and the defence wharfage could be provided through the port, thereby ensuring safety in respect of refuelling services and ammunition services. It would also eliminate the need to put in a cross-creek opening bridge at the end of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Strand" rel="nofollow">
         The Strand
        </a>
        , which would mean that those who use the moorings upstream of The Strand would not have to wait for the bridge to open once or twice an hour. There will be no bridge; there will be no necessity for one. More than that, it is a sensible win because an operating port creates noise and dust and increases the amount of light. We do not want a situation in the years to come whereby residents of 1,000 units complain that the port is affecting their lifestyle. This is a sensible decision that I support. I support the new council and its attitude. I support the port authority’s attitude so that our community can be a living and viable community in the years ahead.
