        Our year 12 students are about to say farewell to their school days, with final exams currently underway. I want to start today by wishing all of our year 12s the best of luck now and in the years to come.
       </p>
       <p>
        Regional youth are 40 per cent less likely to go into tertiary education than their city counterparts. While some of our graduating students may choose other pathways, such as traineeships or apprenticeships, others risk being left behind in their education journey due to the hindrances of living in regional Australia. Where you live should never determine the scope of your potential. The Morrison government has a plan to reduce the disparity facing our regional communities. Our National Regional, Rural and Remote Tertiary Education Strategy aims to implement federal policies to ensure our regional youth get a fair go once they leave school.
       </p>
       <p>
        Financial support is often the main factor driving a wedge between a person's aspirations and their reality. My colleagues and I have worked tirelessly to ensure regional youth get access to the support they need while they study. I'm pleased to say that the hard work has paid off. Just last year we made further legislative changes to make it easier for regional youth to access youth allowance. I want to see greater access to secondary and tertiary education in the regions, to generate greater opportunities and choice for our young people.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to see our young people reach their full potential, uninhibited by the additional challenges they face because of where they live. This government, through improved access to education, will unlock the potential in our regions to build an even better and stronger Australia.
