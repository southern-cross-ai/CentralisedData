        Clearly, Townsville has experienced one of our worst natural disasters in recorded history, with more than 22,000 homes being affected by devastating floods. People's lives have been turned completely upside down. This is an incredibly distressing and trying time for the people of Townsville. Now more than ever we need to keep an eye on family members, neighbours, friends, and also those who are alone or isolated in our community. The extreme heat and humidity plays a significant role in wearing people down and stress levels will rise. Mental wellbeing will be affected. The highly successful

        As Townsville is the largest garrison city in Australia, I know that many currently-serving and ex-serving veterans and their families have been affected by the floods. Just last week I made calls to war widows with the great Legacy volunteers to check that they were okay or if they needed help. Sometimes we can help by simply lending a listening ear. There is nothing more powerful than being totally in the presence of the other and truly listening. ADF members and veterans are asked to check their mates. The campaign motto is 'yarn and motivate'. I believe that all residents could engage in this campaign in this incredibly distressing and difficult time. The disaster and clean-up will take its toll on people's mental wellbeing, so we must be vigilant and reach out to those who may not be coping very well, but that also means being in touch with your own distress levels. Caring for each other will get us through this tough time.
