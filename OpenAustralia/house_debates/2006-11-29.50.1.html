        My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Would the minister advise the House whether progress has been made following negotiations between the Fijian Prime Minister and the Fijian military commander during talks in

         I thank the honourable member for Moore for his question and his interest. The current situation in Fiji does remain worrying and obviously the Australian government and other governments in the region urge a swift and peaceful resolution of the tensions—tensions which are clearly already having some impact on the vitally important tourism sector in Fiji. Today the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          New Zealand
         </a>
         government hosted talks between the head of the Fijian military force, Commodore Bainimarama, and Prime Minister Qarase in Wellington. I congratulate the New Zealand government on using the opportunity of Commodore Bainimarama’s presence in New Zealand—which was for a christening of his grandchild—to bring together Commodore Bainimarama and the Prime Minister. I understand that there was a very good discussion. My friend and colleague
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winston_Peters" rel="nofollow">
          Winston Peters
         </a>
         , the foreign minister of New Zealand, put out a press release in the last hour or so saying:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We welcome the positive character of the discussions and the constructive spirit that both Prime Minister Qarase and Commodore Bainimarama brought to the table.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Consultations will continue.
        </p>
        <p>
         Both Commodore Bainimarama and the Prime Minister are in the process of returning to Fiji. It is the hope of the Australian government—and I know very much of the New Zealand government and I am sure other governments in the region—that this more constructive approach can continue for a good deal of time to come so that we can ensure that Fiji remains a stable country, a country welcoming of tourists, a democratic country and a country that upholds the rule of law.
        </p>
        <p>
         Prime Minister Qarase has called a meeting on Friday of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Islands_Forum" rel="nofollow">
          Pacific Islands Forum
         </a>
         foreign ministers to discuss this crisis and, of course, we will see what happens in that meeting on Friday morning. I think it is highly likely that the forum foreign ministers not only will support democratic processes and the rule of law in Fiji but also would like to see continual consultations over differences in Fiji and not see resort to any action which would be outside the rule of law. I hope that these differences will be resolved and that tensions will reduce. I am pleased the New Zealand government—as ever, a great partner of Australia’s in regional affairs—has taken the initiative it has. I think it has been a very helpful initiative and I hope that in time we will see a successful resolution of these problems in Fiji. But, in the meantime, let me remind the House that the situation in Fiji is very worrying and we, New Zealand and others are continuing to work for a successful resolution.
