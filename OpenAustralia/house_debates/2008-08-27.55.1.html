        <p>
         I thank the honourable member for her question. When we look back to last week, to Vietnam Veterans Day on 18 August, I think I can say on behalf of the entire House that it is a time to commemorate the courage and sacrifice of the many Australians who fought in that war so long ago. As the House would be aware, some 60,000 Australians were part of the in-country and logistical support that was provided through that longest of conflicts that Australia has been involved in. Some 520 Australians paid the ultimate sacrifice, and some 2,400 were wounded.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, this occasion is also the 42nd anniversary of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Long_Tan" rel="nofollow">
          Battle of Long Tan
         </a>
         . Although it is the Battle of Long Tan that we commemorate on this day, we also commemorate the sacrifice of all Vietnam veterans. We also commemorate Coral and Balmoral, Binh Bah and the range of other engagements that occurred and remember the sacrifice of all involved. But on this occasion, the 42nd anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan, we also address an issue that has been a matter of some concern to veterans of Long Tan for many, many years.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battle" rel="nofollow">
          The Battle
         </a>
         of Long Tan was a savage engagement—it involved helicopters, artillery and infantry. At the end of the day, a number of recommendations were made and a number of awards were given. But the fact of the matter is that changes were also made around the recommendations that were made at the time. This has been a matter of concern to those involved for quite a long period of time. It has been an issue which, it is fair to say, has dogged veterans’ affairs ministers over the years because of the very stoic, determined actions of the commander at that battle, then Major
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Smith" rel="nofollow">
          Harry Smith
         </a>
         , who believed that a wrong had been done and who was determined to see that it was righted. I would have to say, if I were ever in a situation where I needed someone to stick by me in a fight, Harry Smith is exactly the guy that I would want. There is no doubt that he would do the job, as he did back at that time.
        </p>
        <p>
         I will not go into the issues of what occurred at the time, or what has occurred since, other than to say that the inquiry that took place was necessary—and it was long overdue. One of the last acts of the previous government was to commence that inquiry, and I congratulate them on that, although I have to say—and I have been on the record as saying it for a long time now—it should have happened a lot earlier. Part of the pressure from this side of the House that occurred with respect to the need for an independent inquiry came from members such as the former member for Cowan,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Edwards" rel="nofollow">
          Graham Edwards
         </a>
         , the member for Brisbane,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_Bevis" rel="nofollow">
          Arch Bevis
         </a>
         , and the member for Ballarat,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catherine_King" rel="nofollow">
          Catherine King
         </a>
         . I was very pleased to make that part of a push in our policy in the lead-up to the election.
        </p>
        <p>
         That independent inquiry came down with a series of recommendations, and the government endorsed the key recommendations. Others we referred to the independent tribunal which has recently been set up under the auspices of the member for Eden-Monaro, the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence Support. The key recommendations that have been acted upon at this time, and the key actions being taken by the government, relate to the upgrading—in modern terms—of the medallic recognition of the leader of that battle, then Major Harry Smith, to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_of_Gallantry" rel="nofollow">
          Star of Gallantry
         </a>
         —one level below a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VC" rel="nofollow">
          VC
         </a>
         but a very significant award—and of two of his platoon commanders, Dave Sabben and Geoff Kendall, to the Medal of Gallantry. I put on the record my congratulations for the long-overdue recognition of these men. I would also like to make it clear—something that I have to say about Harry Smith—that Harry said to me on many occasions that these issues were not about these men as individuals but about the recognition of the gallantry of their men. These medallic recognitions are awarded on the basis of their leadership and the gallantry of their men. That is what they did so long ago, and that is what they see this as being in recognition of today.
        </p>
        <p>
         In addition, the government took the decision that the unit citation, which we believe was granted at the time by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Vietnamese" rel="nofollow">
          South Vietnamese
         </a>
         government, should be allowed to be worn now. It is an extension of what the previous government did around some of the medals in that area some years ago. I believe it is a logical conclusion to what occurred, and I think it also gives very appropriate recognition of the circumstances of all in D Company at that time. I am sure I join with the House in congratulating those involved by saying that we honour their courage and sacrifice at this time. I see this very much as being recognition of the entire effort of the Australians who fought, died or were wounded in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" rel="nofollow">
          Vietnam War
         </a>
         . We should take this time to remember them in this House.

          Mr Speaker, I ask for a brief indulgence. I would like to associate the opposition with the remarks of the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs on the action that has been taken. It has been most appropriate in the long-overdue recognition of the gallantry done.
