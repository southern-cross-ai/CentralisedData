        The shire is well known for its achievements in sport. I wish to inform the House of the successes that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bate_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Bate Bay
        </a>
        surf clubs in my electorate of Cook have had in the recent 2008

        </a>
        Life Saving Surf Championships. The championships reaffirmed the shire’s excellence in competitive lifesaving and the dedication of our surf lifesaving club members to local community service. I particularly want to thank all of those club members who have been out there on our beaches over summer and will continue to do so for a few more days. I thank them all for their efforts. Let it be another season where we can report no lives lost.

        Cook is home to four surf clubs in Bate Bay. They are Cronulla,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Cronulla" rel="nofollow">
         North Cronulla
        </a>
        , Elouera and Wanda. They all have great records in competitive lifesaving. The championships were a case of history repeating itself for the Cronulla Nippers who, after another outstanding showing, took out the junior title for the 11th consecutive time. Wanda followed up the shire’s strong showing by finishing second, while North Cronulla finished ninth and Elouera 16th. The shire nippers’ achievements are so much greater when you realise they were competing against 66 other clubs from around New South Wales. Special mention to Cronulla under-12 Kyle Druery, who was one among many standouts and took out both individual and team events over the course of the carnival. Well done, Kyle. In paying tribute to Cronulla Nippers for another outstanding performance, I commend the performance of all shire nippers who got the chance to compete and do the shire proud. I also want to thank the mums and dads, without whose dedication and sacrifice many budding lifesavers would never get the opportunity to compete.

        Shire clubs also performed strongly in the open events. Cronulla ironman

        hit the record books, becoming the first man in history to win six New South Wales ironman titles after he defeated his Cronulla team mate, Chris Allum. Nathan has dominated the New South Wales event since 2002 and the title capped a great weekend after he was named male competitor of the event, with a swag of gold medals for events including the open men’s ski and board relays, restricted surf race and surf team events. This was reportedly the last time Nathan will enter the ironman event in the New South Wales championships and he will now set his sights on next month’s Australian championships in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Congratulations to Nathan for yet another dominant performance and for his great record in the state titles.
       </p>
       <p>
        The shire clubs also performed strongly in the masters events, which are open to club members aged over 30. Cronulla, North Cronulla, Elouera and Wanda Masters all showed they still have what it takes with outstanding performances to take out many individual and teams events. Wanda brothers Greg, Chris and Doug Iredale combined to win the combined 150 years age group board relay and clinch second in the surf team event. The Iredale family is a famous name in the Wanda Surf Club, and they once again showed why.

        of Wanda and Shane Whittaker of North Cronulla finished second and third in the Masters 35 to 39 ironman event—another great result. Cronulla finished the two-week competition with a fantastic second overall. A final points tally of 280.5 left them shy of traditional rivals Manly, who the Sharkies settled up with last weekend.
