        I had the delight last Saturday to attend the Manningham Seniors Expo, organised by the Chinese Senior Citizens Club of Manningham. This was a very vibrant day of great excitement, singing, dancing, exercise classes, even some karaoke—which I managed to avoid!—and a lot of displays. The Manningham Chinese seniors club is, I think, the largest such Chinese seniors club in the whole country, and it's a very vibrant group of people, who meet weekly and organise a range of activities, including, importantly, this Manningham Seniors Expo, which was held at the Templestowe Baptist Church auditorium on Saturday. I was joined by my state colleague
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Guy" rel="nofollow">
         Matthew Guy
        </a>
        , the member for Bulleen; the mayor of Manningham, Councillor Paula Piccinini; the deputy mayor, Councillor Anna Chen; and Councillor Dot Haynes. It was a great day and a great tribute to the work of the senior citizens club, led ably by Hardy Shum and his committee, who organised a wonderful occasion.

        Community events in Menzies continue this weekend. On Friday night, there is the annual Mayoral Ball. Importantly, this is a charity fundraising opportunity for the largest welfare and social services organisation in my electorate, Doncare. They've been around for decades. They do a wonderful job, and it will be a great opportunity to raise some more money for Doncare. Then on Saturday night the Singapore-Malaysia association will be celebrating one of their regular dinners—in this case, to coincide with the Diwali festival. That's always a wonderful occasion for those in my electorate from Malaysia and Singapore.

        Finally, in this short contribution I congratulate
