        AM, former federal minister and member for Sturt, and places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
       </p>
       <p>
        A man named Ian Bonython Cameron Wilson could only come from one Australian state. For almost a quarter of a century
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Wilson" rel="nofollow">
         Ian Wilson
        </a>
        served South Australia, Adelaide, and the people of Sturt in this House. His father,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Wilson" rel="nofollow">
         Keith Wilson
        </a>
        , had held the seat of Sturt before him almost continuously from 1949 until 1966. His mother, Lady Betty Wilson, was the granddaughter of Sir John Bonython, a member of the very first House of Representatives after Federation, not to mention the owner of the
        <i>
         Advertiser
        </i>
        . Betty was also the great granddaughter of Sir John Bray, the first
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Premier of South Australia
        </a>
        to be born in that state.
       </p>
       <p>
        The choice of profession for the young Ian must have seemed ordained. Ian Wilson was born in 1932. He was educated at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Peter's_College" rel="nofollow">
         St Peter's College
        </a>
        and graduated in law from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Adelaide" rel="nofollow">
         University of Adelaide
        </a>
        . After graduating, he studied at Oxford as a 1955 Rhodes scholar, two years after
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Hawke" rel="nofollow">
         Bob Hawke
        </a>
        and a year before
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Blewett" rel="nofollow">
         Neal Blewett
        </a>
        . Returning to Australia, Ian practised as a barrister and solicitor before entering federal parliament in 1966 as the member for Sturt in his father's footsteps in his father's old electorate. Ian went on to hold that seat, except for a single term between 1969 and 1972, from the mid-1960s until 1993.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ian was a man of moderate views, of conviction and compassion. He was active in many charitable causes and involved in a number of social welfare groups, including the Good Neighbour Council of South Australia and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Matthew's" rel="nofollow">
         St Matthew's
        </a>
        homes for the aged. This flavoured his work as a minister in the Fraser government. After briefly serving as Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Ian went on to serve as Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Home Affairs
        </a>
        and Environment from 1981 to 1982. He was then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs as well as the Minister Assisting the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security" rel="nofollow">
         Social Security
        </a>
        from 1982 to 1983.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to his ministerial service, Ian Wilson had a long and distinguished career of service to the parliament. He served on and contributed his wisdom to many committees and represented the parliament overseas on a number of occasions. Ian Wilson retired at the 1993 federal election. After his death last month at the age of 80 there were many tributes for a man known for his integrity and honesty. One word re-occurred in many of these testimonialsâ€”'gentleman'. On behalf of the government, I offer condolences to Ian's wife of 52 years, Mary, his sons, Keith, Richard, James and Nigel, and their families.

        </small>
        <p>
         I rise to join the Prime Minister in lamenting the passing of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Wilson" rel="nofollow">
          Ian Wilson
         </a>
         . As the Prime Minister has already indicated, Ian Wilson came from a long line of distinguished servants of our country and our community. His great-grandfather was Sir John Bray, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Premier of South Australia
         </a>
         in the 1880s. His great-great-grandfather was the newspaper proprietor and philanthropist, Sir Langdon Bonython, and his father, Sir Keith, was in fact the first member for Sturt.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ian Wilson was a member of this parliament in two stints for 24 years. He was a Rhodes scholar. He was a minister for the last two years of the Fraser government, including a stint as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. He was very well liked in his electorate and, in fact, when he came into the parliament in 1972, he was one of the very few coalition members of parliament who won against the trend in that particular year.
        </p>
        <p>
         His life was the very epitome of public service. Once there were many like Ian Wilson, who regarded themselves as having a vocation to public service. Sadly, there is less of that today. Nevertheless, we honour his spirit and perhaps we encourage others to emulate it by remembering him in this parliament. On behalf of the coalition, we pass our condolences to his widow, Mary, and his sons.

         Question agreed to, honourable members standing in their places.
