        Mr Speaker, on indulgence, on behalf of the government I want to extend our thoughts to the victims of the severe flooding that commenced in Mackay on 14 Febru-ary. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Meteorology" rel="nofollow">
         Bureau of Meteorology
        </a>
        has reported that that was the biggest rainfall in 90 years—624 millimetres of rain fell in just 10 hours. The joint state-Commonwealth natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements were activated on the weekend. That has made it possible for local residents, small business, primary producers and councils to access a range of assistance measures, including personal hardship grants, concessional loans, freight subsidies and cost recovery for restoring certain assets. On Saturday, the Minister for Human Services, Senator Ludwig, toured the areas affected with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Premier" rel="nofollow">
         Queensland Premier
        </a>
        to survey the extent of the damage firsthand.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I announced on Sunday, in addition to the natural disaster relief and recovery arrangements, the government has decided that the Australian government disaster recovery payment, the AGDRP, will be made available to those people adversely affected by the storms and associated flooding. The Australian government disaster recovery payment will provide financial assistance to people whose principal place of residence has been destroyed or significantly damaged and to those who have been seriously injured and hospitalised for more than 48 hours as a direct result of the floods. Those eligible will be able to receive a one-off payment of $1,000 for adults and $400 for each child to help relieve their hardship. In addition, the Minister for Human Services announced that the so-called drought bus, a mobile Centrelink office and communications centre, will arrive in Mackay on Thursday and will be there for one week to help residents to access their entitlements. There will be much work to do over the coming weeks to help these communities to fully recover. The federal government will do its bit to help families, small businesses and local communities get back on their feet as soon as possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        This has been a kick in the guts for the people of Mackay. It was a huge flood, and with very little warning. People in Mackay have coped remarkably well in the circumstances. They are a robust, resilient community. They will bounce back, but we intend to do whatever we can to provide assistance on the way through. The member for Dawson,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Bidgood" rel="nofollow">

        , is now in Mackay assisting in ensuring that assistance which is promised by government is actually reaching those who need it most.

        <p>
         Mr Speaker, on indulgence, I rise to support strongly the remarks of the Prime Minister in relation to the floods in Mackay. For people there to have 600 millimetres of rain in a six-hour period is nothing short of extraordinary, as well as winds of 90 kilometres an hour. To see families with their belongings, at least what is left of them, on their front lawns and all of the tragedy which has beset them in a material and emotional sense would move every Australian to support all initiatives by the Queensland and Australian governments to support these families.
        </p>
        <p>
         I urge all Australians to give generously to the Premier’s appeal. I think
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Premier" rel="nofollow">
          Queensland Premier
         </a>
         Bligh has done a very good job in supporting those communities in Mackay and, more recently, in Emerald and Charleville, which have also been affected by flood. I urge all Australians to add to the $1 million which is now in that fund.
        </p>
        <p>
         Two thousand homes and more than 100 businesses have been affected and/or damaged or destroyed. In a community like Mackay that is nothing short of devastating. I support any initiatives the Australian government has taken, which I know includes a $1,000 payment for families and $400 for children, and all of the other initiatives that will be necessary. Our thoughts are very much with the people of Mackay.

          Mr Speaker, on indulgence, this rainfall event has also impacted on other areas in

           North Queensland
