       <p>
        My question is to the Prime Minister. This morning the former Deputy Prime Minister, the member for New England, said of the Prime Minister's energy policy, 'I've heard the stories in the past about how it was going to drive down prices, and it didn't.' Why should Australians believe promises from this Liberal-National government when even the former Deputy Prime Minister has confirmed the government lied on power bills before?

          On that point, the phrase, with respect to Labor, has been used many times in answers. If there's to be a new ruling, we're not objecting in any way to the new ruling but simply want to note that this, as I understand it, would not be a ruling with respect to questions but a ruling with respect to what is parliamentary.

            The parliament knows that, when the carbon tax was abolished, the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
             Australian Bureau of Statistics
            </a>
            confirmed there was the single biggest drop in electricity prices ever recorded. That is the fact of the matter. Yesterday, in the MPI debate, I read into
            <i>
             Hansard
            </i>
            an
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
             ACCC
            </a>
            press release which said that the $550 reduction that was coming from the abolition of the carbon tax, and estimated by Treasury, was absolutely reasonable.
           </p>
           <p>
            But what the member for
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Adelaide" rel="nofollow">
             Port Adelaide
            </a>
            fails to tell this House is that, when Labor was last in office, electricity prices doubled. They went up each and every year. The member for Port Adelaide comes from a state where a Labor government completely wrecked the energy system, and
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
             South Australia
            </a>
            was left with the highest prices in the country. In the member for Port Adelaide's own electorate, companies lost their power and lost jobs and lost millions of dollars as a result. What did the member for Port Adelaide call it? He called it a hiccup.
           </p>
           <p>
            As the Prime Minister has made clear, everything's been revealed by LEAN Australia, who said, 'High prices are not a market failure; they are proof of the market working well.' What do you think the shadow minister for energy thinks about LEAN? He says:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            In my nearly 30 years in the Party, I have not seen an organising effort on a policy issue like LEAN has delivered. It was phenomenal … It gave Bill, I, and the rest of the shadow cabinet the assurance that the Party was behind us as we stepped out to lead on climate change.
           </p>
           <p>
            So LEAN speaks for the Labor Party. LEAN directs the shadow minister.
           </p>
           <p>
            Just to finish, today there was a very revealing front page in
            <i>
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Australian_Financial_Review" rel="nofollow">
              The Australian Financial Review
             </a>
            </i>
            , which made it very clear that higher emissions reduction targets will mean higher prices for Australian consumers. The
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grattan_Institute" rel="nofollow">
             Grattan Institute
            </a>
            said, on Labor's claims that prices would go down as a result of higher emissions reductions target, that this is 'unlikely to be sustainable', would 'accelerate plant closures', 'requires higher consumer prices' and would be 'inherently uncertain'. This is what the Labor Party is promising the Australian people: higher power prices, lower stability, reckless renewable energy targets and recklessly high emission reduction targets which the business community and the people of Australia reject.

                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
                 South Australia
                </a>
                has the third highest electricity price in the world. Across the planet, South Australia had the highest electricity prices. It's also shown that the average National Energy Market price is higher than the average of the entire European Union. So these are monumental failures by Labor governments.
               </p>
               <p>
                The independent Energy Security Board has warned that high electricity prices will impact on Australia's international competitiveness. That will harm our economic growth. That will harm our jobs growth. That is why the Turnbull government has intervened in the gas supplies to secure them. That is why the Turnbull government has taken on the electricity generators and the retailers. As a result, we are seeing prices coming down. That is why the big businesses in Australia who employ thousands and thousands of Australians back our National Energy Guarantee, because they know it's a mechanism to bring prices down. In fact, it's estimated that wholesale electricity prices will decrease by 20 per cent. Of course, in addition, we will see the forecasts of average household bills coming down by $550. That poses the question: why does Labor support policies that will harm our international competitiveness and destroy jobs? It is because Labor is captive to the Greens. That is why Labor has an ideological, irresponsible, 50 per cent renewable energy target and an irresponsible 45 per cent emissions reduction target. They will harm Australian industries. They will harm jobs. That is why we back a National Energy Guarantee, because the Turnbull government stands for affordable and reliable power. Labor stands for higher prices, higher costs, fewer jobs.

                      The Leader of the House makes a fair point. The practice makes it clear that a withdrawal is regarded as an apology, but, I think, given the circumstances, it would assist the House if the member for Eden-Monaro did both.

                          said this would be a model for other countries around the world. That is why every large miner, manufacturer, farmer and industry group from around the country has got behind the National Energy Guarantee. The Leader of the Opposition talks a big game. He wrote to the Prime Minister last year, and said, 'I want to reach across the political divide. I want to end the climate wars. I want to lower power prices.' But, when it comes to walking the talk, he goes missing. It's maybe because they don't even know what their own policy is.

                          They went to the last election promising an emissions intensity scheme. That will drive power bills up by $300, compared to the National Energy Guarantee. They went to the last election with a 45 per cent emissions reduction target, which the

                          Member for McMahon: 'W-w-w-well, what we have i-i-i-is two Labor policies: the renewable energy target; and then there's the goal of getting to 50 per cent renewable energy.' 'Hang on', says Speers, 'There's a difference between a goal and a renewable energy target?' 'Well, there's a renewable energy target, um, and then we have the 50 per cent aspiration, which is separate to our renewable energy target.' 'Hang on,' says David Speers, 'That sounds like an important nuance.' Member for McMahon: 'Well, there's nothing new here, David; nothing new. You asked me about the renewable energy target, and I don't want to mislead you.' David Speers: 'Your colleague

                          , and I'm being precise with, you know, you know, intentionally.' The Leader of the Opposition, the member for McMahon and the member for Port Adelaide don't even know what the policy is. But what the Australian people know is one thing: under the Labor Party, you'll always pay more for your power.

Would the minister update the House on how small businesses will benefit from the implementation of the government's National Energy Guarantee? Could the minister also advise on how these businesses would be adversely affected if alternative proposals are implemented?

                            In all these places, it didn't take long, when talking to small and family business operators, for the conversation to turn to power prices. In fact, in the member for Leichhardt's seat, one store owner told me that power is now his biggest monthly expense, overtaking his rent for the first time. That's why the moves by the Minister for the Environment and Energy—the work he's done so far—have had great results. Wholesale power prices are 25 per cent lower this year. In my home state of
                            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
                             New South Wales
                            </a>
                            , as of 1 July, power prices decrease both for small and family businesses, and residential.

                           <p>
                            But the National Energy Guarantee is the missing piece of the puzzle, the piece that we need to introduce, so that small and family businesses Australia-wide will have the opportunity, as the modelling shows, to enjoy 20 per cent, on average, of wholesale electricity price decreases in the lead-up to 2030. This would allow small and family businesses to have more of their own money kept in their pocket. What happens then—and we've seen it today with the latest unemployment figures; we've heard it from the Treasurer and the Prime Minister with the million jobs created by the economy over the last 4½ years—is that small and family business owners will reinvest in themselves, back themselves, take on bank debt and employ more people. That's what happens.

                           <p>
                            The minister for the environment has mentioned already today: it's not just business groups representing businesses, irrespective of size, that are saying that this is a policy position that should be adopted; it's all across the board.
