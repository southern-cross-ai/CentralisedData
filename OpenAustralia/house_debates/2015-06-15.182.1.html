       <p>
        I congratulate all of the Queen's birthday awards recipients and acknowledge all of those on the New South Wales North Coast who were recognised for their great work. In particular, I note health campaigner and nurse Anne McGovern, who received an Order of Australia medal. Anne divides her time between her home at Tuntable, near Nimbin, in my electorate, and remote Aboriginal communities in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Central Australia
        </a>
        . The Queen's birthday honour was awarded to Anne for her services to the Indigenous communities of Mintabie and Mimili. She worked as a nurse at the Mintabie clinic frontier services in the early 1990s and cared for disabled and elderly members of the community in remote towns. That was between the years of 1991 and 2011. She was involved in the establishment of a community centre in Mimili and implemented health and welfare programs there as well. A great achievement.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to congratulate Jim Banks of Pottsville, who has been awarded an Order of Australia medal for service to veterans and their families, and to the community. Jim was in the

He said he was totally surprised and honoured to receive it. Jim also said helping out people is the most rewarding thing you can do. He is an outstanding person and a great contributor to our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations to Jim and Anne and all of those recipients of the Queen's birthday awards, and I thank them for the wonderful work they do in my community and, indeed, right throughout the country.
