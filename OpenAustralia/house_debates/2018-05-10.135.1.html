        On many occasions I've raised in the House the dearth of infrastructure in my electorate of Werriwa in the south-west of Sydney: substandard

        , the need for road and rail upgrades to cope with the construction of the airport, and the lack of parking at railway stations like Glenfield,

         Edmondson Park
        </a>
        . Since my election I've had a constant stream of complaints about the lack of parking at Edmondson Park. Constituents can't find a park in the woefully inadequate car park after 7 am. This is a station that was opened just three years ago, which serves a catchment with a population of more than 40,000 people and is set to grow significantly in the next few years. That's why I commend the commitment by

        at the election next year. Commuters have been at their wits' end because of the lack of parking at Edmondson Park. Now there's a firm commitment for the hundreds of people who are simply trying to get to and from work each day. I want to thank the many community members who have been in touch with me about this issue. Your support has helped my colleagues, state member for Macquarie Fields Anoulack Chanthivong and Liverpool councillor Charishma Kaliyanda, and me to successfully advocate this upgrade. I will continue to advocate the overdue access upgrade at Macquarie Fields station.

        Everyone in this place knows how hot and dry the last few months have been, particularly in the south-west of Sydney. On 14 April a fire started in bushland in Casula, which is in my electorate, crossed the

        On 16 April Liverpool and Werriwa lost a special citizen. Uncle
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Williams" rel="nofollow">
         Steve Williams
        </a>
        died after a battle with cancer. He was a proud Wiradjuri man and an Aboriginal elder in our community. As an accomplished artist, Uncle Steve completed beautiful murals in local schools and community buildings. He was sought after to perform smoking ceremonies and share his cultural knowledge with the wider community. He was an advocate and a voice for the Aboriginal community both in my electorate and further afield. His efforts were recognised when he was named Liverpool Council Citizen of the Year in 2014. His funeral was held in an overflowing chapel.
