        Congratulations to the Lake Cathie Medical Centre on the official opening of the new rehabilitation centre as part of an $1.8 million expansion. The expansion was made possible thanks to the federal coalition government investing $300,000 towards the project. The federal funding has been made available under the coalition's Rural and Regional Teaching Infrastructure Grants Program. It's an amazing facility. It will enable the medical centre to increase its capacity of physiotherapists as well as add exercise physiology and occupational therapy. The rehab centre has five consulting rooms, increased gym floor space as well as a magnificent hydrotherapy pool and a gym section. It will also expand the facilities available in the co-located medical centre, freeing up rooms for more consulting rooms and space for teaching medical students and supervising

        journalist Rob Douglas. Amber and Sam were both interviewed about their contributions and involvement in school, leadership, sport, culture, community and citizenship. They were both worthy contestants but, unfortunately, only one can go through to the final, and that was Amber. They both gave excellent impromptu speeches on what Australians find most valuable in the future of printed media, such as books and newspapers, in relation of the rise of electronic media. Congratulations to them both, and I look forward to hearing about their future careers.
