       <p>
        Today I rise to speak about a business organisation in my electorate of Lindsay, the Penrith Valley Chamber of Commerce. The chamber has been operating for nearly 90 years in our community, and hosts popular business networking events which are incredibly valuable because they encourage the sharing of knowledge, they build a strong collective voice and they contribute to local business success.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was my pleasure to introduce the chamber to shadow Treasurer Chris Bowen during the campaign and, as promised, I returned last week with our shadow small business minister,

        , to attend a forum to discuss the issues facing small businesses in Lindsay. I would like to thank the chamber members for their warm welcome. I would also like to congratulate the newly elected board: Kerrie Reeder, returned as

        ; Dianne Wright, from Wright Financial Solutions; and Jo Dickens from Kingswood Florist. They are supported by board members: Amanda Wyllie; Belinda Hill; Cathy Glanville;    Mitchell Angel; and Gordon Henwood.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since before I was elected, I made it a priority to meet with the business chamber executive to cultivate a relationship between myself and businesses in my community. Since then, the chamber has outlined its advocacy strategy, The Valley Vision—Advocating for Our Future, which was a collaboration of all members. It spells out 10 key areas where our community is either underperforming or not meeting the needs of the community or the businesses trying to operate. These are people who know our community best: the people who live, work, raise families and run businesses. Throughout this document there are 10 points of opportunity, and I note that the second Sydney airport was not identified as one of them. I congratulate the Chamber once again on their support for our community.
