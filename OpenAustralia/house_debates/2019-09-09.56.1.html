        I'm going to tell you about the local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Brendan" rel="nofollow">

        's community.

         St Brendan's
        </a>
        is my local church, the church where my mother and father were married and where my mother was buried, and St Brendan's school is where my children went to school. Recently I celebrated its centenary with Archbishop Mark Coleridge, and a few weeks ago there were 90th-anniversary celebrations of the school, which were opened by Pam Betts, the

        , the school's principal. We had a great time there.
       </p>
       <p>
        St Brendan of Clonfert was known as 'the navigator' and was renowned for his legendary quest to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isle_of_the_Blessed" rel="nofollow">
         Isle of the Blessed
        </a>
        . This school does much the same thing. It is a navigator for kids in the education ocean, particularly those kids with disabilities. It always provides a helping hand. It is a safe, warm environment, a school with great heart, great committed educators and switched-on parents. The school motto is 'Live in faith and love'. That is not a bad plan for life generally but that's certainly being lived out at the St Brendan's school and the St Brendan's church.
       </p>

        I know Nicole Cox is leading them on to bigger and brighter things. I thank the teachers and the parents for putting on the fete a few weeks ago and I look forward to helping out wherever I can. I particularly want to say how wonderful the band, Random Access, was. I recommend them. They certainly made for an interesting afternoon, especially when, like a good Catholic school, it had a bar operating.
