        I recently had the privilege, during the parliamentary break, of joining the talented students of Beenleigh State High School for their seventh annual Paddock to Plate luncheon. This has become one of the most popular events in our local community calendar, with over 260 guests in attendance this year. It's always wonderful to see the year 11 and 12 students who have been observing this event since they were junior students finally be able to learn and practise their hospitality skills under the experienced guiding hand of Queensland chef Matt Golinski. The skills that they learn in the lead-up to this even are high-end and world-class. Many of these students will carry these skills into their industry practice in the years to come.
       </p>
       <p>
        Chef Matt Golinski assisted the students to prepare a four-course meal using a range of local and school produce from their garden and agricultural department. This is also a great learning opportunity to show students how they can sustainably source their own produce to create gourmet, healthy meals. This event not only provides a chance to showcase the talented art, hospitality and agriculture students' preparation, performance, skills, farm produce and presentation skills; it also enables them the opportunity to experience success, network with local business and forge future employment opportunities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to once again congratulate all students at Beenleigh State High School who were involved in holding another wonderfully successful Paddock to Plate.
