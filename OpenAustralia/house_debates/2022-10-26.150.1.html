        The people of Mallee are known to be tough and known to be resourceful. In times of crisis we roll up our sleeves, put our heads down and just get on with it. The past week and a half has shown that to be absolutely true. Nine of my 12 local government areas are impacted by floods in Victoria. That may become 10 even as we speak today, as the flood peak moves on.
       </p>
       <p>
        The high water has done little to dampen the spirit of the people of Mallee. I've been travelling my electorate to offer my support in these troubling times. While I've seen the damage and despair that comes with a natural disaster like this, I have also seen the best of human spirit shine through in some of the people that I've met—people like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McConville" rel="nofollow">
         John McConville
        </a>
        , or 'Mr Donald', as he is known. John is a typical hard worker. And in Donald he seems to have his finger in many pies and on the pulse. He is the kind of person who doesn't command respect; he is simply given it. With even five minutes chatting to him I know that he deserves it. John led a team of workers to build a levy in the township of Donald that saved businesses and homes from becoming inundated. He and his team didn't wait for help; they helped themselves.

        In Newbridge, amid the sodden ruins of the multimillion dollar sporting complex, I met three ladies: Kaye Graham, Colleen Young and Sue Horsley. They are members of the Newbridge Recreation Reserve Committee of Management. While the recreation reserve was hit hard by the floods, their strength and optimism were inspirational.

        At Bridgewater's famous Bridgewater Bakehouse I met the owner, Theresa O'Toole. We stood in her shop surveying the damage to her family's livelihood. She told me she was committed to rebuilding and getting back to business.

        These are only some of the stories from my travels—I visited at least a dozen towns in the space of seven days—but these are some that struck me as truly representative of Mallee tough. My thoughts remain with those affected by the flooding. We will get through this together.
