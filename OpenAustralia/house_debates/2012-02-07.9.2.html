       (1) irregular movement facilitated by people smuggling syndicates should be eliminated and States should promote and support opportunities for orderly migration;
      </p>

       (2) where appropriate and possible, asylum seekers should have access to consistent assessment processes, whether through a set of harmonised arrangements or through the possible establishment of regional assessment arrangements, which might include a centre or centres, taking into account any existing sub-regional arrangements;
      </p>
      <p class="italic">

       (4) recognises that:
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
