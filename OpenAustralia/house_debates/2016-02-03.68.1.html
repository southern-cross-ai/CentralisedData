        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development. Will the minister update the House on how the coalition government is delivering economic benefits to communities across Australia?

        <p>
         I thank the honourable member for Flynn for his question. Of course, all Australians benefit from a stronger economy and the growth and job creation that this government has put at the top of the agenda. But there are some communities that have not shared as strongly in our nation's growth and prosperity, and we are determined to make sure that government supports them to get through their difficult times but also to ensure that they can share in the good things that Australia can offer.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have a number of specific programs identified to help those communities that have particular difficultiesâ€”the $45 million Stronger Communities Program, the $35 million program to help remote drought-stricken communities, $350 million for the Community Development Program, and, of course, the billion-dollar National Stronger Regions program. It was a pleasure to be in the honourable member's electorate during the Christmas break, when we visited a number of towns in his community to announce $6.25 million under the Stronger Regions program for a swimming pool at Blackwater, a town that is significantly affected by the downturn in the mining industry. We also visited a very small community called Sapphire in the gem fields of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
          Central Queensland
         </a>
         to announce $110,000 to help develop the Sapphire Wetlands Reserve to encourage tourists and help people to build the economy of that region. In all, $294 million was announced under the Stronger Regions program for 111 projects in communities right across the country.
        </p>
        <p>
         Also during the break, we announced $100 million to fund another 189 projects in our Bridges Renewal Program. There were also some of those in the member for Flynn's electorate. Many of these bridges have prevented people from getting from their properties into town, to school or to other important communication networks within their region. This repair and rebuild program is reconnecting communities and making such a difference. Local government in many parts of the country have hundreds of bridges like these that they are expected to maintain and rebuild. They have not been able to manage it. We promised this program in two elections. Now that we have been elected we are getting on with delivering it. These 189 bridges add to the announcements we have made previously to help repair these vital road networks.
        </p>
        <p>
         We believe in a strong economy. We want all Australians to participate in the wealth that our country has to offer. These special programs are designed to help those communities that have missed out on some of our nation's growth and prosperity.
