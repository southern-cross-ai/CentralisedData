       <p>
        I rise to congratulate all those volunteers in the electorate of Bass who are supporting junior sport. It has been a fantastic effort and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BER" rel="nofollow">
         BER
        </a>
        money in Bass has made a major contribution to some of those sports. I have been to the opening of the South George Town Primary School and it was fantastic to see the number of community groups that are now able to use its facilities. I also visited other schools that have used BER money to undertake work. Some of these schools had not had any work done on them for over 20 years. It has been a fantastic effort.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some of the local sports facilities in my area have had no work done on them for 50 years. I really hope as we move forward and put money into the community that we think of sports facilities. The local netball association in Launceston has over 2,000 girls playing at its facility. The community has not had any money spent on work in that area for over 20 years. It is a great facility. This is something that we should be working on. The Labor Party has always been about opportunities, and the opportunities are sometimes just about giving kids the chance to play in team sport.
