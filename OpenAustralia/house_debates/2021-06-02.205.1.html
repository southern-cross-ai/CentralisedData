        I rise to highlight the urgent need for funding for the Ballina Women's and Children's Refuge. As a former police officer, I have seen firsthand how vital women's refuges are in providing crisis accommodation for women and children fleeing domestic violence. The

        government funding is due to cease on 30 June, and the fact is that, without further funding, this service will be forced to close. The refuge is currently run by a local organisation, Momentum Collective, who took on its operation last year when the charity running it was unable to get enough donations to stay open. Momentum Collective were specifically asked by the New South Wales Department of Communities and Justice to take the refuge over, and they received a one-off funding grant from the department, which will cease at the end of this month. To keep the refuge going, they need guaranteed recurrent funding for staff positions and to provide general upkeep and supplies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Momentum Collective have done an outstanding job running the refuge, advocating for support and arranging a fundraiser event to be held this Thursday. I'd like to recognise and thank those local organisations and businesses for their strong support to keep the doors open. Momentum Collective have stepped up to do their part. The local community and the business community have stepped up too. Now it's time for both the federal and state governments to do their part and urgently provide the desperately needed recurrent funding. The Ballina Women's and Children's Refuge provides such vital crisis accommodation. They must be supported so they can keep operating. Whilst there's wonderful community support, this is primarily a government responsibility, and the government must act urgently.
