        We are proposing amendments to the bill to address some of the views that have been raised by members, stakeholders and through the committee reviews that have been associated with this bill. Again we are reinforcing that this is about safety, both for those who use it and for the environment itself.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government considered the recommendations of the committees and indeed of the Greens minority report, exploring amendments, for example, that might better achieve mutual objectives for our reform. One amendment is required as part of the government's response. It will make clear that the toxicity of chemical degradation products and metabolites must be considered when the authority assesses the safety of a chemical. We are also moving amendments to commencement provisions, delaying introduction of these reforms until 1 July 2014. This will not compromise achieving our objectives for the reform and responds appropriately to what we heard in this place and otherwise from stakeholders. The change will also give the regulator greater time to explain clearly what the risk compendium means to applicants and to communicate appropriately with the industry about implementation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also in response to industry concern, we have moved amendments to provide regulations to require the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry to cause a review to be conducted of any matter about chemicals regulation that relates to the functions and powers of the authority that is prescribed in the regulations. Other proposed amendments will require the authority to make guidelines for the way it completes reviews of chemical approvals registrations and addresses some other technical concerns. Several amendments correct provisions dealing with internal and Administrative Appeals Tribunal merits review of decisions to remove inconsistencies and increase opportunities for review. Amendments further address the need for efficiency in regulating agvet chemicals by providing that a person may apply to the regulator for copies of any information in the record of register that a person is entitled to. Further amendments allow for reduction in red tape associated with providing annual returns et cetera.
       </p>
       <p>
        A definition about the instructions the authority approves has been included in the bill to make sure instructions and conditions using a chemical under a permit are taken into account when considering the safety, efficacy or trade criteria. Other minor amendments will make amendments to repeal provisions where appropriate and to correct a few minor errors made in the drafting of the bill.

        <p>
         The amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Legislation Amendment Bill 2012 will remove the reregistration system from the bill. The coalition is strongly of the view that the only way to achieve the stated aim of the bill to increase efficiency and speed up the review of high-risk chemistries is to remove the reregistration process.
        </p>
        <p>
         This bill is designed to give the green lobby designated time frames to concentrate on campaigns to have chemicals removed. For example, the campaigners will run a campaign on a chemical because of a tenuous link with a disease that is unscientific and force the APVMA to withdraw registration because of political pressure, not scientific fact. The reregistration system does not introduce any new triggers. It just makes the APVMA run a costly recheck of existing triggers. Contrary to the government's claims that the reregistration process will increase the scrutiny on suspect chemistries, the increase in the administrative workload with the APVMA staff will reduce regulatory body resources available to deal with critical registrations and permits.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government has failed to do any cost-benefit analysis of mandatory reregistration processes for low-risk agvet chemicals with multiple uses, products such as glyphosate and iodine. It is obvious that, as a result of this expensive and time-consuming reregistration process, safe and effective chemicals will be deemed by registrants as not being economic to reregister in the small market of Australia, leading to a net loss of chemical products directly impacting on farm productivity.
        </p>
        <p>
         Furthermore, the expensive, time-consuming registration process will drag resources from the regulatory ability to access high-risk chemicals and will further hinder its efficiency, in direct contradiction to the stated aims of the reform to increase efficiency and speed up review of high-risk chemicals. This concern has been heightened by the findings of the Deloitte Access Economics report commissioned by CropLife Australia that there will be an increase in costs of $8 million per year to product registrants that will have to be passed on to users. This is despite the Minister for Finance and Deregulation,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Wong" rel="nofollow">
          Penny Wong
         </a>
         , listing agvet chemical reform as the second key example where the government would reduce regulatory compliance costs for businesses and improve competitiveness—'would reduce', not add to as this legislation will do.
        </p>
        <p>
         Reforms need to address shortcomings of the existing chemical review process. Industry supports the streamlining of the existing process for identifying and reviewing suspect chemicals, but opposes the reregistration process which simply adds another layer of regulation that does not speed up the removal of unsafe chemicals.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was to move amendments to delay the commencement period by 12 months, but I am happy to say that the government has listened to the industry, and to the opposition, and adopted our amendments to make that happen. However, I do have to say that the parliamentary secretary stated how well the government had listened to the industry. If that was the case, we would not need to move the amendment to take out the reregistration process from this bill.
        </p>
        <p>
         I urge the reasoned and sensible members of the House to support the amendments to deliver a bill that provides an outcome that actually goes some way to delivering the long-spruiked efficiencies promised by the government and an improved agricultural and veterinary chemicals registration system. If the coalition is elected, I believe that there will be more work done—I know that there will be more work done—to improve chemical registration and once again make Australia a world leader in chemical registration, but, for now, we have to make the best of Labor's flawed reform process.

          Thank you for your comments. The government does not accept your amendments. I have already given, in a very detailed way, our arguments for reregistration, and we believe that it will absolutely meet the objectives of this bill: ensuring the health and safety of the environment, farmers and the communities that use these products.
