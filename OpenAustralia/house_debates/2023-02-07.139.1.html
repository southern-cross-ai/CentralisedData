        We woke last month to a couple of local businesses sadly being destroyed by fire. These two successful businesses, Struddys clothing factory and the neighbouring
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SJJ" rel="nofollow">
         SJJ
        </a>
        Creative, dance and acting studios, were burnt down in a fire, the cause of which is yet to be determined. So intense was the blaze that the building itself was so damaged that demolition was required to commence later that afternoon. Struddys was the most impacted by the fire, losing their entire factory.

        Those who follow rugby league would know the name
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ross_Strudwick" rel="nofollow">
         Ross Strudwick
        </a>
        , who is a local legend and who has contributed enormously to the field of football over many years. As a former player and coach, Ross played for St George and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortitude_Valley" rel="nofollow">

        and represented his country and state throughout the seventies. Following his playing career, Ross coached teams in Queensland and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        , and in 1975 Ross founded Struddys, which has proudly manufactured Australian-made products since its inception. Struddys produce a range of sportswear, schoolwear and corporate gear for local clubs, schools and businesses.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the aftermath of the blaze, I reached out to Ross. I'm pleased to say that our local community has come out in support of Struddys following the devastating fire. Imaging Solutions, another fantastic local Logan business, which manufactures high-tech medical imaging and diagnostic equipment and personal radiation protection, took the opportunity to reach out to Struddys and offer them some spare factory space they had, as they're moving to new, bigger premises. Their
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        , Glenn Honey, provided Ross and the Struddys team with this spare space for them to recommence their operations within a week of the fire. I'm pleased to say they're now back, operational, and meeting the orders that they have leading into the new footy season for both the clubs and the schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        SJJ Creative Dance and Acting Studios was also heavily impacted by the fire and, equally, has received a wonderful response. Founder Sarah Jane Jones started the studio in 2014. In almost 10 years of operation, SJJ has provided a variety of dance and performance classes, ranging from beginner to advanced, for so many of the local young dancers in our community. They have successfully moved into a business next door to recommence their operations. In addition to the great work they do with our local dancers, they've also done work at

        and a range of festivals and sporting events across Logan and Queensland.
       </p>
       <p>
        Both Ross and Sarah are greatly appreciative of the great community support. Despite the tragedy, it shows what a wonderful community we live in in Logan. I want to thank everybody involved in helping these two businesses get back on their feet as quickly as possible.
