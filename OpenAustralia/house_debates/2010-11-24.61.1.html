       <p>
        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the former Prime Minister’s statement from the leaked minutes of the Labor caucus that the failure to secure action on climate change was one of the three great failures of this government. Does the current Prime Minister agree with the former Prime Minister that this was not his failure alone but hers too? Why did the current Prime Minister advise the former Prime Minister to dump the emissions trading scheme?

         I thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question and believe she must be suffering some form of short-term amnesia, because of course the thing that wrecked the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_Pollution_Reduction_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
          Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme
         </a>
         was the action of the Leader of the Opposition. The thing that prevented the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme going through this parliament was the Leader of the Opposition, as a weathervane without any convictions on the question, going outside, putting his finger up in the political wind and saying, ‘Which way is it blowing today?’ and then deciding, having done that, that the time was right for him to unseat the then Leader of the Opposition on the basis that he would run a scare campaign about climate change. Now to the extent that you can diagnose any underlying beliefs of the Leader of the Opposition in this coming and going, this set of inconsistent statements, this weathervane conduct of the Leader of the Opposition—and weathervane is not my term; it is the term of one of his most senior frontbench colleagues, the member for Wentworth—they appear to be that climate change is not real.

          Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the caucus minutes say that it was strong advice from Julia to dump the emissions trading scheme policy.

                      Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, and I could not have been asked a more broadly based question than the one I was asked and, as a result of the assertions in the question, the answer I am giving is entirely relevant. Of course the truth is that this nation would have a carbon pollution reduction scheme if the Liberal Party had honoured its agreements. But it is a political party without honour and that was proved in the last parliamentary term. It enters agreements and then it walks away from those agreements.

                         Fairly insensitive on a day like today I think, Leader of the Opposition, and I simply say to the member for Cowan and the Manager of Opposition Business that they are both warned. I would hope that some people in the place would actually have a complete understanding of what they are doing and when they make contributions of up to 100 words in an answer by way of interjection they should be fully aware of what they are doing.

                          in agreed form did not pass the parliament. That is the history. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is searching for who is responsible for that, she could try looking in the mirror, she could try talking to the Leader of the Opposition, she could try turning to her colleagues and talking to those who determined that they wanted to wreck the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and engage in fearmongering. That is, they wanted to serve their political interest instead of the national interest.
