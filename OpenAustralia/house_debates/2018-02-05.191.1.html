        I rise to condemn the horror of the ongoing and devastating violence in Kabul, Afghanistan, because, of course, many Australians are currently serving and working in Kabul right now, and many Australian Afghans in my electorate have been shocked and touched directly by the recent violence. It's important that we don't ever become immune to these acts or accept them as normal. All such acts must be condemned, and I'm particularly shocked by the most recent attacks, where trusted institutions have been used by the Taliban and

        to inflict death. An ambulance filled with explosives was driven into a crowd, killing more than 100 people and wounding over 200. The shocking attack on the Save the Children office comes on top of more than 100 attacks on health facilities elsewhere in the country. Organisations like the

        are pulling out of some areas, leaving thousands without care. This latest reign of terror must be confronted. I was particularly sad to read an article that someone sent me saying that some people in Kabul now are so scared that they're carrying notes in their pockets with details such as their name, address, age and blood type and phone numbers of loved ones in case they're the next victims.

        I was in Kabul in October 2016 with the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program, but I don't feel that I actually visited the place. It's frustrating and dissatisfying to be ferried around in combat gear in a Bushmaster, not allowed to experience the city. So I hope one day that I can visit again and be able to walk around with the people. In the meantime, Australia stands with the Afghan people in solidarity, maintaining our commitment to help build and strengthen the state.
