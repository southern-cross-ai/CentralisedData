       <p>
        The Stronger Communities Program is immensely popular in the seat of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McEwen" rel="nofollow">
         McEwen
        </a>
        . With its capacity to deliver funds for small-capital projects and provide real social benefits for local communities, it helps communities to provide for themselves. The problem now is that it's too popular. Under the coalition, this program funds a maximum of only 20 projects, with a total of $150,000 per electorate. The government has not increased the total funding pool over the last five rounds. This round I received 70 applications, worth over a million dollars. A huge number of applications had to be rejected not because the proposals weren't any good but simply because there was not enough funding to cover them. The government's one-size-fits-all approach to funding programs needs to be reassessed.

        In McEwen we have many small towns and villages, such as

        , fast-growing regional centres, such as Gisborne, Kilmore and Whittlesea, as well as the peri-urban fringe. Our needs are diverse and huge. Unlike more urban electorates, we have not one but many fire brigades, sporting clubs, neighbourhood houses,

        s, men's sheds, service clubs and groups of Scouts and Guides. They're all hardworking and inspiring groups that come up with plans for worthy projects that will benefit their communities now and into the future. But the vision and enthusiasm that this program has inspired within my communities to improve and expand facilities and services in their areas will be replaced by defeat and discouragement. Many have struggled with their capacity to fundraise through the pandemic, and the government has not listened. The coalition government must do more for our local communitiesâ€”they deserve it.
