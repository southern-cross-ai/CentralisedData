       <p>
        Last week I had the pleasure of visiting Alexandra Bay State School, in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daintree_Rainforest" rel="nofollow">
         Daintree Rainforest
        </a>
        , near Cow Bay. It is a very small school and one which I visited previously. During my previous attendance it became very apparent to me that the kids were complete Lego fanatics.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the House should know, this region and this community has experienced some horrendous weather recently with Cyclone Jasper and the prolonged wet season. I thought it would be a good idea to bring a little bit of Lego cheer to the kids at Alexandra Bay State School. Between myself and the local Jabalbina Aboriginal Corporation we pooled together $700 for new Lego for the school. I also encouraged

        's

        program to get involved by contributing some set pieces and a special message from Brickman himself. Brickman challenged the kids to build their school out of Lego in under two hours. It was a fantastic morning and warmly received by the kids, staff, parents and all who had been through such a rough period. I thank all those that made it possible: principal Gavin Irvine; teacher Nicola Cox; Jabalbina

        producer Adrian Swift; and Ryan 'Brickman' McNaught himself.
       </p>
       <p>
        In closing, a message for Brickman himself: I understand the kids are well progressed in their 'build the school' challenge and are looking forward to your comprehensive assessment. It'll be on its way shortly, and we look forward to you making your own assessment.
