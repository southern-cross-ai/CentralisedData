       <p>
        As many in this place know, the Logan region in my electorate is growing rapidly; however, the population is also ageing, which is putting pressure on our local health services. So, it's only right that the people of Logan receive the same access to timely, high-quality health care that is already available in other capital cities like Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Adelaide, Canberra and Perth.
       </p>
       <p>
        I grew up in the Logan region and this is my backyard, so I know all too well why health services are so important to every single person who lives, works and comes to play in our region. It is a vital service to many, many people. That is why I am so pleased that on this side of the House, under former Prime Minister
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Morrison" rel="nofollow">
         Scott Morrison
        </a>
        , we committed to a $33 million investment to build a new Logan Urgent and Specialist Care Centre. That was a $33 million investment by the former coalition government.
       </p>
       <p>
        The idea of this $33 million investment was to establish a state-of-the-art facility that would house over 31 specialist consulting rooms together with five ultrasound imaging rooms. And thanks to the former coalition government's commitment, this project is now underway. We had the sod turning last Friday, and I will acknowledge that the member for Rankin, the Treasurer,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Chalmers" rel="nofollow">

        , was at that event, as was the Logan mayor, Darren Power.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Logan Urgent and Specialist Care Centre, which is expected to bulk-bill, will provide a minor injury and illness clinic along with a women's health outpatient centre, which will provide gynaecological and antenatal services. I believe these are vital services in our young and growing community. I think most in this place would agree that this project is an absolute win for the people of Logan. I'm sure, as I stand here with my coalition colleagues in this place today, we acknowledge the fabulous work that was done in delivering this project as a legacy project of the former coalition government led by Scott Morrison.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I look at this project, I see the wonderful services that it will provide to Logan in the Meadowbrook area as part of Logan City Council's health precinct that includes the Logan Hospital. I'll give credit to the state government who are doing a significant upgrade to the Logan Hospital, but the whole purpose of this centre is that it will take the pressure off Logan Hospital for many of these services and free up the emergency centre for other more urgent needs.
       </p>
       <p>
        This tremendous project is one that I am very proud of, having worked to bring it to fruition. This legacy investment will add to the investments to come in the Logan health and wellbeing precinct at Meadowbrook, which will include two further private hospitals that are on the drawing board. And it shows that coalition governments over the years have sought to invest in our local communities in the health space for what are critically important needs.
       </p>
       <p>
        As we look at the Logan community, which currently stands at about 350,000 people, we only see further major growth in the Logan community over the years to come. I know there will be more health services required, particularly in the south-west of Logan, down towards
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Park_Ridge" rel="nofollow">
         Park Ridge
        </a>
        and Jimboomba, which is in the member for Wright's electorate. As we see the development of town centres and populations such as Park Ridge, Flagstone and Yarrabilba we have a goal to see Logan with a population of somewhere near 500,000 by 2040.
       </p>
       <p>
        This Logan Urgent and Specialist Care Centre is greatly needed to take the pressure off Logan Hospital and to ensure that the quality of health services provided to the people of Logan are equal to anywhere else in the country. The establishment of this centre will ease the pressure on the emergency department in Logan Hospital. It will bring an extra 60 health staff to live and work right here in our region, which I think is tremendous news. I look forward to the centre officially opening in 2024, and I again acknowledge the legacy investment this brings to our community for all to benefit from.
