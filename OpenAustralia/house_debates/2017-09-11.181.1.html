       <p>
        I rise today to sing the praises of a particular group in my electorateâ€”a sporting club that's called the Henley South Tennis Club. On 27 August, I attended their open day, which they have once a year. On this particular day, they get the whole community involved in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henley_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Henley Beach
        </a>
        suburb, which is near the beach, obviously. It's a great way for the community to come together, have a hit and celebrate the upcoming tennis season, which is opening. All of us have tennis clubs in our electorate. I just love the way that this club gets so involved in the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, their president, Liz Campbell, is very energetic and has been able to bring hundreds of kids together to learn the art of tennis, to play tennis and to go on enjoying the game of tennis later on in life. On the day, Angela Vaughan, our Labor candidate for the seat of Colton, and, of course, the councillor for the council, Jassmine Wood, were also there.
       </p>
       <p>
        When you think of this club and see what they're doing, they have been, for many, many years, getting kids in, giving them the ability to play a sport, bringing the community together and connecting families. I think it's really important to recognise that it's not only about the actual sporting achievements that they get but also about the fact that they are a community club with lots of functions that bring people together and ensure that the community gets involved.
