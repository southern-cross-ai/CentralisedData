        Today in Ipswich, at his funeral service, our community paid tribute to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hall" rel="nofollow">
         Brian Hall
        </a>
        . Brian was the best mayor Ipswich never had. My sincere condolences to his wife, Glenda, and family. Brian was a life member of the

         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        , a life member of the

        and a life member of the National Servicemen's Association. He passed away recently after a short battle with pancreatic cancer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Brian was Ipswich Citizen of the Year in 2015. He gave 20 years of service to the Ipswich ambulance committee. He was a tireless advocate for disability issues based on his experience as a father. He was a regular attender at Trinity Uniting Church, where at every election—state, local and federal—he was the booth captain for the Australian Labor Party. Brian served as president and secretary at Ipswich Trades Hall and Labour Day Committee and marshal at the annual

        march in Ipswich. I learnt to swim because Brian fought for a pool at my local school, at Ipswich East State Primary School. Over the years Brian put up thousands of signs for the Labor Party in Ipswich. He was a mentor, an example and a coach in many ways for Labor and union activists in the Ipswich area.

        He said when he told me he had pancreatic cancer that he'd lived a good life. He did; a life of service to all of us. His immense legacy and contribution was honoured recently at a dinner where we told him in life what we thought of him and thanked him. We grieve in Ipswich. We give thanks for his life. Vale, comrade.
