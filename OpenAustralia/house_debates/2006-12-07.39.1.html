        contains a number of amendments to the Disability Services Act 1986 to support the staged introduction of contestability for vocational rehabilitation services. The bill also makes a number of minor and technical amendments to the

        Act 1991 and the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999 to ensure there is integrity in the application of the law and to ensure that the Welfare to Work measures which commenced on 1 July 2006 continue to be fairly and consistently applied.

        Australia—the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service Australia—is currently the sole provider of Australian government funded vocational rehabilitation services. The government wants people with disability or injuries to have greater choice of rehabilitation providers to assist them to re-enter the workforce. Therefore, the government is introducing contestability in the provision of vocational rehabilitation services. The first stage introduces partial contestability for the two-year period from 1 July 2007.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Welfare to Work changes commenced on 1 July 2006. They are the most significant changes to the Australian social security system for at least 50 years. The smooth implementation across policy agencies and service providers is a commendable achievement. While it is still early days since implementation, the most recent labour force data indicate extremely encouraging trends towards the reform’s key goals—namely, increased workforce participation and strong employment rates.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments will enhance the smooth operation of the legislation so that job seekers among the targeted disadvantage groups of the Welfare to Work reforms—long-term unemployed people, parents of school age children, mature age Australians and people with disabilities—can continue to be supported and assisted to build their capacity and find work through employment and related services.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are minimal financial implications for the measures contained in this bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend this bill to the House.
