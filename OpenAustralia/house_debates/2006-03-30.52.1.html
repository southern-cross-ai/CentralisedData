Indeed, John Holland’s Port Hedland agreement delivers pay rates which, according to the report, are among the highest in the booming north-west ‘with unskilled labourers to collect $2,700, including allowances, for a 60-hour week’. That is, $2,700 for unskilled labourers under this agreement. That would not have been possible prior to Monday, because it is as a result of the work choices legislation. Indeed, in another report about this, a spokesman for John Holland in the

          <p>
           That is reflecting, of course, on the contraction in the growth of the workforce because of the ageing of the population. Here is an example of a big business operator in Australia—one of the major construction companies in Australia—taking on more workers under a new provision in the work choices legislation and paying them as unskilled labourers some $2,700 a week. The advantage of

              We heard on the Channel 10 News on Monday evening from the store manager of Sumo Salad, a small business, who said:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              We can provide a lot of productivity and performance based incentives. We can convert part-time people into more permanent positions so we can improve our service. Our staff are a lot happier. We guarantee some work on the roster. We guarantee some weekend work.
             </p>
             <p>
              Here you have two examples of businesses, in one case large business and in the other case small business, saying, ‘We can take on more workers and we can pay them adequately’—in fact, in the case of

                . This was a party that once pretended to represent the working people of Australia. The reality is they have abandoned that. I am always reminded of that famous statement by the father of the Leader of the Opposition, who said that, when he came into politics, the Labor Party represented the cream of the working class in Australia and, when he left it, it represented the dregs of the middle class. That is what he said—the father of Leader of the Opposition. I wonder whom he had in mind. The reality is that

                  Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Standing order 98(c) says:
                 </p>
                 <p class="italic">
                  A Minister can only be questioned on the following matters, for which he or she is responsible or officially connected:
                 </p>
                 <dl>
                  <dt>
                   (i)
                  </dt>
                  <dd>
                   public affairs;
                  </dd>
                  <dt>
                   (ii)
                  </dt>
                  <dd>
                   administration; or
                  </dd>
                  <dt>
                   (iii)
                  </dt>
                  <dd>
                   proceedings pending in the House.
                  </dd>
                 </dl>
                 <p>
                  That question may be applicable to another minister, but it is not in order for this minister to be asked it.

                    Is it not the case that the

                    presented by the government to an Australian Valuation Office valuer at executive level 2 zone 3 would see a $17,000 reduction in annual salary when compared with the current union negotiated certified agreement? Minister, isn’t this the real reason why the government is denying its own employees real choice?

                     The question relates to the administration of the minister. It is in order. I call the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer.

                      Again I thank the member opposite for his question. I have received some initial advice from my office and that is that, at the very least, the member opposite is telling a very small part of the story. When looked at with all of the facts, I think we will see that he may well have something to retract at the end of it.
