        My question is for the Minister for Government Services. In March 2017, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Administrative_Appeals_Tribunal" rel="nofollow">
         Administrative Appeals Tribunal
        </a>
        found there was no legal basis for the method used by the government to raise robodebts. When did the minister know robodebt was illegal?

         I thank the member for his question. As I've said previously in the House and as the Ombudsman's report accurately reflects, the use of income averaging to raise debts has been a longstanding practice of government. Indeed, it is so longstanding that, in 2009, 16 per cent of debts raised from a sample of 500 were raised solely or partially using income averaging, and in 2011 that jumped up; 24 per cent of debts that year were raised wholly or partially from income averaging. That was done from a sample of 500, which demonstrates the longstanding nature of this practice, and those ministers in 2009 and 2011—

          Before I recognise the member for Maribyrnong, I was just about to intervene and say, as I've said to the minister before, that he's entitled to a preamble, but that's now approaching a minute. The question was very tight. It had a statement of fact that was necessary for the specific question and there was no commentary or debate in the matter. So, as I said, the minister is entitled to a preamble, but he now needs to bring himself to the specifics of the question or wind up his answer.
