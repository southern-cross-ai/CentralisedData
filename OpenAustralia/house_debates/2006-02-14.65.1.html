        I would like to highlight the achievements of two young Aussies in my electorate. They were here last week and I was really thrilled that you, Mr Speaker, drew attention to the presence of members of the ABC’s
        <i>
         Heywire
        </i>
        program. I want to highlight two stories presented by two of my constituents who came along.
        <i>
         Heywire
        </i>
        is a wonderful program organised by the ABC. I think they ought to be commended. They are often under attack, the old ABC, but they do this program extremely well, assisted by a large number of sponsors and supporters, including the Australian government.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first of my young constituents was Jessica Grimble. She comes from Brimpaen. You would know where that part of the world is, Mr Speaker—it is not far from your part of the world. Her parents are fine-wool growers at the foothills of the Grampians. The students are required to present a story of an issue that is important to them. Jessica’s story was quite timely. She recalled bushfires, at the age of six. Given what the Grampians mountains have just experienced with horrific bushfires recently, her story brings home a lot of memories to many of the people down that way. Her story started:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Like a scene off Mars, the blood-red sky loomed menacingly over the entire western Grampians region. Threatening. Intimidating. Horrifying.
       </p>
       <p>
        For those people who have never had the horrifying experience of being in a bushfire with the kind of ferocity and tenacity that these fires have, that says it all. She finished her story by talking about the country’s harshness and unpredictability. But it is ‘in my genes’ she said. Further:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A part of me will always remain here. No matter where I go or what I do, I will always be a country girl at heart.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is typical of many of the stories that the young people present.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second of the young people—and it was a delight to meet with them and spend some time with them last week—was Rosalie Kelly. Rosalie hails from Quambatook. Quambatook is the home of the singer-songwriter of some note,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Williamson" rel="nofollow">
         John Williamson
        </a>
        , who wrote that great song
        <i>
         Mallee Boy
        </i>
        . Rosalie wrote an interesting story about Mick’s chips. This was a fish and chip shop in Quambatook—long since gone now if you visit Quambatook today; it is typical of so many country towns which have suffered a great decline. She wrote, accordingly:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        You can search near and far, but you will never find a serving of chips that taste as good as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mick_Barry" rel="nofollow">
         Mick Barry
        </a>
        ’s chips. The taste is unbelievable.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is quite a comical rendition she made as she remembered fondly Mick’s chips. She finished her story by saying:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It has been a few months since that miserable day that the cafe closed down, but still the cravings are alive in my taste buds. For years I will continue to search, but I doubt that I will ever find a serving of chips that are even close to the taste of Quamby’s famous ‘Mick’s chips’.
       </p>
       <p>
        I think she reflects the sad sentiments of many country people in small rural towns who see business after business disappear, the people who run them moving into the stronger and more provincial centres. She highlights the great challenge we have in this parliament to deliver policy that can favour and encourage far better economic outcomes for our small rural communities. I am delighted to commend Jessica and Rosalie. I wish them well with their ongoing studies. Rosalie is studying in Kerang and Jessica is studying in Horsham. They have great aspirations about where they would like to take their future careers, and I wish them well. I am grateful for the opportunity to bring those stories to the attention of the House.
