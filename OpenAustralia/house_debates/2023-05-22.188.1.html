       <p>
        Today I stand before you to pay tribute to a remarkable individual whose presence left an indelible mark on our community in Chisolm.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Greene" rel="nofollow">
         Stephen Greene
        </a>
        , a beloved local, dedicated himself wholeheartedly to the Waverley Blues Football Netball Club, enriching the lives of its members and supporters over many memorable years. Sadly, Stephen recently passed away.
       </p>
       <p>
        Stephen embodied the true essence of a volunteer in our community. The stories that have emerged since his passing have been extraordinary. From his active participation as a player, junior coach, game-day medical trainer, goal umpire and list manager to his invaluable role as head recruiter and committee member, Stephen was the epitome of a great clubman. He remained an integral part of the club, with the Waverley Blues considering him part of the furniture and someone who was always ready to lend a helping hand whenever the need arose.
       </p>
       <p>
        His absence will be felt deeply by all those who had the privilege of knowing him. Earlier this month the Waverley Blues open-age teams, players and officials wore 'Greene' armbands as a mark of respect for Stephen Greene. I extend my sincere condolences to the entire Waverley Blues community and specifically to his family, including his wife, Briony; his children, Amy, Adam and Tom; his father, Joey; and his mother, Dianne; along with his extended family and friends, during this difficult time.
