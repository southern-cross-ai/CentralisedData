       <p>
        A government that's growing the economy to make sure essential services continue is very important to each and every one of us. Australia is probably one of the best places to live as we age. With health services better than many other nations, we're sometimes quick to criticise some small difficulties that may arise and are slow to recognise that we still have one of the best systems in the world. Many developing nations are looking to Australia for training and care inspiration in the aged sector. We are truly world leaders. Societies in both developed and developing nations, like Japan and China, have historically had a firm family structure of support. But, as their economies changed, there's been a parallel change in the dynamics of support for their older citizens.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite having leading policies and strategies to care for our ageing population, we have a system that is being stretched by demand. Our population has a demographic structure that shows that, while we have a statistical bulge for the baby boomers, we're likely to have even more pressure on the needs of appropriate aged care in the next few decades.
       </p>
       <p>
        In February 2017 we transitioned to a new home care system for older Australians to have more choice and control in their care. The demand for home care, especially for level 3 and level 4 packages, is increasing. There are four levels of care available and an individual is assessed to be eligible for one of these levels. We're investing an additional $1.6 billion in home care packages to allow 14,000 new high-level home care packages over four years. Many more older Australians with high-care needs will receive the support they require sooner and remain living at home for longer. The additional investment in high-care packages will also improve the wait times for home care, particularly for levels 3 and 4.
       </p>
       <p>
        The department works closely with the aged-care assessment teams across the regions to make sure there's a nationally consistent approach to these home care package approvals. Many people in the queue are already receiving support services through our record $5.5 billion investment in the Commonwealth Home Support Program, which assists around 800,000 older Australians. Approximately half of those on the waiting list are already receiving an interim package. So we really are addressing the queue system. Of the remaining people on the list, many are receiving some form of home care assistance, such as Meals on Wheels, gardening, cleaning or personal care.
       </p>
       <p>
        Other community based programs that are available to all Australians include palliative care and Dementia Australia. In the 2018-19 budget the government announced an additional $32.8 million to increase access to community based palliative care to support older Australians who wish to pass away with the choice of dignity in their own home. We also committed an additional $5.3 million to improve care for people living with dementia, with an emphasis on the use of innovative technologies. Private services can always be purchased to help those who have a little more in their own savings to help them through. There's a misconception in the community that the changes introduced have meant less care and less consideration for our elderly. That is definitely not the case.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of my aged-care providers has presented me with some feedback and some potential solutions for consideration. This may include having a single person or case officer. Each time a new operator takes a call, providers and consumers need to restate a lot of detail, investing time and effort in building an understanding of the consumer's issues. Another suggestion is to have a file note issued to the caller, noting any agreement, action or escalation, and for this to include a reference to the operator either by name or number. If a consumer does not know their
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID" rel="nofollow">
         ID
        </a>
        number or has not been provided a copy of their
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACAT" rel="nofollow">
         ACAT
        </a>
        , their package cannot be activated. A suggestion was made that perhaps a card could be issuedâ€”something similar to a pension card. Perhaps a provider could simply quote a consumer or case number to the client and then the operator would confirm the details on file.
       </p>
       <p>
        Very often our older citizens can't always get onto the internet and they do need to be assisted. Sometimes a person moves from one provider to another for a variety of reasons, and the package and any unallocated funding will not transfer if the previous provider doesn't revoke the package in the system. There doesn't appear to be a mechanism to compel them to do so. Perhaps a compliance mechanism could be developed to ensure providers actually say, 'You need to move that package on to wherever the person actually is.' This should be done in a timely manner. These are just some of the suggestions that I'll take to the Minister for Aged Care,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Wyatt" rel="nofollow">
         Ken Wyatt
        </a>
        , on their behalf to see if we can talk to the providers about their very constructive suggestions for better aged care and changes to this system that can help make their lives have much better quality.
