        Today I rise, in the short time available, with a speech submitted by my Your Voice in Parliament program where young people can submit a short speech on issues that matter to them. These are the words of Kinuko Suzuki, a year 8 student at Sydney Japanese International School in my electorate:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        When I first came to Australia, I couldn't really speak or understand English very well. At that time, it was difficult for me to get to know local people.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        At school, I began to learn English. We have three levels to learn English and my English has become better. I started in the beginner level but I have worked hard and improved a lot.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Also my school is very important for me because now I am in Australia but I know that someday I must go back to Japan. In my school, I can learn the Japanese curriculum and also I can learn Australian culture. For example, we have integration between some local schools and our school. I met some friends. My friend in the local school is learning Japanese, and I am learning English, so it is very good stimulus for each other.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Some people think we go to school to study. I think that is correct, but I also believe there is one more big important reason to go to school. We can learn sociability and human relationships. At school we have many people with different characteristics and backgrounds. I think it is very important and interesting.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Australia is a wonderful and diverse country. People have differences and we can learn good things from each other. That is why I am very happy at school because I can learn a lot of new things and also I can teach others about my culture.
       </p>
