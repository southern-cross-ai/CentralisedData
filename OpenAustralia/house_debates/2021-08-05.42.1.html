       <p>
        In the middle of July, I had the great pleasure of hosting the Minister for the National Disability Insurance Scheme and Minister for Government Services, Linda Reynolds, in my electorate. I picked her up early in the morning in Adelaide and we headed 200 kilometres north to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Pirie" rel="nofollow">
         Port Pirie
        </a>
        to spend a day largely enmeshed with matters concerning the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        . Let me say what a pleasure it was to have somebody in the electorate that was so obviously connected to the people to whom she is endeavouring to give services. We visited Bedford Industries and watched them putting light switches together. It was a very happy workplace. Then the Port Pirie council and mayor hosted a large roundtable session in their council boardroom where we listened to those who are delivering services, advocates for those that need services—things like physiotherapists—and health professionals, and they fed back to the minister how different it is to try and provide services in a regional area, with the extra cost of doing so. The minister was very engaged and the group was very thankful for her presence. Later, we visited Orana, a wonderful workshop where they make high-quality furniture. I nearly snapped up a heap. I bought some bags for me and the kids to put tools in. We then visited the Centrelink, because Ms Reynolds is the Minister for Government Services, where she was warmly welcomed by the staff. It was a very touching day and I applaud her for her work.
