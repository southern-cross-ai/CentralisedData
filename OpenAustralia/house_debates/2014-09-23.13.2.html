        The people of Newcastle are worried about what the Abbott Liberal government is doing to our national healthcare system. In June and July this year, I conducted a survey of my electorate, asking the community what mattered most to them and what issues most concerned them about this year's budget.

And the budget issues that concerned responders most were the government's cuts to health and education, coupled with the new tax on visiting the

        has today reported that growth in health spending is actually at the lowest level in decades. The GP tax is bad for patients, bad for health care and bad for the budget, and the government should scrap it.
