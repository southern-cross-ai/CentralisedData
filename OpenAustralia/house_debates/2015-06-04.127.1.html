       <p>
        This week in Senate estimates it was revealed by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_Work_Ombudsman" rel="nofollow">
         Fair Work Ombudsman
        </a>
        that roughly 20 per cent of 457 visas involved in a particular investigation involved exploitation of those workers. Concerns were raised that they were not working in the nominated position on their original sponsorship visa or that they had in fact been underpaid. The figure of 20 per cent is alarming. It is alarming to think that 20 per cent of workers who are here on 457 visas could be being exploited. The government needs to act. This has only occurred since this government came to power and relaxed the requirements for 457 visas. They did it under a smokescreen, saying it was red tape repeal day; they were going to repeal, make it easier and relax compliance for people and businesses wanting workers here on 457 visas. What have we seen as a result? An increase in the reporting of exploitation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian worker visa program must operate with the assurance that it is going to be robust and protect workers' rights. It cannot be used as a way to replace Australian jobs and it cannot be used to supply a cheap labour source for people working within our country. At the moment, unemployment is at the highest level it has been for 14 years. It is up to 6.5 per cent and is higher in the regions where we have a lot of these temporary workers. The government needs to act because it is not just in the horticultural industry and the meat processing industry; it is going on in construction, in cleaning, in some of our industries where we expect employers to do the right thing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now is not the time for the government to be loosening up the scheme and making it easier for businesses to bring in workers; what they should be doing instead is investing in the skills of our young people. What we do not want to see in our workplaces is further evidence from the Fair Work Ombudsman that one in five visa workers is being exploited. What we want to see in our workplaces is one agreement, one employer and one rate of pay. We cannot afford to have two sets of pay in our workplaces and we cannot afford to have people who are here as guest workers being exploited. What has been revealed this week in estimates is another demonstration of why this government needs to act. They need to crack down and ensure that there is integrity within the visa system and that these visas are not being used to exploit our workers. In my own electorate this is one of the issues that gets lots of local and media attention because people are concerned. They are concerned that their young people cannot get jobs and that young people are missing out to people who, unfortunately, are being exploited. Now we have the evidence, and the government must act.
