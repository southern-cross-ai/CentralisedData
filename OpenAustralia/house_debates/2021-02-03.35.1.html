        The poker machine industry bankrolled the Tasmanian Liberal Party's most-recent state election win. Now it's in line for a thumping $350 million windfall in virtually gifted poker machine licences, and with them dramatically lifted business and property valuations. In other words, it's payday for the industry that effectively doled out mountains of cash to the Tasmanian Liberals, 40 per cent of which came from gambling addicts, and which now looks forward to its taxpayer funded reward. Federally it's much the same, with donations made and favours returned. The laws are so weak that most of the time we don't even know who's dishing out the cash, as evidenced by

        for Public Integrity, which finds that hidden donors gave more than $1 billion to federal political parties over the past two decades. It is no better than wads of cash in brown paper bags. No wonder the community demands reform such as a cap on donations, $1,000 disclosure thresholds, real-time reporting, bans on donations from dodgy industries and from businesses prohibited from making donations under state and territory laws, and recognition that a donation is any expenditure that benefits a candidate or party, like the campaign we saw from the poker machine industry in Tasmania. Instead, all we get is legalised corruption and wilful ignorance of what the $350 million could have done for the Tasmanian community.
