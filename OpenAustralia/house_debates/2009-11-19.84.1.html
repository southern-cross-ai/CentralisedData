       <p>
        Today, East Wanneroo Primary School is visiting the parliament for the first time and, given that it is their first time here and for almost all of the children their first time in Canberra, I will take this opportunity to speak about the school. This will be the first time that East Wanneroo Primary School has been mentioned in parliament and I welcome the opportunity to speak of the school and mention some of those who are here today. The school is situated about 25 kilometres north of Perth in the suburb of Wanneroo. Wanneroo, of course, has a great history as demonstrated by the coming 100
        <sup>
         th
        </sup>
        Wanneroo Agricultural Society show on 27-28 November. There is no doubt that the East Wanneroo Primary School is the oldest primary school in the Wanneroo district in terms of original buildings, celebrating 35 years next year, as I understand it. Until the opening last year of the new primary school at nearby Hocking, East Wanneroo had in excess of 600 students. It is now around about 430 students. Yet I foresee another rise in enrolments as the development of housing blocks on the north side of Elliott Road begins to fill.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is just one reason why I see a great future for the East Wanneroo Primary School. It is not really about the numbers; it is about the sort of young people who are at the school and it is about providing those young people with every opportunity to fulfil their potential. As I said to the senior students during a recent visit to the school, one day they will have a great and very positive future, adding value to this nation and to our local community. Their success—for themselves and our nation—will be achieved firstly through their embracing the educational opportunity provided by the teaching staff at East Wanneroo Primary School, and, secondly, through the support, encouragement and active participation of their parents in a strong partnership. That success will be achieved through hard work and commitment, not through luck or waiting for someone else to deliver success on a plate. It is not automatically owed to them; they must seek and work to achieve that success themselves.
       </p>
       <p>
        To help the students achieve this success, the school has strong literacy and numeracy programs with the ability to provide for an individual student’s learning needs at their level of development. Although I would like to speak of individuals at the school, before doing so I would also say that, like their neighbouring schools in the district, they have taken on the polo shirt with a vertical panel on the front—so magnificently demonstrated today—in the colours of maroon and dark blue. They look very smart in those uniforms and I commend the school community for the spirit demonstrated not only in the uniforms but also in the drive for educational success. The principal is

        , the deputies are

        and Amanda Kelley, the registrar is Sue Barr, and the P&amp;C president is Lisa McMinigel.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the visit today I met all the staff, parents and students. I would like to acknowledge the staff present—Bill Dawson, the principal; Brian Williams; Marie Atkinson; Chantelle Cochran; Carly LeCras; and Michelle Dinsdale. I also note that one of the fathers, Glenn Garrand, is here. I hope I got the pronunciation right, Glenn. To finish up, I would like to mention the students. In the last three hours I have been greatly impressed by their excellent behaviour around the parliament, and they are also very nice young people. I wish that I could mention all of their names. However, I apologise that I can only mention a few of them. But I want them to know that I was impressed with them all. The ones that I understand have contributed particularly well today are James Duyvestyn, Lauren Found, Shanae Campbell, Chaelee Paul, Tia D’Arrietta, Hennie Capello,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Mason" rel="nofollow">

        , Jake Pruiti, Joel Almond, Jack Doxey, Tahlia Whitehead, Emma Carruthers, Caitlin Marlow, Carys Graf and Jasmine Clark.
       </p>
       <p>
        What I would say to all the students from East Wanneroo Primary School is that I am very impressed with you all. While I have mentioned some of you today, I look forward to the next opportunity when I can again speak of students from the school—whether for your successes as individuals or for your collective success as a great school. In the future I would imagine that as you make your contributions to this great nation of ours, Australia, you will again come to the notice of the parliament and again be spoken of in this place. Indeed, maybe one of you will one day sit in this place and be able to make speeches about great schools in your area. Finally, I commend Principal Bill Dawson and his staff, I commend your parents for the way they have raised you and I commend all of you for being very nice young people and great Australians.
