        I have two local police and citizens youth clubs in my electorate of Petrie that offer so many constructive activities to help keep local children and youth on a strong path to success, employment and encouragement. We are lucky that both of these clubs have been established for a long time, and I have two other nearby that also support the Petrie electorate. I have had the opportunity to help both of these clubs recently through the Turnbull government's Stronger Communities Program.

        received $9,915 towards an air-conditioning unit for their new gym, which was also built and funded by the federal government. This will provide an income-producing asset for them through membership of the gym. I note that the wonderful staff at the PCYC, as well as the branch manager, Sergeant Jeremy Arato, recently told me that the club's membership is the highest it has been in years, and that is great news.

        The Redcliffe PCYC also received $18,000 toward upgrading their outdoor area. I used to teach judo at the Redcliffe PCYC. I know the great job they do. Well done to Peter Parkes and Noel and the rest of the committee and all the staff there on the wonderful job that they do. I am doing my best to ensure our local PCYCs have the infrastructure and funding they need to help the whole community and its children prosper.
