        Recently Gloucester was given some very welcome news with the announcement the coalition government will deliver on our election commitment to provide funding towards a new trade skills centre in Gloucester in my electorate of Lyne. The new trade skills centre will forge closer links with industry as we continue to strengthen our focus on vocational education and training in schools. The $995,000 funding injection by the coalition into vocational education and training in high schools at Gloucester will give them the opportunity to strengthen business and industry training in the valley and allow the students to develop relationships and future employment opportunities.

        's Metal Industries Trades Skills Centre will allow the students to obtain a Certificate 1 in Manufacturing (Pathways) and Certificate 1 in Engineering. The trades skills centre includes the refurbishment of an existing metals room to incorporate an engineering workshop and an outdoor covered area and also the provision of some equipment. It will deliver qualifications in the discipline of engineering to address skills shortages in the trades of metal fabricator and metal machinist.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over $209 million has been offered across Australia for round 5 of the trade training centre program. There are 136 new centres, which will benefit over 220 schools, including the one at Gloucester High School in my electorate of Lyne. It is certainly welcome and I know, through my discussions with Gloucester High School Principal Pat Cavanagh and the broader community, these enhancements will enhance the trade skills of our local high school students.

        Gloucester is a wonderful community deserving of this latest investment by the Australian government. The area has a strong agriculture and resources industry sector and a very large and growing tourism industry. I know

        is keen to see further diversification in the local economy. This will be helped by the allocation of over $20 million in funding that is now on the table to go towards the upgrades of

        , which span the Gloucester, Greater Taree and Walcha Shires. These upgrades will improve transport linkages, critical for the existing timber, beef and tourism industries as well as future industries.

       <p>
        I have had discussions with Gloucester Council's mayor and general manager about the future expansion of aged care and health care in the region. Further investment in the aged-care sector is critical to the valley and to the town of Gloucester, and we are in ongoing discussions about facilitating that.
