         Meritorious Service Award
        </a>
        was presented to Marion Lofthouse who has a record of community service that is absolutely inspiring. Much of what you see around the town of Harvey is a credit to Marion's work. She has held leadership roles in the Harvey Mainstreet Committee, helped coordinate the Harvey Harvest Festival and has put art into the streets of Harvey. She is a longstanding member of the Harvey Historical Society, has helped with the preservation of the Harvey railway station building and its transition into a museum, and is also a member the Harvey Town Hall Preservation Committee.

        The Shire of Harvey Appreciation Award for residents who've made really significant contributions was received by three local people. Daryl Fishwick volunteers with the local Leschenault volunteer bush fire brigade and Eaton-Australind Volunteer Fire and Rescue Service. He coaches and referees local basketball and junior footy, as well. Maureen Foss, another Appreciation Award recipient, has a deep love of music and has supported the Harvey Catholic Parish with her talent with guitar and choral works. She also cooks many meals for the Harvey Community Dinner, which feeds up to a hundred people. Taarna Cam is the third Appreciation Award recipient. She loves swimming and wants to make it inclusive for people with disability. She also volunteers for the Australind Swimming Club and helps members with their training.

        The Youth Award went to Taya Larkman who's a member of the shire's youth collective and volunteers at

        winemaker Vanya Cullen was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia for her services to viticulture and oenology.
       </p>
       <p>
        Vanya is absolutely a powerhouse. She's at the helm of one Margaret River's founding wineries and has worked for most of her life on the family farm that was started by her parents, Keven and Diana. She's been Cullen's chief winemaker since 1989 and became managing director a decade later. Cullen is an organic and biodynamic certified winery and was the very first winery in Australia to be certified 100 per cent carbon neutral. She has been named the winemaker of the year by Qantas/the
        <i>
         Wine Magazine
        </i>
        as well as woman of the year and green personality of the year by a magazine in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        . She has also been inducted into the Australian Businesswomen's Hall of Fame.
       </p>
       <p>
        Basically, Vanya has helped to put Margaret River on the map. The quality wines that come out of that winery have helped the reputation of Margaret River as one of the fine wine-producing areas in the world. They also host the Cullen Award for Excellence, which is in honour of her parents, who started Cullen wines and brought that focus on excellence that Vanya has continued and enhanced in her time.
