        I rise today to be absolutely committed to do everything I can to hold this government to account to ensure we do everything in power to end violence against women. Domestic violence figures are confronting and they demand serious action from all levels of government. On average, one in three women today have experienced physical violence since the age of 15, and one woman dies at the hand of a current or former partner every week in this country. Every year, 300,000 women experience domestic and family violence.

        I am proud to be a

        ambassador and this is an incredibly important role that I take in our community. As we know, White Ribbon's aim is to generate understanding of domestic violence. It acknowledges that men speaking to men about stopping violence against women is a powerful catalyst for change. Through education, preventative programs and community partnerships, we will see a reduction in these horrific statistics.

        One of the events I was privileged to attend last week was held at the St Hugh's Anglican parish in Inala, in the federal seat of Oxley. It was organised by Salome Swan of Anglicare. We were joined by Senior Sergeant Neil Gardner from the

        </a>
        . I want to thank and acknowledge those who attended and spoke at a moving and very worthwhile event: Bevan Doyle, Bruce Manu Sione, my good friend Uncle Albert Holt, Eddie from Kiwi Daddys, Jeffrey Mwanza—who has been a White Ribbon ambassador since 2009 and a dedicated social worker—and Greg Duncan, who led a very moving smoking ceremony.

        It was great to see so many members of our local community engaged in standing up against domestic violence through creating understanding, sharing dialogue and encouraging men in our community to take a stance against domestic violence. I note that last week we saw significant announcements by

        , the Leader of the Opposition, including on family violence leave in employment standards, making revenge porn a criminal offence and, most importantly, not allowing perpetrators to cross-examine victims.
       </p>
       <p>
        We all know, in some way or other, in this House people who have been touched by domestic violence. I know in my own community this is an issue. I will continue to speak out. I note that on Friday we joined hands to change ways to make a better place for you and me and it starts with all of us taking action.
