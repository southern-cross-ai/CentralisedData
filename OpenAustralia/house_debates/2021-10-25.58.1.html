       <p>
        There are thousands of pensioners right across Australia who are at risk of being forced onto the cashless debit card scheme. This is a heartless plan by the Morrison government to limit and control how pensioners spend their own money. In my community on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        , well over 21,000 locals rely on the age pension to get by. Under the Morrison government's plan, 80 per cent of their pension will be put on the privatised cashless debit card. This isn't like an ordinary bank debit card; it can only be used at shops that are approved by the government.
       </p>
       <p>
        If this scheme goes through, pensioners on the Central Coast won't to be able to pay cash to buy their groceries and they won't be able to buy a meal at the local

        or even give pocket money to their grandkids. As John, who is 76 and lives in Lisarow, told me: 'After working and paying taxes for 54 years, it's an insult for the government to tell me that I don't know how to spend my money. After seeing Scott Morrison's performance, I am not now convinced that the government knows how to best spend taxpayers' money.' The private company that operates the cashless debit card will also be able to see how much money you have and keep a record of where and when you shop. That's why I support Labor's push to scrap the cashless credit card. This bill will save thousands of Australians from this cruel scheme and prevent thousands of others from being forced onto it. Pensioners know how to spend their own money. They don't need to be told what to do by this government.
