        Championship wins don't just happen; they are won by great teams. My sincere congratulations go to every player in the team led by six-time

        and his team have provided the JCU Fire. The JCU Fire has put Townsville squarely on the map as a powerhouse for women's basketball, and that is great news for our city and our economy.

        are not just a great women's basketball championship team, they are excellent role models for young women in our community, as they are committed to the development of strong young women. They constantly give up their time to support local community groups, including our schools. The JCU Fire have been in five finals in seven years, and I think that is absolutely extraordinary for a female team.
