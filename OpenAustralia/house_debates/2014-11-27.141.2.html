        Condolence motions are times of sadness, but they also allow us to bring back, to the extent we can, the positive memories of the person about whom we speak. So it is with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reg_Withers" rel="nofollow">
         Reg Withers
        </a>
        , former minister and leader of the Senate. I did not know him well but, as a young staffer to Senator Sir John Carrick, I recall Reg Withers as one of the great characters of the Whitlam-Fraser years. To me he was larger than life. Indeed, for a newcomer to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Old Parliament House
        </a>
        , his presence was felt throughout the corridors of the Senate. Back then, in the much closer confines and limited space in which we operated, as Senate leader Senator Withers ruled with a strong hand. They were difficult days which saw the sacking of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gough_Whitlam" rel="nofollow">
         Gough Whitlam
        </a>
        and the election of the Fraser government, and, while I am certain those opposite will disagree, his actions as leader of the Senate during those heady days were supported by the electorate a few short months later.
       </p>
       <p>
        His take-no-prisoners attitude during his time as Senate leader earned him the nickname 'the Toecutter'—which his son Simon tells us Reg always found a little bit odd, but I am sure he enjoyed the name. However, as tough as his reputation was there was always a sense of humour. Reg Withers was one of a number of former servicemen from World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        who turned to politics and with that background brought a blunt realism to this parliament. Peter Shack's comments in
        <i>
         The Australian
        </i>
        a few days ago captured his essence. Just one piece of sage advice the elder statesman gave to the then new member for Tangney was: 'Don't trust anyone, not even me.' Another piece of wisdom this time for ministers: 'Too many people believe that in every situation something must be done. Not true. A good nothing is better than a bad something. Save us please from the nonsense that "we must appear to be doing something".' His son Simon said Reg was just interested in getting the sensible thing done.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reg cut his teeth in politics in local council with a stint on the Bunbury municipal council before being called to fill a Senate vacancy following the death of Senator Sir Shane Paltridge. He was the son of a trade unionist turned
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
         ALP
        </a>
        MP but, like his siblings, became a staunch Liberal—we can only imagine those Christmas gatherings.
       </p>
       <p>
        While he will be best remembered as the leader of the Senate during the final days of the Whitlam government, he would want us to recall the fact that he was, first and foremost, a family man who devoted himself to the service of his country because of his family. Service to Australia ran deep in him as a senator but also as a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Australian Navy

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II" rel="nofollow">
         World War II
        </a>
        . I believe his desire to serve his country in the best way he saw fit was pivotal to his ability to hold a fractious Senate team together while it was under great duress in 1975.
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon leaving the Senate, Reg Withers continued his service to his community with a successful and visionary tenure as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Mayor" rel="nofollow">
         Lord Mayor
        </a>
        of Perth. His foresight to build underground rail services and more apartments in Perth has been credited as the impetus for Perth becoming a revitalised city. He was a delegate for the monarchists at the 1998
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitutional_Convention" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , continuing his extraordinary history of service to his fellow Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        Reg and his wife, Shirley, were married for 61 years. By any measure, that is a magnificent achievement. They had three children and four grandchildren, who will obviously miss their father and grandfather very much. I wish to pass on to Reg's family my heartfelt condolences for their loss. While he lived to 90, the loss of a loved one is never easy to reconcile. Reg Withers leaves us with a record of service but, importantly, with a raft of memories of a time when politics thrived on the strength of character and good humour of a generation of great Australians who served their country in war and in this parliament. Senator Reg Withers was and remains a great Australian.

         As the member for Perth, I think it is most appropriate that I do recognise the passing of a former
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Mayor" rel="nofollow">
          Lord Mayor
         </a>
         of Perth—a lord mayor under whom I served when I was on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
          Perth City Council
         </a>
         . I entered Perth City Council in 1988, and Reg was elected as lord mayor in 1991. I will be honest: I was part of a generation of people from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         that very much saw Reg as something of an Antichrist because of the role that he had played in bringing down the Whitlam government and, in our view, contravening the conventions of guaranteeing supply. Notwithstanding that, when Reg and I came to work together on the Perth City Council, we had a very cordial relationship. We were both able to put the party politics aside. I found Reg was always very straightforward to deal with and—as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Walsh" rel="nofollow">
          Peter Walsh
         </a>
         has gone on the record as saying—whilst Reg might have been very cynical, he was never hypocritical. He was always someone I found to be very much a straight shooter.
        </p>
        <p>
         I do note some of the commentary about Reg's vision for the city. I always remember Reg giving me a book he had just read,
         <i>
          Edge City
         </i>
         about American cities—which seemed to have been written by someone who was saying that the future of the inner city areas was over and that, in the future, there would be massive rejuvenation or expansion out on the edges of cities, with Walmarts moving out to the edge of cities—that was where people were moving; that was where jobs were moving—and that the inner city was dead. Whether Reg was fascinated by this book because he thought that was inevitable or because he thought that was a trend that we should resist was never entirely clear to me. Nevertheless, it was certainly an interesting period in the history of the city of Perth. In my second reincarnation as a local government person as mayor of Vincent, I worked very closely with his son, Simon, who was the mayor of the adjoining tiny town of Cambridge. We forged, I think, a very good working relationship on a number of issues, so it has been interesting to work closely with two generations of this family.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
          Can I
         </a>
         pass on my condolences to Shirley, who I met many times during her time as the lady mayoress and who was always a very gracious person, and to Simon and to all of the family.
