       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) TB is preventable and curable, yet prior to the COVID-19 pandemic it was the world's leading infectious disease killer;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) TB killed approximately 1.5 million people around the world in 2020, an increase for the first time in over a decade;

         World Health Organization
        </a>
        has found that the COVID-19 pandemic has already reversed the progress made in the fight against TB, with reduced access to treatment and diagnosis of the disease causing more deaths;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) the impacts of COVID-19 on TB have been forecasted to be considerably worse during 2021 and 2022;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) over 60 per cent of the global TB burden continues to be in our region, the Asia-Pacific;

       <p class="italic">
        (g) our region has also accounted for 84 per cent of the reduction in TB case notifications globally between 2019 and 2020, highlighting the effect COVID-19 is having on the detection, and thus treatment, of TB in many of our regional partners;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (h) funding for essential TB services went backwards in 2020; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

       <p class="italic">

       <p class="italic">
