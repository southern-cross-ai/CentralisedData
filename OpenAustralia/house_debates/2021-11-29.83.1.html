         I thank the member for his question. I think we in this place would all agree that Australia is a very proud leader within the Indo-Pacific region, and we will always work to support our Pacific neighbours during times of need. Our law enforcement agencies, in particular, take a very active role in assisting and working cooperatively throughout the region, and they have been doing that for a very long time.
        </p>
        <p>
         The violence, the looting and the civil unrest that is currently taking place in Honiara has, sadly, led to a number of deaths and resulted in very extensive property damage. That is very concerning to us here. It's very important to the people of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Islands" rel="nofollow">
          Solomon Islands
         </a>
         that law and public order is restored as soon as it possibly can be. We've made it very clear that our role from Australia is not to involve ourselves in domestic political situations arising in the Solomon Islands. Our mission to the Solomon Islands is in fact very clear: we are there to work with the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force, to do all we can to restore stability in the region and to protect people and critical infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is a very serious issue, and, once again, as a government, we have taken very immediate and decisive action to support one of our closest neighbours. Yesterday, extra
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Federal Police
         </a>
         personnel landed at Honiara, taking the number of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
          AFP
         </a>
         personnel on the ground to 70. Of course, there are ADF personnel on the ground as well as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">
          DFAT
         </a>
         officers. Our AFP are uniquely positioned, having built a very strong working relationship with the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force over a number of years. They're working very closely to assist the local police to restore order and to investigate the criminal conduct of the rioters that are there at the moment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Every Australian can be so proud of the fact that we have elite and specialist police officers who are ideally suited to help with such a complex and challenging situation as that that exists in the Solomon Islands. They contribute far more than just mere numbers on the ground; they actually contribute a wealth of experience. I would like to thank the members of the Australian Federal Police for the work they do every single day to support us here in Australia and for the work they are doing in the Solomon Islands to support the police force there. I'd also like to thank the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Police_Force" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales Police Force
         </a>
         , who have added to our presence on the ground in Honiara.
        </p>
        <p>
         As a government, we will always do all that we can to support our neighbours in the Pacific region. I thank everyone who has participated so far in supporting the Solomon Islands.
