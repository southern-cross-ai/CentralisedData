         We support the amendments. They mirror the coalition's position on this issue.

          also support these amendments. I also want to take a moment to put on the record that the member for Melbourne is unable to be here this week, as he is sick with COVID, but he wanted to make it very clear that he fully supports this bill.

           I move the amendment circulated in my name:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           (1)   Schedule 1, item 2, page 5 (lines 3 to 11), omit the item.
          </p>
          <p>
           This commission has broad powers and we believe the Administrative Decisions (
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judicial_Review" rel="nofollow">
            Judicial Review
           </a>
           ) Act should be available for all decisions. That position is consistent with the position put by the Law Council in their submissions to the joint committee on these matters. We think that the ADJR Act is particularly useful in that it provides a more streamline process to bring review of decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
           We acknowledge that there is review under 75(v) of the Constitution and under the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_Act" rel="nofollow">
            Judiciary Act
           </a>
           , but we believe the ADJR Act processes provide additional safeguards, particularly as the commission has such broad powers. We know that the ADJR Act applies to large parts of this bill, but we don't agree with the carve outs that've been put in place and that's what our amendment seeks to address.

            I thank the member for Berowra for his amendment. The consequential bill provides that decisions relating to the commencement of an investigation or inquiry, and intermediary or procedural steps by the commission on the way to reaching its findings, would not be subject to review under the ADJR Act. This is appropriate to ensure that the commission's statutory functions are not undermined and delayed as a result of lengthy litigation at each interlocutory stage of an investigation and that investigations and inquiries can be conducted in a timely manner. A person may still seek judicial review of these intermediary or procedural decisions under the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judiciary_Act" rel="nofollow">
             Judiciary Act

            1903 or in the High Court's original jurisdiction. The government does not support this amendment.
