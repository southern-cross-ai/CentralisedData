       <p>
        Some of my proudest accomplishments have been securing funding for small-scale projects throughout my electorate. Despite the size of the funding, these projects still have a massive impact. I've been particularly happy to help fund projects through the federal government's Stronger Communities Program, projects that will benefit many young children and families in Bonner. I visited Manly Community Kindergarten this month to see their completed sensory space project, which has been built to provide children with a safe space. The federal government contributed over $2½ thousand dollars to this project. The sensory space is equipped with soft furnishing, soothing materials and technology to help children de-escalate when they feel upset, anxious or in need of some quiet time. The kids love it, and it's clear the funding has been put to good use.

        Wynnum General Gordon Community Kindergarten is another community based not-for-profit kindy that I've helped secure Stronger Communities funding for. They received a $6½ thousand dollar grant to upgrade their outdoor area with new turf and a new automatic sprinkler system. They were also able to open up their tree canopy with the funding. It's important for the children to have outdoor spaces to play and learn in, and I'm glad to be able to secure this funding for Wynnum General Gordon Community Kindergarten.

        Despite the small scale of these projects, they have a huge impact on the learning experiences of every child who goes through their doors and I'm passionate about fighting for them.
