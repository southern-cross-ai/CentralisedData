        In doing so, I indicate that the government's amendments to the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (National Regulator) Bill 2011 respond to a concern raised by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. The standing committee noted that a provision in the national regulator bill provides the ability for the responsible Commonwealth minister to incorporate into directional material a standard as in force or existing from time to time. The standing committee noted that this ability raises the prospect of changes being made to the law in the absence of parliamentary scrutiny and can create uncertainty in the law, as those obliged to obey the law may have inadequate access to its terms. The proposed amendments remove this concern and do not adversely impact on the integrity of the other reforms in the package of bills to establish a national offshore petroleum regulator. I commend amendments (1) to (3), as circulated, to the House.
