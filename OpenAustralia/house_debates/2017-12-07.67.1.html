        On 15 December, when the final report of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Royal Commission
        </a>
        into Institutional Responses to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Child_Sexual_Abuse" rel="nofollow">
         Child Sexual Abuse
        </a>
        is published, it will represent for many a victory over the evil monsters who destroyed so many young lives and went unpunished. But, for many, it will also be a reminder of unbearable and unresolved pain.
       </p>
       <p>
        For those of us whose lives have been untouched by child sexual abuse, the impact is hard to fathom. And of course a report won't fix it. But former Prime Minister Julia Gillard and former Attorney-General Nicola Roxon wanted to establish this royal commission because of the need for survivors to receive some kind of answer to the question: 'How could this happen?' I hope that next week's report goes some way towards answering that question for those for whom it is so important.
       </p>
       <p>
        The report represents a momentous effort by the royal commission and staff, including the Hon. Justice
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McClellan" rel="nofollow">
         McClellan
        </a>
        , the Hon. Justice Coate and their four fellow commissioners. They've handled more than 40,000 calls, held more than 8,000 private sessions and referred more than 2Â½ thousand cases to the police.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank my colleague the member for Jagajaga, who has been a tireless advocate for survivors from the very beginning. The production of this report next week is a testament to her hard work.
       </p>
       <p>
        The recommendations in this report must not go unheeded. It is up to us now to make the difference the survivors need.
