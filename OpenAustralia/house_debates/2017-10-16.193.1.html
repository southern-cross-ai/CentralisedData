        On 11 October 1817, the foundation stone for St Matthew's Windsor Anglican Church was laid. At Sunday's service to mark the bicentenary of this

        -designed church, it was noted that the foundation stone was actually laid three times. As was the tradition, Governor Lachlan Macquarie had put a holy dollar beneath the foundation stone but, when the official party retired for drinks, the money was stolen. Two days later, the party returned to the site with the governor and re-laid the stone. Again, another holy dollar, but a few nights later that coin was also stolen. It seems that the third and final time the stone was laid, there was no coin used and the stone has stayed in place ever since.

        I was honoured to be part of the three days of celebrations and pleased to represent the Leader of the Opposition at yesterday's service. The church cemetery tells a story of ex-convict farmers, merchant rivals and successful astronomers. It has the remains of

        from 1810, the most prominent ex-convict citizen in the district and the first ex-convict in the colony ever to be raised to the high office of magistrate. He has a town square named after him, which is under threat.

        Rector Chris Jones and the team he put together to make sure this milestone was inclusive and community-focused deserve high praise for what they've achieved. They've allowed the whole community to be part of this historic event.
