         I thank the member for his question. He is aware that a superclinic is proposed in his electorate. The consultations were only recently held in Strathpine. Unfortunately, the shadow minister did not attend, but the consultations were very constructive. As many of the members on this side of the House would know, we have now had I think 24 of the 31 consultations. There are two agreements that are already signed. There are, I think, something like 11 tenders that have already been concluded, where negotiations are being undertaken with the preferred—

           I am answering the member’s question but he is clearly not interested to know that we on this side of the House are absolutely proud of being prepared to consult with local communities. There is nothing wrong with listening to local communities. Those opposite when they were in government did not want to listen to local communities. We are making sure that we are going to deliver, whether it was the commitment that was made in Geelong, whether it was in Strathpine, whether it was in Redcliffe—all across the country.

              As I have made clear, the processes that we promised—consultation with our local communities—are occurring. The processes are well underway. Two contracts have already been signed. I think the number—off the top of my head—is 11 or 12 that have now completed their tender process. There are another four or five where the tenders are nearly closed. Of course, with a new program you will see the consultation phase first and the delivery phase second. We believe in getting that the right way round, and we are determined to stick with it.
