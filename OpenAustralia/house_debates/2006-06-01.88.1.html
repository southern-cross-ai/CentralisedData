        I am particularly pleased to be able to rise in the Main Committee today to talk about the Investing in Our Schools Program and the more than $1.3 million in government funding that we have recently been able to attract to our electorate. These funds are necessary because the state government of Queensland serially underinvests in government school infrastructure and does not help non-government school infrastructure either.

        The government schools that have recently received funding include Buddina

        , with $80,365 for several projects including new shade structures, protective awnings, library refurbishments and shade structure replacements. Buderim Mountain State School received $150,000 for hall extensions.

        The Investing in Our Schools Program is a fantastic initiative of the Australian government because it helps fund projects that school communities themselves have identified as being necessary. This initiative has seen more than $1.5 million allocated to schools in the electorate of Fisher. The Investing in Our Schools Program is enormously popular because it cuts the state governments out of the equation and means that much-needed infrastructure—the needs for which have been ignored by the state government—is provided by the Australian government, indicating our keen interest in education and our determination to make sure that we as a community recognise that our children are our future. I am very proud of this initiative; I am proud of the more than $1.3 million in recent funding, and I am proud of the $1.5 million in earlier funding. I commend this program and I salute the schools.
