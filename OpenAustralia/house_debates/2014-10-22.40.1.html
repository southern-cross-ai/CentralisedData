        On Friday 10 October I had the pleasure of joining with over 800 business and community leaders on World
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_Health" rel="nofollow">

        Day to raise awareness of mental health and to help remove the stigma that is often attached to those with depression by attending the Youth Focus Night of Nights Annual Charity Ball.
       </p>
       <p>
        As members know, despair of depression is not discriminatory. A person's ethnicity, religion, gender or age does not matterâ€”this despair can be felt by anyone, and too often a person who suffers from its impact believes that their only way to find solace is through suicide. According to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Bureau of Statistics
        </a>
        <i>
         Causes of death report
        </i>
        there were 2,535 reports of death due to suicide in 2012, equating to almost seven deaths by suicide in Australia each day. It is because of these staggering numbers that it is vital we have organisations in our communities who have the necessary people and resources to support those who seek help.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my electorate of Swan, Youth Focus is one such organisation whose life-saving work in youth suicide prevention I have been humbled to support in this place and in the community. I am pleased to inform the House that the charity ball was once again successful in raising much-needed funds for Youth Focus, who do not get any government support at all, to provide these support services, matching their fundraising efforts from last year of about $500,000. Congratulations to everyone at Youth Focus and their commitment to making a difference and supporting the lives of so many young Western Australians. The fundraising efforts I witnessed by all those in attendance was magnificent. I also acknowledge that the Hon. Helen Morton
