        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to his failure to answer my question yesterday about the $2.5 billion tax grab from gas field condensate announced in the budget. Is the Prime Minister aware that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        relies on natural gas for more than 50 per cent of its energy needs, including electricity generation? Can the Prime Minister guarantee that his new $2.5 billion tax will not drive up the price of domestic gas and electricity for pensioners, households and businesses in Western Australia?

           I do not think that was the coup d’etat arrangement. Wasn’t it supposed to be Wentworth and not Curtin? On the condensate arrangement, it was actually instituted back then in order to provide encouragement for the industry to start with. That is the first point. Secondly, that is quite a long time ago, and since that time the industry has not only become profitable and been established; if you look at the return to the industry concerned, its actual profits in recent years have been not just in the hundreds of millions of dollars but in the billions of dollars.
          </p>
          <p>
           What this seeks to do is to actually close a tax loophole which has existed for a long, long time and, furthermore, to use those taxation measures to underpin the robustness and the financial integrity of this budget, with its $22 billion surplus, which is necessary as an instrument of economic responsibility. What we have witnessed in this chamber just now with this debate and this vote is quite remarkable. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition—

            Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order, on relevance. The Prime Minister was asked to give a guarantee that his $2.5 billion tax grab would not drive up prices of electricity and domestic gas in

             <p>
              As I said, these measures close a loophole which has long existed. I suggest that those opposite look at the original rationale for the measure in question, which is to do with the establishment of this industry in the first place, and then look secondly at the actual returns which those companies are generating by way of profit now. Given their preferential taxation treatment, I have a simple response: let’s use that revenue to assist families under pressure; let’s use that revenue to start doing something about investing in the schools of
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
               Western Australia
              </a>
              ; let’s use that revenue to invest in the hospitals of Western Australia; let’s close a tax loophole that in fact can deliver revenue to the overall integrity also of the budget. This debate has been quite extraordinary, because those opposite have just voted against FuelWatch.

                   One of the great principles of politics in this place for the Manager of Opposition Business is: the greater the volume the lesser the content. What we have had most recently is a complete tactical implosion on their side of the House. They know what has happened. They moved their censure motion, we moved a substantive amendment and we asked them to vote one way or the other on supporting this fuel tax measure—

                       On the question of condensate, it is quite clear where our position lies—that is, that that revenue stream should be delivered to assist working families, including in ensuring that that money we have allocated to the establishment of national FuelWatch, some $20 million, can be delivered from an appropriate and secure revenue stream for the Commonwealth.

                                So condensate and all the other measures in the budget represent an exercise in financial integrity. The measures represent how you construct a robust surplus for the Commonwealth and how you produce, through that surplus, insurance for Australia’s long-term economic interest and sufficient revenue flow to ensure that we can help working families on the way through, including by establishing a national FuelWatch scheme. The direct connection between the two propositions is quite clear-cut. Those opposite have just voted against FuelWatch. They have tried to deploy every procedural device to avoid the vote. They voted against it and now they are seeking to wriggle out from under. It is quite clear-cut.
