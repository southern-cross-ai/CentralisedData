        It is with much pride that I rise today to acknowledge the work, passion and dedication of some of our most remarkable local citizens, acknowledged on both the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penrith_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Penrith City Council
        </a>
        's honours list and the Australia Day Honours List. Firstly, I would like to recognise
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_Plains" rel="nofollow">
         Emu Plains
        </a>
        resident
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Mitchell" rel="nofollow">
         Barbara Mitchell
        </a>
        . Barbara was awarded an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Australia_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Order of Australia Medal
        </a>
        for her incredible service and dedication to the international community of Bangladesh through a humanitarian medical program. By day, Barbara works as a nurse, but since 2007 Barbara has organised a self-funded team of medical professionals to travel to Bangladesh. There they perform life-saving surgeries on young children whose families cannot afford to pay for some of these much-needed transformational operations. So far, they have performed 639 operations, including for cleft palates and for children who have suffered from severe burns or have had foot deformities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I also stand to acknowledge the work of

       </p>

        I would also like to acknowledge David Bentham, who has won an Order of Australia Medal for serving on the board of the

        I would also like to acknowledge the citizens recognised by Penrith City Councilâ€”in particular Penrith Citizen of the Year David Currie. David was an inspiration for and a champion of people with a disability. A local for 70 years he, for many decades, has devoted his time to several charities and to campaigning for the rights of people with a disability.
