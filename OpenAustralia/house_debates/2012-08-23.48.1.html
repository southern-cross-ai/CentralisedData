        Earlier this week I raised the issue of poverty in regard to letters I received from Pastor Louise Shanks and young people in my electorate who were inspired to speak out about the issue of poverty and injustice in our world. I shared with the House how the teacher found that she was educated by the young people rather than the young people being educated by her. She talked about a young girl aged seven who gives 30 per cent of her pocket money to help poor children and a boy aged nine who runs a garage sale every month to raise money to send to poor people in other counties. Then there is Ned, who is 10 and has already been to Canberra with his dad for a demonstration to try to raise awareness about the issues surrounding world poverty. A young girl of 11 said, 'I make sure I only have as many clothes as I need. The rest I give away.' These are inspiring young people.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Monday I read out some of the letters that I received from young people in the electorate who were begging me and the members of parliament to think about people living in poverty throughout the world. I seek leave to table the letters from the young people who attended the Lakeside Baptist Church.
       </p>

        Leave granted.
