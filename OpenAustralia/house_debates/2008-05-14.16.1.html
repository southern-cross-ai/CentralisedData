          The opposition have no objection to these amendments. There is good reason why we need to pass these measures quickly. I do note that all of the measures are coalition policy, either introduced or announced by the previous coalition government, with the exception of the tax deductibility for political donations. I just might say on that matter that the opposition are very, very happy to have a debate about the funding of political parties in Australia. I think it is a very important debate. What we do object to is this cynical exercise of including within a tax bill a measure that should appropriately be referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, where these matters are traditionally debated at the conclusion of any election in Australia. I think it is a good indication of the cynicism of this new government that they would include a measure like this within a tax bill with these much needed measures. As I have said, we are very happy to have a conversation about the funding of political parties in Australia. It is a terribly important discussion, but it is not one that we should have in relation to a tax laws amendment bill. I support what the government is doing in bringing these measures forward. This has the support of the opposition.
