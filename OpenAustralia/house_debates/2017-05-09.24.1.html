        I wish to inform the House of an amazing night that the Rochester community had last Friday. It was the same week that Murray Goulburn announced it was going to close its dairy processing plant in the town in the next three to six months, but this particular night was a time for the Rochester community to come out and celebrate the decision of local legend

        to donate his entire collection of sporting memorabilia to a community museum.
       </p>
       <p>
        Video messages were played, from the great

        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merv_Hughes" rel="nofollow">

        and a range of other sporting identities. There was a message from

        . There were panellists, including Brownlow medallists, who were there to pay homage to a sporting legend who for many years has worked for the Puma sporting goods company. It was a celebration of his life, even though he is still with us. It sounded a little like a wake, with all the testimonies throughout the night, giving so much adulation to the character of John Forbes, who has always been there for many sports stars when they have been going through tough times. Australian netballers of the past—

        , a local from Lockington, and Liz Tavenor from Shepparton—were also there to pay homage to the bloke who was best known as 'Forbsey'. His collection, which has been collected over many years, will be given to the Rochester community to show forever.
