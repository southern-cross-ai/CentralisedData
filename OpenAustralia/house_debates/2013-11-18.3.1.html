       <p>
        I rise today to address an issue which is one of the most serious and distressing that our community faces. That is violence against women, and particularly, domestic violence. As members of the House would appreciate, 25 November is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Ribbon" rel="nofollow">
         White Ribbon
        </a>
        Day, observed as the United Nations' International Day of the Elimination of Violence Against Women.
       </p>
       <p>
        A recent campaign by White Ribbon Australia labels domestic violence as our 'nation's most shameful secret'. The statistics, quite frankly, back this up, when you consider that one in three women in our country will experience violence in their lifetime and one in five women will experience sexual violence. A local police officer asked me recently whether I realised that each week at least one woman dies from violence at home. I have to say that I did not know that. According to police, domestic violence exceeds street crime as the fastest growing form of assault. As a matter of fact, Detective Superintendent James Johnson of the Green Valley Local Area Command advised me that, in his command, in excess of 50 per cent of local police work is related to domestic violence. The reason the scourge of domestic violence has become a central focus is that, unfortunately, 64 per cent of violence against women occurs at home. For most of us, home is a place where we feel safe; it is our private refuge from the world. Sadly, for many women and children home is a place of fear, pain and loathing.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important to note that under-reporting is still an issue in this country. It is currently estimated that 64 per cent of physical assaults against women are not reported. Even more staggeringly, more than 80 per cent of sexual assaults against women go unreported. Under-reporting is particularly prevalent within multicultural communities, where victims often lack confidence to turn to authorities, and attitudes towards domestic violence may differ depending on the areas people have emigrated from.
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <i>
         National Survey on Community Attitudes to Violence Against Women 2009
        </i>
        found some truly worrying facts regarding attitudes to violence against women from selected culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. Of respondents from these backgrounds, 45 per cent expressed the belief that domestic violence was excusable if the perpetrator got 'so angry that they temporarily lost control'. To compare that with the broader community, 18 per cent agreed with this view. Nearly 60 per cent of respondents from culturally diverse backgrounds also stated that domestic violence was excusable if the perpetrator 'truly regretted what they did'. That would be a truly alarming attitude for any of us.
       </p>
       <p>
        We need to make it clear that, no matter where you come from, domestic violence is a crime. We need to not only look after the victims of domestic violence; we need to make it very clear to the perpetrators of domestic violence that it is a crime and it is a crime that will be punished. Although no section of the community is immune to domestic violence and violence against women, women from Indigenous communities, from newly arrived ethnic backgrounds and from low socioeconomic communities are at greater risk. My community is the most multicultural electorate in the whole of Australia, so this has some specific interest for me. My community is also rated lowly on the socioeconomic ranking.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is another issue that needs to be addressed. We need to improve the relationship and trust between victims and, particularly, law enforcement agencies. As a community we need to make sure we make the stand that violence against women is simply intolerable. The local police in my electorate have seen an increase, of between five and 10 per cent, in the reporting rates of domestic violence over a 12-month period. That does not necessarily mean there is increased domestic violence; it just means that the message is getting through and women are becoming more confident about notifying authorities of domestic violence.
       </p>
       <p>
        Domestic violence is one of the most serious issues affecting our community. It causes serious health problems. And I now know that one woman a week dies as a consequence of domestic violence. Also, it is one of the leading causes of homelessness for women. To add to the social costs—how domestic violence impacts on victims—violence against women costs our economy an estimated $14.7 billion in the past year. Unaddressed, this cost to the community will skyrocket.
       </p>
       <p>
        We need common definitions of what constitutes domestic violence in this country and a common strategy for tackling the issue. We need to make it easier for our law enforcement agencies, as well as social and government agencies, to assist the victims. One of our main motives in tackling domestic violence and violence against women should be in addressing the cyclical nature of this crime. I ask members of the House to appreciate the fact that the evidence suggests that 50 per cent of girls growing up in abusive households end up being abused by their husbands. What is even more staggering is that 60 per cent of young boys growing up in a similar sort of household are likely to become abusers themselves. This is not an area where we can afford to put our heads in the sand and say, 'This is a matter to be dealt with by the authorities.' This is a matter that must be dealt with by us and the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The International Violence Against Women Survey conducted by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Bureau of Statistics
        </a>
        found that a history of victimization—whether the victim is a child or an adult—is a strong predictor of future victimization. Members, this destructive cycle must stop. I am proud to say that my local community is standing up and is certainly trying to make a change when it comes to the issue of domestic violence. On Friday, together with Detective Superintendent Jim Johnson, I will be addressing a forum on violence against women organised by the Liverpool Migrant Resource Centre. Liverpool
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRC" rel="nofollow">
         MRC
        </a>
        , led by Jimmy Mtashar, has done much over the years to address domestic violence, particularly in newly-arrived ethnic communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also on Friday, I will be opening the White Ribbon function at the Cabramatta Community Centre organised, once again, by the Fairfield Migrant Resource Centre. I thank in advance Dr Simon Emsley from the migrant resource centre who has taken on a proactive leadership role in my community in raising and tackling the issue of domestic violence.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 6 December, which marks Stop Domestic Violence Day, I will join the local Aboriginal women's group 'Sistas for Sistas', the Liverpool Women's Resource Centre and Green Valley Local Area Command at the Know Us Respect Us event. These are people coming together to say, 'Enough is enough; we must make a stand. This is not an issue for the police and the welfare agencies; this is an issue for us.' Being in this chamber means we are community leaders; we must all make sure that we commit ourselves to making a genuine stand against violence against women and children.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate all the people involved in this and I encourage everyone to increase their activity. As community leaders in the parliament we can be proud of many things but one thing we cannot be proud of is the level of domestic violence occurring in our communities. This is a cancer on our communities—one which can be stopped if we have the will to do it. I encourage members to observe White Ribbon Day on 25 November. Please make a stand in your communities.

         ( Madam Speaker Bishop, as this is my first address in this new, 44th
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Parliament of Australia
         </a>
         , in the greatest nation in the world, I would like to congratulate you on your election to such high office. I have been intimately associated with you in and out of this House. In fact, we have had an in-and-out relationship. You have been going in and I have been going out on a number of occasions. I congratulate you and wish you all the best in your position as Speaker of this House and in the role that you will play.
        </p>
        <p>
         I commend the member for Fowler for his motion today. I know that the member for Fowler has been consistently an advocate on behalf of women, especially with regard to violence against women. What I am about to say has been said too many times by too many others in this place and in other places: to hit a woman is unacceptable; to hit a woman is cowardly; to hit a women degrades the men of this nation.
        </p>
        <p>
         I continue to be disgusted. We must find a way forward—not just for women who suffer through domestic violence but for their children. We must do it for people in schools, people in businesses and for relatives and friends—all of us. We are all diminished in this face of this. We are all made less by not being able to make it stop.
        </p>
        <p>
         I have experienced a situation in my own business where this issue was hidden from the employer. I did not know that the woman on staff was not clumsy; there was an issue. When, like me, you come from a household where there is no domestic violence you have no idea that it occurs. You take that ignorance into the workplace and expect that domestic violence would never happen to your staff, that it would not happen in families. It does. The honourable member for Gippsland knows, like I do, that the reports from our collective electorates have been unacceptable to him and me. We are taking action, and I will come to that in a minute.
        </p>
        <p>
         Violence against women is a cancer that gnaws at society and that seemingly and inexplicably is getting worse by the day.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Ribbon" rel="nofollow">
          White Ribbon
         </a>
         Day on 25 November is a day dedicated to raising awareness as well as eliminating violence against women across this nation. But, in a sense, every day should be White Ribbon Day. There needs to be a cultural shift in our attitude. This has been my desire—that across Gippsland and the seat of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMillan" rel="nofollow">
          McMillan
         </a>
         there will be a cultural shift that starts at kindergarten, through to junior football and cricket and soccer, where the men of this nation say to the junior men of this nation that this practice is unacceptable. It has to be not just a shift to a new government program with more money being spent on the issue when there is no change happening and we end up back in this place talking once again about the figures.
        </p>
        <p>
         Whether it is in Eden-Monaro, coming down close to Gippsland, or anywhere else, this is not a rural issue—it is a country-city issue; it is a male issue. One of the best ads I ever saw was with the guys sitting in the bar and the other fellow comes in and says he straightened out the wife so he can stay with his mates, and they all just disown him. It is not just enough to disown him—there has to be a cultural shift. The tribe has to decide in each community, in each small town, in each group what is culturally acceptable, and domestic violence towards women is absolutely unacceptable. This has to be trained into the hearts and minds of our communities. Then we can grab hold of a cultural shift, determined that the people of this nation will say that this is a nation that has completely changed its attitude towards violence against women. The nation will change—Gippsland will change,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Gippsland" rel="nofollow">
          South Gippsland
         </a>
         will change,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Gippsland" rel="nofollow">
          West Gippsland
         </a>
         will change.
        </p>
        <p>
         I am making this a local issue because it is happening in my area and it is happening in the member for Gippsland's area. It is on our patch. We see the results of it. Quite often the people who come to our members' offices do not tell us they are victims of domestic violence—they have just been evicted or are without a house and need some help; they are having trouble with their children and they need some help. Through my life I have had the great opportunity to deal with some amazing people who have raised funds themselves and have purchased houses and run organisations where women in fear could run to safety. If it is not in your family, you have no idea. If you are a truck driver on the road and it is not in your family, you have no idea. If you are a farmer in a family that has never experienced domestic violence, you have no idea. But those who are affected live in fear, live in pain, and give responses to their friends and colleagues and families that are unusual. Ask why do people respond like this; why do these children respond in such a manner?
        </p>
        <p>
         I know there are new members of this House who will make magnificent contributions on women's issues and particularly domestic violence. I know the desire of the member for Fowler and the member for Gippsland and the member for Eden-Monaro, because we are connected—we have a desire to lead the way in this cultural shift so that members of this House look to Gippsland and say that we actually did something about it. We have white ribbons on today—we have to wear all sorts of things into this House and I wonder whether the world notices. I have signed a pledge that I will do all I can, make every endeavour, to have a cultural shift in Gippsland, in McMillan, and in Eden-Monaro, on violence against women so that there might be a deep maroon glow across the area that signifies that there has been a cultural shift—a cultural shift in the

I went to some local people and they said that yes they would like to make a change. It is just a breakfast, but who is coming? Community leaders are coming, and we are beginning the cultural shift that will change a nation.
