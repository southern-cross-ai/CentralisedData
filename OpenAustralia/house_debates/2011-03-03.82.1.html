          I thank members on my left for their advice. Like when it is done on my right, what you have now done is save the Leader of the House from a warning. If you do not think that I can deal with things by myself and if you continue to interject for the whole 50 minutes, I will not—I will not—have no reaction to that. The Leader of the House knows that that was not a point of order. The Leader of the Opposition has the call. The House might indicate that it takes these matters seriously by sitting there quietly. The Leader of the Opposition has the call.

            Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The capacity to move for the suspension of standing orders during question time is afforded under the standing orders. The practice has been, for a very long period of time, that it is moved in exceptional or rare circumstances, not every day. To move the motion, as the Leader of the Opposition has done, every day this week at a particular time, is an abuse—

               No. The Minister for Defence will resume his seat. I simply say that the action is permissible under the standing orders. There may be some vague strain in precedent that indicates and supports what has been put to me, but I have not actually read it. The Leader of the Opposition has the call.

This Prime Minister and this government are committed to a tax which is explicitly designed to raise Australians’ cost of living and which is explicitly designed to drive manufacturing jobs offshore. This tax has to close down the coal industry because the coal industry is an emitter. This tax has to close down industries which are high-emissions industries. That is the whole point and purpose of the tax—only she is not closing down the coal industry overseas, she is not closing down manufacturing industry overseas; her tax is closing down the coal industry here and the manufacturing industry here. That is why it is such a bad tax and that is why this Prime Minister and this government should be censured by the House.

                 <p>
                  The very purpose of this tax is to make every single Australian’s life more expensive when he or she turns on the light or when he or she gets into a motor car. That is the whole point of this tax. What has happened here is that the Greens have kick-started this great big new tax. They hijacked the Prime Minister’s courtyard on Thursday of last week. They took over the Prime Minister’s press conference on Thursday of last week. They have commandeered the government’s climate change policy, as they have commandeered the policies on so much else. Whether it is climate change or gay marriage, the Greens are in charge and Bob Brown is the real Prime Minister of this country. Labor is in office but the Greens are in power.

                   <p>
                    Mr Speaker, I take that point. It is very important that we should suspend standing orders so that the people of Australia might understand exactly what this government is doing. The three wise men of the Labor Party have woken up to the fact that the government has been hijacked by the Greens. That is why they were in the Prime Minister’s office yesterday at 10.30 demanding that she change her position.
                   </p>
                   <p>
                    What have we got here? This is why it is so important to suspend standing orders. We have got yet another big new tax on top of the mining tax and on top of the flood tax. This is the third new tax that this government wants to introduce this year. We have got a government that has no mandate whatsoever. In fact, if anything, it has a mandate not to introduce a carbon tax. Now we have deliberate disruption from members opposite.

                             I second the motion. We move this motion out of a sense of frustration that the Prime Minister will not answer questions on the most basic aspects of a new tax that she has announced.

                             , the Prime Minister went with the Leader of the Greens into the Prime Minister’s courtyard, they were asked questions on the details of the new carbon tax and they refused to answer those questions. Since then, we have had new evidence, from a

                                So, each day during question time, we have moved to suspend standing orders to bring on a debate about the carbon tax. After frustrated attempts by this government to close down proper debate; after the government has failed to explain to the Australian people how much the tax will raise, how it will be applied, what industries will be left behind, what industries will grow; after the Treasurer yesterday talked about specific job figures and then refused to acknowledge that they were calculated based on a carbon price of $45 a tonne, we are seeking to suspend standing orders so the Australian people can get some answers. The Australian people want to know exactly what this new tax is going to do to them and how they are going to pay their bills. Every time we come into this place seeking answers to simple questions, as my colleague sought a simple answer to a question about steel jobs—

                                       Because we cannot get simple, straightforward, honest answers from the government about a tax that they have announced, here in question time we have asked them question after question about the impact of their new tax, and the government refuse to answer. Instead, the sole approach of this government is to attack others—to attack the Leader of the Opposition, to attack others on this side of the House, to attack critics like Paul O’Malley from
                                       <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BlueScope_Steel" rel="nofollow">

                                       . That is their response to every question requesting information about the tax they have announced. That is why we are seeking to suspend the debate. That is why we want to bring on a proper debate about the carbon tax. If we do not get answers, we have to continue to do this, because if the government does not answer questions in the House of Representatives then there is no choice for the opposition other than to come into this place and suspend standing orders so that we can have a proper debate.

                                       But this Prime Minister does not want to have a proper debate. If the Prime Minister wanted to be open and honest when announcing a new tax, she would have told the Australian people how much that tax would be and whom it would apply to. Instead, the Prime Minister excluded the agricultural industry but would not comment on other industries, and that has created a climate of uncertainty right across the economy. And that is in a period when that uncertainty was reflected by the Treasurer in his own answer on building approvals today—a dramatic drop in building approvals following the events in Queensland—but the response of the government is two new taxes. We on this side of the House say the Australian people want some answers. They want a Prime Minister with courage. They want a Prime Minister who is prepared to explain in detail how Australians’ cost of living is going to rise with yet another Labor tax—yet another Labor tax. Prime Minister, don’t run away from the debate; give us the answers.

                                        The House is being asked to suspend standing orders to hear a debate led by the Leader of the Opposition. Well, frankly, Mr Speaker, why would we do that? The dogs are barking, but the caravan has moved on. I would say that to the bitter, shallow, hollow people on the front bench of the opposition. They are realising, day after day—and you can see it written on the faces of the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Treasurer; these

                                           We are asked to suspend standing orders because the opposition, in part, says that it wants to reflect views from the business community. Mr Speaker, let me just take you to today’s misrepresentations to show how the call for this debate is based on untruths, as every other claim they have made in this parliament this week has been. Let me take you to the words of the Alcoa managing director, going to the question raised with me—

                                              This debate would be a waste of time because it would come from the party of the past and it would include more misrepresentations. Let me take you to today’s misrepresentations. In question time the member for Wannon raised a question about the aluminium jobs in his electorate. I refer him to the words of Alcoa’s

I put it to you that the Prime Minister is speaking not even closely to the suspension of standing orders.

Yesterday they said that the government should be condemned because it had not given out enough information. The day before they were trying to persuade people that they would pay $1,500 extra for electricity and 6.5c extra for petrol. Every day these people will make something up to continue their fear campaign. Every day they come into this parliament and misquote others. Every day they intend to mislead the Australian people.
