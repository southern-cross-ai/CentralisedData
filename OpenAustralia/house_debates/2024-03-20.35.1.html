        I want to wish a happy 95th birthday to Grices Bakery Cafe. Ninety-five years ago this establishment began trading on Vincent Street in Cessnock, and 95 years later they are still here as good as ever. It is no secret that I love good feed, and it's well known that I love a good burger in particular. Less well known is the fact that I also love a good pie, and Grices Bakery Cafe does excellent pies. They also do great cakes—so I've heard. I'll admit that I don't usually go for cakes myself, but I've heard they are good and I have no reason to doubt that at all because Grices Bakery Cafe is a much loved establishment in my electorate. This is a place highly supported by the community. They have kept up an excellent standard of food and an excellent standard of service. I would have loved to have been in Cessnock today because, to celebrate their birthday, they are offering deals on pies and sausage rolls.
       </p>

        The food is all right here in Canberra but, let's be honest, it's not as good as in the Hunter—not even close. Thank you to the team at Grices Bakery Cafe. Here's to many more years to come. Happy birthday! Because, under an Albanese Labor government, you get to keep more of what you earn, that means you can buy more cakes and pies.
