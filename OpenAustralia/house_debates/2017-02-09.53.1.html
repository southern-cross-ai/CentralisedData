        I rise today to speak about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_New_Year" rel="nofollow">
         Chinese New Year
        </a>
        . Based on the lunar calendar, the Chinese New Year fell on 28 January this year, but, in keeping with tradition, celebrations across my electorate of Swan and across Australia have continued. The Chinese New Year is one of the most important occasions on the Chinese calendar. It is a time of strong traditions and rich culture and is a celebration of the year that was and, of course, the year that will be. It is a very special occasion not only for the Chinese community but for all Australians as we celebrate our nation's diversity. It is a time to enjoy a spectacular array of Chinese cuisine, music, dancing and more, and has become a major festival of celebration in Perth.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Saturday evening, my wife, Cheryle, and I attended the Chinese New Year ball held in my electorate of Swan, where I represented the Prime Minister, who has just entered the chamber. We were immersed in an evening of diversity and culture. We thoroughly enjoyed the celebrations and were pleased to be able to share in such an important occasion with the community. I would like to thank the Western Australian Chinese Chamber of Commerce and President Khoon Tan for hosting us on the evening and congratulate them on their 30th anniversary. I would also like to thank the chamber for their continued efforts in championing Chinese businesses but also in promoting and supporting the broader Chinese community in WA.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is now the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_of_the_Rooster" rel="nofollow">
         Year of the Rooster
        </a>
        , which is associated with the traits of confidence, hard work and loyalty. On behalf of Cheryle and myself, I would like to wish all our members and constituents a very happy Chinese New Year and a successful Year of the Rooster.
