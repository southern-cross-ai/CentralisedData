        In my first adjournment speech in the House of Representatives, tonight I acknowledge the service of two great Australians and two wonderful friends. Firstly, I recognise someone that you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Vasta, a Brisbane city councillor, Shayne Sutton, a good friend of mine and a wonderful, devoted councillor for the inner south of Brisbane. For 13 years, Shayne has served as local councillor. She's been a role model as an advocate for the south side and a role model for young women leaders. She was elected in 2004 as the youngest woman ever elected to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane City Council
        </a>
        , and this week she announced that she would be retiring from the council. When she was leader of the opposition and one of the youngest leaders ever in the city's history, I served as her deputy when
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campbell_Newman" rel="nofollow">
         Campbell Newman
        </a>
        was
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Mayor" rel="nofollow">
         Lord Mayor
        </a>
        of Brisbane. It was a difficult and sometimes very personal, trying time when, as lord mayor, Newman played politics extremely hard. After sitting next to her for four years in the council, let me tell you, nothing in this place comes even close. Shayne rose to the challenge with an unshakeable commitment to her beliefs and the people and community she has loved.
       </p>
       <p>
        Her knowledge as spokesperson for planning and development and infrastructure has kept the council of the day accountable but also led to some great outcomes for the people of Morningside ward and the wider city. As the local state member,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Di_Farmer" rel="nofollow">
         Di Farmer
        </a>
        , said this week:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Hardly a street, any park or any of the suburbs in the inner south of Brisbane haven't been touched by the hard work and devotion to local issues by Shayne.
       </p>
       <p>
        Shayne has been a constant source of strength and a support for me personally. I couldn't possibly begin to describe it, but the fact that I'm a member of this House is partly because of her support and unquestionable loyalty. For the rest of the nation, take it from me: never get on the wrong side of Shayne Sutton! Her community has been her second love, after that of her beautiful family. This week, Shayne said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My decision to retire early was not easy. I have loved and cherished my role as a councillor and I am sad to leave it. But as a parent I know this is the right choice for my family. It also paves the way for a new councillor who can give the people of Morningside Ward the dedication and commitment they deserve.
       </p>
       <p>
        To her husband, Stephen, and her particularly wonderful children, Sarah and Riley: we're all proud of your wife and mum. Congratulations, Shayne, on 13 years of outstanding service to your community and to the city of Brisbane. Here's to sharing the next chapter of your life.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish to also pay tribute to the life of the late Lindsay Jones. Lindsay passed away a few weeks ago and was a lion of the Labor movement in Queensland. Joining the Queensland branch in 1959, for almost 60 years Lindsay Jones was a progressive, positive voice for change in Queenslandâ€”a warrior of the left of the party but a much loved figure of the right of the party. There would barely be a candidate across any level of government or a party official in Queensland who hasn't been supported or advised by Lindsay Jones. He served in just about every role within the Queensland
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
         ALP
        </a>
        , including as a candidate, as an alderman on the Toowoomba city council and as a long-serving assistant state secretary at a time in the party's history that saw the end of the disgraceful Bjelke-Petersen era. Alongside the 1989 victory go the names of

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne_Swan" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and Lindsay Jones. Through the next 25 years, there was no-one better who knew marginal seats across regional Queensland or target messaging or, quite simply, helping Labor people get elected.
       </p>
       <p>
        I place on record tonight my thanks for the life of Lindsay Jones and his service to good government, his integrity and his unselfish service to others. Lindsay Jones was a powerhouse inside the Queensland ALP. He was an enormous strength and an adviser to me when I was state secretary, and he provided particularly strong campaign support and knowledge to me as a candidate for local government and then for the federal parliament, and also to my brother, Cameron, in his campaigns, enabling us both to become elected. He'd always say, 'Are you with me?' To his devoted wife, Norma, his children and his beloved grandchildren: we are much better because of the life of Lindsay Jones. Lindsay, we will always be with you. Rest in peace, old mate.
