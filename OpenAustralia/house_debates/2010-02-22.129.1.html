       <p>
        Mr Deputy Speaker, I present a petition on behalf of Canning residents and Western Australians regarding the foundations of marriage. The petition has been considered by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Standing Committee
        </a>
        on Petitions and certified in accordance with the standing orders. I welcome this opportunity to say a few words about the nature of the petition and share the sentiments of the signatories in response to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage" rel="nofollow">
         Marriage
        </a>
        Equality Amendment Bill, introduced in the Senate by Senator Hanson-Young last year. The signatories have entered this debate, and today I table their petition opposing the amendment to the definition of marriage.
       </p>
       <p>
        The petitioners confirm that the definition of marriage is a union between one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life. The petitioners state their strong belief that such unions are the foundation on which society stands. The petition says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To alter the definition of marriage to include same-sex “marriage”, as proposed by the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill, would be to change the very structure of society to the detriment of all, especially children.
       </p>
       <p>
        This petition contains 277 signatures. Let me take this opportunity to commend the organisers of the petition and those who widely circulated it throughout Canning. They have taken the opportunity to put their views on record and have played a vital role in that democratic process. I therefore present the petition on behalf of the signatories.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The petition read as follows—

        We, the undersigned citizens draw to the attention of the House of Representatives assembled, that the definition of marriage as “a union between one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others, voluntarily entered into for life” is the foundation upon which our families are built and on which our society stands. To alter the definition of marriage to include same-sex “marriage”, as proposed by the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill, would be to change the very structure of society to the detriment of all, especially children.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We, the undersigned citizens therefore request that the Marriage Equality Amendment Bill 2009, be opposed.
