       <p>
        Tonight I wish to use this opportunity to speak about some of the great community events that are continuing to build a positive community in my electorate of Forde. Firstly, I would like to congratulate the Ormeau Lions Club for their successful Ormeau Fair. The Ormeau Fair was held on the weekend of 13 and 14 August. The Ormeau Lions Club begins work on this fair in January and February of each year, and my congratulations go to Norm Jessen and the rest of the team for their organisation and professionalism. An event such as this does not succeed without the help of many volunteers, and my thanks go to those volunteers for their contribution to making the fair such a success. Thanks also go to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast City Council
        </a>
        and Mayor Ron Clarke and local councillor Donna Gates for their support, and to the many other sponsors who provide the support necessary to make this event a success.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the two days I had the opportunity to speak with many of the stallholders, who were excited at the opportunity the fair provided to engage with the local community and to make the local community aware of the business and services that are available. Everybody that attended the fair was well rewarded with the usual two great days of Queensland weather. The community turned out in record numbers to support the fair, and for many families it was a local wonderful alternative entertainment, with free entry and close to home. It had its own sideshow alley, show bags and rides for the kids, and it was much easier for families not having to travel the 40 or 50 kilometres to Brisbane on the Ekka weekend.
       </p>
       <p>
        The following weekend, on 20 August, the Eagleby Community Association held their annual Eagleby Festival. My congratulations go to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Bray" rel="nofollow">
         Ian Bray
        </a>
        and the team at Eagleby Community Association as well as the team of volunteers for a very well run and organised eventâ€”again, with many stallholders and local businesses represented. It was a great opportunity for them to, in a more social atmosphere, mix with the local community. Again my thanks go to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Logan City Council
        </a>
        , to Mayor Pam Parker and to local councillor Ray Hackwood for their support to make this event such a success.
       </p>
       <p>
        A great many people spoke during the day of thoroughly enjoying themselves as they went around the various stands and mixed and mingled with neighbours and new friends. This annual event is a great opportunity for the community to come together and celebrate the community and its achievements.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lastly, I would just like to touch on the event that I attended at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_Ship" rel="nofollow">
         Training Ship
        </a>
        <i>
         Walrus
        </i>
        with the local Navy Cadets. On 4 September they had a national inspection and parade. This made them one of seven nationally to go into this award, with the potential to be awarded as the best training ship in Australia. Training Ship
        <i>
         Walrus
        </i>
        was named after a boat that travelled along the Albert River delivering mail and various goods to settlements along the river in the 1800s. This is particularly relevant as the unit's base is located on the banks of the Albert River at Eagleby. Their skills trials were part of inspections for national titles, the winner of which is due to be announced later this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Naval Cadets from Training Ship

        were put through their paces with an inspection of the unit, the guard and the ship's company by the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANC" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Following the inspection was a march past and advance and review order. The Precision Drill Team then showed us their skills with a great demonstration of precision drills and weapons handling. The cadets then undertook a number of practical activities, such as a tactical water craft and navigational display and blind obstacle and medivac and first-aid demonstration. My congratulations go to commanding officer Sub-Lieutenant Tracey Hagan ANC and her team of volunteers for the work they have done to get the cadets to this level and for their hospitality on the day. I wish them every success in this national award.
