        Today is Barry Gwyther's last day as the Assistant Serjeant-at-Arms. He will retire from his position tomorrow, which I am very sad to see. We all know that Barry is not one to seek the limelight, and that is why I am doing this now when he is in the chamber. It would be remiss of me not to thank Barry on behalf of all members of the parliament for his important and very long contribution to the parliament. Barry joined the department in October 1998 after a 27-year career in the Army—one need only look at Barry's shoes to be aware of that! He has been a highly valued member of the Serjeant-at-Arms' office, providing wonderful support and service to members and departmental colleagues. He is very highly respected by all who have worked with him—I agree entirely with that. Thank you, Barry. We wish you all the very best for the future. I know there is going to be one very happy cow out there!
       </p>

        I also want to mention Ann Mackinnon, another valuable member of this place. Many would not know her but would appreciate her work through the

        department. Ann is also finishing up today.
