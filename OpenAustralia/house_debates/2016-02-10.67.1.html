        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development. Will the minister update the House on how the government's investment in infrastructure and regional development is helping to close the gap between Indigenous and non-

         I thank the honourable member for his question. Indeed, everyone has a role in helping to close the gap for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         , and the government's investment in infrastructure and regional development is certainly playing a significant part in providing new opportunities for Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait
         </a>
         Islander Australians.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government's infrastructure program is investing in roads, rail, bridges and communications that make a real difference to help, shortening the travel difference and improving communications to communities. We work with local government right across the nation to help deliver services, including in 31 Aboriginal councils. In addition, our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_York" rel="nofollow">
          Cape York
         </a>
         regional package is providing $260 million to help upgrade roads and infrastructure in the Cape, and I know the honourable member for Leichhardt has been a champion of that project. I approved a package of 11 measures for the Peninsula Development Road, and already 68 kilometres of the Peninsula Development Road have been sealed under that program. In addition, there will be $600 million for northern Australia under our northern Australia package for new roads in the North, and $100 million for beef roads, which will also be benefiting Aboriginal communities. In

         main access road upgrade is a $106 million project. With the member for Grey, I announced recently the letting of the contract for the crushed metal for some of the most significant parts of that project.
        </p>

         In our
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Australia
         </a>
         package the government committed to providing $110 million towards finalising all native title claims within 10 years. We have also added another $20 million to help native title claimants to mount their cases. It is so important for the security of Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         businesses that they have security of land title. It is also important for other investors in Aboriginal communities that they know that their title is secure. In the Torres Strait we have a marine safety program which has led to about 170 local people obtaining qualifications in navigation, fishing and the like to help provide job opportunities in the Torres Strait. Our Remote Airstrip Upgrade Programme is providing funding to help upgrade airstripsâ€”many of them on Aboriginal communities. Indeed, in the last round in December last year, I announced funding for 52 remote airstrips for upgrading to make sure that they can operate in a sustainable way.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government is committed to improving access and opportunities for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aboriginal_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Aboriginal Australians
         </a>
         , and by working together we can certainly advance social and economic outcomes for Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islanders" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islanders
         </a>
         and bridge some of the gap that exists currently between Indigenous Australians and those who have come here over the latter years.
