       <p>
        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. I refer to the three previous questions asked of him by the Leader of the Opposition and his undertaking to consult his records. I also refer to the Austrade cable from Washington, dated 11 March 2000, entitled ‘
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Wheat_Board" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Wheat Board
        </a>
        dealings with Iraq under the oil for food program’, released yesterday by the Cole inquiry. When did the minister first become aware of the contents of this cable? If the minister cannot answer the question now, will he consult the advisers in the chamber and provide an answer to this question, and the previous question, prior to the end of question time?

                I have checked my records following the tabling of this cable in the Cole inquiry, and I have checked with the then deputy managing director of Austrade. I do not have a record of any specific briefing he gave me; he does not have any record of any specific briefing he gave me. But the general issue that was being addressed and reported here was certainly known to the government at the time because
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DFAT" rel="nofollow">
                 DFAT

                were dealing with it. DFAT had taken advice. Information had come in from the mission in

                 New York

                 AWB
                </a>
                . This is all public knowledge in the public domain at the moment. DFAT were dealing with the issue in the broader public domain. They had sought advice from the AWB and ultimately they provided the information required to the
