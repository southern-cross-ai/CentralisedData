        DonateLife Week was held from 31 July to 6 August this year.    On Saturday, 5 August I held a motorcycle ride from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffs_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
         Coffs Harbour
        </a>
        to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Macquarie" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        to raise awareness of the need for more people to register as organ donors. Currently there are 1,400 people waiting for an organ transplant—a procedure which could change their life, or in many cases save their life. Around 34 per cent of Australians are registered donors but regrettably only nine per cent of people aged 18 to 24 are registered. If we can increase the number of registered organ donors we can save more lives and improve the quality of life for more people.    It's so easy to go online to donatelife.gov.au and register, and it only takes a minute to do.
       </p>
       <p>
        The ride was a huge success, with 40 bikes and trikes participating. Craig Lee, a double lung transplant recipient, rode his delightful

        Agusta over from Tamworth to participate. Riders also included Michael and Una Carpenter, whose son Jason passed away suddenly—Una said that the fact that Jason was able to become an organ donor and give the gift of life to others meant that something good had come out of a tragic situation.
       </p>

        I received fantastic support from the community, including

        BCU is a great local financial institution and they had in-branch displays to encourage people to sign up. I would particularly like to thank Culture and Recognition Officer Kerrie Byles and

        Thanks also to the Coffs Coast branch of Ulysses for their great support, including Shirley Rose, Paul Cooling and Bernie Higoe. I would also like to thank John Sercombe of Coffs Property and Ian and Helen Bamford of Laser Plumbing. It was a great event and it was fantastic to see such fantastic community support. I am delighted to be able to say that the event will be back next year, bigger and better.
