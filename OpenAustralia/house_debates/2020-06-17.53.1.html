        It is with great sadness that I inform the House of the passing of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurie_Kerr" rel="nofollow">
         Laurie Kerr
        </a>
        over the weekend, on Saturday 13 June. Born on 12 May 1958, Laurie was a member of the Kingsley Football Club and a survivor of the Bali bombings of 12 October 2002. Laurie was 44 years old when he travelled to Bali with the Kingsley Football Club as a club official. The club lost seven of its players as a result of the terrorist attack. In the moments after the bombing, despite his injuries, and still inside the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sari_Club" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Laurie worked to save others who were also fighting for their lives. He was later flown to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Perth_Hospital" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        for treatment in the burns unit. Laurie suffered burns to 20 per cent of his body. In the years since, Laurie battled constant pain from his injuries, undergoing numerous operations. He was diagnosed with regional chronic pain syndrome, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. Sadly, he lost his business and his home.

        On behalf of our local community, I pay tribute to Laurie Kerr and extend deepest sympathies to his family. We will always remember the victims who lost their lives in the terrorist attack, and the many survivors who have endured immense suffering in rebuilding their lives. I fully support the efforts by the Bali Peace Park Association to secure government funding to develop a memorial park on the site of the bombing as a place of quiet reflection and contemplation for future generations.
