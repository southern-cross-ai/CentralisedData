        Since being elected, I have visited as many of the 19,818 small to medium businesses in my electorate of Stirling as I can. I was pleased to be joined by some of my ministerial colleagues as well. The Minister for Employment, Skills, Small and

        , where Tony and Connie explained which government policies supported their family-run business and where else we can help.

        I learned from Sam, at Silvestro Butchers in Osborne Park, how to make sausages. Sam and I chatted about the improvements technology has made to his business.
