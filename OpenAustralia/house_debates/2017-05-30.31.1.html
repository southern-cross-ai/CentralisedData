        I rise to join with many others in expressing disgust at the targeting of

        s in a horrific attack last Friday. With many children among the victims, gunmen struck at three vehicles travelling in convoy, containing many worshippers, heading to the Monastery of St Samuel, home to about 100 monks. The death toll stands at 30 people. It is one of the deadliest attacks on

        in recent history. Unfortunately, it was not the first attack on Egypt's Copts this year. On

        , two Cairo churches were bombed. During those twin assaults at least 45 people were killed and over 100 were injured. Such conduct is simply unacceptable and is condemned in the strongest terms.

        We will always condemn all acts of terrorism and violence. Nothing should restrict one's peaceful expression of one's religious beliefs.

I want to mention my support for His Grace Bishop Daniel, the head of the

        . There is a strong and highly valued Coptic Christian presence in the Chifley electorate, and the prayers of many local residents go out to all of you during this difficult time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I would like to throw my support behind the call made by the member for Wills and urge the government to reconsider their decision to return 20 Coptic families back to Egypt. This decision must be reversed.
