       <p>
        Today in the Australian parliament I would like to recognise Councillor
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Watson" rel="nofollow">
         Greg Watson
        </a>
        from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoalhaven_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Shoalhaven City Council
        </a>
        , who has recently celebrated an amazing 50 years as a councillor and mayor and is retiring. I can honestly say that I have had the privilege of Greg Watson knowing me my entire life. We both lived at Terara when I was young, and it was Greg Watson who, just before he was elected in 1974, rescued me as a four-year-old from my family's dairy farm during the massive floods at Terara. In true Greg Watson style, he used his truck to evacuate people from the community. And, as a youngster, I was put in the front of the truck as we were evacuated into town.
       </p>
       <p>
        Greg was first elected as an alderman to Shoalhaven Shire Council in 1974. From my time as a young person growing up in the town, I have many fond memories, and I can honestly say that Greg was there every step of the way. Greg was a master at always thinking ahead, a political strategist, a relationship builder, a problem solver and someone that always had the community at heart. It was those qualities that were appreciated and saw Greg achieve so much for the Shoalhaven.
       </p>
       <p>
        From establishing Flinders Industrial Estate and sealing roads to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REM" rel="nofollow">
         REM
        </a>
        Scheme, the aviation technology park, the Shoalhaven Entertainment Centre and more, what Greg achieved was nothing short of astounding. Greg's practical and proactive approach made him very popular electorally. It was Greg's idea to turn the Shoalhaven shire into the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Shoalhaven" rel="nofollow">
         City of Shoalhaven
        </a>
        , and that's what happened in 1979. Greg made sure that every schoolchild received a commemorative coin. I certainly received mine at Terara Public School, and there was a huge street party in Nowra.
       </p>
       <p>
        But it was when I was a mum with my own young kids that Greg re-entered my life in a more prominent way. It was during the save the Nowra pool campaign from September 2009 to 2015, where Greg would answer any of my questions. Greg provided advice when I asked for it but never expected me to agree. That's what Greg did. He was a mentor and always made time to help others. It was Greg Watson that encouraged me to enter into politics, and I suspect that Greg's main interest was that people entering politics should be doing so for the right reasons: for an absolute love of community, a genuineness and a true desire to serve our community for the better. Thank you, Councillor Greg Watson. You have left an incredible legacy and gift for us all from your dedication over the past five decades.
