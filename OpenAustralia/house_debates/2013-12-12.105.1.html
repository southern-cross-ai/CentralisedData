        THE SPEAKER ' S SCHEDULE OF OUTSTANDING GOVERNMENT RESPONSES TO COMMITTEE REPORTS
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The attached schedule lists committee reports tabled and government responses to House and joint committee reports made since the last schedule was presented on 27 June 2013. It also lists reports for which the House has not received a government response.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schedule" rel="nofollow">
         Schedule

        s of outstanding responses will continue to be presented at approximately six monthly intervals, generally in the last sitting weeks of the winter and spring sittings.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The schedule does not include advisory reports on bills introduced into the House of Representatives unless the reports make recommendations which are wider than the provisions of the bills and which could be the subject of a government response. The Government's response to these reports is apparent in the resumption of consideration of the relevant legislation by the House. Also not included are reports from the Parliamentary Standing

       <p class="italic">
        Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are usually reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered. Reports from other committees which do not include recommendations are only included when first tabled.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit primarily make administrative recommendations but may make policy recommendations. A government response is required in respect of such policy recommendations made by the committee.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responses" rel="nofollow">
         Responses
        </a>
        to administrative recommendations are made in the form of an Executive Minute provided to, and subsequently tabled by, the committee. Agencies responding to administrative recommendations are required to provide an Executive Minute within 6 months of the tabling of a report.

        Notes

       <p class="italic">
        1 The date of tabling is the date the report was presented to the House of Representatives or to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker" rel="nofollow">
         Speaker
        </a>
        , whichever is earlier. In the case of joint committees, the date shown is the date of first presentation to either the House or the Senate. Reports published when the House (or Houses) are not sitting are tabled at a later date.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        2 If the source for the date is not the Votes and Proceedings of the House of Representatives or the Journals of the Senate, the source is shown in an endnote.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        3 For reports up to the end of 42nd Parliament, the time specified is three months from the date of tabling. While the government has undertaken to continue to respond to reports within three months, from the 43rd Parliament (28/09/10 onwards) the period within which the House requires a response is 6 months - see resolution of the House of Representatives of 29/09/10. This resolution also puts in place additional steps for reports not responded to within that six month period. The period from when the 43rd Parliament was prorogued on 5 August 2013 and the commencement of the 44th Parliament on 12 November 2013 is not included in the response period.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        4 In July 2011 the government advised that it did not intend to respond to the report because of the time elapsed since the report was tabled. The committee has not agreed to the removal of this report from the schedule.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        5 In June 2009 the government advised that it did not intend to respond formally to this report. The committee awaits a response to recommendations of the report. In November 2009 the government indicated a response is being considered and will be tabled in due course. In November 2011 the government indicated it was in discussion with the committee on this matter.
