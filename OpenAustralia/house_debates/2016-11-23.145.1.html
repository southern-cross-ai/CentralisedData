        Last week I had the pleasure of meeting Professor Neil Drew, Director of the Australian Indigenous Health
        <i>
         InfoNet
        </i>
        , based at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edith_Cowan_University" rel="nofollow">
         Edith Cowan University
        </a>
        , who gave me a briefing on his work. I would also like to acknowledge the distinguished contribution of Professor Colleen Hayward AM, Pro-Vice-Chancellor and head of Kurongkurl Katitjin,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECU" rel="nofollow">

        's Centre for Indigenous Education and Research. It is commendable to have such a leading service operating from our local university.

        Since its establishment in 1997, Health
        <i>
         InfoNet
        </i>
        has been addressing the need for policymakers and health practitioners to have access to the best and most up-to-date knowledge and information about Aboriginal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        health. An important focus of the service is on the development of knowledge exchange tools and resources that synthesise research and other information related to a wide variety of health issues. These resources provided a time-poor health workforce with the capacity to quickly and effectively enhance their knowledge and skills to guide their everyday work in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        With over a million visits per year to its web resource, 5,000 easily searchable pages of resources and a bibliography of over 35,000 publications, Health
        <i>
         InfoNet
        </i>
        is the go-to web resource for anyone working or studying in the sector. Its suite of knowledge exchange tools and material includes an annual overview of Indigenous health summarising over 300,000 health research papers, surveillance data reports and national statistics. It has published 16 peer reviewed health topic reviews as well as numerous plain language reviews and newsletters. Knowledge exchange materials now include ebooks, animated infographics and short films. The service is unique in the world, the first resource of its kind, and it is guided by a strong commitment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspectives. It has formal partnerships with a wide range of Indigenous peak health organisations and is guided by over 140 experts on a wide range of health topics. It is recognised internationally and is the winner of many national awards.
