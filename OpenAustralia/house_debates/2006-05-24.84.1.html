        I rise this evening to inform the House of a great local company in my electorate of Braddon and an exciting project which could create as many as 20 new jobs.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MES" rel="nofollow">

        (

         Pty Ltd
        </a>
        was established in north-west Tasmania as a supplier of mining equipment and supplies, particularly for mines on Tasmania’s mineral-rich west coast. In recent years, the company has sought to manufacture its own products rather than importing all of its stock from interstate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Recently, MES decided to manufacture polyethylene pipe, while relocating the business to a new facility near Wynyard, west of Burnie, in north-west Tasmania. This company has invested significant funds into the introduction of new, specialised equipment that will make it possible to produce polyethylene pipe customised to order. I understand the company will be the first in Tasmania to be able to produce this pipe, for which there is a growing demand in our resurgent mining industry and also interstate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased to say that the Australian government is a major player in assisting this company to develop the project. Under the Sustainable Regions Program, the Australian government is providing a grant of some $165,000, including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        . This funding has given the company the confidence to install not one polyethylene production line, as originally planned, but two. While it was expected that the project would create seven new full-time jobs, now with two production lines soon to be installed it is hoped to create as many as 20 new jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        The introduction of the polyethylene pipe production capability within Tasmania is also expected to assist to reduce costs for the local mining industry and provide better products in response to their needs. The company has also just opened an outlet interstate, at Bendigo. Importantly, the new capability will also enable MES to expand and diversify into supplying other industries, right across the board, including agriculture.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week, I had the privilege of visiting the company and its production line. I was very impressed with the state-of-the-art equipment. When operational, the two new production lines will have the capability to produce varying widths, lengths and sizes of pipe, depending on what is needed by the customer.
       </p>
       <p>
        The driving forces behind this company, David and Kylie Kenworthy and their staff, are displaying through this project the confidence, ingenuity and vision that is needed to thrive in a regional business. For these types of individuals and companies to invest such large sums of money just demonstrates the confidence that is out there in regional Australia now. Under their direction, this company will continue to grow and prosper. It is a fine example of an innovative and successful business located in regional Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Up to $12 million was originally made available under the Sustainable Regions Program to support projects within the Cradle Coast region of north-west Tasmania that will provide long-term strategic benefits to the community. I understand that well over $11 million has been committed to myriad projects, with outstanding success. These projects are now reaping success, and they are developing employment, businesses and industries that will thrive well into the future. While at times those on the other side have criticised the Sustainable Regions Program and various other programs which provide direct assistance to regional Australia, we on this side are getting on with the job and helping people like David and Kylie Kenworthy to realise their vision and deliver new job opportunities in regional Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I must make special mention of the work of the tireless Cradle Coast Authority in supporting the regional program in north-west Tasmania. In particular, I would single out Roger Jaensch and Karen Hampton, who have worked with north-west companies on their submissions and advised the government on the allocation of funding. This is an independent authority that provides recommendations based on what projects would be the most successful. Their efforts are most appreciated. The coalition government’s Sustainable Regions Program, with their help, is an outstanding success in regional Australia, and it will continue to deliver benefits, investment opportunities and employment in regional Australia.
