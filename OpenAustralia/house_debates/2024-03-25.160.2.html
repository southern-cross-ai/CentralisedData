        As we, in this place, all know, we have a range of wonderful community organisations in our electorates. Normally, over the course of weekends, many of them are out and about doing really interesting bits and pieces around the electorate, and so it was with the weekend just gone.
       </p>
       <p>
        I had the joy of joining the team at the Ormeau Progress Association and the North East Albert Landcare at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rivermount_College" rel="nofollow">
         Rivermount College
        </a>
        , to continue their efforts to revegetate the banks of the Albert River. Their planning day was organised with the support of Landcare and also Regen, and they encouraged people of all ages to join in the work to plant native tree species on the college campus grounds. Now, I will say that, on Thursday and Friday last week, they were also there with the students of Rivermount College, and our job on Saturday was made that bit easier because the students at Rivermount College had done an extraordinary job on Thursday and Friday, in getting the revegetation project well and truly underway.
       </p>
       <p>
        Revegetating our local environment can play a significant role in broader conservation efforts, particularly around our waterways. Without it, our riverbanks, such as those along the Albert River, can be at risk of soil erosion, leading to further losses of native plants and habitats for our native animal species.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is the latest in a series of projects along the Albert River around Rivermount College conducted by the Ormeau Progress Association and North East Albert Landcare. I'd like to thank Sue Durance and her team for the wonderful work they do in bringing these projects to fruition, through a variety of grants and supports by

        city council, and of course Rivermount College and Regen as well. These native trees and shrubs will greatly enhance the college grounds but also, as I said, go a significant way to revegetating our local environment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last Friday night, I also had the pleasure of attending the Beenleigh

        and their awards presentation night. Little Athletics is a healthy, fun and safe way for children aged five to 17, of all skills and abilities, to get involved in sports, across a range of track and field events. Beenleigh Little Athletics competed at various events throughout last season, including the Jimboomba carnival, and several of their athletes couldn't make it on Friday night because they were actually at the state titles. So congratulations to them.
       </p>
       <p>
        The season included some milestones off the track, too, with the completion of renovations to their clubhouse. It was a joy to join those athletes to celebrate their successes during the season. They also had some difficulties, and I'd like to thank Browns Plains Little Athletics club for hosting Beenleigh Little Athletics club while their facilities were out of action, particularly due to the rain and flooding events. Congratulations to all the award winners. You've done a terrific job. All the best for next season.
       </p>

        Finally, on the weekend, I had the pleasure of joining the Australian Budgerigar Society for their AGM and the Oaks and Derby Show. It's always wonderful to go along and talk to my good friends at the Australian Budgerigar Society. Their enthusiasm for the breeding of budgerigars is infectious. I haven't succumbed to buying one yet, much to my wife's disappointment! But some of their members travelled several hours from northern

        I want to congratulate the outgoing committee for the fabulous work they've done over the last 12 months and thank the incoming committee, very ably led by President Lucas Hendry, assisted by Vice President Wayne Robinson and Secretary Chad Siebenhausen. Congratulations to the two newest members of the committee, Kristen Cooper and Kaleena Meirs.

        Thank you to everybody for the great job you do for our community.
