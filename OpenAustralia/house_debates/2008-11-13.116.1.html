       <p>
        It is very important that as a nation this week we acknowledge the service men and women who have served this country particularly well. I would like to acknowledge all those involved between 1942 and 1943 on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokoda_Track" rel="nofollow">

        in what was one of Australia’s most significant and historic conflicts in any theatre of war.
       </p>
       <p>
        We should not forget the desperation of the early 1940s.

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        In July 1942, Australia had only two militia brigades in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Moresby" rel="nofollow">
         Port Moresby
        </a>
        . The Japanese were ordered to take Port Moresby overland from Buna and Gona. The port facilities would have provided an ideal base to attack
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Australia
        </a>
        and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
         US
        </a>
        Navy in the Pacific. The inexorable, ruthless march south of the formidable Japanese imperial forces appeared to be all-conquering—they had not yet lost a battle in the strike through Malaya, Singapore and the Philippines.
       </p>
       <p>
        After Kokoda airfield was lost to the imperial forces, the only barrier between the Japanese forces in the north and Port Moresby on the south coast was the rugged, steep
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Stanley_Range" rel="nofollow">
         Owen Stanley Range
        </a>
        . With our Allied forces fighting throughout Europe in various areas of engagement, the Australian and Papuan forces made a last, desperate attempt to repel the Japanese. They were outnumbered five to one by battle-hardened, highly trained forces and had to deal with malaria, tropical rains and diseases, mosquito infested swamps, stinking mud, leeches and searing heat and humidity, but the Australian troops displayed stoic defence, courage and determination, and their capacity to inflict as much harm as possible on the Japanese was assisted by the local Papuan people.
       </p>
       <p>
        Papuan porters, affectionately nicknamed ‘the fuzzy wuzzy angels’, provided the primary, essential transport of supplies and extracted the sick and wounded with great care in almost impossible circumstances. The fuzzy wuzzy angels’ bushcraft, knowledge of the land and unending assistance was invaluable to our troops. It has been stated that no known wounded soldier who was still alive was ever abandoned by the fuzzy wuzzy angels, regardless of heavy fire or extreme forms of conflict or conditions. At times, it would take up to six days walking through thick jungle to reach a hospital area.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to take this opportunity to recognise the significant contribution made by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Salvation Army
        </a>
        . The uncle of one of my constituents from my electorate of Forrest fought in the Kokoda campaign. He said that the dedication of the Salvation Army could also not be spoken of more highly. In his words:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        After meticulously preparing a camp invisible to the enemy and just when you thought nobody could see you, the Salvos would often tap you on the shoulder, having crawled through the bush to deliver you a cup of cocoa or something similar.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syd_Heylen" rel="nofollow">
         Syd Heylen
        </a>
        , from the 39th Battalion, said in an interview:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thank_God" rel="nofollow">
         Thank God
        </a>
        for the Salvos. I know the nicest thing I ever had on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kokoda_Trail" rel="nofollow">
         Kokoda Trail
        </a>
        was a cup of tea given to me by the Salvation Army. And I hated tea that never had milk or sugar in it; this didn’t have any in it and I loved it, I wanted more. I had half a cup, that’s all they had. I never forgot that one.
       </p>
       <p>
        Major Albert Moore, the Salvation Army’s representative attached to the 21st Brigade, later wrote of his experiences:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I look back on those days as among the greatest in my life, never again do I hope to hear the sighs of relief that I heard during those days, as men, utterly exhausted, weak, sick and wounded, would well nigh fall at our feet.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those words were from Major Moore himself. Six months of some of the bloodiest and most difficult land fighting of the Pacific war, including the battle of the beaches, ended on 22 January 1943. Australia lost 2,165 troops, and 3,533 were wounded. How many of the wounded would not have survived without the help from the fuzzy wuzzy angels and the Salvation Army is not known. This campaign forever sealed the relationship between Australia and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
         Papua New Guinea
        </a>
        . We should recognise sacrifices made by people who did so much for our forces and our country. The fuzzy wuzzy angels stood beside our troops on our sovereign soil and helped defend our country during such an important time. It is with great respect and gratitude that I acknowledge this week the efforts of all our Australian service men and women who have, and do, serve this nation.
