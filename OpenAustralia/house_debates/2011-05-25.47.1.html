       <p>
        I record my tremendous relief and gladness concerning the decision of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_Supreme_Court" rel="nofollow">
         Indonesian Supreme Court
        </a>
        two weeks ago to overturn Scott Rush's death sentence. I am sure Scott's remorse regarding his involvement with drugs and his determination to play a role in educating other young people on the dangers to themselves and to society posed by drugs will be positively regarded by the court in his future application to have his life sentence reduced.
       </p>
       <p>
        I pay tribute to Scott Rush's parents, Lee and Christine, who have been there as a constant source of support for Scott. I also acknowledge Scott's lawyer, Colin McDonald
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QC" rel="nofollow">
         QC
        </a>
        , whose professionalism and dedication has been remarkable. I note the bedrock of encouragement and friendship given to Scott by my colleague
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Hayes" rel="nofollow">
         Chris Hayes
        </a>
        , the member for Fowler, and also the support of other colleagues in this place, including the member for Moreton in whose electorate Scott's parents live, the member for Berowra and Senator Gary Humphries as the co-chairs of the Parliamentary Group against the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Penalty" rel="nofollow">
         Death Penalty
        </a>
        . For the other prisoners who remain on death row in Indonesia and elsewhere, it is important that we hold them in our thoughts and continue to push for change.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I pay tribute to the Indonesian Supreme Court for this very fair decision. Indonesia has made important progress in strengthening democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law in the past decade and it is important that this be acknowledged. As I have said before in this place, to stand for life and for human dignity and to eschew violent retribution even when one has the power to carry it out is the mark of civilisation.
