        My question is to the Minister for Veterans’ Affairs. Will the minister inform the House about the importance of the government’s pension reform package for the veteran community?

        <p>
         The Harmer review and these pension reforms are good news for the veteran community in this country. We are talking about an additional $1.1 billion with respect to income support for those veterans and war widows who are in a situation where they rely on government income support. We are talking about some 320,000 Veterans’ Affairs pensioners in this situation, some 190,000 service pensioners and over 105,000 war widows. This comes on top of the 325,000 or thereabouts who benefited from the bonus payments in the first stimulus package and the nearly 130,000 who received support under the second stimulus package.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Harmer focus was very much on the issue of income support for those who really needed it. As was outlined by the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs earlier, it was also about simplification of payments and also improved indexation methods. It is complex, and the circumstances around individual veterans are something which they will need to understand. They will be written to accordingly to ensure that they have the information that they need to understand the nature of what they are receiving.

          Again, the point was targeting where it was really needed for those who definitely required it—those who were on the lowest levels of income support from government. I note from some of the interjections that there have been issues raised around the question of disability pensioners under Veterans’ Affairs, the circumstances they face and the position around the question of why they did not receive this increase with respect to their disability pension payments. Let us make it clear, though: overwhelmingly they do receive support through these changes. Of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TPI" rel="nofollow">
           TPI
          </a>
          s—those most severely disabled veterans who have suffered in the cause of their country—some 80 per cent-plus will receive benefits as they receive income support payments from government because they are in a situation where they are reliant on income support payments from government. Some 60 per cent of TPIs will in fact receive a net benefit into the future regardless of the impact of the taper rate and the transition situation, because nearly 50 per cent of TPIs are in receipt of the maximum level of income support they can receive from government according to their circumstances, whether they be single or in a couple. In fact, overall almost two-thirds of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVA" rel="nofollow">
           DVA
          </a>
          disability pensioners, including those on general rates, will receive benefits through this system.
         </p>
         <p>
          I want to make it very clear: the indexation method that was fought for over a 10-year period of neglect under the Howard government has been maintained and enhanced through the introduction of PBLCI as outlined earlier during question time. There is absolutely no doubt that this is a positive move forward for the veterans community in terms of those relying on income support.

             I note also from some of the comments made across the table that there are issues around the question: what does the opposition really stand for on this issue? Maybe it is time we heard what their actual position is, because there has been a bit of smoking going on around the edges—smoky positions with respect to this. There were a few people on email suggesting certain things about what they stand for and a few people around the edges intimating that they might support the shadow minister over there. The shadow minister, the member for Paterson, has alluded to the fact that there might be some support there. Let us get clear what the opposition’s position has been with respect to these issues over the term of this parliament.

                     Sorry. The opposition, Mr Speaker, expanded it to cover service pensioners, but they still left out couples and war widows. So even when they have had a policy—and it is one of the few areas they have had a policy in since they have been in opposition—the circumstances were that they excluded massive elements of the veteran community. So where is your policy now? Are you supporting an income support targeted approach as implemented by this government? You are, because you have passed the legislation, but are you going further than that? Are you prepared to go further? I do not think you are.
