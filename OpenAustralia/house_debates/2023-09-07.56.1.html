        Today marks a significant milestone in my time as the member for Capricornia. On this day 10 years ago my constituency elected me as their representative. I vowed that I would serve my community and fight for their fair share. With over $6 billion of investment into Capricornia over the past decade, I have held true to my word. I have fought tirelessly to make Capricornia the best place in Australia to live and work. There are far too many projects to name them all. However, I do want to touch on just a few that I know have changed the lives of those who live in my community.

        Rockhampton Hospital parking was virtually non-existent. Unwell patients and families were forced to walk blocks in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CQ" rel="nofollow">

        heat to get to the hospital. After years of inaction by the Labor state government, I was able to secure $7 million to get the ball rolling on construction of the multilevel car park onsite at the Rockhampton Hospital. No longer are patients forced to trek uphill to seek the medical help they need.

        Another very special community project that's close to my heart is the Collinsville
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QCWA" rel="nofollow">

        hall redevelopment. The QCWA is the backbone of country towns. They support and fundraise for those most in need, and their halls are the epicentre for community gatherings. When the women of the Collinsville branch approached me for help to replace the asbestos filled hall, I lobbied successfully and secured $425,000, and this month the new hall will be opened. I want to thank my supporters and, in particular, my loving family—my mum, Gloria, and late father, Bill, my daughters, Jessica and Kirsten, my son-in-law, Tim, my brothers and my gorgeous grandbaby, Fitzwilliam—for their support over the last 10 years. Thank you.
