        During January, February and March in regional electorates like mine, we are overtaken by show society fever. Gilmore is in the lucky position of having six wonderful shows spread through the months. As I was standing at the gate on Saturday afternoon in the steaming heat, I reflected on the extraordinary efforts of all of those involved, because we were all suffering from the heat. From the eager competitors in the artworks, the photography and the amazing flowers to the bullock trains, showjumping and woodchopping, it is all a colourful, noisy, exciting medley of activities. However, it is the hundreds of volunteers on the committees; the stewards; the judges; the Lions and Rotary clubs, who look after the gates and help collect the ticketing money on those gates; and the

        </a>
        volunteers who all enable the show to actually take place. Congratulations to the dedicated committees of each and every one of our different shows for all the work that they have done.
       </p>
       <p>
        The shows are held in Kiama; Berry;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo_Valley" rel="nofollow">

        , whose show is this weekend; Nowra, whose show was last weekend; Milton, whose show is to come; and the Eurobodalla, whose show was a couple of weeks ago. They have regenerated interest in the show girls competition, which is not just about wearing a pretty sash over a great dress; it is about encouraging young women to embrace our local strengths in agriculture and raising awareness of the central importance of this industry to our local area, from dairy and vineyards to cattle. They do a great job as ambassadors for the agriculture industry.

        There are increasing numbers of young people getting into agriculture in many different ways. There are enterprises in our region that are just beginning to explore export and things like that, and some of them actually display their goods at the show, so it is a chance to have taste testing and all sorts of different things. I commend those businesses as well. However, the overwhelming entries in our shows are from dedicated amateurs like Vonnie Muller, a show winner in multiple categories at a number of shows. Last Friday, I was deeply honoured that the Prime Minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull" rel="nofollow">
         Malcolm Turnbull
        </a>
        , accepted an invitation to visit Gilmore especially to see the activities of the show. He actually met Vonnie. She signed her recipe book for him. On a scorching hot day, Malcolm saw the great show that Nowra puts on and met the famous Vonnie.

        Special thanks go to the committee of the Nowra Show and especially Wendy Woodward, who kept us on the move with a very tight schedule. We went from meeting and greeting at the gate and talking to volunteers to the students at Nowra East Public School as we walked past. There were cameras everywhere and the young ones saying, 'Oh my goodness; what's going on?' But they were thrilled and shook the hands of the

        . We walked up there and met people enjoying the show. Then we went up into the pavilion and talked to them. We talked on our local radio station, 2ST Power

        . They were very pleased. We walked down and talked to the camels, went to the clydesdales, met Mulligan and a little lad with ribbons on a horse. It was just a great day for the PM to be in our region.
