        I am always fighting to get our fair share from Canberra, and I am very proud to deliver federal funding to my electorate. To date, this has included more than $2 billion for local roads, schools, health and community infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last December, I was very pleased to announce that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweed_Shire_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Tweed Shire Council
        </a>
        will receive $9.8 million in federal funding towards a total cost of $21 million for the Kingscliff foreshore project. The project received funding under round 2 of the National Stronger Regions Fund, and it is a real credit to the entire community that this funding was received. Council is providing $3.8 million for the foreshore upgrade, and Tweed Coast Holiday Parks will contribute $7.5 million. I would like to congratulate everyone involved: the Tweed Shire Council, Kingscliff and District Chamber of Commerce and all the community groups and residents who fought so hard for this funding. It is important to note that the project has overwhelming local support.
       </p>
       <p>
        Kingscliff is a vibrant, exciting coastal town, and this great project will enhance the village and protect the foreshore. In fact, it was reported only last week that Kingscliff has been ranked fourth in a list of the top 10 sea-change towns in a national online newspaper. Kingscliff is a popular destination for both

        locals and domestic and international visitors. This project will really add to its already outstanding reputation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The plan includes the construction of a permanent seawall, an upgrade to Kingscliff Beach Holiday Park, the creation of open space for Kingscliff Central Park and the refurbishment of Kingscliff Amenities Hall. The central park will provide spectacular views of the ocean from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Parade" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . The features of the park include recreational features for the aged, disabled and youth; improved beach access; a bigger cenotaph area; a new amenities block; a boardwalk and viewing platforms; and barbecues, picnic shelters and landscaping—all wonderful achievements. It is estimated that the revitalisation will create more than 200 jobs during the project and post construction. Council advises that the timetable for the redevelopment is a two-year project, with construction expected to start in early 2017 and scheduled for completion in 2019.
       </p>
       <p>
        This project has been years in the making and planning. I would particularly like to acknowledge the outstanding work of Tweed Shire Council. There was extensive community consultation on the project in 2011, and I understand that council are again currently undertaking community liaison for feedback and to provide information. I also understand that there have been many people in council who have worked very hard on this project for many years, and it is important that their dedication and commitment be acknowledged here. This project is truly a community victory and one we should all be rightly proud of. I again thank all those community members who have contributed to this very successful effort to secure this important funding.
       </p>
       <p>
        Kingscliff already has many great features. It has beautiful beaches, thriving cafes and a range of diverse and wonderful businesses. It also has a very popular coastal cycleway. This exciting project—the revitalisation of the Kingscliff foreshore—will really add to what is already an outstanding village.
