       <p>
        Earlier this year I participated in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        Parliamentary Program by attending the Army's Combined Arms Training Centre, which includes the School of Artillery and the School of Armour at Puckapunyal in Victoria. The experience provided me with a new perspective of the Australian Defence Force as one of the most successful vocational training institutions in our country.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was able to participate with our troops and officers in theoretical classes, develop my skills using state-of-the-art simulator technology and undertake practical field exercises, including live firing. It was good to take part in early morning physical training, to share in training activities and sit down to meals with our troops. The dedication and professionalism of our serving personnel in uniform greatly impressed me. It was great to attend the Army officers' course for captains, followed by an inspirational address on leadership in the lecture theatre by Major General Fergus McLachlan AM.
       </p>
       <p>
        I experienced driving the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_Abrams" rel="nofollow">
         M1 Abrams
        </a>
        tank, a 60-tonne machine producing 1,500 horsepower from its turbine engine, considerably more power than the 500-horsepower prime movers which I'm accustomed to driving. I also experienced the use of the 155 millimetre M777 lightweight towed Howitzer, as well as navigating the vast Puckapunyal military area, travelling in the Australian light armoured vehicle,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASLAV" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , armoured personnel carrier.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to record my sincere appreciation to Lieutenant Colonel Scott Fletcher, commanding officer of the School of Artillery, known as the 'Firemaster', who made my visit memorable. I thank Majors John Bennett and Benjamin Gray, and visiting Major Jason Dudley of the United States Army, as well as Captain Cameron Gibbins, Lieutenants Ellis, Roksa, Robinson, Linley, Winsor, Donnelly and Sue, and Warrant Officers Windridge and Toby, for accompanying me during the week. The experience was invaluable because it reinforced the need to ensure strong and continued investment in the maintenance and upgrade of our Defence Force facilities, particularly useful in my role as a member of the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Works" rel="nofollow">
         Public Works
        </a>
        . Whilst the defence budget will grow to two per cent of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        by 2020-21, and the government will provide Defence with $34.6 billion this financial year and $150.6 billion over the forward estimates, there is merit in continuing to invest in our Defence Force facilities. I have seen firsthand that many Defence Force facilities are in need of upgrade and our military personnel could do with more resources.
