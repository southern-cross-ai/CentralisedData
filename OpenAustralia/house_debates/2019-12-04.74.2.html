        We do not know how many Australians suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome but it is likely as many as 250,000. Their suffering is real. It is not imagined. It's important that they know we in this building know that. Chronic fatigue syndrome is a complicated disorder characterised by extreme fatigue that can't be explained by any underlying medical condition. Fatigue may worsen with physical or mental activity, but it does not improve with rest. Around a quarter of the people with the syndrome suffer a mild form and are able to get to work or school part time while reducing activities. Another half will have a moderate to severe form, while another quarter will experience severe chronic fatigue syndrome and have to stay at home in bed.

        I recently met with Dr Heidi Nicholl, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of Emerge Australia, which advocates on behalf of those 250,000 of our fellow Australians. She is in the gallery today. I also acknowledge Susan Hutchinson, who is also in the building, who is an advocate. And I do want to acknowledge the member for Perth, who has raised this issue with me and has been an advocate for people with chronic fatigue syndrome as well.

        There are issues with access to telehealth. We need broader access to telehealth anyway, but people with chronic fatigue syndrome have a very strong case for access to telehealth when you consider their condition stops them from getting to the doctor. There are issues with Centrelink and with the

         NDIS
        </a>
        . I welcome the recent Medical Research Future Fund grant for further research, but we need to do more. We need to understand this condition better. The fact that this condition is hard to explain is not a reason to disbelieve people; it's a reason for more research and more attention.
