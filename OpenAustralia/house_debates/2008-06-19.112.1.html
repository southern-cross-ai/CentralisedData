        I rise to draw the House’s attention to the recent anniversary of the Battle of Crete, an anniversary that commemorates the heroic efforts of Australian defence forces and the local community of Crete in 1941. The battle took place three weeks after the Allies’ loss of mainland Greece to Germany. Commencing 20 May 1941, the Battle of Crete lasted 10 days. Allied forces consisted of three British battalions, two

        brigades, eight Greek battalions and six Australian battalions. The invasion was the largest German airborne operation of the war.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_German" rel="nofollow">
         The German
        </a>
        s parachuted 8,100 men onto the island of Crete. The German parachute forces suffered appalling casualties. The casualties amongst German parachutists were acute, with nearly 4,000 being killed or lost, leading to Crete being subsequently dubbed the graveyard of the German parachutists. Initially, allied advantage was lost with the Maleme airfield in Western Crete falling to the Germans, enabling sufficient reinforcements to land and overwhelm the allied forces. The battle was significant on a number of fronts. But the civil resistance of the local population was, in itself, highly significant—in the spirit of resistance to the Nazi domination and in the bond that was forged between the people of Greece and Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Local men and women, and even children, became involved in the battle proper. But, when the allied withdrawal commenced and the many thousands of troops were scrambling to evade capture, the local population put itself at extreme risk in assisting allied forces and Australian soldiers that were left behind. It is my belief that through this period of adversity a bond was formed between the peoples of Greece and Australia. Many Australian soldiers who were left behind were harboured by locals in villages. For every Australian soldier who was caught by the Nazis whole villages were executed in response and to give the message that this was not on with the Nazis. This did not stop the local community. They continued to harbour Australians and others from the allied forces to ensure their safety, and the resistance continued. We know that a bond was forged between the peoples of Greece and Australia through a shared desire to prevail against an invading Nazi force that proved to be a disaster for the local population.
       </p>
       <p>
        Through the theatre of battle and the desperate avoidance of capture, Greeks and Australians sacrificed much and suffered terribly, in unison, side by side, in the defence of the island. I am sure that the ongoing pain and loss endured by the local population throughout the period of Nazi occupation was not lost on the allied forces, which failed to maintain the security of the island to protect the people. The gallantry and the loss were recently commemorated and remembered at many ceremonies around Australia, including in my home state of

        .
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battle" rel="nofollow">

        of Crete and those who perished as a consequence of war were formally honoured through the laying of wreaths all around Australia. I know for a fact that the battle is remembered by many thousands of people around Australia through local ceremonies, informal gatherings and personal reflections.
       </p>
       <p>
        Many of those who themselves pay special attention to the anniversary braved occupation within Greece—that is, many of the veterans whom I have met over the years. They can take great pride in the resilience of the Greek people and the Australian soldiers that was so evident in those dark days and in the bond that they have continued to develop with Australia, their adoptive country, which tried valiantly to defend Greece from invasion and persecution in its hour of need. I hope we continue to acknowledge the important contributions of Australian forces, the Greek soldiers and the Greek civilians in the defence of Crete against the 20 May 1941 German invasion. I hope we also continue the annual commemoration of the Battle of Crete within Australia as an event of national significance and encourage the reflection of the shared experiences of Australians and Greek nationals through the Battle of Crete, the bond forged between our two nations in a time of war and the evolution of Australian-Greek relations within the post-war period.
