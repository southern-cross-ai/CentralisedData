       <p>
        I rise today to acknowledge one of the many hardworking community groups within my electorate of Stirling. I would like to bring to the attention of the chamber the hard work, dedication and commitment shown by the Friends of Trigg Bushland. The Trigg bushland is a significant natural coastal reserve and a natural habitat for the endangered tuart trees. One of the projects conducted by the Friends of Trigg Bushland is the tuart mapping project. This project collects vital data that can be utilised in the ongoing conservation of this native species.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are also a number of other native flora growing in the area, growing on dunes composed of white Quindalup sands formed in the last 6,000 years. As this dune system advanced, it buried the limestone and yellow sands of the 100,000-year-old Spearwood dune system. In some parts of the Trigg bushland the Spearwood sands still remain at the surface. The reserve itself is located on the coastal strip of my electorate in an area about one kilometre long, covering approximately 10 hectares. It is a class A reserve and in 1998 was recognised in Perth’s bushland, which subsequently became the Bush Forever plan, and it has now been designated as a reference site by the Perth regional biodiversity project.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Friends of Trigg Bushland group was incorporated in 1990 at a public meeting after several years of informal operation and it is now recognised throughout my electorate of Stirling and in the wider community as one of the most active conservation groups in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . I would very much like to place on record my thanks for the efforts of the officeholders and committee members who give up their time voluntarily to ensure that the fragile bushland environment is preserved for current and future generations. In particular I acknowledge the hard work and commitment of present and past officeholders and committee members, Peter St Clair-Baker, Peter and Barbara Alcock, Phylis Robinson, Nina McLaren, Kristina Newton, Samantha Clarke and

        </a>
        . There are many more members of the community actively involved in the activities of the group, and I would also like to thank them for their personal time and the commitment they make to this valuable conservation project.
       </p>
       <p>
        Spring is one of the busiest times of the year for the Friends of Trigg Bushland. The biggest job in spring is to tackle the scourge of weeds. After our wet winter, weeds are rampant. As well as conducting quarterly guided walks through different parts of the bushland—walks I have been very happy and privileged to attend in the past—the group collects seeds, removes weeds and rubbish and generally assists with bush regeneration. Local residents and families are encouraged to become involved with the Friends of Trigg Bushland. It is an area that I would recommend to anyone visiting my electorate of Stirling who would like to experience firsthand the unique and fragile bush environment that we are very lucky in Stirling to have on our doorstep.
