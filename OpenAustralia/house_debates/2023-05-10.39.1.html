        I'd like to congratulate Forster entrepreneur and committed charity worker, Michelle Bamford, for being one of 24 recipients selected for the 2023 New South Wales Rural Women in Leadership scholarship program. Michelle is a committed volunteer and has coordinated for several community groups, schools, sporting and support groups. Congratulations again, Michelle.

        I also want to give a shout-out to Matt Gorton of Stroud, who recently returned home with a gold medal from the World Transplant Games held in Perth. He underwent a kidney transplant in 2019, and recently won the triple darts and just missed out on a bronze medal in volleyball. Good on you, Matt. You're putting that donated kidney to good use!

        I recently attended the official opening of the new Gresford Sporting Complex clubhouse facility. It was wonderful to see so many of the committed community players and community groups there. This was made possible by a combination of the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure federal Commonwealth grant of $300,000, a similar grant from the New South Wales Stronger Country Communities and funds from the council. Unfortunately, this Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program is being ended. It was a wonderful program that delivered so much for local councils and small regional communities.
