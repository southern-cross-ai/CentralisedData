        My question is to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister has cancelled the scheduled
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Council_of_Australian_Governments" rel="nofollow">
         Council of Australian Governments
        </a>
        meeting because his government is too busy fighting itself to finalise vital funding for schools and hospitals. And, the last time this House sat, the government cancelled parliament because it was unwilling and unable to govern. Doesn't this just confirm that the government is too busy fighting itself to govern for Australians? And is this what the Prime Minister meant when he called his own government a muppet show?

          The jeers that come from the opposition and the Labor Party when I say that we're having a drought summit tell us a bit about where their priorities are. They want to come in here and go on with all this political rubbish day after day after day. Earlier today, I met with the Deputy Prime Minister and with the special envoy, the member for New England. I met with the head of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Farmers'_Federation" rel="nofollow">
           National Farmers' Federation
          </a>
          and I met with Major General Stephen Day. We received an update on the report of the work that has been done by Major General Stephen Day, who is coordinating the government's response to the drought.
         </p>
         <p>
          On 26 October, we will bring together people from around the country. I'll be inviting all the state and territory leaders or their nominees or those within their governments who are directly involved in coordinating the drought response to come and align all our efforts to ensure that we're doing a number of things: firstly, that we're getting the feed to where it needs to go to support the efforts of our farmers to keep their properties going and keep them in business; to support the towns; to support the centres; to make sure not only that the farms keep going—

                meeting related to the education funding arrangements which are being pursued by the education ministers' council as well as the Council on Federal Financial Relations, who have advised the premiers, when I spoke to them directly about this, that these issues will be resolved in time for when that meeting would have been held anyway. So those issues do not require a special meeting of COAG in October. What we do require in October is a national drought summit to coordinate the entire national effort of not only the state and territory governments but the Commonwealth, the charitable sector, the farming sector, the meat producers—all of these groups coming together to focus on what is my priority.
