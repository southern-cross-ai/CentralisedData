       <p>
        by leave—I rise today to discuss the Casey Kidz Klub. The Casey Kidz Klub is a not-for-profit organisation, run by an extraordinary lady from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranbourne_North" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        named Amanda Stapleton, that provides out-of-school care for disabled teenagers in the city of Casey. Amanda, you are doing an amazing job. You are having to spend a great deal of time and effort bringing up your teenage son, Peter, who is severely disabled, and I congratulate you for what you are doing. It shows the rest of us how easy we have it in life sometimes.
       </p>
       <p>
        The club was founded in April 2006 to bridge a gap in support services and provide relief for families struggling with challenges associated with caring for special needs children. It is currently helping 13 families, and extra funding will allow it to help up to 40 families across the city of Casey. The Casey Kidz Klub uses a targeted blend of academic and sporting activities that are designed to explore the boundaries of each individual. Located at

        , Berwick, the Casey Kidz Klub enjoys the support of the local community, and I am delighted that the new Rudd Labor government matched our election commitment of $39,000. However, matching funding of $39,000 from the state government is required to allow the club to access a further $39,000 pledged by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Casey" rel="nofollow">
         City of Casey
        </a>
        , which is conditional on matching funding from the state and federal governments.  With this money, the club will be set up for the remainder of the year. Unfortunately, by letter dated 17 January 2008, the Acting Victorian Minister for Community Services,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Andrews" rel="nofollow">
         Daniel Andrews
        </a>
        , said that the Casey Kidz Klub does not qualify for Victorian state government funding as it is an after school care program and not disability related.
       </p>
       <p>
        That is an absolute disgrace. Governments at all levels have a fundamental responsibility to care for those who are in dire straits or those who cannot care for themselves. I cannot think of a better cause for any government than to fund those who have children with disabilities. I find it absolutely outrageous that the state Labor government in Victoria and its Premier,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brumby" rel="nofollow">
         John Brumby
        </a>
        , are not looking at this program as being key and fundamental to helping out people in the worst possible situations.
       </p>
       <p>
        This has also been raised in the Victorian parliament by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Wooldridge" rel="nofollow">
         Mary Wooldridge
        </a>
        , the shadow minister for mental health and community services, who has called on the Victorian state government to recognise the Casey Kidz Klub as a state government responsibility. I urge the state government to do the right thing in Victoria and help out the Casey Kidz Klub.
