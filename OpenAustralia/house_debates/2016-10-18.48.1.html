          I refer to this email from your office to Senator Leyonhjelm's office dated 12 August 2015 at 10.36 am, which confirms the minister and Minister Dutton on behalf of the coalition government agree to insert a sunset clause on the banning of particular lever action shotguns in exchange for Senator Leyonhjelm's support in the Senate. Does the minister consider it acceptable that he was prepared to trade off John Howard's gun laws in order to secure support for legislation in the Senate?

            Yet again, the opposition leader shows he has absolutely no understanding of what he is talking about—no understanding whatsoever. Let me explain to the House—now there is nothing new in that email, by the way; this has all been on the public record for a very long time—when we pass the regulation through the Senate to restrict the import of lever action shotguns, with a magazine capacity of over five, on a temporary basis—this has always been a temporary ban until the states come to an agreement about where to classify the gun—we had a conversation with Senator Leyonhjelm, and, yes, as part of that conversation we will put a sunset clause on that particular regulation.

                We put a sunset clause on that regulation. This is not unusual. Governments put sunset clauses as a break at any particular point so you can have another conversation about what you might do going forward. That is exactly what we did in this case. The government have always been 100 per cent clear in our position that we will restrict their import until we get an agreement with the states about where they were to be classified. I would have very much liked that that conversation was concluded within those 12 months, but it was not; so we have subsequently extended the ban until we reach that agreement. It is very straightforward. It is very simple. If Labor had any idea about what they were talking about then they might just get it. I repeat—
