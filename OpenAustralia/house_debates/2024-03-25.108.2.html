       <p>
        I have a question for you, Mr Speaker, regarding the administration of this building. Last Friday afternoon, I referred to you a matter of significant concern. Earlier on that day, 22 March, an event was held in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Hall" rel="nofollow">
         Great Hall
        </a>
        of the Australian parliament titled the National
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        Review Conference. The event's organiser was Mr Devinder 'Dev' Singh of the company
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communities_of_Practice" rel="nofollow">
         Communities of Practice
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The event was promoted as having me providing the keynote speech and interview. However, this is despite the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Social Services
        </a>
        providing advice to the organisers on 27 and 28 February, the month before, that I would not be attending, and then again, on 7 March, writing to the organisers asking that marketing materials be updated to reflect this.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSS" rel="nofollow">
         DSS
        </a>
        noted in their correspondence that it was imperative that attendees and prospective attendees were accurately informed about speakers at the conference, and I will table that attachment. However, in subsequent promotional material for the event, the organisers continued to market my appearance, and I'll table that attachment, too, at the end of this.
       </p>
       <p>
        This event was branded as being about the NDIS Review, an official policy of the Australian government, but it was charging attendees $185 to attend online and more than $700 to attend in person at the Great Hall. My staff have also been told the vendors paid up to $4,000 to be provided space at the event, on the understanding that not only would I be speaking, but there would be direct access to me. As the Australian disability community knows, the government and I have been travelling around the country hosting NDIS Review town halls—all for free.
       </p>
       <p>
        My staff personally spoke to attendees outside the event on Friday morning, where many were still under the impression I'd be attending and giving the keynote address. The attendees understandably felt misled. This is also reflected in the multiple disappointed attendees who posted comments on my
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkedIn" rel="nofollow">
         LinkedIn
        </a>
        page. Many attendees justifiably feel misled and have sought refunds from this conference organiser, and they should be refunded, in my opinion. I've also made a complaint to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCC" rel="nofollow">
         ACCC
        </a>
        to this effect. Furthermore, other statutory speakers were advertised as attending, having told the organisers that they were not attending.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Friday evening,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channel_Nine" rel="nofollow">
         Channel Nine
        </a>
        news ran a package that showed journalist Mr Probyn attempting to address the organiser about why they'd falsely promoted my appearance to conference attendees. At that point, Mr Singh evacuated the Great Hall and barricaded himself in a cupboard or a bathroom—I'm not sure which. For the benefit of the House, I table the transcript from that news package as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        The real issue here is this—and this could happen to any minister or politician—

         <p>
          We're very concerned that a politician or minister could be used to promote an event, a month after he had made clear he wasn't attending, and as to the use of the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Hall" rel="nofollow">
           Great Hall
          </a>
          of the parliament for commercial purposes to mislead attendees. I'm very concerned because of the fact that the Great Hall holds great prestige. I'm concerned about the reputational risk to the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Parliament of Australia
          </a>
          to allow such events to be hosted on its premises. Would you please provide an update at your earliest convenience as to what can be done to prevent this happening in the future?

           I thank the minister for his question. I have received his correspondence. I'm taking this matter very seriously. I've asked the Department of Parliamentary Services to urgently review the circumstances under which—

           Order! While I'm addressing the chamber, the member for Barker will not interject. I've asked the Department of Parliamentary Services to urgently review the circumstances under which the event booking was taken. I stress to all members: I'm deeply concerned about these allegations, and I'll report back to the minister.
