        I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Kirrawee High School on their 50 anniversary, which will be celebrated on Saturday, 17 September between 10 am and 3 pm. Since opening its gates in 1966—coincidentally, the same year that Australia's currency changed—Kirrawee High has posted a proud and successful tradition in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sutherland_Shire" rel="nofollow">
         Sutherland Shire
        </a>
        . During that time the school has delivered outstanding programs in sport and creative and performing arts. And, since the 1990s, it has been known as a comprehensive languages school. There are currently around 1,200 students enrolled. Last week it was my great pleasure to address the students at the school assembly and present them with an Australian flag.
       </p>

        Following the electoral boundaries redistribution, Kirrawee High is one of the schools that has returned to the electorate of Hughes, which I represent here in the federal parliament. I look forward to working closely with the school, staff and parents. I have already met with the principal,

        , and members of the executive team. We are exploring ways in which we can assist the school to continue to provide the very high level of education they have been delivering for the past 50 years.
