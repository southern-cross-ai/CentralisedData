         I'd like to thank the member for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McEwen" rel="nofollow">
          McEwen
         </a>
         for his question and for all the work that he does to support the most disadvantaged in his electorate.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Albanese government has, from the time it was elected, been bringing people together to solve some of the very complex issues in our community. The Jobs and Skills Summit was one of those that brought together all sides of the community to look at how we boost economic participation. Over the weekend, the Prime Minister announced the next step in how we bring people together to tackle economic inclusion and how we ensure that the most disadvantaged in our community are supported. Of course, this comes off the back of the agreement we have got with our secure jobs, better pay bill, a piece of legislation that very much will support some of the lowest paid workers in this country.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, we need to also look at those who have been excluded from the workforce. Our commitment to establishing an economic inclusion advisory committee is the next part of ensuring we have a transparent process, run by an expert, legislated committee, to give this government important advice. This committee will be tasked with providing advice to government on economic inclusion, including policy settings, systems and structures, and the adequacy, effectiveness and sustainability of income support payments, ahead of every federal budget.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Labor government want to do everything we can to address the challenges faced by everyday Australians. While we know that there are many competing priorities in the budget and, of course, fiscal pressures that must be handled responsibly, it is the Labor way that in every budget we hand down we consider how we can support those doing it the toughest.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, the economic inclusion advisory committee will be an important resource and will bring together members of our community, whether they be experts in the community, advocates, union or business representatives, to examine very carefully the issues confronting our most disadvantaged. The Treasurer and I will make these appointments with the committee, which is to be established, in an interim capacity to inform the 2023-24 budget before legislating this committee on an ongoing basis. High-level recommendations and findings of the committee will be released publicly at least two weeks prior to each federal budget.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is an example of where the Albanese government isn't afraid of expert advice. We're not afraid of bringing people into the tent, we're not afraid of transparency. We will continue to work collaboratively across the community to get good outcomes for those most disadvantaged here in Australia.
