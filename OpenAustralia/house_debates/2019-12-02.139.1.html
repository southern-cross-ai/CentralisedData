       <p>
        As we move into the last sitting week of the year and we prepare ourselves for Christmas and the new year season to come, I'd like to take this moment to acknowledge the continuation of the stable and secure federal government under the leadership of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Morrison" rel="nofollow">
         Scott Morrison
        </a>
        and celebrate the wins we've had as a nation and, more importantly, back home in my electorate of Petrie. I want to thank my electorate for their ongoing support at this year's federal election and, in turn, I want them to know I've been working hard to deliver the infrastructure, jobs and funding that local families rely on and listening to them when I'm at home in my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        We've delivered tax relief for local families, giving more than 70,000 locals tax relief back into their pockets. We've supported veterans and their families, including with the introduction of the veterans covenant, mental health support and the veterans discount card. We've also been able to protect Australians against foreign fighters This legislation will enable the government to prevent suspected extremists from returning to Australia and putting Australia and her people at risk. We've introduced legislation to make it easier for first home buyers to get into the market, with the First Home Super Saver Scheme and the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme starting next year. They're just a few things.
       </p>
       <p>
        Locally, we've seen infrastructure milestones start. There has been $3 million in federal funding for the Mango Hill State School hall; work has started on that. There has been $500,000 for the Redcliffe Coast Guard, those volunteers who protect our boaties; the clubhouse upgrade has started. Work has officially begun on a jointly funded

        North Brisbane and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_Rivers" rel="nofollow">
         Pine Rivers
        </a>
        autism hub, which is fantastic. We have local road projects in Bracken Ridge starting; that has been signed with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane City Council
        </a>
        . There's $7Â½ million worth of work in Bracken Ridge. We've also secured a fully rebated
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MRI" rel="nofollow">
         MRI
        </a>
        licence for Redcliffe Hospital; that room is currently being constructed by the state government.
       </p>
       <p>
        Then there are the completed projects in Petrie. We've opened the $450,000 federally funded indoor sports facility and change rooms at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peninsula_Power" rel="nofollow">
         Peninsula Power
        </a>
        soccer. We've seen the completion and opening of the federally funded extension to the Redcliffe
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCYC" rel="nofollow">
         PCYC
        </a>
        . We completed the $1.1 billion Gateway north upgrade in March this year, with a further $800 million committed to the final link between Bracken Ridge and Pine Rivers. I had the biggest jobseeker boot camp ever in the history of Petrie, with 150 people attending. There's a lot more to do in 2020, so I say to my electorate: thanks for your support, have a great Christmas and I'll continue to work hard for you next year.
