        Every summer many people visit, and obviously many of our locals enjoy, the great beauty of the beaches on the

        . Every year our volunteer lifesavers save the lives of many people using our beaches. It takes a special type of person to be a surf-lifesaver, and this was proved last week by surf-lifesaving members Aidan Yourell, Rachael Redman and Jacob Harcourt. Last September I gave a young sporting champion award to 16-year-old Aidan. He and the two 15-year-olds, Rachael and Jacob, all from the

        and was washed up onto nearby rocks. Aidan told the paper, 'It's giving back to the community, really, and making sure everyone stays safe around the beach.' This was a tremendous effort by all three, not only because they risked their lives to help and save others but also because all three are teenagers. Well done and thank you.

        The iconic Grafton Jacaranda Festival is in its 82nd year and is about to enter a new era. The committee have had several recommendations put to them recently and these were discussed at the recent
