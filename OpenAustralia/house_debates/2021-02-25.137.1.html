        I want to congratulate everyone who was involved with the bombing of Darwin commemoration last week. It was great to have the Minister for Veterans' Affairs come up to Darwin to take part in that very important commemoration. Next year is the 80th anniversary. Reflecting on those who have served, we have some extraordinary veterans in the

        . He sent me a poem recently, and in the poem he says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Some troops have lost fellow members who've died from suicide.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Their lives have been shattered, and they have no place to hide!
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The families of our troops often suffer in their silence.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Sadly there's a confrontation, sometimes ending up in violence.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        People complain about the cost of a royal commission.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Parliamentary Members, this is your decision!
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Let's keep this big wheel turning, for there is no place to hide.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Let's work to help deter our Veterans with thoughts of suicide.
       </p>
       <p>
        Waldo Bayley is a great man.
       </p>
       <p>
        My dad also is a Vietnam War veteran, and one of his veteran mates said recently, 'A royal commission will be too late for some, but it will be a lifesaver for others.' These are extraordinary people who put their hand up to serve our country, and the least we can do is support them and their families after their service. It's well past time for a royal commission.
