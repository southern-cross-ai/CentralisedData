        Last Saturday the Kalamunda Chamber of Commerce held their annual Business Excellence Awards night, recognising some of the leading businesses from my community. I want to congratulate Brian, Karen and the team at the Kalamunda Chamber of Commerce for hosting another successful business awards. The awards remind us of the important role that small businesses play in our local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to offer my congratulations to the award winners. The winner of this year's Micro Business of the Year Award is John Stanley Associates.

        is a two-person team that has made its name known around the world for professional, horticultural, farm retail and culinary eco-tourism consultancy. This year's Kalamunda Farmers Market Best Stall Holder Award goes to Elizabeth and Peter's stall Colour Patch, which has been a great stalwart of the markets since the very beginning.

        Kalamunda Plumbing was the well-deserved winner of this year's

        family have been dedicated members of the Kalamunda business community since the 1950s and pride themselves on their service excellence mentality. Similarly, Kalamunda Toyota, which has grown from its humble beginnings in 1984 was the winner of the Medium to Large Business of the Year Award. Proprietor Joe Zito still takes an active role in instilling a strong work ethic in his enthusiastic and vibrant team. This year Kalamunda Toyota has achieved sustainable growth and record results in all divisions, which is a credit to his hardworking team.
       </p>
       <p>
        Customer service is a strong theme in Kalamunda businesses and the Outstanding Customer Service Award was won by Ben and his business, Metropolis Plumbing and Gas, known across the Hills region for their excellent maintenance work, reliability and dedication to going above and beyond for their customers. The key to a successful business is good staff and Julie Pierrot's hair studio has demonstrated this by being named the winner of this year's Staff Training and Development Award. Julie seeks to provide national and international stage work for her hairstylists.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Kalamunda Retail Business of the Year Award was awarded to the Zanthorrea Nursery, which is a third-generation family business run by passionate environmentalists, with a focus on growing and selling Australian plants that suit the local area.

        One can always be assured of quality food and great conversation at the Best Drop Tavern in Kalamunda which is why, no doubt, it was awarded this year's Dining Establishment of the Year Award. This year's

        went to the Forrestfield and High Wycombe Community Bank, which has taken a special interest in helping out community groups wherever possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last, but not least, is the winner of the Community Spirit Award this year, which went to Benchmark Consultants. Benchmark provides sponsorship of sporting clubs and events, as well as recognising teachers in local high schools who go above and beyond the call of duty to provide support to students dealing with personal issues and stressful situations.
       </p>
       <p>
        All the winners of this year's Kalamunda Chamber of Commerce Business Excellence Awards should be commended for their excellent achievements.
