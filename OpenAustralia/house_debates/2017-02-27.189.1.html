       <p>
        Last week I was fortunate to tour the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QIMR" rel="nofollow">
         QIMR
        </a>
        Berghofer Medical Research Institute and have the opportunity to hear from some of the scientists at what is Queensland's largest medical research centre. Currently, there are 17 ongoing clinical trials based on QIMR's work, led by their researchers, across four programs: cancer, infectious diseases, mental health and chronic disorders. The importance of these trials to progressing our understanding of these conditions and to curing them cannot be understated.
       </p>
       <p>
        I met with the director, Professor Frank Gannon, to talk about the opportunities for medical research in Australia and the challenges it faces. We had quite a good discussion about medical funding, and I was very interested to hear the quite remarkable extent to which QIMR leverages its government funding into further funding and support. Professor Gannon explained how their research work is split evenly between exploration—that is, finding treatments and cures—and translation, which is putting the research into tangible, scalable and commercial benefits for the Australian and international communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have to say, I found the research to be absolutely fascinating. I was shown epilepsy treatment involving electronic waves being sent through coils in the brain, with researchers led by Professor Breakspear; cystic fibrosis research with Professor Grant Ramm; and so much more. This is about fostering a critical mass of medical science and research capability. It is about our local talent pool, it is about great facilities, and of course it is about outcomes.
