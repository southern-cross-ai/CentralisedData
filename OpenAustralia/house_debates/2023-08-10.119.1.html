        n barley, into a sugary liquid which is then fermented with yeast. Barley is Western Australia's second-largest cereal crop, being 25 per cent of the state's total grain production and producing over a billion dollars in export earnings each year. Thirty per cent of the barley produced is delivered as malting grade, destined for the international beer industry. In Hasluck we know all about quality WA barley and quality WA beer, and we are blessed with many quality brewers. These include funk 2.0, Valley Social, Mash Brewing, Duckstein Brewery, Bailey Brewing in

        It would be no surprise to me if it is not just Australia that is celebrating the lifting of tariffs on barley and the improving trade relations with China; I'm quite sure that brewers and consumers alike in China are celebrating. The ongoing stabilisation of trade relations with China, our most important trading partner, continues under the constructive, productive stewardship of this government.

        and Emerald Grain by China yesterday was the result of ongoing discussions on biosecurity issues, which have come to a resolution, and follows last week's confirmation that China would remove the duties on Australian barley. The skilful and steadfast work done by many ministers—notably, Foreign Minister Wong, Trade Minister Farrell and Agriculture Minister Watt—means that barley growers across Australia, including our growers in Western Australia, can once again benefit from the breadth of the Chinese market, which is measurable. Prior to the disrupting imposition of those duties, China was Australia's most valuable export partner for barley, worth around $960 million in 2018-19, which was about 70 per cent of that export market.
