       <p>
        Well before this century reaches its half term, diabetes will have seriously challenged our nation's health services and budgets. The consequences of government inaction will be catastrophic, as diabetes is a blight on our social fabric and on income production. Not since 1997 has there been a definitive government statement making diabetes a national health priority. Yet, within the last two decades the prevalence of diabetes has more than doubled, making it the fastest growing chronic disease in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two hundred and seventy-five people are diagnosed with diabetes every single day. Forecasts are that this figure will climb sharply so that 3.3 million Australians will be diagnosed with diabetes by 2031. Uncurbed, it is likely that one-in-three 'Gen Ys' will join the ranks of the now 'Gen Ds'. This is tragic, given that type 2 diabetes is largely preventable and with early diagnosis and proper treatment its malevolent progress can certainly be slowed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Diabetic complications are multiple and lead to a reduction in mortality. Every 30 seconds, somewhere in the world, someone has a limb amputated due to diabetes. Diabetes robs people of their potential ability to earn and care for their families. Access Economics estimated that the workforce participation rate of people with type 2 diabetes is 53.8 per cent, well below that of other people of working age. The total productivity loss is estimated to cost this country $4.079 billion.
       </p>
       <p>
        That Australia has no coherent national diabetes plan in 2013 is truly astounding, as in 2006 Australia strongly supported the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations
        </a>
        resolution 61/225 to recognise diabetes with its own international day. In addition, Australia was a signatory to the United Nations 2011 declaration on the prevention and control of non-communicable diseases.
       </p>
       <p>
        The European Diabetes Leadership Forum held by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
         OECD
        </a>
        in Copenhagen in 2012 built on these commitments with the development of a 'Copenhagen roadmap'. This provides a ready-made template for a comprehensive national diabetes plan. The roadmap can be localised to meet Australia's needs by working with some of our brilliant local health experts. The aim of the Copenhagen roadmap is to outline a plan for the prevention, early detection and intervention and management of diabetes. The benefit of the Copenhagen roadmap is that the outcomes are to be regularly measured to show the quantum of improved health and reduced healthcare costs.
       </p>
       <p>
        In December, Australia is hosting the World Diabetes Congress in Melbourne and there is no better opportunity for the government to make diabetes a national health priority and to recommit to a comprehensive national action plan. We can and we must have a more vigorous public health campaign to manage diabetes in the community. In speaking to the estimates published by Professor Stephen Colagiuri that diabetes will cost Australia $23 billion within 20 years, leading expert in diabetes Professor Paul Zimmet has warned that diabetes will become the fastest growing non-infectious disease epidemic in human history.
       </p>
       <p>
        With a comprehensive national action plan Australia will ensure that our future generations do not shoulder a cost that this country simply cannot afford. To quote my friend the member for Moore in his last speech here on this subject:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It is imperative we take action now on diabetes. Just consider that in 15 minutes allotted to me to make this speech two more Australians have been diagnosed with diabetes and there are another two who have the disease but remain undiagnosed.
