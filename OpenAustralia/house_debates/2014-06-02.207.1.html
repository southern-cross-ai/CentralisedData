        The Launceston business community recently lost one of its stalwarts, Bob Bilson. Bob was the chairman of the Launceston printing company Foot and Playsted and will be remembered for his passion for the printing industry and his successful management of a prominent business, established in 1926. Bob joined Foot and Playsted as company secretary in 1962, achieving over 50 years service, which is in itself a remarkable record. He had a strong vision for Foot and Playsted, ensuring it provided top-quality service and the very best products. Bob was a pioneer when it came to printing innovation, installing state-of-the-art equipment. He oversaw every technical change at Foot and Playsted as it moved into the digital age, from linotype and hot metal to digital and direct to press.

        Bob Bilson was also a proud Launcestonian who supported the printing of books by local authors. The quality of these products was so high that many of the books he printed are highly prized on the collectors' market both in Australia and overseas. Bob served on the boards of the former Launceston Bank for Savings, the

        and the prominent local retailer McKinlay's, ensuring that Foot and Playsted was always heavily involved in charities and volunteer organisations.

        To his wife, Janet, and their family I extend my sincere sympathies. Their grief at his sudden departure will, I hope, be tempered by the knowledge that his life was one of great contribution to our community and our nation.
