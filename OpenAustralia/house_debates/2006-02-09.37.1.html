        My question is to the Prime Minister. Could the Prime Minister inform the House of what the Commonwealth will do to improve the services for those many Australians who suffer from mental illness?

         I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. The member for Leichhardt has been a persistent advocate of more being done by both the Commonwealth and the states in this area which is of such vital concern to the daily lives of millions of Australians.
        </p>

         The
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mental_Health" rel="nofollow">
          Mental Health
         </a>
         Council report
         <i>
          Not for service
         </i>
         released last October noted the likelihood that every family in Australia will be affected by mental health problems at some stage. It made the point that it should no longer remain a marginal health issue. The report noted, incidentally, that in the last nine years the Commonwealth funding commitment to mental health had risen by 128 per cent. But, despite this, there remain many challenges and systemic weaknesses in the area, including the need to get the balance right between hospital care, community care and the best type of accommodation for people who cannot manage on their own.

         In November, I wrote to all the premiers and chief ministers on the need for a more coordinated approach. We will be discussing this matter and our shared responsibility—and I stress that: our shared responsibility—at the meeting here in Canberra tomorrow. The states of Australia have a responsibility to devote more resources to mental health; so does the Commonwealth. I note in particular and I welcome the fact that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         Premier has indicated his commitment to make this a priority. I would be very surprised if the other premiers and the chief ministers did not adopt a similar attitude.
        </p>
        <p>
         Three per cent of Australians have a severe mental illness such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or other psychotic disorders or suffer from severe depression. About 20 per cent of Australians suffer some form of mental illness over any 12-month period. This is a problem that, as a society, we have not handled well in the past. Until the 1960s we had a policy of treating mental illness through a process of institutionalisation. That changed largely under the impetus of the Richmond inquiry in New South Wales, and the change gathered pace through the 1980s and 1990s. There is abundant evidence that that process went too far. Whilst I do not advocate, and I do not believe Australia would benefit from, turning back the clock to the institutions of old, nor can we as a decent society tolerate having people with mental illnesses out in the community unsupported and untreated.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also believe that we are paying a very heavy price in terms of mental illness from the abuse of illicit drugs such as marijuana over the years. The tolerant and absurdly compromised attitudes of many on the use of those drugs are now a classic case of the chicken coming home to roost. I think we are paying a dreadfully heavy price for the abuse of so-called recreational and socially acceptable drugs despite the clear evidence, unaccepted until a few years ago, that these things are doing massive damage within our community.
        </p>
        <p>
         Greater focus on prevention and early detection must be part of a more comprehensive mental health strategy. We also need a better understanding of the medical workforce needed to support and treat people—for example, by looking at the role of psychologists and other health professionals. We need to look at supporting people with mental illness on a day-to-day basis—at home, through education, training and assistance into employment, as well as with the medical treatment that they need—and supporting their families and training others in the community who are in the front line dealing with the problems of mental illness.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to say on behalf of the Commonwealth that we will play our part. We will make an additional commitment of resources. We will do our bit, but we cannot do it alone. The states have ongoing important institutional responsibilities in this area. I want this matter dealt with on a bipartisan basis. I want all of the heads of government of this country to understand it is a serious issue and the Australian public will expect no less than a coordinated, genuine commitment by all of us to try and solve the problem.
