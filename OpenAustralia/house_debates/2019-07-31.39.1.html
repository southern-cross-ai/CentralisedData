        I would like to recognise the extraordinary contribution of the army of helpers and volunteers I am grateful to have in Brand across the cities of Rockingham and Kwinana. Many of them have helped on many federal and state campaigns over the years. Lois Robinson is our star doorknocker. Her enthusiasm knows no bounds. Thank you so much, Lois.

        prepoll. His humour is always very welcome. Owen Farmer didn't miss a single campaign event in Brand and his work with the homeless community in Rockingham is greatly appreciated by all. Margaret Sweeney is always effective and reliable, whether she's calling voters or manning a polling booth on election day. Then there are Bill and Val Ashman. Bill put up many yard signs across my electorate—some might say too many!—and Val fed our army of volunteers with her extraordinary sausage rolls which we have to hide to so that my staff don't eat them all—or me, for that matter!

          Good idea. Some are veterans, some are new hands and all are very valued. I certainly would not have been elected for the second time without my volunteers across Rockingham and Kwinana, and I want to thank them for their support across the campaign and their hard work across the electorate and in the businesses they work in. Their efforts don't go unnoticed. I really look forward to working with them over the next three years of the 46th Parliament. Thank you all so very much.

           Since 2010 I've worked hard, and so have my staff, to get millions of dollars in new health and educational services, roads, bridges, business support and water infrastructure. But there is still more to do in the face of the go-slow state government that has plagued politics at every step of the way. Gladstone's state member likes to pull the wool over one's eyes and pass the proverbial buck to the federal government for this slowdown. However, that's not the case. This is why my last election was so important for Flynn, and I take this opportunity to thank all the people who helped during the campaign to make it a great success. You were a part of an amazing team that was diligent and hardworking, never showing signs of weakness. I would like to thank: my campaign manager, Sonia Burton, from Emerald; Ash Jensen and Val and Ken McInnes from Biloela; Hec Kilah from Monto; Dot Hamilton from Eidsvold;
