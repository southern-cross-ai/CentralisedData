        The Liverpool Women's Resource Centre is an invaluable group for women and families in my electorate, providing support services such as counselling referrals both in person and over the telephone, as well as group programs that fight isolation and bring women of all backgrounds together with art or other shared interests, allowing them a valuable outlet with free child-minding. The centre has been in operation since 1984 and continues to provide essential assistance to disadvantaged women across the southwest. The centre's success is the result of the efforts of its hard-working team. I particularly want to note the efforts of manager Nikki and community development officer Rosheen, as well as the dedicated volunteers and board members, including Linda, Anna and Susan.
