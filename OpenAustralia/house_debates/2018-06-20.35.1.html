       <p>
        I rise to pay tribute to an outstanding member of the Mackellar community, Brian Friend
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        . In 2013 Brian was awarded the medal of the Order of Australia for services to touch football and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Beaches" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Beaches
        </a>
        . This achievement came on the back of decades of dedicated work in a number of local areas which has also seen him made Australia Day Citizen of the Year for Pittwater in 2000 and a recipient of a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centenary_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Centenary Medal
        </a>
        in 2001. Brian was a co-founder of the Warringah Touch Football Association. He was granted life membership in 1993. He's also been a coach and referee at Avalon Junior Rugby League Football Club since the 1970s, while serving as president for three years. Brian was also a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Police_Force" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales Police Force
        </a>
        for 32 years. In 1974 he was recognised for his bravery with a Queen's Commendation for Bravery.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is clear that Brian's commitment to and efforts in the field of community service, sport and policing have made him deserving of the honours he has received. I'm proud to count him as a constituent of mine in Mackellar, and I encourage all people, wherever they may be, to do as much as they possibly can, to dedicate as much effort and devotion as Brian has, into giving back to the community that Brian so nobly represents.
