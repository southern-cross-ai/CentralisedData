        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister. Deputy Prime Minister, following the shocking deaths of thousands of sheep aboard the
        <i>
         Awassi Express
        </i>
        in 2017, some weak reforms to the live animal export industry were announced. It now turns out that despite most Australians still opposing this cruel trade, even the flimsy reforms have been quietly dumped. Deputy Prime Minister, this week why did you ignore the advice of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Maritime_Safety_Authority" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Maritime Safety Authority
        </a>
        and approve a live animal export ship failing ventilation requirements? And how can the community ever believe that the government cares about animal welfare when even the half-baked safeguards we do have are ignored on a ministerial whim?

         I do thank the member for Clark for his question and for his interest in this area. There is a commitment to phasing out two-tier vessels for live sheep exports. A ban on two-tier vessels was implemented through marine order 43, as the member for Clark would be aware, on 1 January.
        </p>
        <p>
         Where existing vessel operators require further transition time, and can demonstrate genuine intent to comply with the new standards, they are able to apply for limited—limited—and temporary exemptions for twin-tier decks carrying sheep. Any application will be considered on a case by case basis. They will be considered individually. Applicants must justify why they are unable to comply with legislated deck height and ventilation requirements, and submit a plan to comply with these requirements as soon as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
         As a condition for any exemption—any exemption whatsoever—exporters will also need to have an animal welfare management plan that has been approved by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Agriculture" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Agriculture
         </a>
         , Water and the Environment. My department has been working very, very closely with the Livestock Transport and Trading Co. , the exemption applicant, since 18 December last year to agree to a plan to enable them to meet the requirements under Marine Order 43 , with clear milestones to ensure that they are meeting their commitments. My department consulted with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AMSA" rel="nofollow">
          AMSA
         </a>
         , the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Maritime_Safety_Authority" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Maritime Safety Authority
         </a>
         , as the administrator of marine orders, including 43. AMSA did not—I repeat , did not — advise against the exemption application. The operator of the

         </i>
         <i>
          Shuwaikh
         </i>
         has committed to a timetable to comply with the requirements and has agreed on arrangements to manage animal welfare with the department of agriculture.
        </p>
        <p>
         On this basis, I've approved one temporary exemption to the twin-tier requirements for the vessel. The House should note that the exemption only relates to twin-tier requirements. It is only in relation to this decking and associated ventilation, and only for sheep. If the vessel doesn't comply with the agreed requirements, the exemption will be revoked. As always, the primary focus of this government is on meeting the highest possible animal welfare standards , as set out in the Export Supply Chain Assurance System . No other country that exports live animals has such a scheme in place. We do.

           It doesn't matter who it is; t he nation has it in place. The nation has it in place because animal welfare has to be first and foremost, and that's what we are doing.
          </p>
          <p>
           The live export trade is a major source of employment in the national red- meat sector. It' s worth $2 billion. And for the member for
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Connor" rel="nofollow">
            O'Connor
           </a>
           — and I know how important it is for him—it is worth $150 million per annum. That is significant money. That is jobs in regional Australia . Providing the animal welfare standards are being met, we will always back those sorts of industries , with those sorts of jobs and that sort of wealth creation.
