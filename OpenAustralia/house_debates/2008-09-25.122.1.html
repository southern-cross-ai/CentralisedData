        Today I want to talk about babies. I have a baby myself—he is two years and a couple of months old. In particular, I want to talk about the Bonnie Babes Foundation and to very strongly associate myself with the wonderful work that they do. As a young father of a two-year-old baby, I can only imagine how difficult it must be for some parents with children and babies with great challenges. Some of my constituents have asked me to help the Bonnie Babes Foundation as much as I can, and I want to talk about some of the things that they do because they are a wonderful organisation in our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Bonnie Babes Foundation provides medical equipment to hospitals for premature babies struggling in intensive care. As someone who has a sister and brother who are doctors, I quite often hear the stories that my brother and sister tell me when they are at home with me. So there is that link. The Bonnie Babes Foundation also assists with vital medical research into pregnancy loss and complications to women’s health during and following pregnancy. They provide education and training for health professionals. They also provide a 24-hour seven days a week free family crisis phone line for those who have lost their baby through miscarriage, stillbirth or premature birth. My mother lost a couple of babies, so helping mums who have miscarriages or stillbirths is something that is very close to our family.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Bonnie Babes Foundation also provide health, nutrition and wellness advice for women prior to and during pregnancy. They provide support for families with infertility issues and they provide support for babies born with abnormalities. They also support women who develop pre-eclampsia and other medical conditions during pregnancy. Those points say so much about the wonderful Bonnie Babes Foundation. I have a very young electorate, a very family type of constituency, and I enjoy very much the opportunities I get to talk to young parents, being one myself. On 16 October Bonnie Babes will be here in parliament and I encourage all my colleagues in the House and in the Senate to meet those that are leading this organisation and to support them in whatever way we can. This is an organisation that reflects very much the spirit of this great country.
