        This past weekend Frankston hosted the 19th annual Waterfront Festival. The stunning weather complemented the multiple live music stages, market stalls, food trucks, beer garden, rides and amusements, arts and craft, beach and water sports and more, which were bordered by the iconic sand sculptures organised by Sand Sculpting Australiaâ€”this year themed 'Aladdin and the Arabian Tales'. On the weekend the Frankston waterfront was the picture of a peninsula summer. I was thrilled to see the festival so well attended.

        We were especially fortunate to have the Commonwealth Games Queen's baton relay coincide with the festival, The relay convoy was cheered as it travelled through Frankston's CBD before arriving at the waterfront. Congratulations to the festival organisers and the local participants in the Queen's baton relay. One such participant was Lisa McLeish, a baton bearer from Frankston, who went from not being expected to be able to walk and talk when she was born to representing not only the residents of Frankston City Council but also all people with a disability, especially those who may never get the chance to do something like this in their lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        Between the Waterfront Festival and the Queen's baton relay, we are so proud of all the wonderful ambassadors who put Frankston and the electorate of Dunkley on show to the whole nation. It's still summer, so I invite anyone to come down to the electorate to visit and enjoy our wonderful beaches, our wonderful environment and our wonderful people.
