        I rise to speak about some of the magnificent contributions that volunteers in my community have given, particularly the Lions clubs and the Rotary clubs in my region. If we as state, federal or local governments were to put a price on the amount of man-hours contributed by these organisations—not only by Lions and Rotary but by all volunteer organisations—that would be a difficult figure to comprehend. I know that both state and federal governments are thankful to these organisations for the mountain of work that they have done.

        Last year, 2011, was the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Year" rel="nofollow">
         International Year
        </a>
        of the Volunteer, and Treasury put an estimate somewhere in the vicinity of $16.4 billion worth of benefit to the community generated by volunteer hours. Ironically in this year of 2012—the Year of the Farmer—the farmers in my electorate often think that they are working for the same financial gain as some of our volunteers did, believing that they are working for nothing. But today I congratulate members of my electorate of Wright who have made significant contributions to their community.

       <p>
        Firstly, I congratulate retiring Boonah Lions Club president, Andrew Bader, outgoing treasurer, Ian Pask, and re-elected secretary, Wally Sands. All of these men are mountains in their own community for the amount of work they get through. They go about their work very quietly, but if there is a hamburger stall, or a show or a function they are at the forefront, flipping burgers and serving drinks, and raising money for their organisation. I welcome the incoming president,

        </a>
        . Tom also does a mountain of work in the electorate and is a welcome president, as is the newly elected treasurer, Mile Murray. To all of those I say thank you for your contribution to the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to congratulate the Harrisville Lions Club on their 30-year anniversary, and in particular the outgoing president, Glenys Bentley, the first woman president of the club—what a wonderful milestone—and secretary, Mick Rashford, and treasurer, Duncan McInnes. Duncan is a local councillor and I take the opportunity to thank Duncan for his contribution to the community. Also, congratulations and welcome to the incoming president, Rob Quodling. Rob will do a magnificent job with the Harrisville Lions Club, along with secretary, Dennis Dwyer, and treasurer, Al Ledger. These people do magnificent work in their communities, and as a result the communities of Boonah and Harrisville are better off for their contributions.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank the House for its indulgence.
