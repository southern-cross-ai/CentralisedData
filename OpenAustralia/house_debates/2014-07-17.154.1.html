        I rise today to raise awareness of the remarkable Australian light-horse regiments who fought in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Beersheba" rel="nofollow">
         Battle of Beersheba
        </a>
        and Macarthur's special role as a training ground for these men and their horses. On 31 October, we will mark the anniversary of this armed and bloody battle, which is also known as the last successful cavalry charge in history. Even though our Anzacs emerged victorious from the Battle of Beersheba, this victory occurred against the most fearful odds. Armed with sheer bloody audacity, 800 Anzacs defeated 4,000 Turks; 31 men died, 36 were wounded and 70 horses were killed in this battle. This remarkable and decisive victory changed the history of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and helped create the Australian light-horse legend.

        Gullet wrote about the charge of Beersheba:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        These Australian countrymen had never in all their riding at home ridden in a race like this â€¦ and all ranks from the heroic ground scouts galloping in the front of their squadron leaders, to the men in the third line, drove in their spurs and charged on Beersheba.
       </p>
       <p>
        He went on to say:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The fine exploit of the 4th and 12th regiments, although only 400 or 500 light horsemen actually made touch with the enemy, had a far reaching effect on the whole campaign.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fred Eves, an Australian with the light horse ambulance who settled in Campbelltown after the war, said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        When I saw those first lines charge in all I could think was, thank God I'm an Australian. I've never seen boys fight like them!
       </p>
       <p>
        So whilst Gallipoli is one of Anzacs' best known battles in military history, the Battle of Beersheba is described as one of Australia's greatest military triumphs. An extraordinary and decisive victory of the world's youngest nations, in an ancient land far from home, changed the history of the Middle East and helped created the

        legend.
       </p>
       <p>
        This battle and the men who fought in it are particularly special to many families in my electorate. Macarthur is a place rich with equestrian heritage, and military records confirm that local Light Horse ranks contain many of Macarthur's skilled horseback riders. Macarthur is also home to

        , which played a significant role as a training ground for many men and horses that left Australia for the Middle East and Europe in

        Local resident Steve Wisbey is the proud descendent of Frederick Cave Wisbey, his great-grandfather who served in the 7th
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Horse_Regiment" rel="nofollow">
         Light Horse Regiment
        </a>
        at Beersheba. Steve's grandfather often shared stories with his family of the 7th Light Horse Regiment in the harsh Middle East desert and the Battle of Beersheba. Frederick Wisbey was 16 years old when he went to war and travelled from Egypt to Gallipoli and back to the Middle East. Fortunately for his family Frederick returned home but, sadly, for so many others that trained on local soil at Menangle Park, that was not the case. Steve told me that his great-grandfather was a part of history that is truly difficult to imagine in all its horror and glory.
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though it is difficult to imagine the fear and horror our Anzacs experienced in this battle, we must continue to honour and recognise their heroic and brave efforts. That is why I am proud to see that the Macarthur community will honour these brave soldiers and their horses with a series of events over the next four years. This year Tabcorp Park Menangle chief executive John Dumesny and the

        harness racing club have organised a commemorative service and breakfast at the Menangle racecourse to celebrate Beersheba Day on 31 October. I praise John and the racing club for this wonderful tribute. The event will include Australian Light Horse in full uniform to parade and lay wreathes and special guest speaker
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Col_Stringer" rel="nofollow">
         Col Stringer

        , author of
        <i>
         800 Horsemen
        </i>
        . In his book, Stringer reflects on the battle that opened up the doorway to the liberation of Jerusalem and the way for the foundation of the modern nation of Israel. This is something no other nation had been able to achieve in over 1,400 years. It was the first foreign army in the history of Israel to take Jerusalem, only to give it back, giving freedom to the Jewish people, and not taking it for themselves.
       </p>
       <p>
        We were the world's youngest nation in an ancient land far from home. So this is truly a remarkable story of man and horse that the Macarthur community wants to honour. To mark the Battle of Beersheba centenary anniversary on 31 October 2017, John and local residents Steve Wisbey and Susan Peacock are working hard to have a statue erected at the local paceway in tribute to the horseback regiment. They are also organising a range of community events to commemorate those who fought in the battle and Macarthur's role in training the victorious regiment.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am extremely proud of this committee for organising these events so that the Macarthur community can remember and honour these brave young horsemen and their great military triumph. I also praise their commitment and efforts in raising the profile of Beersheba Day and for encouraging community involvement in creating the memorial. I encourage John, Steve and Susan to keep up their fantastic work as they pay tribute to a very special part of Macarthur's history that will be remembered by local residents for many years come.
