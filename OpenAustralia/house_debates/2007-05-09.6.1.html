       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        As announced in the 2007-08 budget, this bill will make amendments to the Superannuation (Government Co-contribution for Low Income Earners) Act 2003 to double the government co-contribution in respect of contributions made during the 2005-06 income year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Take the example of a person who earned under $28,000 in 2005-06 and who boosted their retirement savings by contributing $1,000 to superannuation out of their take-home pay. Provided they met the other eligibility criteria they would have already received a government co-contribution of $1,500.
       </p>
       <p>
        This person will now receive an extra $1,500 government contribution.
       </p>
       <p>
        They have turned their initial $1,000 into $4,000, turbocharging their retirement savings. This amount will remain invested in their superannuation account, growing over time until they are ready to retire.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the majority of cases the additional co-contribution will be paid to superannuation funds before 30 June 2007. Remaining amounts will be paid in 2007-08.
       </p>
       <p>
        This measure will result in an extra $1.1 billion being paid directly into the superannuation accounts of low- to middle-income Australians. This is in addition to the $2 billion of government co-contributions that have already been paid into superannuation under this highly successful scheme.
       </p>
       <p>
        This time last year the government announced the most significant changes to Australia’s superannuation system in decades, including extending the government co-contribution scheme to the self-employed. In addition, the income thresholds for the co-contribution scheme will be indexed next financial year in line with growth in wages.
       </p>
       <p>
        These measures are made possible by this government’s continuing strong record of sound economic management.
       </p>
       <p>
        Full details of the measures in this bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate (on motion by
        <b>
         Mr Crean
        </b>
        ) adjourned.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordered that the resumption of the debate be made an order of the day for a later hour this day.
