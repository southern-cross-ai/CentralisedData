       <p>
        Australia boasts having such an advanced and comprehensive safety net for our citizens. Medicare is undoubtedly one of the world’s finest health care systems, with universal access to quality and affordable medical treatment. We do not regard it as a luxury; we regard it as a right for every Australian citizen. Unfortunately, however, there are people that are falling through the cracks. This is highlighted with the need for long-term care and support for Australians that live with a disability. Every person in Australia knows someone affected by a disability. Those with members of their family suffering from long-term disability understand the emotional, physical and certainly the financial impact it has. There are too many Australians who, as a result of their disability, feel disempowered and unable to live independent lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        Compounding this lack of autonomy, disabled people are often disproportionately likely to face economic hardship, social problems and, very disturbingly and most unjustly, those suffering with intellectual disabilities or mobility impairment are more than likely to be unemployed, welfare dependent, live in public housing, and many you will find in our jails. Currently, people with disabilities tend to be reliant on the love and commitment of parents and the extended family, assuming that they will provide all the necessary support and care. As horrible as it may seem to mention, what happens to these people when their parents pass on? That is something I am regularly asked in my electorate. What I am advocating for is for social and economic justice. I am talking about the government finally introducing a national scheme that provides insurance for every individual who has been dealt such a hard hand in life and suffers long-term disability.
       </p>
       <p>
        I speak, of course, of a national disability insurance scheme. The scheme has recently received the attention of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Productivity Commission
        </a>
        in the production of its recent report. In addition to being an equitable and just arrangement, this new initiative contributes to the productivity and sustainability of our nation. The commission has reported that by providing an insurance scheme the growth in employment for people with disability will be 100,000 people by the year 2050. That is certainly a boost for national
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GDP" rel="nofollow">
         GDP
        </a>
        . Furthermore, 4,200 carers who have had to give up their work will have the opportunity to re-enter the workforce. The initiative requires $13.5 billion to be set aside each year by the federal government. However, given the potential economic gains to be made it seems to me that the benefits certainly far outweigh the costs, particularly if we describe ourselves as a caring nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the National Disability Service points out, increasing disability employment has a microeconomic implication specifically addressing Australia’s ageing population. I regularly get to meet with and consult with disability groups in my electorate, no doubt as every other member does. The message that I have received is rather clear and unambiguous. They see a need for more support to be provided. I recently met with the staff, carers and clients of families during my DisabiliTea that I had with the Australian Foundation for Disabilities, known as AFFORD. This foundation provides employment skills, development and accommodation, and supports over 1,400 people with disabilities and their families. Within my electorate I also hosted a disability forum to engage with families about the issues that affected them on a day-to-day basis. One of the main issues that was raised at the forum was the need for a national disability insurance scheme, and that is what I communicated to Parliamentary Secretary Jan McLucas, who also attended that forum with me.
       </p>

        I am proud to be a part of the Labor Party that has taken this issue that has historically been committed to the periphery and brought it to the front and centre. I, along with my colleagues, see great opportunities for areas such as schooling, housing, jobs, and essentially basic areas that we take for granted to be accessible to all. Australia is one of the few Western nations that has ratified the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        rights of a person with a disability and now it is our responsibility to act on that commitment.
