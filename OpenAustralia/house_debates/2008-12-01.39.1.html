        My question is to the Prime Minister. Does the Prime Minister stand by his election commitment that through fibre to the node his government will deliver broadband to 98 per cent of Australians for $4.7 billion of taxpayers’ money?

         The government’s commitment has not changed. Consistent with the discussion of sorts we have just had in this place about the state of digital education in Australian schools—the government was left with a mess on that score by our predecessors which we are now seeking to fix—when it comes to the state of high-speed broadband in the country, we are left with exactly the same challenge. According to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OECD" rel="nofollow">
          OECD
         </a>
         comparative tables, we are lurking right down towards the bottom somewhere between the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slovak_Republic" rel="nofollow">
          Slovak Republic
         </a>
         and Slovenia. I would have thought that a modern economy seeking to build itself into a 21st century economy could do a lot better than that. But that is where the former government sat, and they flipped and flopped year in and year out without actually delivering any substantive outcome on that score. Broadband is critical in laying out the infrastructure of the 21st century. High-speed broadband is very much the railroad of the 21st century, the arteries of the new economy, and will be a critical piece of infrastructure for the future.

         The government last week received proposals for the national broadband network. The government, as the honourable member will be aware, received six proposals. It is important to have an open process. The government’s independent expert panel will now have eight weeks to assess these proposals and provide advice to government. We intend to get on with the business of investing in the future.

          I am particularly taken by those opposite who are

          who literally sat on their hands about this piece of infrastructure that is so necessary for small businesses, families, and kids wanting to do their homework properly and connect with their teachers. We are making sure that the system is working properly; we are making sure that you can run a home based business. This government has got on with the business of rolling out a national broadband network. We are proud of what we intend to do. We have allocated funding for that purpose. We are getting on with the business of nation building for Australia’s future, which those opposite did not know the meaning of when they occupied these benches.
