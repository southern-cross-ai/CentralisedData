       <p>
        The private members motion which I have moved today represents an opportunity for the government to show that it does care about Australian agriculture and that it does understand the concerns of banana growers. Across the farming and horticultural sector the Rudd government’s Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is starting to be referred to as the minister for Punchbowl. Members would all be aware that Punchbowl is a major part of the minister’s city seat. There is, of course, nothing wrong with Punchbowl, except that members would be aware that it is not a region renowned for its agricultural production.
       </p>
       <p>
        Farmers are becoming increasingly concerned that the government’s minister for agriculture is demonstrating that he has no understanding, no empathy and no comprehension of many of the key issues which relate to agriculture. Instead of standing up for the sector which he is meant to represent, we now have a minister who is simply becoming an apologist for the poor policies of the Rudd government. The issue of importing bananas from the Philippines is a prime example. The Australian banana industry has more than 800 growers and employs some 5,000 people. Despite declining prices for their excellent product, the industry survives because growers operate efficiently and because they produce quality product which is essentially disease free. That will all be at risk if the Rudd Labor government gives the green light to the importation of bananas from the Philippines.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are many reasons that we should not permit bananas to be imported from the Philippines. There is the risk of disease, there is the threat to our food security and there is the impact on banana-growing communities if such an industry were shut down. However, the overwhelming issue here relates to the science and risk management measures which have been applied in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosecurity_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Biosecurity Australia
        </a>
        ’s import risk assessment of Filipino bananas. There is a real threat of disease from these imports which could wipe out our local industry. The Australian banana industry boasts a clean green image. Unlike in many other countries, our bananas are relatively disease free. That makes the Australian banana a quality product and the envy of many other nations. It therefore defies belief that the Rudd Labor government would consider permitting bananas to be imported from a country which has a disease record as prevalent as the Philippines has.
       </p>
       <p>
        Biosecurity Australia’s import risk assessment into Philippine bananas is long on rhetoric and short on detail, particularly in relation to the risk management measures aimed at preventing disease being imported into Australia. It is of great concern that our national industry is dependent on processes taking place in the Philippines. Of primary concern is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BA" rel="nofollow">
         BA
        </a>
        ’s visual inspection process which they say will be put in place to mitigate the threat of disease. We have no idea who is going to conduct these inspections. We have no idea how thoroughly it will be conducted. We have no idea as to whether those being charged with the responsibility of protecting Australia’s interests may be subject to a conflict of interest. Will Australian quarantine officers be inspecting the bananas on the ground or will they be hiring Filipino contractors to perform this role? What processes are in place to guarantee the integrity of these inspections? How comprehensive will these inspections be? How comprehensive will the sampling process be? I see the member for Kennedy in here and he is obviously concerned about the import of bananas into this country. There are also significant costs in relation to this process. Who will bear the costs? What processes are in place to check whether there is any prospect that there is corruption in this process?
       </p>
       <p>
        We all remember the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EI" rel="nofollow">
         EI
        </a>
        outbreak, which almost brought the equestrian industry to its knees. That was caused by an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AQIS" rel="nofollow">
         AQIS
        </a>
        mistake. That was something we were able to recover from, but with the banana industry there are no second chances. For the benefit of members, let me put on the record for the House that once a foreign disease enters into this country there will be little or no chance of eradicating it. From that point of view and that point of view alone, the risk of importing Filipino bananas is just too great.
       </p>
       <p>
        The recent inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport ordered that, prior to any permit being issued for Filipino banana imports, AQIS and BA shall provide the committee with a detailed list of the risk management measures and the administrative requirements relating to them. The important part of the committee’s recommendations is that they focused not on the theory of how this might work and the procedure manual that is dumped in the corner and disregarded. They were more concerned with how these risk management measures would work commercially on the ground in the Philippines—the actual way they would work in practice, not in theory.
       </p>
       <p>
        During a visit to my electorate by the National Party leadership team of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Truss" rel="nofollow">
         Warren Truss
        </a>
        and Senators Joyce, Nash and Scullion, we took the opportunity to meet with a number of banana growers. We met with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Gray" rel="nofollow">
         Ron Gray
        </a>
        , Wally Gateley,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Pike" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Tate" rel="nofollow">
         David Tate
        </a>
        in

         Coffs Harbour
        </a>
        . They were very concerned about the prospect of banana imports. They were very concerned, indeed. They were very concerned about the fact that, in the area of the Coffs Coast and around Coffs Harbour, if disease was to get into those plantations on the steep hillsides where access for machinery is very difficult it would be virtually impossible to eradicate. So any imported disease whatsoever would be the end of the Australian banana industry. That is of great concern. Coffs Harbour banana growers do not want to see their industry decimated. Coffs Harbour banana growers do not mind fair competition, but they do not want competition that is going to introduce diseases and pests which will be impossible to eradicate, which will decimate our industry and which will be bad for Australia in general.
       </p>
       <p>
        The growers also raised the issue of food security. The fact is that we have had drought in this country and the world’s growing population means that, more than ever, Australia needs to be able to guarantee that it is able to feed itself and that it is able to continue to produce high-quality fruit and vegetables into the future. Importing Filipino bananas can only work against that end.

           <p>
            Thank you, Member for Kennedy. I am sure that you are as passionate about the import of bananas as I am. You are very much an outspoken member on the issue of bananas. But we have the opportunity today for the Labor members opposite to actually support their local industry, to actually support the call that the government not permit the importation of bananas into this country.
           </p>
           <p>
            We have the member for Leichhardt here, and I am sure that his local growers would be very keen to see our local clean, green image maintained and the potential threat from imported Filipino pests averted. Also, the member for Page, who will be speaking in this debate later, has growers in her electorate. I know that they will be very keen to see that the importation of bananas from the Philippines will not go ahead. It is vitally important that we ensure the integrity of our quarantine system and that we ensure that we have an effective quarantine system.
           </p>
           <p>
            Despite that, the fact is that there is a risk. What we are talking about here is the fact that importation from a place where pests and diseases are as prevalent as they are in the Philippines means that it is not a question of if pests and diseases will be imported into Australia on Filipino bananas; it is just a question of when. If we allow imports from the Philippines, where there is basically every banana pest and disease known to man, it is an absolute certainty that our industry will ultimately bear the brunt of those diseases. It is an absolute certainty that these diseases will arrive on our doorstep. It is an absolute certainty that our industry will be decimated. I for one do not want to see our local banana industry decimated. I for one want to see the Rudd Labor government stand up for our local banana growers, stand up for our local industry and stand up for the fact that we need to maintain our clean, green image. The risk from Filipino banana imports is too great. It is a risk that the local
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffs_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
             Coffs Harbour
            </a>
            and Coffs Coast banana industry cannot bear. It is a risk that the Australian banana industry cannot bear. Filipino bananas must not come into this country.

            </small>
            <p>
             I rise to speak on the motion concerning the importation of bananas. This is a very serious issue, and it is an issue of particular importance to the region that I represent—Leichhardt and tropical
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
              North Queensland
             </a>
             . I see the member for Kennedy, who is from that part of the world, in the chamber. I look forward to his contribution because he is very clear on this matter. He does not change his point of view, and he stands by what he says. His position is very different from that of the National Party. The member for Cowper spoke on this motion prior to me. It was the National Party who started this process back in 2000. It was their idea. It was the National Party, who, when in government, were working through and implementing this import risk assessment. We have picked up the National Party process and have continued on with it. That is the reality of being in government.
            </p>
            <p>
             I do not seek to move around on this issue. What I seek to do is outline the situation of the import risk assessment and the quarantine system in this country. The reality is that the National Party are political opportunists. They do not actually represent or stand for anything. When they were in government, they were like mice on this issue. Now that they are in opposition they are like elephants on the issue, stomping around the place and wanting to make a big noise, but they did nothing while in government. They did not deliver anything. I can assure members that this government has moved through the process. It has recognised that the import risk assessment process needs to be scientific. We went back and made sure that the bar was raised significantly higher than the import risk assessment established under the previous government—and the bar is now significantly higher.
            </p>
            <p>
             Like the member for Kennedy, I do not want to see bananas imported into this country. I do not want to see that, but the reality is that we export sugar, which also comes from tropical North Queensland. And we export beef and wheat. We are out there in the international community arguing that countries should open up their markets. We cannot make the simple statement that we are not going to accept bananas from the Philippines while we are out there arguing for our wheat, beef, wool and sugar to be exported to other countries. We need to make sure that our scientifically based quarantine inspection process is properly run and assessed, and that is what the government is seeking to do.
            </p>
            <p>
             I come from a rural background. I was born on a property in the Territory. My parents grew bananas around the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_River" rel="nofollow">
              Adelaide River
             </a>
             . When I was a kid, we sent the bananas to Darwin to be sold. That is how my mum and dad made a quid. I have packed bananas. I have worked in a banana packing shed. I have been down to Innisfail and Tully—the areas that Mr Katter represents—to help people there to clean up after tropical
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Larry" rel="nofollow">
              Cyclone Larry
             </a>
             . I have great empathy and great passion for the industry. I do not have many banana farmers in my electorate—maybe none—but I do know that it is an important economic driver for the community that I represent. It supports a range of different people—local Indigenous people and other local community people. It also supports tourists from all around the world who come to Australia to backpack around the country and to work in the local communities. It is an important industry and it drives my local economy.

             I recognise that there is real risk from banana imports from the Philippines, but we cannot just say no. We need to work through properly established quarantine processes and laws. That is what the government is doing. Minister Burke also appreciates the situation. I have written and spoken to him about it and he has responded to the issues that I have raised. The government appreciates and understands the concerns of banana growers who want to ensure that their industry remains free of pests and diseases. This is why the Australian Director of Animal and Plant Quarantine has established a stringent quarantine policy for the importation of bananas from the Philippines that is consistent with Australia’s conservative approach to quarantine.

             will be required to demonstrate to Australia’s satisfaction that the risk management measures set out in the determination can be achieved under commercial conditions on an ongoing basis before trade can commence.

             officers will be applying Australian quarantine conditions in the field, including inspecting, verifying and auditing processes in the Philippines both before and during the export of bananas. In addition, the Philippines will need to undertake laboratory and field experiments prior to exports occurring.
            </p>
            <p>
             Australian quarantine inspectors need to go to the Philippines and they need to ensure that our quarantine standards are met. We do not want to see bananas imported into this country, but we cannot just say no. We have got to go through a proper quarantine process. We have raised the bar very, very high, and I do not think that we will see bananas imported into this country. But we cannot say no; we have got to go through appropriate quarantine processes.

             This motion has been moved by the National Party, but I do not think there are any Nats north of Bundaberg anymore. This is supposedly a party that represents rural and regional Australia but cannot win a seat up in North Queensland. It does not represent too any people in rural and regional Queensland. We have a Liberal up in Herbert, Mr Lindsay; we have got an Independent, Mr Katter; and we have got the member for Flynn, the member for Dawson and the member for Capricornia—who are all good Labor Party members. Like me up in Leichhardt, they are looking to represent rural and regional Australia. The National Party are opportunists. They do not actually seek to do things in government; they seek to take opportunities and they do not actually stand for anything. But we do.

                  And the grape industry. The import risk assessment analysis was commenced in 2000, an issues paper was released in May 2001, and three draft reports were released between 2002 and 2007. On 3 July 2000,

                   Warren Truss

                  stated that the
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRA" rel="nofollow">
                   IRA
                  </a>
                  would allow for a ‘careful scientific assessment of quarantine risks as well as opportunities for widespread consultation with all stakeholders’. This is the Leader of the National Party today. This is what he was saying back in 2000, which is quite different from what we are hearing from the opposition benches today.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  On 28 March 2002, Mr Truss stated that the IRA would be a ‘rigorous one based solely on sound science’ and that ‘neither threats of trade retaliation by the Philippines or publicity campaigns by the Australian industry will be taken into account in the decision’. Following the change of government this process, which was already underway, was inherited by the current government. So when they were in government they were talking about taking a scientifically based approach and working through the quarantine processes. In opposition they are grandstanding on an issue for cheap political point-scoring. That is the reality of what they are doing here tonight. They are not dealing seriously with this issue, a really important issue. They are seeking to grandstand and to generate some votes in their supposed ‘heartland’, but they do not have any heartland up in

                  A draft final report was provided to the Eminent Scientists Group in mid 2008, and the final report was published in November 2008. It was then subject to an appeal period before being provided to the Director of Quarantine to consider the making of a policy determination.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  In line with

                  ’s final import risk assessment report, issued in November 2008, the Philippines will be required to demonstrate to Australia’s satisfaction that the risk management measures set out in the determination can be achieved under commercial conditions on an ongoing basis before any trade can commence. Bananas from the Philippines will be approved for importation to Australia only if the Philippines can demonstrate that they can implement Australia’s required quarantine measures. The measures are designed to limit the risk of pest and disease entry to a very low level, consistent with the Australian appropriate level of protection. We have raised the bar very, very high. I do not want to see banana imports into Australia but, like I said, we export beef, wheat, wool and other things. We are arguing for the opening up of trade in other countries. We cannot simply say no to banana imports from the Philippines. We need to base our quarantine policy on solid science, and that is what the government have sought to do with our import risk assessment and the decisions that we will make about whether bananas can come into this country.

                  Last Friday, I met Mark Nucifora, the Chairman of the Innisfail Banana Growers Association. When we won government I facilitated meetings between Minister Burke and the banana industry—with people like
                  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Leahy" rel="nofollow">
                   Patrick Leahy
                  </a>
                  , the immediate past president of the Australian Banana Growers Council; Nicky Singh, the President of the Australian Banana Growers Council; Cameron Mackay, vice-president of the Banana Growers Council; and Len Collins, the imports committee chairman.
                 </p>
                 <p>
                  So I have been talking to the banana industry. I understand how important it is. My door is open and I am keen to talk to them about further issues and concerns they have got. But I will take a scientific based approach to this—I will not seek to politically grandstand on this issue as the opposition have done tonight in bringing this motion on. The reality is that they started this import risk assessment—they started this process. The Rudd government have taken it over. We have raised the bar in terms of the import risk assessment. We have made a very difficult decision. I do not believe that we will see banana imports coming into this country. It was their IRA. We are getting on with the job of supporting rural communities in electorates like mine.

How would I, Member for Leichhardt, consider taking this as a joke? What I am confronted with is a situation where there is a very strong likelihood that, under this government, including the member for Leichhardt, our internationally recognised green image is going to be destroyed; and that is no joke. The reason it may be destroyed is that you are going to make platitudes about the necessity of free trade and you are going to assume the position that you are all righteous in this matter, and I do not believe you have that righteousness.

                                    I believe that it is right to do what is right, and today and tomorrow is what is important to banana growers in Australia—t yesterday, quite frankly. I can include in that logic the member for Kennedy, because he is a logical fellow and he knows that, regardless of the cause and regardless of the conduit, what we need is a disease-free banana industry in Australia. To put that at risk, for any political or philosophical view, is simply not good enough. I do not care about yesterday; I care about my growers, their reputation and their sales in Australia tomorrow.

                                    I know quite well a banana grower who has invested in Philippine banana production. He is also largely represented in Australian banana production. Even though it is his bananas that could be introduced from the Philippines into Australian markets, at possibly great profit, our green image is worth more to him, as an Australian banana grower—rather than to be opportunistic and import bananas from the Philippines to Australia, because a bird in the hand in this case is not worth two in the bush. He knows that our reputation, so bitterly fought for and so well deserved, could so quickly be lost. I, as I said, represent the expanding

The fact is that they have this motion before the parliament, when it is something that they initiated, and they should have the guts to stand up and say, ‘That’s what we did.’ It is absolute political cowardice to come in here and say one thing—

                                        It is just total political fraud and political cowardice to do this. You should be honest with your constituents, honest with the members in the electorate. Of course we care about biosecurity. Of course we care about clean and green. Of course we care about the banana industry. But to act as though you have had nothing to do with this—that it just all of a sudden appeared—is absolutely ludicrous and duplicitous.

                                                   This is actually duplicitous. I sit side by side with the member for Cowper, so I see what he does. He writes things down and says one thing here and then says another thing at home. I do not. I actually say what is going on. You remember Mr Truss? Mr Truss, your leader—the new face of the Nationals—has dishonestly tried to blame the federal government, when he himself initiated the very process which led to the decision. I am all about taking responsibility for decisions, and that is what the nine members of the National Party in the lower house should do—and not duck and weave and say one thing here and another thing back out there. It is absolute humbug.

They were there when all of these things happened. The net result is that this country is now a net importer of fruit and vegetables. This did not happen under the ALP. This happened under you. Each year it got progressively worse, and we have cried and screamed. The honourable member for Leichhardt says that we have got to be truthful and scientific.
