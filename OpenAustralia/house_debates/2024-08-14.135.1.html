        earning her fifth Olympic medal; cyclist Matthew Glaetzer, who lost four bronze medal races in the past four Olympics, beating thyroid cancer and finally getting an Olympic medal in Paris; and Jessica Hull becoming the first Australian woman to claim a medal in the 1,500 metres and propelling the athletics team to its best result since Melbourne in 1956. We saw Saya Sakakibara, the

        For Canberrans, the success of Australia at the Olympics is a special source of pride because of the work that the

In canoeing, the men's K4 spent time in their boat, training in the AIS pool in Canberra, with Paddle Australia and the AIS biomechanics and engineers teaming up to help them find the crucial milliseconds during the race start they needed.
