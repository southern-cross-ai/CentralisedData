        This morning I would like to reflect on a number of important community organisations in my electorate that are doing great work in my area. Recently, I attended the 37th annual Lugarno Lions
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_Festival" rel="nofollow">
         Spring Festival
        </a>
        at Gannons Park, down in Peakhurst. As always, there were lots of festivities and rides. The classic cars were there again this year, and there were a wide variety of food stalls and so on. Many thousands of people attended, as they do every year. Even though, unfortunately, the weather was not the best this year, thousands of people still turned out, which was great to see. I would like to congratulate the Lions on their efforts again this yearâ€”Greg English, the president;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Slack" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , the secretary; and Ivan McKay, who played a huge role in organising the event this year, as he does every year. It was good to be able to assist Ivan with one or two activities on the day. Thank you, again, to the Lugarno Lions, for their great efforts in the Spring Festival. Of course, all the funds raised go to charity, as they do every year. Since 1974, the Lugarno Lions have raised over $2 million for charity, so thank you to the Lions.
       </p>

        I also recently attended the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddha's_Light_International_Association" rel="nofollow">
         Buddha's Light International Association
        </a>
        temple at Kogarah. About five per cent of people in my electorate are of the Buddhist faith, and I always enjoy visiting the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLIA" rel="nofollow">
         BLIA
        </a>
        and catching up with them on issues. It was good to see
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Wong" rel="nofollow">
         Francis Wong
        </a>
        , the president; Reverend Yao; and all of the local attendees of the temple on the day. The BLIA does a lot of great work in our broader community, raising funds for different activities. After the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains" rel="nofollow">
         Blue Mountains
        </a>
        bushfires a number of years ago, they raised tens of thousands of dollars in support. They also have activities such as sending people into nursing homes to provide companionship and entertainment through their singing groups to local residents. So thank you, BLIA, for your activities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to congratulate Oatley
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        Youth Netball Club on their recent annual presentation. Robyn Ellis, the president, does a great job and has for many years. It was good to be down there at Maso's in Mortdale to present a number of awards. The Banks Outstanding Sporting Achievement Awards, which I commenced in 2014, are a good way of acknowledging the efforts of, particularly, our young kids in sport in the local community. As part of the broader Oatley RSL Youth Club, the netball club does a fantastic job in providing opportunities for our local kids.
