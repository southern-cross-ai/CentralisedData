        I rise to send my sincere condolences to the family and friends of those affected by the horrifying terrorist attack in Mogadishu, Somalia on the weekend. On Saturday two deadly car bombs were detonated in a crowded street in the middle of a traffic jam in Mogadishu. Information is still coming through, but at the last count 276 people were killed in this attack and over 300 people were injured. This is the worst terrorist attack in Somali history, one of the deadliest attacks in the

        </a>
        and one of the most lethal in the world. President Mohamed Abdullahi 'Farmajo' Mohamed declared there would be a three-day mourning period for Somalia and stated:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We will observe three days of mourning for innocent victims, flags will be flown at half-mast. Time to unite and pray together. Terror won't win.
       </p>
       <p>
        This was a cowardly, cruel attack designed to intimidate everyday Somali people. The terrorists wanted to disrupt the lives of ordinary Somalis, to scare them and to bring chaos to that nation. As we have done in the face of terrorist attacks around the world in recent times, we must stand united in solidarity with the Somali people in the face of these cowardly attacks on innocent people. Australia is home to many Somali Australians who have fled violence and conflict in their country of birth to start their lives anew in our country. I offer my thoughts and condolences to them too as we face this common scourge together.
