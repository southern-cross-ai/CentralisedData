        My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, yesterday's federal budget listed 10 city and regional deals, including—surprise, surprise!—the Launceston City Deal for the marginal electorate of Bass. But there was no mention of the Hobart City Deal, which was announced with much fanfare two years ago and which has seen little action beyond the $30 million social housing package I negotiated. Prime Minister: remember the Hobart deal promised the Antarctic precinct at Macquarie Point, activation of the rail corridor and to address Hobart's terrible traffic congestion and housing crisis. So when is the government going to deliver these vital initiatives for Tasmania's capital? Or don't they pass the pork-barrelling test? No wonder the public detests politics and politicians.

         The member for Clark can speak for himself! But I thank the member for Clark for his question. I was in Hobart with the former Tasmanian Premier,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Hodgman" rel="nofollow">
          Will Hodgman
         </a>
         , in February 2019 when we announced that deal, with around $1.7 billion in investment. We also expect that deal to create over 1,400 jobs. Before I hand over to the minister responsible, let me update the member on a couple of things.
        </p>
        <p>
         Design work on the replacement of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgewater_Bridge" rel="nofollow">
          Bridgewater Bridge
         </a>
         is continuing. We expect the Commonwealth investment in this project will be some $461 million, and we anticipate works will begin on that next year. Direct flights from Hobart to Auckland recommenced on 21 April 2021 for the first time since 1996, and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
          Air New Zealand
         </a>
         is now flying the service twice a week into Hobart. Forty-eight properties have already been tenanted through the $30 million investment to deliver at least 100 new dwellings in the Greater Hobart region, in partnership with community housing providers. I know that's a topic the member is keenly interested in and played a key role in when we formed this deal. And city deal partners are considering the findings of a study of potential transport solutions to the northern suburbs transport corridor, which will help to identify the most economic and efficient option. I'll ask the minister to add further to the answer.

          I thank the member for his question, and I thank the Prime Minister for the opportunity to add to his answer. Certainly, the Morrison government is very focused on the Hobart City Deal. As the Prime Minister mentioned, one of the elements of the city deal is the $82.3 million commitment for the provision of border services to allow international flights to come into
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobart_Airport" rel="nofollow">
           Hobart Airport
          </a>
          . So I was very pleased to be able to represent the Morrison government on 22 April this year at the Hobart Airport to welcome the first international flight coming in from Auckland—in other words, a key element of the city deal being delivered.
         </p>
         <p>
          Another element of the city deal—as the member rightly refers to and, indeed, had some important involvement in—is the $30 million commitment to affordable housing. I was pleased to have the chance to visit a group of houses which had been built under the program recently. I visited Kathleen Moore, who resides in one of those homes. She thanked the government for her new home and made the point that her rent was previously 80 per cent of her pension and that, now, thanks to these new housing arrangements, it's 25 per cent of her pension.
         </p>
         <p>
          As the Prime Minister has rightly said, work is well advanced on
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgewater_Bridge" rel="nofollow">
           Bridgewater Bridge
          </a>
          , a major component of the Hobart City Deal. In relation to the Antarctic and Science Precinct at Macquarie Point, a detailed business case is presently being developed and there's been very extensive engagement with stakeholders. I've been pleased to have discussions with the state minister, the relevant council mayors and other stakeholders on this project.
