        Recently I was honoured to attend the official unveiling ceremony, dedication and commemorative service of the Rotary Kokoda Memorial Wall in Cascade Gardens, Broadbeach. The Kokoda memorial at Cascade Gardens has been created to help visitors to Cascade Gardens appreciate the courage and determination of the men who fought on the

        . The memorial was unveiled on the occasion of the 66th anniversary of the first shots fired by the 39th Australian Infantry Battalion and the

        Kokoda Track campaign, fought between July and November 1942.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Kokoda memorial wall was commenced in 2003 with concept plans drawn up by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast City Council
        </a>
        under the guidance of Rotarian George Friend, who had conceived the idea in 2001. In 2005 local artist and resident of McPherson David Yardley was commissioned by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        of Broadwater Southport to develop the design and construct the wall. From concept to a complete set of plans, David has told the story of Kokoda through sculptured images on the face of a slightly curved memorial wall in the shape of the Kokoda Track. These images are based on the famous photos taken by wartime photographers and correspondents
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damien_Parer" rel="nofollow">
         Damien Parer
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Silk" rel="nofollow">
         George Silk
        </a>
        and are imposed on seven panels. The top edge of the design follows the line of the track over the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Owen_Stanley_Range" rel="nofollow">
         Owen Stanley Range
        </a>
        , the central mountain range running through PNG. Each of the seven three-dimensional panels tells part of the story of the World War II Kokoda campaign.
       </p>
       <p>
        Panel 1 tells of the arrival of the first troops at Port Moresby in early 1942 and their deployment to fight on the Kokoda Track, beginning their journey at the Golden Staircase, the entry to the jungle. Panel 2 depicts Imita Ridge, the first major geographical obstacle of the Kokoda Track. The saw-toothed top edge of the wall is an exact replica of the torturous terrain which defines the track as one of the most difficult walking trails in the world. Panel 3 tells of the fuzzy wuzzy angels. Australian soldiers are to this day indebted to the courage, commitment and resolve of the Papuan people in their role of carrying supplies and evacuating the wounded on the Kokoda Track. Panel 4 shows the village of Menari. Troops, carriers and the wounded are depicted in chaos receiving supplies and refreshments from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvation_Army" rel="nofollow">
         Salvation Army
        </a>
        . Panel 5 shows a wounded man being assisted by his mates at a graveside as well as troops moving forward from the midpoint of the Kokoda Track to the next battle. The inscribed words ‘courage’, ‘endurance’, ‘mateship’ and ‘sacrifice’ help define us as a nation and are also engraved on the four granite monoliths at the Isurava Memorial in PNG. Panel 6 is dedicated to the Papuan Infantry Battalion, who fought alongside the Australians, as well as commandoes, coastwatchers and those who undertook the aerial resupply of ammunition and other supplies. Panel 7 depicts the Battle of Isurava, the site of some of the most intense fighting in the Kokoda Track campaign. It illustrates the determination, raw courage, commitment and selflessness so often displayed by soldiers on the Kokoda Track. This final panel details the initial withdrawal and the victorious return to reoccupy the village and ultimately expel the invaders from the beaches of Buna and Gona. The rear of the wall will be inscribed in bronze with a dedication to all who fought in and supported the campaign and also offers details of the significant points, villages and battles along the track.
       </p>
       <p>
        Construction of the wall was begun in April 2007 by David in his West Burleigh studio and was completed in July 2008. The Kokoda memorial wall is 23 metres long and five metres tall at its highest point. The largest panel weighs approximately five tonnes. David is an extremely talented industrial artist, and the detail of his work is a moving tribute to the heroes of the Kokoda Track. Funding for the design of the memorial wall and the sculpting of the panels was raised through the Rotary Club of Broadwater Southport with the generous support, contributions and assistance of numerous sponsors and individual donations. I am proud to say that, through the commemorations program in 2007, the former coalition government granted $32,000 towards construction of the Rotary Kokoda Memorial Wall in Cascade Gardens, Broadbeach. I commend all those involved in the construction of this Kokoda memorial: David Yardley, Gold Coast City Council and the Rotary Club of Broadwater Southport.
