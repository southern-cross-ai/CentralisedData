       <p>
        I am pleased today to rise to talk about the important work that was done by Australians through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Commonwealth_Occupation_Force" rel="nofollow">
         British Commonwealth Occupation Force
        </a>
        between 1946 and 1952. I believe it is important to acknowledge the significant contribution made by the British Commonwealth Occupation Force and I would like to take this opportunity to recognise all Australian troops who served in that important force.
       </p>
       <p>
        Following the defeat of the Axis powers in World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
         II
        </a>
        , the Allied forces deployed troops to enforce the conditions of unconditional surrender which had brought an end to the devastating conflict. The British Commonwealth Occupation Force was charged with the task of overseeing the demilitarisation and disarmament of Japan. The British Commonwealth Occupation Force occupied five Japanese prefectures with a population of 19 million and was primarily concerned with overseeing the demobilisation of Japanese troops as well as the dismantling of Japanese war-making capacity, including by destroying military equipment or converting it to civilian use. Members of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force were also involved with supervising elections and establishing the foundations for democratic government in this nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the British Commonwealth Occupation Force consisted of 45,000 members from Britain, India, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        as well as Australia, Australia's participation was a significant contribution proportionally in comparison to the other countries. A total of around 16,000 Australians served under the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. The main deployment of Australians under the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BCOF" rel="nofollow">
         BCOF
        </a>
        landed in Japan on 21 February 1946, and this was the first time that Australia had participated in a military occupation of a sovereign nation which it had defeated in war. In fact, the British Commonwealth Occupation Force was commanded by an Australian officer, and for two-thirds of the occupation period it was only Australia who represented the force. It is not only the infantry soldiers who must be recognised for their contribution during this period of our history but also the 2,200 Australians from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">

        wing, the 130 Australians from the Australian General Hospital and Australians serving with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        in this region.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is clear that Australia played a significant role in the work of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force, and it is important that we remember the contribution of those Australians. I would like to thank a constituent of mine who brought this to my attention,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Clark" rel="nofollow">
         Ronald Clark
        </a>
        . He has been a big advocate for those who have served in this area and he has continued to represent these issues to the Australian government. There is also a collection of legacies and a whole range of activities which are there to serve our veterans. I wish to recognise
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ron_Clark" rel="nofollow">

        and thank him for bringing this to our attention. I also thank him and his comrades for the work they have done in this area.
