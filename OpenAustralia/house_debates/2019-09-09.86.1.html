        My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. After more than six years of this government, when growth is the slowest it's been in a decade, wages are stagnant, consumption is weak, household debt is at record highs and productivity has actually gone backwards over the last year, why does the Prime Minister spend all of his time talking about Labor and none of his time coming up with a plan to turn the economy around?

         One point four million jobs were created under the economic policies of this government, and 75 per cent of those are full-time jobs. A budget that is coming back into surplus this year and real wage growth occurring under this government: that's what's happening now. People are not only earning more; they're getting to keep more of what they earn, and we want them to earn more in the future. But you won't get higher wages with higher taxes. That's what the Labor Party never understands. They never understand that, if they want to tax people more, they will slow the economy, which will thieve them of their economic opportunities.

           He couldn't even get to 45 seconds before he started talking about Labor. The question's asking him: what's his plan? He's meant to be running an economy.

            I'm not quite sure what the point of order is—he didn't state one—but I'll just say that, of the seven or eight topics in the question, one of them was Labor, so he didn't put it there.

             Our plan is to bring the budget back into surplus this year. Our plan is to deliver tax relief to Australians. Our plan is to invest $100 billion in infrastructure, which includes just under $10 billion just this year, which is almost 50 per cent higher than the annual spend on infrastructure that occurred under the Labor Party. There will be more investment in infrastructure, more investment in skills and more investment in expanding our markets. The government have taken the share of trade covered by our export agreements from less than 30 per cent to 70 per cent, and we're going to take it to 90 per cent. The agricultural sector is growing. It'll be a $100 billion sector by 2030 under the plan that we're putting in place.
            </p>
            <p>
             So we have a plan, but what is happening on the side of the Labor Party—and I'm asked about the Labor Party? It's chaos, it's uncertainty and, in

             , there's the big stench of corruption. What are we seeing in New South Wales, the Leader of the Opposition's home division? I mentioned it on the weekend. When I said we have to recycle plastics, I didn't mean Aldi plastic bags stuffed full of cash. That was not my plan, but it is certainly the plan of the New South Wales Labor Party.
