        It is with sadness that I have to take the opportunity in the Parliament today to report the passing of an absolutely wonderful trailblazing woman. Toni Newman died on 29 March after a long battle with melanoma. She was a good friend, as was her partner, Dave Voltz. Many in this place will know Dave. I say she was a trailblazer because she was one of the country's first female apprentice electricians. In fact, Dave tells me that he first met her while playing pool at the

        </a>
        , and he was particularly attracted because she was wearing a bib and brace and steel-capped boots. She obviously will be very sadly missed by her partner, Dave – they had been together 28 years – her parents, Win and Claire, who still live in our local area at Lake Heights, her sisters, Lesley – and her partner, Greg – Karen and Michelle, and her beloved nieces and nephews.
       </p>

        She was very grateful for the care and expertise of Dr Carlino and the staff at

        . Toni loved Granville, where she made her home with Dave. She loved the Rabbitohs, she was a whiz of a quilter and she particularly felt that those she worked with at Clipsal-Schneider were good friends who provided great support to her during her illness from her workplace. She will be sadly missed by all of us, a real trailblazing woman.
