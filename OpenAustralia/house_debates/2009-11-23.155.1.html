        On Wednesday, 4 November I attended the concept to creation showcase of science based projects designed and created by schoolchildren from schools in the north-eastern and northern regions of Adelaide. Students from 16 schools participated in the concept to creation showcase, which was organised by the Northern Advanced Manufacturing Industry Group, otherwise known as NAMIG. The following five schools from my electorate of Makin participated in the concept to creation showcase:

        , where I will be opening a

        project next week on behalf of the Deputy Prime Minister;

        </a>
        ; and Valley View Secondary School.
       </p>
       <p>
        NAMIG commenced operations in 2005 with the purpose of, firstly, creating awareness of advanced manufacturing and advanced technology industries; secondly, promoting the relevance of mathematics, science and technology studies; and, thirdly, developing underpinning employability and enterprise skills through project based approaches to learning for students. These outcomes have been actively pursued through authentic and effective partnerships with local industries, local governments and tertiary education providers. The defence industries are to be particularly applauded for their significant contribution to the establishment and performance of these programs.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate all 16 schools that encouraged and supported students to participate in the showcase. I particularly congratulate the students for their innovation and creativity of their projects. I also acknowledge the work of NAMIGâ€™S General Manager, Bernie Fitzsimons, and the many local industries that support the concept to creation project. It is a wonderful example of how the education sector across the northern and north-eastern parts of Adelaide are working collaboratively to create career opportunities for young people.
