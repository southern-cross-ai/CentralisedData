       <p>
        I rise to speak about a new initiative that is doing great things for people in and around the Scullin electorate. This initiative is building stronger communities through leadership and through partnerships. Last week I was honoured to be asked to say a few words at the inaugural annual general meeting of the community leadership network Victoria Inc.—better known as the Whittlesea Community Leadership Network—along with Councillor Kris Pavlidis from the city of Whittlesea. In my speech then, I reflected on how much had been achieved by this group in a very short time. Today, 2 December, marks the first anniversary of the network's incorporation, so I say to it happy birthday, and I take this opportunity to discuss in this place the important work of the network.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Whittlesea Community Leadership Network grew out of a series of initiatives on the part of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Whittlesea" rel="nofollow">
         City of Whittlesea
        </a>
        , which had identified the need for such a network through an exhaustive process of pilot projects. The membership of the network is largely composed of a wide range of not-for-profit groups. From our very active
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/U3A" rel="nofollow">
         U3A
        </a>
        to the Congolese community of Victoria, a wide range of community groups, which participate actively, is represented along with very many individual members from right across the Whittlesea community. It is pleasing to see the active engagement in this network of newly arrived communities. I was particularly pleased to extend some words of welcome at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM" rel="nofollow">
         AGM
        </a>
        to a number of recently arrived migrants from Iran who have successfully sought asylum and who are forging their path in Melbourne's northern suburbs through the extraordinary networking opportunities provided by the Whittlesea Community Leadership Network.
       </p>
       <p>
        In its very short life, the Whittlesea Community Leadership Network has already conducted a range of community training sessions which have engaged 238 members of the community. These people have attended seminars on subjects such as the law and health care, so that community members can guide themselves and others through the often complicated maze of the legal and health care systems, as well as—critically, in bushfire prone communities—emergency preparation and readiness for culturally and linguistically diverse communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The network has developed a strategic plan to carry this nascent organisation into the future around three core principles—connect, coach and construct—to build leadership and relationships across communities. It is very clear to me that effective partnerships have already been formed and that social cohesion across Melbourne's north has been enhanced. New leaders are emerging and making wider contributions. This is down not to the work of a small group but to the work of many people. I acknowledge the tireless work of many at the City of Whittlesea, in particular Maria Callipari and Salvador Nunez, and I extend my thanks to the chair of the network, Chantal Kabamba, the vice-chair, Pece Georgieski, and the chair of the advisory committee, Glen Wall. I look forward to supporting them in their important work and in their following through on the motto of the organisation: 'building capacity through partnership'.
