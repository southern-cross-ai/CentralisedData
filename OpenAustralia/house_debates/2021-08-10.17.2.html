        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPCC" rel="nofollow">
         IPCC
        </a>
        report released overnight leaves no room for any doubt. We are in a race to save the planet. If nothing changes, global warming could hit 1½ degrees by 2030. This is real, and it's a race. Yet the Morrison government will not even commit to net zero emissions by 2050. For the better part of a decade this Liberal government has been wandering slowly across the track, watching the race instead of trying to win it. As IPCC report co-author and climate scientist at the University of Melbourne Malte Meinshausen has said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … everybody in the international community would laugh if they would hear that Australia thinks they're doing enough. Of course they're not doing enough.
       </p>
       <p>
        Except it's not just the international community, and we're not laughing, we're crying. When did the Liberal Party decide it was okay for Australia to finish last, whether it be on vaccinations or on emissions? When did the Morrison Liberals decide that incentives don't matter, that institutions don't matter, that the views of the business community and global investors and scientists and everyday Australians just don't matter? The Prime Minister can engage in all the spin, all the defiant twisting of data, all the bullish pretence that he is leading a government that is acting as he wants, but my community can see right through it. They know that the challenges and the renewable energy opportunities of the race to save our planet are real and they know I'll always be right there with them, pushing our country to start running again.
