       <p>
        I rise to continue my comments on the motion moved in the House by the member for Ryan on Monday. Extremist Islamic groups like

        —

        —would have their popularity propped up through a supposed victory if troops leave Iraq before the job is finished. I remind this chamber of the 92 Australians and the 245 other people who died as a result of the JI terrorist attacks in other parts of the world. These were in Bali in 2002 and 2005, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriott_Hotel" rel="nofollow">

        attack in Jakarta in 2003 and at the Australian Embassy in Jakarta in 2004.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to highlight to the chamber the incredible job that our Australian troops are doing in Iraq. The fact that troops have been able to withdraw from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Muthanna" rel="nofollow">
         Al Muthanna
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhi_Qar" rel="nofollow">
         Dhi Qar
        </a>
        provinces is a positive sign. Now troops are supporting the Iraqi security forces in these two provinces. They are also assisting in preparing and training the Iraqi army to be able to operate independently in the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was privileged to visit Iraq about 12 months ago as part of my role as Chair of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I saw these young Australian men and women in action. They are very proud to be part of the rebuilding of Iraq. I have nothing but admiration for the men and women of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        . They are doing an absolutely outstanding job.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is crucial that the Australian Defence Force remain in Iraq to assist in the creation of a democratic and free society—a society in which its people adhere to the rule of law, are tolerant of other people’s beliefs and can live safely without fear for their lives. Extreme Islamic groups reject this concept of a society and have used and will use indiscriminate violence in the future, unless we continue to remain in Iraq and help Iraq to determine its own future. Not only will keeping Australians troops in Iraq until the job is completed benefit the people of Iraq; it will benefit the wider community by not allowing extreme terrorist organisations to grow and cause more bloodshed and heartache to many innocent families across the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        I conclude by saying that the tragic news of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hawk" rel="nofollow">
         Black Hawk
        </a>
        accident off Fiji overnight reminds us all of the dangers that our men and women of the ADF face as they operate and train on a daily basis. I hope, as the search goes on for the missing soldier, that it is successful. I extend my sympathies to all those who have suffered as a result of the accident overnight.
