Several Berowra constituents were recently inducted into the order, and today I would like to take the opportunity to recognise their service and offer my congratulations.

        Graham Ross of Beecroft was appointed Member of the Order of Australia for significant service to the broadcast media, and particularly to horticulture and the community. Graham has been a fixture on Australian radio and television for four decades. He's been a presenter on television shows, including

He's also a major identity in the Beecroft community, always finding ways to contribute, not just nationally but locally as well. Today I acknowledge the immense contribution Graham has made to horticulture.

           of Australia is a truly great honour for Australians who are committed to serving their communities, but I'm quick to point out that there are many Australians who have not yet been awarded the Order of Australia who are incredibly committed to our community. I encourage those Australians out there, when you know a good Aussie that is doing a brilliant thing for our community, for our country, to nominate them. The

           , which, of course, is important work as we reflect today upon the efforts that are still required to close the gap. During his tenure as chief justice he was outspoken on such issues as alcohol abuse, high imprisonment rates and cuts to legal aid. He's made a colossal contribution, and Territorians are very thankful.

           His colleague Professor Amanda Jane Leach has now been awarded an AM. She is doing fantastic work in fighting an ear infection which causes long-term hearing loss in First Nation's kids. When you consider that hearing loss in children often leads to less-than-great outcomes at school—dropping out of school et cetera—then this work that Professor Leach is doing is so important.

          <p>
           Long-time and recently retired Katherine mayor, Fay Miller, has done tremendous work for her community. A member of the other side of politics, Fay has been a tireless advocate for Katherine for more than 30 years, including as deputy opposition leader in the NT legislative assembly. She has faced down huge obstacles, such as breaking her neck and rebuilding her home twice after the flooding that went through Katherine over the years. So I send a heartfelt and very apolitical thank you to Fay.

            I would like to thank my colleague, the member for Berowra, for putting forward this motion to recognise the men and women who were awarded an Order of Australia honour on

            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV" rel="nofollow">
             MV
            </a>
            -22 Osprey—a military aircraft. In what was a demanding and hazardous dive, the efforts of Leading Seaman Palu in overcoming a challenging environment and malfunctioning equipment guaranteed the return of the body of a marine to the grieving family. He said, 'We had a job and we got it done.' But this was no ordinary job.
           </p>
           <p>
            The Royal Australian Navy notes that no Australian clearance diver has recovered human remains from a ditched aircraft at that depth in recent history. Leading Seaman Palu was awarded a

             Conspicuous Service Medal
            </a>
            , citing his meritorious devotion to duty. Leading Seaman Palu's devotion to duty is unquestionable, as is his courage, determination and dedication. This truly was bravery at its best and I congratulate Leading Seaman Palu on his recognition.

            Also receiving recognition on Australia Day this year was Mr Shaun Danby,

            as a vocational instructor back in 1996. Since 2017 he has been the Corrective Services Industries Operations Manager, leading a team on construction, emergency and urgent building and maintenance works. Shaun develops inmates through managing, coaching, instructing and encouraging the members of his team to help improve their skills and experience, helping them to get a job after their release and to become productive members of the community. Shaun's citation notes that he is, 'a selfless and committed leader and his dedication is exemplary'. Typical of the humble fashion in which he goes about his work, Shaun attributed his success to his team but it is appropriate that he has been recognised with the Australian Corrections Medal.

            Warrant Officer Christopher William Rohweder, CSM, of Glenmore Park was awarded a Conspicuous Service Medal. He was recognised for his meritorious achievement in the training and development of the Australian Defence Force Explosive Ordnance Disposal Remediation Program. He is known for being an outstanding professional who displays exceptional dedication to duty. His development of innovative assessment and instructional tools, subject matter expertise and professional work ethic were crucial to achieving a successful trial of the new course that has delivered improved training outcomes and a number of resource efficiencies that have advanced defence capability.

They truly are outstanding citizens. I am particularly pleased of the work that is being done to encourage younger people in our community to serve as well. I congratulate all of them on their Australia Day honours and look forward to their ongoing contributions to our community of Lindsay.

             I want to begin my congratulating Greenvale resident Michael Panormitis Pakakis AM,

            <p>
             Michael is a child of the post

             nation-building migration program. His parents migrated to Australia from the island of Rhodes in Greece when he was 13 months old. In fact, Michael and I may have come to Australia in the same year. Certainly our families came here for similar reasons: a better future for their children.
            </p>
            <p>
             As an only child Michael spent many hours watching science fiction
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV" rel="nofollow">
              TV
             </a>
             series and reading. Both parents were at work, his mother a seamstress and his father a tool maker. This is a very familiar migrant story. Michael had an interest in science and recalls that on the day the Americans landed on the moon, 20 July 1969—who could forget that—he told his dad that he wanted to do something related to science. He loved acquiring knowledge but he also wanted to impart this knowledge so he became a teacher. Michael has been teaching since 1985. Reflecting on his service and contribution, Michael says:
            </p>
            <p class="italic">
             During my first years in teaching, I taught disadvantaged kids from migrant and refugee backgrounds, often with poor English and learning difficulties. I used to tell them that I am a migrant too and they can achieve anything they dream of, if they put some effort in. I wanted to be a role model for them.
            </p>
            <p>
             Michael's motto is one that NASA instils in its astronauts: 'Failure is not an option. Perseverance is the only option.'

             </a>
             for services to refugee welfare for the African community of Victoria. Samia came to Australia as an Eritrean refugee 30 years ago. She too shares the enduring story of refugee settlement in Australia. From an early age she had to overcome challenges by being resourceful and visionary. She spoke seven languages and quickly learned English, and she went on to obtain a social work degree, a master's degree and a postgraduate diploma in women's health at the University of Melbourne as well as a certificate in cultural practice, law and health at
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Trobe_University" rel="nofollow">
              La Trobe University
             </a>
             . Samia became the founding member of the Centre for African Australian Women's Issues. Her experience of being a refugee has pretty much shaped her advocacy work and drives her determination to help those refugees who come here. She has led on issues related to racism and sexism, working to ensure that there are appropriate and equitable services available for African women.
            </p>
            <p>
             In the past five years Samia has worked on projects associated with sexual and reproductive health improvement for Sahel African women and is the statewide coordinator for the Productive Rights Education Program. She conducts important work in addressing perceptions about African women and family violence. Samia is very passionate about helping people find a job, especially women. As she says, 'If you get employment, your life will change in a lot of aspects.' Samia has set up a specialised centre in Melbourne's west, whose main goal is to help people into employment. She connects with a wide network of other services and people who are sympathetic to her cause and who work together to make it happen. Samia is a great woman, and I want to congratulate her especially.

               I'd like to thank the member for Berowra for bringing this motion forward today. It is certainly a true privilege to receive an Order of Australia award. These awards recognise local people who have demonstrated outstanding service or an exceptional achievement during the year. Often they are the quiet achievers of our community who are doing their bit every day to help our community and to give back, never wanting or expecting anything from it. This year we have seen even more why these people are so special. I am always delighted to have an opportunity to celebrate people like this in our community on the

Recently I had the privilege of recognising 12 local heroes in my electorate who received an Order of Australia for their distinguished service to our community and the nation more broadly. I was delighted to recognise 11 constituents in the Ryan electorate who recently joined the general division of the Order of Australia and one who joined the military division of the Order of Australia.

                I am very privileged to commend such worthy individuals from the Ryan electorate to the House today. It is people like Sue, Bronwyn, Kirsty, Thomas and John, who sacrifice an enormous amount of time and energy, that make Australia and the Ryan electorate such a fantastic place to live. It is their contribution to the local community and recognising it that will inspire others to step up and lead by example, just as they have done. It is so important to recognise our local heroes, whether it be through the OAM process or just in general.

Although a vaccine hasn't come out of their work, they worked tirelessly day in, day out, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, particularly through the Christmas period, to produce their very best work on behalf of Australians. I thank all of those involved in the University of Queensland research and all of those from the Ryan electorate who received honours in the
