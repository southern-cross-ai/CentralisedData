       <p>
        This weekend we secured an agreement to pass the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 2022. It's the first time in a decade that this place has done something meaningful to lift the wages of hardworking Australians, the first time in a decade that this place has done anything to close the gender pay gap and the first time in a decade that this place has tried to make work more secure for casual employees. These are great labour reforms. And, of course, there are some who cannot bring themselves to support them.

        The Leader of the Opposition has made it clear that he isn't on the side of working people. He's on another sideâ€”and it's not that surprising, given he's been doing some fancy travelling with a mate recently!

        has been the Leader of the Opposition's personal chaperone. On no less than four occasions, the Leader of the Opposition has been jetsetting with Ms Rinehart in her personal aeroplane, including for an exclusive dinner with former attorney-general

        . Apparently, flying around with Gina and dining with the bloke who hid a million-dollar legal bill from unknown donors are priorities for the Leader of the Opposition, but standing with Australian workers is not. It's clear where this bloke flies, and it's not with the hardworking Australians who deserve a pay increase. But we, on this side of the House, are going to deliver it.
