        Like people across the country, I watched in awe and pride as Australian Olympians competed on the world stage in Paris. The games were a thrilling showcase of talent, hard work and perseverance, and every athlete should be commended for the years of dedication and training it took to get there, and their families should also be commended for their support. I want to pay particular tribute to those Olympians from Wentworth, including Bronte Campbell, a member of North Bondi Surf Life Saving Club, is only the fifth Australian ever to swim in four Olympics and, even better, she was a member of the women's four x 100 metre free different relay team who won gold. Noah Havid, also a member of North Bondi Surf Life Saving Club, was an integral part of the men's kayak four who won silver. Grae Morris, a member of the Woollahra Sailing Club, won silver in the men's windsurfing, becoming the first Australian since 1992 to win an Olympic windsurfing medal.
