        On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on

         National Capital

        and External Territories, I present the committee's report entitled,

        .

       <p>
        Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).
       </p>
       <p>
        by leave—Norfolk Island has historically been part of this nation since the establishment of a settlement shortly after the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Fleet" rel="nofollow">
         First Fleet
        </a>
        landed in Sydney in 1788. Since becoming part of this country the political and governance arrangements have changed throughout its history. This can be seen in the different iterations in the nature of successive settlements. Despite these continuous changes, what has never changed is the beauty and the unique nature of the environment. In these ways Norfolk Island will always be a different world and those that visit the island will know what I mean.
       </p>
       <p>
        In March 2014, the Assistant Minister for Infrastructure and Regional Development, the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamie_Briggs" rel="nofollow">
         Jamie Briggs
        </a>
        , referred an inquiry into the prospects for economic development on Norfolk Island. The reference followed an audit report into Norfolk Island's finances which found, unequivocally, that the Norfolk Island administration is failing. That failure comes at a cost to many residents of the island.
       </p>
       <p>
        There has been a sharp downturn in tourism and employment in recent years and a declining population as residents seek work off-island. Progress on the Norfolk Island Roadmap—a process for reform—has been too little, too late. Yet change is necessary. Norfolk Island would now be bankrupt if it were not for the Commonwealth's ongoing financial support. The condition of infrastructure is close to critical failure. Service delivery is not commensurate with Australian standards. The Norfolk Island government is failing to deliver on a range of responsibilities which are beyond its budget and management capability. It is the island's 1,600 residents that suffer the consequences.
       </p>
       <p>
        The key message to emerge from the inquiry is that there is an urgent need for reform to achieve improved economic stability. This was voiced by all Norfolk Islanders, irrespective of their position on self-governance. The committee has made eight recommendations addressing    the need for new governance arrangements, infrastructure investment and the framing of new economic opportunities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first recommendation is to end self-government by repealing the Norfolk Island Act 1979. An interim administration should assist with transition to a local government type body. The committee recognises that the Norfolk Island community will need to be on board throughout the transition process. To support this, we recommend mechanisms for community consultation to facilitate the reform process.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee recommends that the Commonwealth government assume responsibility for the overdue Cascade and Kingston Pier upgrades.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">

        should also assume responsibility for the purchase of multipurpose barges. The barges will increase passenger offload capacity from cruise ships and will facilitate safety matters. The barges will also allow for containerisation and introduce modern freight-handling practices. Improving the island's public road infrastructure is another critical need.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee recommends that officers be placed in the transitional administration to strengthen Norfolk Island's economic and human resources capacity.

        and Austrade can offer advice and support to improve the existing tourist product, and to develop new products and services. More can be made, for example, of the

        2014, when the committee visited Norfolk Island, we were impressed by the quality of locally produced goods, including fresh produce and artefacts. The committee recommends a dedicated officer to help local businesses with product branding and to set up a cooperative and visible shopfront.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst on the island I found that the vast majority of people supported the end of self-government, but there is no doubt that some will resist the call to abolish self-governance. However, I am disturbed by reports that some supporters of self-government are now attempting to intimidate those that support change. There are those who will claim that ending self-governance will put Norfolk Island's unique history and culture at risk. I would argue the opposite is true. Working towards greater economic viability and sustainability is the surest way to keep Norfolk Island alive and vibrant for years to come.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee acknowledges those that made written submissions and gave evidence at hearings on Norfolk Island and in Canberra. I thank my committee colleagues for their strong bipartisan support. I also thank the secretariat for their outstanding organisational ability and excellent efforts through this inquiry. I conclude with the words of one young Norfolk Islander who told the committee:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Norfolk Islanders have the drive and passion to make the island succeed. The time has come for change.
