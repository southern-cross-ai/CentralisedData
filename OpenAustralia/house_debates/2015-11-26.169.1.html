       <p>
        This week we have all remembered and recognised White Ribbon Day. It is the day Australia stood up, with one voice, to stop violence against women of all forms and violence in general.
       </p>
       <p>
        Currently, two women are killed by a current or former partner every week and 78 women have died as a result of domestic and sexual violence this year alone. The Prime Minister reflected:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        All disrespect of women does not end up with violence against women, but let's be clear, all violence against women begins with disrespecting women.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this week I would also like to speak about violence in all forms and the abhorrent violence that happens in many families as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        This week my electorate of Lindsay was sickened and horrified by a tragic event that happened to a very young boy in Penrith. On Tuesday the young boy, a 10-month-old baby, sustained horrific injuries, including third-degree burns to almost 50 per cent of his body, as a result of being deliberately left under hot water in the shower allegedly by his mother's partner. The child had also suffered bruising to his skull and to his jaw.
       </p>
       <p>
        After posting a message on my own Facebook wall, being quite saddened by that, I have so far received 194 likes from people who are equally upset and many, many comments. To really show how widely all communities have spoken in outpourings this week about domestic violence against women and violence in our families, I would like to share some of their reflections. 'He should get life for what he did,' said Debbie Hayes. 'That poor child will suffer each and every day for the rest of his life from the effects caused from such horrific burns. I can't get that out of my head. I pray to God that just once the law gets it right,' Melanie Lauren. 'I am heartbroken. Who could do such a horrible act towards an innocent baby?' Jennifer Mckinlay. 'No. No. No,' from Pamela Mealey. Jo Dymock wrote, 'This story made me sick to hearing what this bloke done. If he found guilty he should get life in jail and he should be never allowed near children again.' The messages just go on and on and on.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a nation, we must protect those who are vulnerable in our society. We must do better. We can do better. I will close my statement today by informing the House that I stand before you and before my community in solidarity, condemning this horrendous act of barbarity to such an innocent baby. I will be doing more with my community to eradicate this surge of family and domestic violence. I have been talking with the Mayor of Penrith and also with wonderful activists like Michele Ellery from the Queen of Hearts Community Foundation about what we can do together as a community, because I know my community in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">

        does not want to see any form of family violence against women, against children or against anyone, and I am proud to represent a community that is committed to seeing this end.
