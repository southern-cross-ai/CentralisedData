       <p>
        I am proud to report to the House that the Knox Headspace Centre was officially opened this week. The opening of this centre has been the culmination of a two-year campaign which I have spearheaded, along with community members in my electorate. The Headspace Foundation runs these headspace centres. They are terrific centres that cater for youth with depression and anxiety and other issues faced by 12- to 25-year-olds. These centres are so important because, unfortunately and sadly, youth depression and anxiety, and in some cases suicide, is so prevalent in our community and right across Australia. Indeed, it constitutes more than 50 per cent of the burden of disease for 12- to 24-year-olds. It is particularly high in my electorate—no-one understands why, but the stats speak for themselves.
       </p>
       <p>
        The services that are going to be provided at the Knox headspace centre—which is located at Knox Ozone, right where the young people of my electorate tend to hang out—include general practitioners, counselling services, drug and alcohol rehab assistance, an eating disorder clinic and employment services. It has been a real community effort to get this centre up and running. I am very proud to have been associated with it and to spearhead it. I would particularly like to thank the chief petitioners, Pauline Renzow and Prerna Diksha, for their tireless effort.
