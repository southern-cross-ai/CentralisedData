         I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. The member for Leichhardt knows that delivering infrastructure in his electorate is essential for the future prosperity of the north.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was very pleased to join the member for Leichhardt in May, with the Prime Minister, when he announced $24 million for the infrastructure upgrade of the Cairns Marine Precinct. He understands that now is the time to get on with the job of delivering for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Northern Australia
         </a>
         . This government has a strong economic plan, and has a strong economic plan for rural and regional communities, particularly Northern Australia. We understand that Northern Australia already makes an enormous contribution to the wealth of our nation, but with the right infrastructure that contribution will only grow into the future.
        </p>
        <p>
         The member asked me about roads. We understand that roads are the arteries of life in community areas. They are the arteries for commerce and for social interaction. We also understand the need to improve connectivity between our rural communities, our remote communities and our regional communities. The Northern Australia Roads Program, which the Turnbull-Joyce government has committed $600 million for, will deliver roads across northern Australia. This funding will improve safety and transport reliability in northern Australia and support economic growth in our North. Members on this side of the House understand the importance of investing in northern Australia and the potential that we can unlock in this region: the member for Capricornia, the member for Dawson, the member for Flynn and the member for Durack—all tireless advocates for road upgrades in their electorates.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is good news for northern Australia. I know those opposite do not like to hear all this good news. They would rather whinge and complain. They would rather talk Australia down.

           They have such a negative view of Australia. They are the wreckers. On this side of the House we are the builders. On this side of the House we are building for the future. The contrast is very clear: we are building for the future and they are complaining about it. We have a $50 billion Infrastructure Investment Program. We are out there. We are building roads. We are building rail. We are building airports. They are building a complaints box. That is all they are building.

           In more good news, there is $100 million for the

              Cape York
             </a>
             Region Package, with $208 million, an investment by the Turnbull-Joyce government in the cape. Importantly, the Cape York region project has actually employed around 20 Indigenous trainees in 2015.
            </p>
            <p>
             So I thank the member for Leichhardt. I thank him for being such a strong advocate on behalf of northern Australia. He has supported local businesses in his community, and I know he will continue to do so. So I thank the member for Leichhardt for his question. The government does have a strong economic plan. We do have a strong plan for investing in infrastructure and for building for the future, and we commend the northern Australia package, the northern Australian investment and development which is occurring under the Turnbull-Joyce government.
