        Today marks day 14 of industrial action by United Workers Union members at

        , in the electorate of Chifley. General Mills is one of the largest food-manufacturing companies in the world, boasting brands such as

        and Latina Fresh. What they also boasted last year was a record $2 billion profit—profit built off the back of their workforce, including their 150 workers at the Rooty Hill factory. And these workers had our backs during the pandemic. When the shops were struggling to keep up with demand, these workers went to work—when many of us were working from home—to help meet this demand. It's only right that General Mills have their backs now. The workers' wages have stagnated. All they want is a pay packet that keeps up with the cost of living, to help support their own families. They also want to protect hard-earned redundancy conditions and ensure secure jobs for all workers.

        I've visited the picket line multiple times to show my support for them, and I know last week they greatly appreciated the support of Labor's shadow industrial relations minister,

        . It was terrific to have him out there visiting those workers.

       <p>
        Australians deserve a pay rise. Workers are tired of being at the bottom of the list of people rewarded for effort. Enough is enough. We are proud to stand with these workers at Rooty Hill, who expect their employers and their government to have their backs. They deserve better.
