        I rise to speak about so many tragedies when it comes to drownings, especially in the multicultural community. On

        In the past year there have been several devastating drownings in our region.

        As the shadow minister for multicultural affairs, I find the multicultural community very much over-represent the drowning figures. When you get to the root cause, quite often people are coming from countries such as India where access to swimming is difficult. Councils play a major role in Australia when it comes to swimming; they provide learn-to-swim schools, which is fantastic. The fees for someone to learn to swim at the moment are, for 10 lessons, between $200 and $250.
       </p>
       <p>
        My concern is this: when the councils manage the pools and operate the learn-to-swim centres, there is a conflict of interest when it comes to maintaining the safety of those swimming compared to the financial interests of the learn-to-swim schools. What I've personally witnessed is a father with their son or daughter being targeted and asked: 'Are you giving professional lessons to your children? Are you a coach?' It can be a family friend who, quite often, in the past has been a squad swimmer and is a very able swimmer, but they get targeted. In actual fact, a number of councils have a code of conduct where it says that that person can be evicted for giving so-called coaching lessons.
       </p>
       <p>
        As far as I'm concerned, I don't care if the person gives lessons to a child if that child is an able swimmer. It's crazy to have lifeguards at swimming pools being encouraged to go up to people and ask: 'Is that your child? Is that your friend's child? Are you a professional coach?' The councils have one responsibility: to make sure that they help kids learn to swim in a fun and safe environment, not to target those who can teach their kids.
