       <p>
        I want to talk to the people of Petrie about the good news in the economy. The government has a plan for jobs and growth. We've seen that there's been a million jobs created in the last five years, and the benefits of that are increasing income taxes and increasing company taxes because of our crackdown on multinationals. That all helps people when we invest more heavily in roads and infrastructure and when we increase funding for health, hospitals, the environment, mental health and

        </a>
        . All of these things are possible because of a strong economy, and the government is heavily focused on that.
       </p>
       <p>
        In stark contrast, we have those opposite, the members of the Labor Party and the opposition leader, and all they want to do is increase taxes by $200 billion over the next 10 years. That's another $20 billion in taxes that the Australian people are going to have to wear. Everyone in the gallery, everyone listening in their car on the radio, everyone in the electorate of Petrieâ€”they're going to be hit with $20 billion worth of new taxes from

        , the member opposite. And it's just unbelievable. It's a disgrace. They've got no plan for a stronger economy and no plan to create one new job. To everyone in my electorate who relies on health funding, who relies on a stronger pension, who relies on welfare: that is only able to be there because of our stronger plan for the economy. The Labor Party is only going to rack up more debt for future generations. Shame on Labor.
