         AGM
        </a>
        s are not always a source of celebration but the AGM of the Friends of The Australiana Pioneer Village was just that, because, for many of us, it was the first time we could attend an AGM in a COVID-safe environment for a very long time. The rules were clearâ€”carry your own chair, names taken, and none of the usual hand shaking and hugs to those wrapping up or taking up a position. The friends reopened the village in early July. This is not just a volunteer organisation; this is a volunteer-run tourist destination at Wilberforce in the Hawkesbury. They estimate they lost around $50,000 in revenue during the nearly four-month closure. Smoke from the bushfires also wreaked havoc with their summer openings. But even if you're not open, animals still need to be tended and the upkeep of historic buildings transplanted there still have to happen. The pioneer village relies on revenue from various sources but also donations. I was pleased to see that CAWB donated money they had left over from their fight to save history in Windsor, a worthwhile $3,000 donation.

        At a recent visit to see the work of the Hawkesbury Men's Shed on the site of the pioneer village, I was able to see the wheelchair-friendly tables I purchased with the $5,000 grant I secured for the group. I do hope Men's Shed will able to fulfil their ambitious plans in a way that benefits both important groups who each do so much to connect our community.
