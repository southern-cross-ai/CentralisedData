        In the gallery this afternoon is Louise Yaxley, who has been the ABC parliamentary bureau chief for a very long time. She has spent 28 years covering politics in this House and tomorrow she will end what has been an absolutely sensational career. Louise Yaxley is always professional, she is courteous and she is knowledgeable, and she has added to the quality of political discourse in this country through her work in the

She brings to the profession of journalism honour, respect and integrity. I pay tribute to her on her final day, which happens to be as well the 90th anniversary of the ABC, our national broadcaster, which will be celebrated tomorrow at the ABC headquarters in Ultimo. Well done, Louise.

         I join with the Prime Minister on behalf of the coalition to wish Louise all at the very best in the next phase of her life. She has been here for almost three decades, covered 10 federal elections, has provided leadership at the bureau and seen incredible changes, particularly in the technology space and the way in which the message is communicated. I think it is fair to say that this side of politics has not always agreed with the ABC but from Louise we have always got a fair hearing. I want to thank you for the professionalism and for your approach to dealing with our press secs and the queries that we have had. The engagement has been professional and it has been a credit to you and to your leadership skills.
        </p>

         Of course, despite all of the investigative resources at the ABC, none of the journalists up there, including those who sit with her in the gallery today, have been able to uncover the truth as to the origin of 'Penguin', her nickname. It remains a mystery to the day of her retirement, so perhaps there is an opportunity to write a story, or perhaps in her book there will be some mention of how she came about to achieve that nickname. But from all of us in this place, we wish you every good health and success into the next phase of your life.
