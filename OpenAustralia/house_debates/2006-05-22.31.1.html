       <p>
        I wish to speak on behalf of the great Australian car industry. Like other members, today I received a letter from Dennis Mooney, Chairman and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managing_Director" rel="nofollow">
         Managing Director
        </a>
        of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_Holden" rel="nofollow">
         General Motors Holden
        </a>
        , about the company’s plans to turn around its fortunes in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_America" rel="nofollow">
         North America
        </a>
        . We wish it well. General Motors Holden and Toyota have extensive operations in my electorate. The great Australian car industry is one of the successes of the previous Labor government; its industry plan enabled the survival of an industry that now generates massive exports. Automobiles are one of the few manufactured goods that we export large amounts of, particularly to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
         Middle East
        </a>
        . Toyota, in particular, is extremely successful with its export of cars like the Camry, with its highly reliable suspension and airconditioning, to that part of the world—and long may it continue.
       </p>
       <p>
        One thing that concerns me and people in the industry is that, in our ever cosier relationship with China and with the free trade agreement that this government is planning with that country, some people in the government, including certain Liberal members for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        electorates, would like to see the end of the Australian car industry. They would like to see cheap Chinese cars being imported as a substitute for cars manufactured in Australia, a prospect which all members of this parliament should be opposed to.
       </p>
       <p>
        Automobiles are one of the manufactured goods that Australia successfully exports to the rest of the world, and we should be doing everything that we can to support great local firms like General Motors Holden and Toyota; we should not be undermining them. The car plants, workers and management of Fishermen’s Bend and Toyota ought to be supported and not undermined by the Liberals.
