        The Queensland Childcare Services has set a new standard of inclusive play environments following the official opening of the newly refurbished outdoor play area at the Hyperdome Early Education Centre in my electorate of Forde. The inclusive playground is designed by pioneering play experts Wearthy and is a local first in design. The playground features a connecting ramp, which the surrounding architecture is linked to, allowing children of all physical abilities to play together. Unlike other inclusive playgrounds in the region, the key feature of this playground is it's a natural environment. It's not made of rubber and soft floor materials. It provides all of the fun of natural boulders, direct pulley systems, a tree house and water play, therefore creating authentic childhood adventure for all abilities.

        It's estimated that more than 260,000 Queenslanders have a profound or severe disability. Just 3.4 per cent of the Queensland population under the age of five has a disability, and this rises to 10.4 per cent of children aged five to 15 years. Wearthy founder, playground designer and outdoor educator, Lukas Ritson, believes that every child, no matter their capabilities, has the right to a limitless childhood through play. Their design is built to nurture the developmental needs of children, to ignite creativity, curiosity and connectedness no matter their abilities. The outdoor play relieves anxiety and creates wellbeing in the children, and Wearthy are advocating the right to a healthy, thriving childhood, because play has the power to change the world.

        The Hyperdome Early Education Centre is proud to offer this in addition to their talented team of educators and resources to nurture the next generation of our community. The early childhood learning experience truly provides our children with the building blocks they need to shape who they are. The addition of this inclusive playground to the centre only builds on the range of activities they offer to help develop children's skills across all areas, activities such as bush kindy, swimming lessons and engaging programs such as music, yoga, fitness and drama. Parents also have the ability to order nourishing meals through QCCS's own catering company, the Healthy Cooking Company, and each one is dietitian and nutritionist designed and tailored for dietary needs. This allows the children to fuel their bodies with the essentials they need to support their play and development.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to take this opportunity to commend the ongoing efforts of the staff and the team at the Hyperdome Early Education Centre and QCCS for the clear passion they show towards teaching our youth and children of today.
