        My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, does big business deserve a $50 billion handout? Do millionaires deserve a $16,000 tax cut? And how on earth, when wages growth is at record lows, does the Prime Minister believe nearly 700,000 Australians deserve a pay cut?

            Did they deserve to be told that? We think they did but they did not and we are going to have to change the law to make sure they are. The honourable member likes to talk about how proud he is, as does the member for Isaacs, about the Leader of the Opposition's leadership of the

He has all the opportunities of the House to tell us what that $300,000 was really for. Was it forum tickets, conference sponsorships or training?

                 The member for Gorton will resume his seat. The member for Gorton certainly did ask that, but he asked other things as well, including what big business deserved or did not deserve. I am listening very carefully to the Prime Minister.

                 The member for Lingiari will leave under standing order 94(a). The member for Chifley is warned! If the member for Lingiari does not move immediately, I will take further action.

                  Do Australian workers deserve to be represented by unions that tell them the truth? We say they do. Those opposite say they do not. Just like they opposed childcare reforms and just like they are opposing one million families being better off, they are opposing workers being told the truth. Oh, yes. All of this hypocrisy, this covering up of one secret payment after another and one worker after another being sold down the river by money paid to unions—we are going to shine the light on that. We are going to ban those secret payments. You can vote against it if you wish.
