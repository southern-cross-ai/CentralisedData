        Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, I am concerned about the workload you have undertaken in this session. It has been a colossal effort and I take the opportunity to acknowledge the work you do in the House. More importantly, I rise today to sing the praises of those wonderful unsung heroes in my electorate and people throughout Queensland and Australia who volunteer their time. Last year we had the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Year" rel="nofollow">
         International Year
        </a>
        of the Volunteer, a wonderful accolade and acknowledgement of the work that volunteers do right across the nation. This year, ironically, we have the year of the farmer, and in my electorate I am sure that most of my farmers believe they are working for about the same remuneration package that the volunteers work for. Nevertheless, in my communities there are a number of motivated organisations and I would like to take the opportunity to share with the parliament some of the wonderful work that happens.
       </p>
       <p>
        Firstly, I would like to congratulate the Fassifern Valley Rotary Club, which had a meeting the other night. Their outgoing President, Graham Porter, has done a magnificent job over the last 12 months, and I would like to acknowledge the work he has done for the community, particularly the Fassifern Valley Rotary Club.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge the re-elected secretary, Natalee Klan, and outgoing youth director, Elsie Fraser. I would like to welcome the incoming President, Ross McInnes, who is synonymous with being an outstanding dairy farmer in the area and being part of a small, local community. He is a guy who fights above his weight division when it comes to being involved in the community. Ross, congratulations on your new presidency of the Fassifern Valley Rotary Club. I would also like to acknowledge vice-president Bev Ward; Sergeant-at-Arms Paul O'Sullivan; youth director Thyrlene Devin; re-elected international director Marjorie Porter; club service director Lindie Kirchner; and community service director
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Kay" rel="nofollow">
         Andrew Kay
        </a>
        . They all do a wonderful job for their community.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition, we have the Beaudesert Hospital Auxiliary Board. You would question as to why a group such as the hospital auxiliary board would get together to raise money to give to the hospital because, in Queensland, an enormous amount of money from both sides of government has traditionally gone into the health portfolio. Federally, we give hundreds of millions of dollars to health. But auxiliary boards are there because the local hospitals are filled with their friends, their neighbours, their community members and the auxiliary board raises money through running the canteen to make the stays in hospital for the unfortunate people a little bit more comfortable. They raise money for additional furnishings or just to make the stay in hospital for these unfortunate people that little bit more comfortable.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have had the 50th anniversary of the Beaudesert Hospital Auxiliary. We welcome the incoming president Pat Burnett; first vice-president Therese Cahill; second vice-president Dianne Campbell; and secretary Marj Gardner.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also make special mention of committee member Lynn Mulders, who was the guest speaker at the recent meeting. She was an employee of the hospital for 44 years. Without a doubt she had the whole room in absolute stitches with some of the untoward practices that had happened over the last 44 years. She is truly a character.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also take the opportunity to acknowledge Julie Jones, Beatrice Flesser, Lyn Domjahn, Alexia Baker, Ella Todd and Lyn Loweke. They are wonderful people, who contribute many hours to ensure that hospital stays are made a little bit more comfortable.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, in addition, I have no hesitation in congratulating the 2012 Boonah Hospital Auxiliary Board, which performs the same function in a smaller hospital a couple of kilometres away. The auxiliary has purchased more than $25,000 worth of equipment in this financial year alone. I congratulate the tireless efforts of president Doreen Nason; vice-president Val Griffiths; second vice-president Shirley Steven; secretary Ann Andrews; and treasurer June Roberts. I was honoured to be asked to chair the meeting.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are many other well-deserved organisations that I would also like to acknowledge but time is going to inhibit me. But it is appropriate that in this place we continue to acknowledge the wonderful efforts of people that work tirelessly in their communities, whether it be Rotary, Lions or hospital boards. To each of them, I thank them personally.
