       <p>
        My question is to the Treasurer. There are more than a million Australians still on JobKeeper, and many are still dealing with the effects of border closures, delayed vaccinations and now floods. Today, Treasury has told Senate estimates that it expects 100,000 to 150,000 jobs could be lost after the Treasurer cuts JobKeeper this weekend. Why is the government leaving so many workers behind? How many of them could he afford to support beyond this weekend if he hadn't wasted so much money on companies which didn't need it?

           The relatively smooth transition from JobKeeper 1.0 to 2.0 gives us reason to believe that the effects will again be moderated by the strong economic and labour market recovery, the ongoing easing of restrictions, the changes that businesses have been making to their operating models and broader policy support measures that are in place.
