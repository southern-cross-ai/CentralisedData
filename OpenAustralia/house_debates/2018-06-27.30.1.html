        The Australian Electoral Commission recently announced the results of the redistribution of federal divisions in the state of Victoria. This will see changes to the electorate of Murray. There will be a change of name as well as geographical boundaries. The name will no longer be Murray; it is set to become Nicholls. The change of the division of Murray to Nicholls is to honour Sir Douglas Nicholls and also Lady Gladys Nicholls for their significant contribution to advocating for Aboriginal rights and welfare.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sir Douglas Nicholls was a professional athlete, a

        footballer with Fitzroy, a pastor and the inaugural Chairman of the National Aboriginal Sports Foundation. He was involved in organisations such as the Australian Aborigines' League and the Victorian Aborigines Advancement League. Sir Nicholls became

        in 1976 and the first Aboriginal person to hold vice-regal office. Lady Gladys Nicholls co-founded the women's auxiliary of the

        as well as holding many other positions. She was also leading in the advancement of Aboriginal rights, especially Aboriginal women's rights.
       </p>
       <p>
        As part of this redistribution, I'm also going to lose part of my electorate. Places such as Wedderburn, Boort,

        and Bridgewater, in the Loddon shire, will be joining Mallee, and towns such as Euroa and

        , in the Strathbogie shire, will be joining Indi. But I do look forward to picking up the towns of Seymour, Tallarook, Broadford and Puckapunyal to join me. Hopefully, I will get the opportunity to stand for Nicholls.
