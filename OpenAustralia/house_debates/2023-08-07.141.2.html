        From the very largest of cities to the smallest of towns and most quiet of villages barely a community across Australia has been left unmarked by the loss and tragedy of war and conflict. Memorials raised in every corner of our country inscribed with the names of our service men and women bear testament to this. Over the past two years the village of Millthorpe, 1,500 people strong, has come together to search for those sons and daughters of their beautiful town whose names needed to be added to their war memorial at Redmond Oval. The Millthorpe and District Historical Society and the village committee worked tirelessly on this project and recently, on a clear winter's morning, the local community gathered at the memorial to see 15 new names officially added to the roll of honour. It was a day to remember, as families from all over the state came to honour their loved ones. I was privileged to attend as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the names added to the memorial was that of Major Colin J Flatters
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , who was born in Millthorpe. Colin did two tours of Vietnam and served in the artillery during the

        </a>
        . Colin spoke of his service to our country, and his address was very significant, given that this year marks the 50th anniversary of the end of Australia's involvement in the

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Adding these names to the memorial, ensuring their service and sacrifice is honoured for generations to come, was made possible by the hard work and dedication of the Millthorpe and District Historical Society. I give a big thank you to President Bruce Chapman, Secretary Jacki Irvine, Collections Manager Hayley Lavers and Treasurer Rosemarie Amos. The project was funded by a Saluting Their Service grant, successfully applied for by the Millthorpe Village Committee, run by President Nick Anagnostaras, Vice President Richard Beach, Interim Secretary Mark Logan and Treasurer Helen Russ. A big 'well done' must also go to Ben Crombie and his team at McMurtrie and Co. stonemasons of Orange, who expertly installed the new plaque on the roll of honour.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another highlight of the day was catching up with Irene Chapman, who celebrated her 101st birthday that very day. Friends and family gathered to toast Irene's more than 10 tremendous decades.

        Small villages like Millthorpe thrive when community members volunteer their time and skills to make their corner of the country extraordinary. I'd like to acknowledge the team of volunteers who helped out on the packed Millthorpe fire festival on the weekend. A huge congratulations to the event committee of Nick Anagnostaras, Richard Beach, Michelle Slack-Smith, Helen Grey,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dane_Morgan" rel="nofollow">

        , Phoenix Kamsteeg and the dozens of hardworking volunteers who chipped in to make the opening night for the winter fire festival such a memorable one.
       </p>

        Millthorpe, as you can gather, is an extraordinarily vibrant community. They are very active on all manner of projects. Honouring the service and sacrifice of those who have worn the uniform for Australia is obviously an obligation that they take very seriously and they do it very well.
