        , their service to our nation did not end there. It didn't end with the hanging up of their uniform. Their service and their dedication to our nation continues to this day. We see it in the actions of the veterans still living, who continue to contribute to our communities, and it lives on in the stories of family members that served, those stories which filter through generations and still have the power to shape and inspire us.

        Mr Geoff McClements, a constituent of Curtin, is one such veteran, who at the age of 97 is still brimming with a passion for service and love for Australia.

He was a well-known player for the Claremont footy club and has for 50 years been a passionate volunteer at his local

         In accordance with standing order 43, the time for members' statements has concluded. Before we go to questions, just for the information of honourable members, in order to record the historic nature of our sittings at the moment, you'll notice photographers at each of the three ceremonial entrances capturing some of the images. Our well-known government photographer is there at the moment and will be joined by some others as we begin question time, and they'll be there through the week to get different angles on some of the shots.
