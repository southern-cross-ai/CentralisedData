        Mr Speaker, I have a question about the warning that you issued to me earlier on today. It seemed to imply that the impact of a warning on a previous day could somehow flow through to subsequent sitting days. Could you clarify whether when a member receives a warning on another sitting day that may be the basis on which they could be ejected without a warning being issued to them on the day on which you seek to eject them?

         I think, if the member for Melbourne had listened carefully to what I said to him before, he would have noted that I said that I have either given him a warning or taken action every sitting day this year. Given that, and given the way I gave him his warning today, I think he ought to reflect carefully on what I said.

            I have a question to you, Mr Speaker, and I refer to previous questions to you that indicate that over 98 per cent of people excluded from this House under your rulings have been members of this side of the House. Today the member for Brisbane has just been excluded for one day and the members for Richmond, Hindmarsh, Ballarat and Maribyrnong were also all excluded. In addition, a number of members on this side were warned, whilst to the best of my recollection only one member from that side of the House was warned, in spite of the fact that our questioners were heckled, such as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition when she got to her feetâ€”

              I am outlining what happened today. I am asking you to reflect on whether you think that was an accurate and fair implementation of the standing orders and the rules, particularly given the answers that were given today from people such as the Leader of the House.

              <p>
               In responding to the Manager of Opposition Business, can I make it clear, as I have made it clear in the past, that when members interject, I call them to order. I usually give them a warning if they continue to interject. If they ignore that warning then I will take action, and that is consistent with the way I have upheld the standing orders on discipline all the way through. If all members observe that point then they would understand where we have got to.
