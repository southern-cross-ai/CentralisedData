       <p>
        People all around Australia, and in fact all around the world, are experiencing higher inflation and the difficulties it then causes. It is truly a global problem caused, in large part, by disrupted supply chains during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and of course the Ukraine-Russia war. Knowing that it is a shared global problem does not make it any easier for people, and in Hasluck people are doing it tough.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hasluck has a very high population of people paying mortgages—52.3 per cent compared to the national average of 35 per cent—and they are wearing the brunt of any increases in interest rates to reign in inflation. Additionally, 18.6 per cent are renting, and the supply demand constraints in housing mean that they are also experiencing increases in rent. When I consider policy and legislation in this place, and in my work as a member of the House economics committee, I keep those people, fully 70 per cent of my constituents, front of mind.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Albanese government has implemented a range of measures both in the budget and over the last 12 months to address cost-of-living pressures. This government has been careful, however, to do this in a way that will not add to or exacerbate inflation. The government has supported substantial wage increases for those on the minimum wage, and, in the budget, supported a 15 per cent increase in salaries for workers in aged care. These are life-changing increases, and I call upon all those aged-care facilities in my electorate and around Australia to sign the pledge to pass on those increases in full.
       </p>
       <p>
        From 1 July, just over a month away, 96 per cent of families who use child care will be better off under the government's cheaper-childcare package; this is over 5,600 families in Hasluck alone. The budget also contained measures for fee-free
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        for 300,000 extra students, ensuring people can skill up as they need to and take charge of their career as we transition to newer energy jobs and pathways—particularly, again, in Hasluck, at our Midland TAFE facility, where we have a renewable energy trade focus.
       </p>
       <p>
        After taking bold action to cap energy prices late last year, the government has provided, in concert with states and territories, further energy price relief in the budget—a measure that will help over five million households and over one million businesses. The budget assisted those who currently depend on our social security safety net with increases in JobSeeker and youth allowance, and an increase in rent assistance when it's most needed. In the area of health there are cheaper medicines due to the cap on prescriptions and the 60-day script measures, together with the tripling of the Medicare rebate for groups most in need.
       </p>
       <p>
        When I'm out doorknocking in my electorate, my constituents speak to me about the issues that matter the most. It's pleasing for me to respond and say, 'We are listening, we're hearing you,' and we're responding with the policy measures to create relief in those homes.
