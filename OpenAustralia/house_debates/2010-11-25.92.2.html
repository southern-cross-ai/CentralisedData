       <p>
        Mr Speaker, on indulgence, I would like to associate myself with the comments this morning of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition regarding the mine disaster in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        . As honourable members are aware, there were two Australian victims, one of them William John Joynson, known to many as Willy Joynson. Willy came from Tinana, near Maryborough, and earlier from the Howard-Torbanlea area of my electorate, famous until comparatively recent times for its coal deposits.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Joynson, who worked at Burgowan Collieries, and his brother, Stanley, have both been miners in Australia. His cousin Russ said his family ‘would want people to remember him as a good guy who was always fun, never whinged and was always happy to have a chat’. On behalf of my electorate I extend condolences to his wife, Kim, and his two children; his mother, Beryl; his brother, Stanley; and his sisters Veronica, Diane and Leanne.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a sad and tragic irony that Mr Joynson, who moved to New Zealand earlier this year, was to return to Australia with his family at the end of this school year, which makes the matter all the harder to bear for his extended family. I spoke to his mother, Mrs Beryl Joynson, this morning, and the family is hoping to repatriate his body to Australia if that is possible. I trust the government will extend every assistance to her, to his wife, Kim, and her little family.

         I am sure that the House would want me to associate them with the member for Hinkler’s comments.
