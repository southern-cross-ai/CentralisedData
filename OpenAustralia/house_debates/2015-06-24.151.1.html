        The Solomon local sporting grants program is a fantastic initiative that helps so many budding Territory sporting stars. For those aged between 12 and 18, it helps towards the cost of travel, accommodation, uniforms and equipment when they are competing, coaching or officiating at a state, national or international sporting championship program.
       </p>
       <p>
        The grants, as you are well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, are for $500. Each recipient receives $500. I have had many mums and dads say to me that they are so appreciative of this grant when they have received it. There are three rounds of grants for each financial year. Round 1 for 2015-16 is closing in a few days' time, on 30 June, so I encourage all parents and sporting organisations to put in their grant submissions. They can do that through my website, which is natashagriggs.com.au.
