        My question is to the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction. Why won't the minister tell the House whether or not a compliance officer was present at the meeting?

         At the time, 2017, when I was in a previous role, I had no idea who was coming to that meeting. I didn't ask those people to come to a meeting. My understanding—it has been drawn to my attention since then—is that there was actually a compliance officer there. It is very clear that on that day I received a briefing from departmental officials on technical aspects of the revised listing under the

         Act. This is a big deal for farmers—something that those opposite wouldn't understand. It affects the small businesses who farm in my electorate and all of those businesses that depend on them. It is my job as a local member to make sure that they get a fair deal. As I said in the previous answer, an independent review by Wendy Craik identified that there were serious issues, which I'm pleased now that the government is acting on. It will ensure that farmers are better able to work with the

         and, hopefully, will reduce red tape for farmers, who are the greatest custodians of our environment.
