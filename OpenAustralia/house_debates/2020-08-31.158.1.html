        To get behind Australian manufacturers so they can unlock opportunities and create local jobs, we first need to understand the challenges they face. Recently I had the opportunity to connect with Tracy and the team at Plustec. Tracy, who's the owner and managing director, and her team make thermal double-glazed windows and doors in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_Plains" rel="nofollow">

        in my electorate of Lindsay. It was great to hear Plustec is one of the many local businesses applying for their
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Made" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        accreditation. Tracy used the instant asset write-off to purchase the machinery they need to construct and assemble their high-quality product onsite. As an innovative and competitive local business making an outstanding Australian-made product, Tracy understands the obstacles facing local manufacturers on the ground. She is exactly the type of person we need to have contributing to the new era of advanced manufacturing in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Western Sydney
        </a>
        . That's why I asked Tracy to be part of my advancing manufacturing task force.
       </p>
       <p>
        The advancing manufacturing task force will connect with industry leaders and stakeholders in local manufacturing, education and business to promote initiatives that increase and improve manufacturing in Australia. We will advocate for existing and emerging Australian manufacturers and deliver practical recommendations to bring more manufacturing opportunities, particularly advanced manufacturing in Western Sydney. We have members from Western Sydney

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Institution" rel="nofollow">

        of Australia, Plustec, Pandrol, Napean Community College and SpanSet Australia. I brought these members together to tackle challenges like the cost of manufacturing in Australia; lowering the cost of energy and inland freight; levelling the playing field for Australian businesses and protecting their

        from theft and from foreign competitors; and increasing awareness of the importance of buying Australian Made. Before coronavirus, the cheapest option was often the most convenient. Now we need to capitalise on our ability in Australia to compete on quality and value. We need to harness that momentum and the community groundswell of support to make the choice to buy Australian Made and actively support local jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        We want businesses to take advantage of the government's support through grants, and particularly apprenticeships, so we can train our kids to take on the jobs of the future. Young people may not know where a career in advanced manufacturing could lead them. We want to remove the barriers that kids face, opening new pathways for education that can include TAFE, university and apprenticeships so they can access these emerging industries. And it's not just young people. This week is Adult Learners Week, because we know learning doesn't stop at any age. We want to open these pathways for everyone and create jobs across the community.
