        It's been just over six months now since the election and the good people in my electorate of Longman are justifiably asking when the election promises made by Labor are going to be fulfilled. Both parties made many of the same promises, if they were elected, and part of being a good government is keeping your promises. Where are the lights for the

        , the new clubhouse and lights for the Narangba Eagles Football Club and the new clubhouse for the Caboolture rugby league club? We've heard crickets on the Centenary Lakes splash park, and we won't hold our breath on the

        four-lane upgrade. But the project that the coalition promised that will have the biggest impact on the Longman community is the $110 million commitment the coalition made to partner with council for the critical upgrade to Caboolture River Road to allow access to the Bruce Highway for the 70,000-odd expected residents that will move into the Caboolture West development over the next 20 years. This massive project was one of vision and plans for the future. It is a proactive rather than a reactive project that puts the infrastructure in place before this development reaches maturity, with something the Australian public are crying out for: forward planning. So I'm challenging this Labor government to fulfil their promises and , at least, give our community time lines on their election promises, and I'm asking them to match the coalition's commitment to the Caboolture River Road project.
