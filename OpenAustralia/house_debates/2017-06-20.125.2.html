        I would like, this evening, to take the opportunity to talk a little bit about my electorate in Brand in the southern metropolitan area of Perth. Brand incorporates the cities of Kwinana and Rockingham, which are made up of many communities that come together to create great places to live, work and play. These communities are made up of energetic, engaged and committed people that make Kwinana and Rockingham the fantastic places that they are to live today. I, like my colleagues in this place, am most fortunate in this job in that I get to visit groups, organisations and facilities where I can meet and talk with the volunteers, the hard workers and the big thinkers who put in the hard yards for the benefits of many throughout the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is inspiring to witness the depths of commitment that exist in the schools across Rockingham and Kwinana, where the passion for education and participation runs deep. Rockingham Beach Primary School principal Jacqui O'Donnell exemplifies this passion and ability, being one of only three principals from across Australia to be selected as a Harvard scholar. Heading off to Boston in July, the principal of my old primary school will be engaged in a program of learning where educators from around the world will hear about the great work being done at this little public primary school in Rockingham, nestled, as it is, between the beautiful Lake Richmond and the calm waters of Rockingham's Palm Beach. In turn, Principal O'Donnell will learn about and share in educational best practices from around the world that will benefit Rockingham Beach Primary School. These learnings will no doubt benefit the whole of the WA public school system into the future as educators and leaders like Jacqui O'Donnell move through the system along the course of their careers. This prestigious scholarship is a fantastic celebration of the school community and is one that the community should, rightly, be very proud of.

        In Medina, in the City of Kwinana, Brittney, Carmel Kickett and Wendy Oliver are just some of the team at the Moorditj Koort Aboriginal Health and Wellness Centre, and they are doing a fantastic job offering culturally sensitive services in health and wellbeing to the Aboriginal and

        community. This not-for-profit community-controlled centre is working to improve the delivery of health services by strengthening the relationship between health providers and the local community. The team's commitment to community is more than formal health provision. This year's Moorditj Koort

        ball is promising to be a stellar affair of good food, good company and great entertainment. I only wish I could be there myself. Moorditj Koort means 'good heart' in the local Noongar language, and the team works to achieve this physically and emotionally. The success of Moorditj Koort is built on more than just the work of people merely fulfilling their jobs; it is built on the enthusiasm and commitment of a dedicated team of people who want to improve the outcomes and the possibilities for people in their community.

        It is no secret that I have a passion for sport, mainly hockey and also footy. It is a passion that has given me some of the best times and strongest friendships of my life. The tireless work of an army of volunteer coaches, managers, groundskeepers, administrators, umpires, parents and sports lovers means that every weekend, and many weekdays, hundreds of children and young people get to participate and play in teams and in sports that they love. I am constantly impressed by the sporting talents demonstrated by young athletes across Brand. When presenting those dedicated young people with Local Sporting Champions certificates, the diversity, sporting ability and enthusiasm on display are always impressive. The sporting communities across the cities of Kwinana and Rockingham are important hubs that continue to grow as the suburbs grow. From the Secret Harbour Surf Lifesaving Club to the Rockingham Rams Football Club, from the Baldivis Archery Club to the Kwinana Bowling Club and from Peel's Riding for the Disabled to the myriad of others in-between, the depth and commitment to community through sport is one that the electorate of Brand can be proud of.

        Our whole community is all the stronger thanks to the work of those tireless volunteers who help those who are doing it tough. Jill and the team at the Rockingham Coastal District Care Centre are a godsend to those who are homeless or in dire financial straits. Julie-Anne, Tegan and the rest of the gang at The

        cookbook, which has the basics. It is handy to have a book that gives you some hints on catering for many. I admit I adapted 'catering for a shearing party of 25' for my own garden party once! The recent Safety Bay Belles Craft Market raised money for the Lucy Saw Centre, an important part of the local community which provides emergency support and shelter for women affected by family and domestic violence. The Lucy Saw Centre provides a refuge and safe place to stay for women and their children. It also provides an outreach program and counselling. I wish the centre all the best in the future. It does a marvellous job for the women of the community.
