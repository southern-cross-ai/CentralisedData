        ESTER () (): If you see a grader, a bulldozer or a crane at work on a major public project anywhere in Australia today, you can be sure of one thing: the current Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development had absolutely nothing to do with it. On major road projects, bridges, airports and community facilities, Australians are out there hard at work, all funded by the previous government and approved by the previous governmentâ€”works started by the previous government.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development turns up for the ribbon cutting. She turns up for the photo opportunity. And then she issues a press release full of praise. Then, in the greatest moment of chutzpah I have seen in my whole time in this parliament, she waltzes into this place and claims the previous government did nothing in 10 years. We have our own King of spin, our own King of excuses, the King of deception. Our own King of spin doesn't actually build anything but takes credit for the work from the previous government at every opportunity.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is the same minister who has hit the ground reviewing. It's now 137 days since she announced her 90-day razor gang review. She can't even deliver a review on time. This is serious. Delays caused by the review of the infrastructure pipeline will see increased prices, less roadwork and people's lives put at risk, right now.
