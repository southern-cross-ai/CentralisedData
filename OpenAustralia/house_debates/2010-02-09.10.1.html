        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the 87 per cent increase in the number of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        ns who cannot pay their electricity bills after a 26 per cent price increase this year. I also refer him to the further 19 per cent increase, on Treasury’s own figures, coming down the pipeline as a result of his great big new tax. I ask the Prime Minister: will he apologise to those 77,000
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australian

          The last time I looked there was not at present a carbon pollution reduction scheme in operation, therefore the Leader of the Opposition’s question goes to electricity prices already announced by the Liberal government of

           Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order going to relevance. The Prime Minister was asked about what he is responsible for, which is the 19 per cent Treasury estimate of the increase in electricity prices. That is what he was asked about and he should not dissemble that—

               n parliament when it convenes on these matters. The Leader of the Opposition talked about the impact on gas and electricity prices. They have been the subject of detailed responses by me and other ministers here at the dispatch box based on the Treasury modelling. On the question of the impact on prices, there is one key element missing in this whole debate—that is, the hidden pricing regime of those opposite. When Senator Joyce, who has been the subject of some discussion in recent days, was asked about the impact of what would happen to the opposition penalties regime for non-compliant businesses he indicated that those penalties would apply to business. And if penalties are applied to business as a cost to business then guess what happens? The prices get passed on to consumers. That is the hidden penalty price regime contained in their policy—

                 <p>
                  Thank you, Mr Speaker. The question went to the impact on electricity prices and went to recent decisions by the WA government prior to any passage by this parliament of any emissions trading scheme. I will just repeat that to go back to the basic logical flaw in the question. Secondly, our position in terms of the impact on electricity prices is clear, it is documented, it is on the public record and we have said it day after day. What has not been clear on the part of those opposite is the hidden penalties regime buried within their own scheme. They say that, if you breach so-called business as usual, then businesses unspecified in number will be penalised. When asked what the financial penalty is, they run and they hide and they do not say what it is. But there are three questions which arise here: how many businesses, how big is the penalty and where does the compensation lie?
