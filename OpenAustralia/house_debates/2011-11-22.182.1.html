        s movements have long been a quintessential part of an Australian childhood. They encourage our younger generations to engage in community service, support their peers and learn valuable life skills, including teamwork and leadership. Scouts and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_Guides" rel="nofollow">
         Girl Guides
        </a>
        provide a wonderful outlet for our children and at the same time teach them invaluable life skills. My electorate of Ryan was hit hard by the floods in January, affecting homes, businesses, livelihoods and, of course, community organisations. In particular, local Scouts and Girl Guides groups lost many of their halls and facilities. These groups are not-for-profit organisations, so this damage has had long-term detrimental effects.
       </p>
       <p>
        Almost 12 months on, some of these groups are still not back in their huts, with the Auchenflower Scout Hall remaining closed, mainly due to flood damage. Over the past year I have received many calls for help and support from local groups. I am always happy to support these worthwhile organisations, as they provide a continuing commitment to our youth generation after generation. They encourage young people to play a constructive role in society as responsible citizens and active members of our community—although, I must say, as a scouting mother I do feel that the first badge they earn should be one for sewing. I vividly remember many long nights trying to sew those badges on straight on my son's shirt.

        I was delighted to attend the recent John Oxley Girl Guides awards ceremony. Congratulations to all the girls who have achieved so much. However, I particularly want to acknowledge
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Hall" rel="nofollow">
         Jennifer Hall
        </a>
        from the Kenmore Ranger Guides. On a visit to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mater_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Mater Hospital
        </a>
        in Brisbane with her Girl Guides unit, Jennifer discussed ways that she could help the hospital as part of the service component of her Baden-Powell award. Jennifer decided to make beanies for premmie newborn babies. She chose the ambitious target of 800 beanies—the number needed at the Mater each year. Conscious of the challenge of the task ahead, Jennifer enlisted the assistance of local community groups. By the end, she achieved a truly amazing result—more than 6,800 beanies. These were collected and distributed not only to the Mater but to hospitals in need throughout all of Queensland. It was wonderful to hear Jennifer sum up the project in her own words:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I felt immensely proud of what I achieved as a Girl Guide with the community and know that we did make a difference. It taught me many skills; not only communication, project management, and logistics, but also the need to say thank-you to every knitter for their wonderful contribution.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate Jennifer and, indeed, Girl Guides all around Australia. They are indeed our country's future leaders.
