        I am very pleased to speak about the glue which plays a vital role in keeping regional and rural communities together, and what I am referring to is sport. 2016 will be looked upon as the year sporting hoodoos ended right around the world. The

        had a birthday—did he what!—kicking six goals for the Kats, who kicked six goals to none in the last quarter to come from behind at three-quarter time and win the cup. The Karratha Falcons also came from third place to win the reserves premiership. As the regional WA Liberals know, regional and rural WA punches well above its weight when it comes to sport, particularly in AFL, with the Pilbara being home to the

        , the most notable of the existing crop, hails from Cervantes in my electorate of Durack. Cervantes has been a powerhouse in the league, winning 15 of the last 18 premierships—a tremendous achievement by any regional sporting club. This year they defeated Lancelin Ledge Point by 83 points to 59 to add yet another cup to their ever-growing trophy cabinet. Dandaragan knocked off the

        and his board have done another brilliant job in 2016, demonstrating just how hard our volunteers in regional and rural Australia work week in, week out.

        In closing, I acknowledge and celebrate all the volunteers who contribute to sporting clubs in some way to ensure that sport remains alive and kicking in regional Australia.
