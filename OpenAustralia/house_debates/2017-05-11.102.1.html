        My question is to the Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. Will the minister outline to the House how the government's $75 billion of infrastructure investment over a decade will benefit my electorate of

         I thank the member for

         . As a former police officer, he well understands the importance of investing in good infrastructure. He knows that good infrastructure will change people's lives and save people's lives, particularly on our roads. I congratulate him for the work he is doing on behalf of his community.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government is investing $75 billion over 10 years in infrastructure across our nation. I am delighted to be the minister who is delivering this record infrastructure spend around our nation. As part of the Turnbull-Joyce government I want to congratulate the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Treasurer for the budget they handed down this week, which will deliver right across Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         In relation to the member's own electorate, the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Highway" rel="nofollow">
          Bruce Highway
         </a>
         is an issue he is particularly focused on. This budget continues to deliver on our record $6.7 billion investment in the Bruce Highway over 10 years. We are getting on with the job of delivering those projects right along the coast of Queensland.

         The member for Grayndler interjects. The member for Grayndler continues to interject and suggest that somehow we are spending less than he did on the Bruce Highway. But his own press release from 24 April 2013 says, 'with this latest announcement taking our total commitment to this vital economic lifeline to $5.7 billion'. That is $5.7 billion in 'A Ten Year Plan for a Better, Safer Bruce Highway'. We have a 10-year plan where we are spending $6.7 billion—$1 billion more than the member for Grayndler ever intended to spend under his 10-year plan for the Bruce Highway.

         The member for Wide Bay asked about projects in his own electorate. The budget included $11.2 million for the Bruce Highway and

         intersection, which he will be very pleased about. It included $530 million for the

         to Caloundra Road upgrade. I know the member for Petrie is very proud of that, as well as the members for Fairfax, Fisher, Dickson—they are all very happy. The member for Longman—she is happy as well. The member for Longman on the other side is very happy with the upgrade. Of course, the member for Petrie will be very excited about the $120 million for the

         interchange upgrade which was also announced in the budget. On top of that, there is $182 million for the Bruce Highway safety upgrade. This week of all weeks—National Road Safety Week—that upgrade will help to save lives and reduce road trauma, which I am sure all members join me in recognising.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Treasurer released a fair budget. It is a budget that will help to change lives and save lives with our infrastructure spend. He has made the right choices. There is a lot more in this budget than perhaps those opposite have recognised yet. There is $20 billion for the rail program: $8.4 billion for investment in inland rail and $10 billion for the national rail program. We will be working with the sates to improve connectivity across our nation. There is more than $5 billion to deliver the long-awaited Western Sydney Airport. We are creating jobs right across Australia. We are delivering a safer, stronger, better Australia where everyone can get ahead. We are building for our future while others are whingeing about it.
