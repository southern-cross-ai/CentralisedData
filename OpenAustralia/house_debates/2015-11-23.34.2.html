         Special Olympics

        movement is a real force for good in our country. I am fortunate in my area to have Special Olympics Logan putting basketball, futsal, bowling and swimming within the reach of more athletes in my local community. I spent a bit of time with the athletes, particularly the basketball athletes in Special Olympics Logan. They are always great fun to spend time with, as was the case on Saturday night at the end-of-year function and trophy presentation. A lot of fun was had on the dance floor and in the photo booth. We also got to celebrate Darren's 36th birthday—happy birthday, mate!

        Everyone got a trophy, but I wanted to single out Trent Warner. Trent is an absolute superstar. He won the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gary_Campbell" rel="nofollow">

        Spirit Award. Gary Campbell is someone we lost all too early—a bit over a year ago—in a cycling accident. He was a big supporter of the Special Olympics generally, but in Logan in particular. His award, presented by his wife Sue, is all about sportspersonship and playing the game the right way. I want to congratulate everyone involved in another terrific season: people like Suzy Chainey, the chair, and David and Sharon Russell, Lyn Mathers from Logan Metro, and all of the volunteers and coaches and everyone else who is involved. They are such a terrific group of people at Special Olympics Logan.
       </p>
       <p>
        I believe, as do they, and no doubt everyone in this chamber, that the joys and benefits of sport should be within the reach of everyone. That is what is so important about Special Olympics Logan. Well done to everyone involved.
