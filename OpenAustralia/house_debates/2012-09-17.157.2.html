        It gives me great pleasure to rise to congratulate talented sports star
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Barba" rel="nofollow">
         Ben Barba
        </a>
        . Darwin born Ben plays fullback for Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs, and many of his fans tell me that he played an integral part in the Bulldogs' minor premiership. A few weeks ago Ben made national headlines at the

        . Not only was he recognised as the best player in the NRL, but the Canterbury-Bankstown star also took home four other awards. They included being named Fullback of the Year, collecting the Provan-Summons Medal for the people's choice, sharing the award for the most tries with Cowboy winger

        , and securing the Peter Frilingos Headline Moment of the Year. Ben is a great ambassador for our youth, not just in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">

        under 20s competition and win the NRL's highest individual accolade. At just 23, he has achieved what most NRL players only dream of, and I look forward to following his career in the future. Well done to Ben.

        Another talented Territorian making headlines at the moment is 14-year-old Dripstone High School student Shiane Hawke. Shiane is a finalist on the

        and she has the most amazingly powerful voice and certainly surprised everyone, including all the judges, when she sang Duffy's song 'Mercy' during the audition. She continues to surprise Australians with her talent. I know that every time I hear her voice I get goosebumps. We Territorians know that Shiane does have the X factor, and recently I spoke to Shiane's mother, Mary, who is obviously very proud of Shiane, as we all are. I have it on very good authority that Shiane has the most amazing strength and determination, and, like many Territorians, has an easy-going laid-back attitude. And that is what sets us apart from the rest of Australia. I have to agree with

         Ronan Keating
        </a>
        , who is an expert in this field, when he says Shiane is truly gifted. Nothing gives me greater pleasure than having the opportunity to boast right here in this place about talented young, up-and-coming stars in my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am confident that we will see and hear more of Ben Barba and Shiane Hawke in the years to come. After all, it was not that long ago that the fabulous
