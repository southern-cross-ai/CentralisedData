         The Hunter
        </a>
        has amazing students who are taught by even better teachers, so it's absolutely no surprise to see an astonishing 68 students and teachers from all over the Hunter being recognised by receiving one of the Singleton Learning Community Education Week Awards for 2023. I want to recognise these outstanding students and teachers and thank them for all they do for their school communities and the whole community.

        Excellence partnership received an award for strengthening teacher capacity in implementing high-quality STEM programs for K to 6. King Street Public School's Story Street was recognised for encouraging a love of reading and providing an opportunity to connect with the whole community to view real-world literacy skills and storytelling. Milbrodale Public School's attendance program was a winner for designing, with staff, personal learning pathways and individual education programs for students and improving school organisation and culture by building a team mentality and continually involving school community. Mount Pleasant Public School received an award for their school canteen which, led by Jacob Godschalk, is run by the student representative council every Friday.

        Singleton Heights Public School's breakfast club received an award, along with Singleton Public School's Primary Mathematics Specialist Teacher Initiative and Singleton High School's tiny house project, which is being driven by Jason Kolatchew. Singleton High School have also received recognition for their program with Takahata, which is run by Ren Barnett, who organises a cultural exchange program between Takahata and Singleton. Singleton really excelled in this category, getting a third award for their K Block Kafe program, which has provided senior school students from the special education unit opportunities to develop food handling, meal prep and customer service skills.
