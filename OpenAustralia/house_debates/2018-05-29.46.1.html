        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport. Will the Deputy Prime Minister update the House on how the government is investing in nation-building, job-creating infrastructure? What other alternatives are there?

         I thank the member for Dunkley for his question. He's a good member, and he knows that this government has the back of Victorians. This government has the back of everyone in Australia who wants infrastructure to build jobs, to build this nation and to build our future.

         and Nationals government is committed, and is investing in more than $75 billion through our 10-year, decade-long infrastructure investment pipeline—a 10-year plan to bust congestion in our capital cities and, in our regions, to connect those communities that are looking for connection to ports and to further markets to take advantage of what the trade minister and the assistant minister, the member for Hinkler, are doing. All the while this is creating tens of thousands of jobs: a million jobs brought about five months earlier than we anticipated—more jobs for local businesses and more jobs for local communities.

        <p>
         When we talk about the state of Victoria, we look at the $12.9 billion to key infrastructure projects, including $5 billion for the

          I'm asked about Tasmania. I was there yesterday and the day before. I met with

           Deputy Premier
          </a>
          and Minister for Infrastructure. We talked about the infrastructure needs of the Apple Isle and what a great job
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Hodgman" rel="nofollow">
           Will Hodgman
          </a>
          and his Liberal government are doing down there. As well, I had discussions with the candidate for Braddon,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Whiteley" rel="nofollow">
           Brett Whiteley
          </a>
          , about
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_Highway" rel="nofollow">
           Bass Highway
          </a>
          funding. He understands the critical importance of infrastructure funding. I stood there with Brett, Senator Richard Colbeck and local mayors Daryl Quilliam and Robby Walsh to discuss infrastructure for our region. Later, I discussed it with Senator Steve Martin, a new voice for Tasmania in the government. In Tasmania, there is $461 million to replace the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgewater_Bridge" rel="nofollow">
           Bridgewater Bridge
          </a>
          , a fundamental piece of infrastructure, and there is $400 million under the roads of strategic importance, a Tasmanian roads package that is going to make such a difference to
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midland_Highway" rel="nofollow">
           Midland Highway
          </a>
          , Bass Highway and all the highways and byways in the Apple Isle. We're getting on with the job of building the infrastructure Tasmania needs, Victoria needs and this nation needs—building our future. I'm asked about the alternative. Well, the alternative is very bleak. In Tasmania, it's just a few million dollars promised compared to our $400 million roads project. The bleak future of those opposite is there before me. It is very bleak indeed. They stand for less jobs and for higher taxes. We stand for infrastructure.
