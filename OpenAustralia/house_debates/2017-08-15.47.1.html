        My question is to the Prime Minister. The former member for New England,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Windsor" rel="nofollow">
         Tony Windsor

        different to anybody that has stood aside during this particular issue?
       </p>
       <p>
        Why won't the Prime Minister direct the Deputy Prime Minister to resign from the cabinet? Is it because the Prime Minister relies on his single vote to cling to power?

          Mr Speaker, this question was asked yesterday and fully answered by the Prime Minister, and, under the standing orders, a question fully answered cannot be renewed.

           Whilst there was a question that was very similar, the requirement is that it's identical and—whilst I try to carry as much
           <i>
            Hansard
           </i>
           around in my head as I can!—I don't believe it's identical. That's how the standing orders are framed, so I am going to allow the question.

           <p>
            What the honourable member for Hunter did was not ask me a question; he quoted a rhetorical question from
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Windsor" rel="nofollow">
             Tony Windsor
            </a>
            which was apparently addressed to the world at large. But I won't put him to the trouble of reformulating his question. The member for New England is entitled to sit in this parliament. He's a member of the House of Representatives, he's the Deputy Prime Minister, he's a minister in my cabinet and he's entitled to be so. That's the case. We've referred the matter to the High Court not because we lack any confidence in his eligibility to sit here but because the High Court can take the opportunity to provide some clarification on this section of the Constitution, which has limitations, clearly, as the High Court has described. It's not unlimited; it's not to be read literally. That's very, very clear, and at least one member opposite is taking advantage of case law in that regard. So it's a good opportunity for the High Court to provide some further clarification. As I've said before, based on the advice of the Solicitor-General, the government is very, very confident that the member for New England's eligibility to sit in this House will be confirmed.
