       <p>
        I rise to inform the House of a new task force that has been formed on the north-west coast of Tasmania. Leading industry representatives of agriculture have come together to form the ‘Produce of Heaven’ task force to take advantage of Tasmania’s export potential, particularly in the Asian market. The task force has created the brand name ‘Produce of Heaven’ because of the richest soil, the cleanest air and purest water that it can boast from the region.
       </p>
       <p>
        Working together in this way will allow us to join forces in creating a road map that can significantly change the way we market ourselves on the international stage. We know our region is amongst the world’s best when it comes to good-quality fresh produce. Now under the banner ‘Produce of Heaven,’ we can actively go out and market the region and drive a greater share of the export market, particularly in Asia.
       </p>
       <p>
        As head of the ‘Produce of Heaven’ task force, I have been actively working with the trade commissions of various Asian countries, including Taiwan and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong" rel="nofollow">
         Hong Kong
        </a>
        . Members of these commissions have also been invited to the area. Through close relationships we will provide the Asian markets and our guests with a feeling of quality and an ability that only Tasmanian businesses can deliver. These Asian markets are particularly interested in Tasmanian produce because they know that Tasmania has been formally recognised as free from fruit fly and tobacco blue mould, as well as a number of other pests and diseases. They also recognise that Tasmania’s quality temperate climate and its low levels of chemical residues make it competitive with the world’s best producers. Beyond hosting these official visits, the ‘Produce of Heaven’ task force has also secured exhibition spaces at some of Asia’s biggest food expos. (
