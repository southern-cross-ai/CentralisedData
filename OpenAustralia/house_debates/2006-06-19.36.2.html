        My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that, of the 20 MPIs and censure debates on the subject of industrial relations moved since October 2005 in this House, he has participated in none of them? Is the Prime Minister also aware of the following exchange with the Catholic Archbishop of Sydney, Cardinal Pell, yesterday? Journalist: ‘So would you encourage Mr Beazley’s debate on this to take place?’ Cardinal Pell: ‘Debate is always, always useful.’ Given that the Prime Minister has not had the courage to debate me on industrial relations, one on one, in this House, will the Prime Minister now agree to have an industrial relations debate with me in the car park of the Coffs Harbour Spotlight store?

         I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question. I think the most appropriate way to reply to him is to say that, in the last 30 years, on both sides no Prime Minister has attended more question times for longer periods of time and answered more questions than I have.

           I thank the member for Braddon for his question. The answer is yes. The latest example appears to have been the member for Perth in relation to a company called Esselte, and I seek the permission of the House to take the House through some of the detail of this.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Thursday" rel="nofollow">
            Last Thursday
           </a>
           in this place the member for Perth, brandishing what was purported to be an
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWA" rel="nofollow">
            AWA
           </a>
           , asked the following question:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Isn’t it the case that this AWA leaves a full-time employee—
          </p>
          <p>
           of Esselte—
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           working a Saturday shift $65 a week, or $10,140 over three years, worse off?
          </p>
          <p>
           That was the claim. According to a statement from the company, released today, the facts are different from those suggested by the member for Perth. Amongst other things this is what the company had to say:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           The management of Esselte understands that the $65 pay cut allegation was raised in connection with Saturday work. Esselte does not regularly work any of its employees on a Saturday.
          </p>
          <p>
           It went on to say:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           Esselte has never engaged a person to work their regular hours on a Saturday.
          </p>
          <p>
           So, on the basis of the member for Perth’s claim, that particular claim is false. Further, Esselte said:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           At certain times of the year, due to increases in warehouse volumes, the existing full-time warehouse staff are asked to work Saturdays on an as-required basis. This Saturday work is voluntary and has always been in addition to the employee’s week hours and is worked at overtime rates of pay.
          </p>
          <p>
           The AWA that was offered to Esselte staff increased the minimum hourly rate to $18.39 an hour, compared with the collective agreement of $17.39 an hour, and also compared with the relevant award, which had a rate of $13.78 an hour. On the basis of a calculation along the lines of that made by the member for Perth of an employee working 38 ordinary hours and three hours overtime, they would actually be $27 a week better off, not $65 a week worse off, and $4,000 better off over the three-year period.
          </p>
          <p>
           I understand that the agreement offered included increases in wages, increases in some allowances and an increase in sick leave provisions. On Saturday, one of Australia’s most respected union figures, Mr Joe de Bruyn, had something to say about people taking liberties with the truth in the industrial relations debate. That was referring to Spotlight; it may well also have referred to Esselte.

                             I would like the member for Perth to address the case. I would like the member for Perth to explain to the House how it is that he can get up and make an allegation that somebody is $65 a week worse off when, with a bit of research based on what the company has said, that person is in fact $27 a week better off. That kind of misrepresentation is of a piece with the misrepresentation of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition was trying to establish that Teys Bros were deliberately refusing to give Aussie workers a job, when in reality they had not only advertised but also gone to the union and asked the union to provide some Australian workers, and the union could not do so. What the opposition is doing on this issue is deliberately distorting the facts in order to create fear and hostility in the community.
