       <p>
        Before I call on question time, I have a brief statement to make to the House that will be of interest to all members. Members would be aware that I announced earlier this year that our Clerk,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Elder" rel="nofollow">
         David Elder
        </a>
        , is to retire. As I said at the time, we'll recognise his longstanding and outstanding service to our parliament and to our nation on his last day in this chamber, which I can now advise members will be Thursday, 1 August. His last day in the parliament will be at the end of the following week.
       </p>
       <p>
        I can advise the House that a selection process for the position of Clerk was undertaken, which was overseen by the Parliamentary Service Commissioner, Mr Peter Woolcott AO, and assisted by an advisory panel comprising former speaker
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Burke" rel="nofollow">
         Anna Burke
        </a>
        and former member for Boothby Andrew Southcott. Following consultations with the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the House and the Manager of Opposition Business, I have today signed the instrument appointing our next Clerk. I'm very pleased to advise members that our next Clerk will be our current Deputy Clerk, Ms Claressa Surtees.
       </p>
       <p>
        Claressa commenced with the Department of the House of Representatives in August 1994. She subsequently served in a number of important roles, including Serjeant-at-Arms and Clerk Assistant, following which she was of course promoted to Deputy Clerk. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clerk_of_the_House_of_Representatives" rel="nofollow">
         Clerk of the House of Representatives
        </a>
        is the principal adviser in relation to proceedings of parliament and is also responsible for the Department of the House of Representatives. The Clerk plays a critical role in maintaining our democracy. As I have said, I was sure members would welcome the announcement. It's also, of course, a historic appointment as Claressa will become the first female Clerk of the House of Representatives.
       </p>

        Honourable members: Hear, hear!
