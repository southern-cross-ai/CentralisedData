         Early Childhood Education
        </a>
        . How is the Albanese-Labor government delivering on its election commitment to make early childhood education more affordable for Australian families?

         I thank the member for Bennelong for his question. It was really fantastic to visit the West Ryde Neighbourhood Children's Centre with the member for Bennelong last week. The centre is led by the wonderful director, Susie, and we got to meet such beautiful children like Lily, and a huge thank you to Lily for the painting of rainbows and love hearts. I particularly enjoyed watching the member for Bennelong pretending to be a human basketball hoop while the children threw their hats at him. It certainly was a sight to be seen.

         The Albanese government believes that good quality and affordable early childhood education is critical for every Australian child. We know that it can change the trajectory of a child's life, but the benefits, of course, go beyond just children. A well-functioning early learning system pays a triple dividend. It sets children up for a great start in life, it helps families get ahead and it builds our economic prosperity by supporting workforce participation. Our reforms that were introduced last year will make early learning more affordable for over 1.2 million families right across Australia in electorates like Bennelong, starting from 1 July.
        </p>
        <p>
         It's just one of the ways that the Albanese government is providing responsible relief to families that will make a huge difference to their household budgets. The reforms will enable more primary carers, who are predominantly women, to return to work, to take on extra work if they so wish to contribute to the household income, or to go back to university or study if they so wish.
        </p>
        <p>
         I visited early centres right across Australia, from Bennelong to Reid, Swan, Boothby, Wills and Aston. Everywhere I go, families tell me how relieved they are that the Labor government is living up to its promise and making it more affordable for early childhood education. I also get to see firsthand the fantastic work of early childhood educators. In the words of Georgie Dent from the Parenthood, who is a wonderful advocate for the value of early learning:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Investment in early childhood education and care is an investment in building the nation's social capital. It is an investment in the future prosperity of the country and just as important as physical infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Albanese Labor government is making investments in Australian children and families, investments that make a real difference to their lives. We're delivering on our commitments to the Australian people, and we're giving children the best start in life and making a real difference to the household budgets of Australian families.
