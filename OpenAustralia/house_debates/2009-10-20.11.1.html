        My question is to the Acting Prime Minster. I refer to comments yesterday by the National Secretary of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Workers_Union" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Workers Union
        </a>
        , Paul Howse, about the surge in asylum seekers. I quote:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I think we should put out a red carpet and welcome them with open hands.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Howse also said, ‘One man’s people-smuggler is another man’s liberation hero.’ Given the influence of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWU" rel="nofollow">
         AWU
        </a>
        at Labor’s national conference, will the Acting Prime Minster inform the House of what input, direct or indirect, Mr Howse has had into the government’s border protection policies?

         I genuinely thank the Deputy Leader of the Opposition for her question. The answer is none. Matters of policy for government are decided by the government. In deciding our border protection policies, what we determined to do was to be tough on border protection but to deal with people in a humane way. In putting that balance together, we have been very, very focused on dealing with people-smuggling. And, of course, as we deal with people-smuggling, we note that, despite the claims of the opposition to the contrary, the numbers of people moving around the globe have increased. The numbers of asylum seekers have increased.

            Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The Acting Prime Minster answered the question. She said the

              It will take finer minds than mine to work out whether that is the worst performance the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has ever had, or whether the Keating quote was the worst performance the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has ever had. I will leave it to finer minds than mine to try and work out which was the silliest question. Once again, it may be a heroic assumption in relation to members of the opposition, but I am assuming that in one of these public policy debates of our time—namely, how the world deals with unauthorised people movement—people in the opposition will be interested in the facts. I am constantly being proved wrong, question by question, interjection by interjection—

                And I am told, ‘That’s right.’ In a triumph of hope over experience, I am going to try and inject some facts into this debate in the hope that maybe the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and others might grapple with the facts as they engage in the public debate about asylum seeking and people movement. Fact No. 1 in dealing with the question of how many people are moving around our globe: the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNHCR" rel="nofollow">
                 UNHCR
                </a>
                tells us that, at the end of 2008, the total number of refugees and internally displaced people under its care remains high at roughly 25 million—almost unchanged since 2007. So some sense that there has been a big drop-off is not right. Fact No. 2—and here we go, of course facts do not want to impinge on the opposition’s views—
