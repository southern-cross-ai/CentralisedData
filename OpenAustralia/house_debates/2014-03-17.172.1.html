        Michael and Di Sullivan from the historic northern Tasmanian village of Evandale had a plan more than 30 years ago to put their village on the map.

        , along with the hardworking and long-serving Avondale Village Fair committee most ably led by president
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Lewis" rel="nofollow">
         John Lewis
        </a>
        , had no idea that the plan would prove quite as successful as it has. A couple of weekends ago Evandale staged its 32nd Evandale Village Fair and the national penny-farthing championships. The event had 75 starters for a range of novelty and high-speed penny-farthing races around the streets of the village. A delighted Mrs Sullivan was particularly pleased that 25 of the 75 competitors were first-time entrants, whilst others have come up through the ranks from junior competitions. A number came also from interstate and some from overseas to be part of the unusual cycling racing weekend.

        I was delighted to present a number of ribbons during the day, and it should be noted that the winner of the main race of the day, the 2014 national penny-farthing championship, was

        , one of Mr and Mrs Sullivan's sons. Ryan started his cycling career on penny-farthings and has gone on to compete internationally on more conventional bikes. Competitors at this year's penny-farthing championships ranged in age from as young as six to well over 70 years of age. I was pleased to sponsor this year's novice race as well as one of the intermediate sprints that went past my office in the road race on the Sunday. This is indeed a wonderful and unique event.
