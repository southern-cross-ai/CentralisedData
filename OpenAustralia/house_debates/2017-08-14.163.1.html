       <p>
        The government's Stronger Communities Program is now returning for a third round in my electorate on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        . In this year's budget, the government has committed $22½ million for the third round, with funding of up to $150,000 available for community organisations across the electorate of Robertson. Already we've received dozens of expressions of interest. I really encourage any local community groups who are interested to also consider nominating their projects.
       </p>

        In the first two rounds, we've been able to assist groups across the Central Coast with a great range of community projects. The Umina Community Group was able to help fund the construction of Runway Park at Umina—an outstanding tribute to our region's wartime history. Musicians Making a Difference, in Gosford, have just completed a brand new recording studio. It was a pleasure to attend the launch of this new venue recently for an outstanding organisation that does great work with young people right across the Central Coast and around Australia. BlueWave Living at

        was able to purchase and install an emergency generator, the Pearl Beach Progress Association secured a defibrillator for the beach, and the Central Coasts Sports Federation, along with the

        </a>
        , will be launching the Central Coast Walk of Fame in Gosford. It's great to see projects like this come to life as a result of this program. I certainly encourage applicants who would be interested to consider registering their interest for this project by 4 September. Applicants can seek grants of between $2,500 and $20,000, and we'll match the grant on a dollar-for-dollar basis.
