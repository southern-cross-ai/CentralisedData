       <p>
        I rise today to highlight a critical issue to Tasmanian businesses, the Tasmanian community, the Tasmanian economy and Australia as a whole, and I would think everyone would want to listen to what I have to say. We currently have a fuel security emergency on our hands, yet this government is doing nothing about it. I will note there is a Liberal senator, Senator Molan, and a Liberal backbencher, the member for Canning, who do understand what I have to say, which is pleasing, and I wish there were more who would listen to them.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government's own statistics show current reserves of fuel diesel, jet fuel and petrol sit at three weeks or less, and that includes the supply sitting out at sea on vessels. This is in contravention of the International Energy Agency's 90 day fuel stockholding obligation that has been in place since March 2012. In simple terms: as a nation, we are meant to have three months supply here on the continent; instead, we have just three weeks.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are a number of factors at play here, including the closure of four Australian petroleum refineries and the loss of a domestic shipping fleet to transport fuel to and from this country. Our fuel supply is at the mercy of the boardrooms of overseas countries, which is an absolute shame.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my electorate, we have seen these decisions at work. The
        <i>

        , when docked in Devonport, my home town, in 2015, had its crew sacked, to be replaced by foreign labour in Singapore. And who gave the permit to allow that to occur? This Liberal government. This decision has meant that Tasmania is now entirely dependent on international ships with foreign crews to supply our fuel.
       </p>
       <p>
        Nationally, this emergency, the lack of Australian-crewed ships, potentially has enormous ramifications. What happens in a time of conflict when the government needs to requisition ships to supply the Navy and the nation with fuel? Where will they come from? The simple answer is: nowhere, because, under this government, there will not be an Australian ship supporting an Australian effort. Also, what happens if there is another global financial crisis and international credit markets collapse, tying up foreign ships? That could happen, based on the situation with some of these international shipping countries. You could have a ship out at sea with fuel to come to Australia; that ship needs support, and nothing happens with that fuel. And then, again, Australia has three weeks fuel here.
       </p>
       <p>
        Short-sighted and ideological policy decisions from this government could see Australians paying a very heavy price. Earlier this week, I called upon this government to abandon the flawed coastal shipping legislation they're proposing, as it will potentially open

        </a>
        up to more foreign-flagged ships. Tasmanian Senator Colbeck responded that the government's proposals were good for business. But his logic is flawed beyond belief. As an island state, Tasmania absolutely relies upon reliable shipping services, and Bass Strait is Tasmania's social and economic lifeline. It's about time that this government woke up, for the good of the Tasmanian economy and for our farmers and producers.
