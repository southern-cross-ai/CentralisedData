       <p>
        There are serious doubts over the Deputy Prime Minister's entitlement to sit and vote in this place, notwithstanding the Prime Minister's breathtaking declaration that the High Court should find in the Deputy Prime Minister's favour. Those doubts have a very real impact on the lives of Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Monday, I seconded and spoke on the penalty rate motion vote moved by my colleague and fellow Tasmanian the member for Braddon. She, like me, recognises the economic and social impact that cuts to the take-home pay of our lowest paid workers will have on our communities in Northern Tasmania.
       </p>
       <p>
        This government has relied on one vote to ensure that workers in my electorate of Bass will have their wages cut. That one vote sees lower-paid workers missing outâ€”a vote that this government has used to block amendments to legislation which would have stopped wage cuts to nearly 700,000 Australians and a vote that will see people like Carol in Launceston, who has worked weekends in hospitality, is a full-time foster parent to her nephew and has chronic health conditions, having to work more hours to make up a difference in lost wages.
       </p>
       <p>
        Every affected Australian needs their voice heard. I ask, in their name: how can this chaotic and incompetent government continue to accept the Deputy Prime Minister's vote when it means that nearly 700,000 Australians will continue to have their penalty rates cut?
