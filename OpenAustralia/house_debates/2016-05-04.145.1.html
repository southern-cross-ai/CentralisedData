        It gives me great pleasure to rise. It may be the last time I get an opportunity in this parliament—who knows? Ultimately, that is a decision for the Prime Minister. I just wanted to say that for the last three years it has been an honour and a privilege to be the member for one of the most diverse and amazing electorates in Australia, in my belief.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have an enormous respect for the electors in my electorate. They are reasonable and they are fair-minded. We have more work to do, and I do hope that they will give me the opportunity to continue the work we have started. Tasmania has been a better place in the last three years. When we inherited government unemployment was over eight per cent, and today it is in the mid-sixes. We have invested in infrastructure and we have supported the engine room of my state, which ultimately is small business.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to take this opportunity to thank my staff. I have extraordinary people who support me every day. I thank Caroline Donaghy, Cassie Tickner-Smith, Sharna Lee, Charles Headlam, Lorraine Anderson, Jane Donaghy, Kirstie Hill and all of the other people and volunteers who support me in the work that I do. I thank them all very much. They make me look good most of the time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most of all, can I thank my family—my beautiful wife, Amanda, and my two boys, David and John—for the time that I do not spend with them, for the times I miss important events in my boys' lives—I miss that—and for the time that I do not spend with my wife that I should spend with my wife. That is the choice I made. As has been said, they are the conscripts and I am the elected member.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to focus on the future as well. Last night was an important milestone for our country.

        , the Treasurer, delivered a plan for our nation's future. It is a plan to deliver jobs in growth and to create a stronger, more diverse economy, whether it be through the National Innovation and Science Agenda; the procurement of defence spending capacity; the ability for small and medium businesses all around Australia to take advantage of those initiatives and for Australians to have the passion and the capacity to be able to develop start-ups; or the tax cuts that are now extended for businesses with a $10 million turnover—small and medium businesses—and hardworking Australian families that will benefit from not going into higher tax brackets—this is all about you. We are cracking down on tax avoidance and multinationals. It is right and proper that they pay their fair share of tax. That burden then does not fall on families and small business, which we know is the engine room. We have, with secure and proper planning, been able to guarantee proper and reliable funding for health and education. This is about the trust we put in Australians. We will deliver on that promise.
