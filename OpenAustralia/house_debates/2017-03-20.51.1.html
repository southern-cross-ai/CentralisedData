       <p>
        I would like to acknowledge the very good work of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        state government in upgrading local roads in my electorate of Hughes. Firstly, we have had the upgrade of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfords_Point" rel="nofollow">
         Alfords Point
        </a>
        bridge. The northern approach was upgraded in 2011 and the southern approach is currently being fully upgraded. The road is being widened to three lanes and is being divided down the middle, which will add a lot more safety to that road.
       </p>
       <p>
        But there is still much more work to do in our electorate, especially on Heathcote Road. This was a road constructed back during World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
         II
        </a>
        . It was constructed between the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holsworthy_Army_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
         Holsworthy Army Barracks
        </a>
        and the port down at Wollongong. We have since recently upgrades to Deadmans Creek bridge, which has been most important. Currently, there are upgrades of Woronora bridge, with new warning signs and a new speed camera going in there. We would like to see, eventually, that entire road be upgraded. In the last few years, between 2011 and 2015, there have been 110 crashes along that road, with, sadly, two fatalities. Further, the F6 extension, from the south coast, is also badly overdue, and needs work to commence.
       </p>
       <p>
        But I would like, overall, to congratulate the New South Wales state government. They are doing a good job in the local area on roads. As I said, there is still much more work for them to do.
