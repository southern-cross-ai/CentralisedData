        , I, along with a number of lucky members and senators, was able to hold aloft the 2023
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
         AFL
        </a>
        Premiership Cup as it stopped by on its tour of Australia over this month. However, I'd like to mention a much more prestigious award that was bestowed on someone in Parliament House later that night. I am of course referring to Rosie Connelly, who, along with a handful of other teachers from across the nation, was awarded the Early Career Teacher award at the 2023 Commonwealth Bank Teaching Awards. Rosie is a teacher at Playford Primary School located in Craigmore in my electorate of Spence. I was proud to see Rosie get further recognition for the work she is doing, particularly for her work with students with special needs and students with autism.
       </p>
       <p>
        After she was recognised by the South Australian Department of Education last year as the primary teacher of the year, it is little wonder that, after listening to her story and the work she does, her work translates very well to the national stage, which aims to recognise the best and the brightest. And, as far as the brightest goes, Playford Primary School truly has one of the best in Rosie Connelly. It's very rarely about the recognition, but you should be, amongst your peers across the country, recognised for just how profound an impact you are having on so many young minds and lives. Thank you, and well done to Rosie Connelly.
