       <p>
        The bill before the House obviously provides the Treasurer with enormous power and discretion. It allows the Treasurer to impose conditions, to vary existing conditions and, as a last resort, to force the divestment of any realised investment where national security concerns are identified. It also provides the Treasurer with greater enforcement, monitoring and investigative powers to respond to actual or likely noncompliance by investors, including call-in powers to review certain actions not otherwise captured under the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975. If the public is to have confidence that these powers are being wielded responsibly, we must know when and why the Treasurer uses this power and discretion. To that end, my amendments will ensure that the decisions and reasons for the decisions made by the Treasurer under this act will be on the public record.
       </p>
       <p>
        Moreover, these amendments are particularly important because of the loose definitions of 'national security' or 'decisions not contrary to national security' that are used to initiate the new national security test. There have been many occasions over the past 10 years on which I voted against legislation that erodes civil rights and the freedom of the press in the name of national security. I've also voted against the barbaric treatment of asylum seekers and refugees that has been actioned in the name of national security. And I've voted against the unfettered and unprecedented levels of power given to ministers and our security agencies in the name of national security but without accountability or independent review.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to know, and I think the community wants to know, what the government considers to be contrary to the national interest and what actions by foreign investors give rise to national security concerns. Too often the government has used the term 'national security' to protect its own interests. The public disclosure of this information that I propose this afternoon would provide some surety for foreign investors intending to invest in Australia and also build public trust that the decisions made under the foreign investment framework are warranted. Indeed, without these amendments, how do we know that decision-makers will not use these legislative powers to help out their mates or perhaps the large political donors at the next election? The half-baked
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICAC" rel="nofollow">
         ICAC
        </a>
        proposal by the government is certainly not going to provide any comfort to the community. In fact, without a federal ICAC we really need all the decisions made at the discretion of ministers to be on the public record.
       </p>
       <p>
        By the end of 2019, the total current foreign investment in Australia had reached $3.8 trillion. There is no doubt that foreign investment is increasingly complex, particularly in this climate of rapidly changing technology and shifts in our international security settings. Foreign ownership or control of strategic assets, prime agricultural land and residential property has been especially problematic in recent years. The 99-year lease of the Darwin Port, which is a significant defence asset, and the sale of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Diemen's_Land_Company" rel="nofollow">
         Van Diemen's Land Company
        </a>
        , Australia's biggest dairy asset, are obvious examples. I believe that the sale of these assets to foreign interests are clearly inconsistent with Australia's national interest and public expectation. This is one of the reasons I agree the Treasurer should have increased powers and discretion, outlined in this bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        I support the bill, but I want to know, and the community wants to know, what decisions are made and for what reason these extensive powers are enacted under this legislation. I believe the community, business and industry, as well as foreign investors, would want to know. These amendments provide for that clarity and transparency. I hope they get the support of both major parties, because surely the government and the opposition would realise by now how important transparency is to the Australian community. In essence, I just want the Treasurer's decisions and the reasons for those decisions to be on the public record, available through a publicly accessible website so we just know what's going on and why it's going on.
