        Today I rise to congratulate the Camden Show Society on a fantastic show last week. Crowd numbers were at an all-time record, with more than 42,000 people attending the 127th annual show on Friday and Saturday. The crowds were treated to a wide range of events and exhibitions, which showcased the fantastic people and produce we have in the Macarthur region. These included the grand parade, the Camden Show Farmer of the Year, our Camden Showgirls, the Battle of the Schools Talent Quest, carnival rides, show bags, stalls, animal farms, a rodeo, fireworks, wood chopping, pole climbing, chainsaw duelling and much, much more.

        The Camden Show prides itself on being a country show and attracts thousands of locals and tourists to Macarthur each year. Local residents are very proud of the show and the atmosphere that it creates across Camden and the surrounding suburbs. On Friday, I took the shadow minister for communications and broadband,

        , the member for Wentworth, to the show to meet the locals and see some of the fantastic local produce and talent we have in Macarthur. We were given a tour of the show, which included a walk through the show pavilion, where we saw some of the fantastic cooking, arts and crafts, needlework, floristry and photography.

        It was great to see so many local entries in this year's pavilion and we were very lucky to meet some of the entrants personally and see some of their fantastic work. I would like to congratulate show president David Head, secretary Lyndy Cornwell and the Camden Show Society on another fantastic show this year. I wish them all the very best as they start planning for an even bigger and better show next year. It is with great pride that I wear the Show Society tie in this chamber today.
