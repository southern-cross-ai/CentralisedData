        At the weekend, I got to do something that no other member of this place has done. I was at the 208th anniversary of a church, the oldest surviving church in Australia,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebenezer_Church" rel="nofollow">
         Ebenezer Church
        </a>
        . Established in 1809, this sandstone building was originally a nonconformist church and then became the first Presbyterian church in the country. The history is this: a group of families arrived on the
        <i>
         Coromandel
        </i>
        in Sydney in 1802. These families—Davison, Hall, Howe, Johnston, Johnstone, Mein, Stubbs and Turnbull—came to the new colony with a request to be settled together. Their wish was granted by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_King" rel="nofollow">
         Governor King
        </a>
        and they moved to their 100-acre land grants at Portland Head, Ebenezer on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawkesbury_River" rel="nofollow">
         Hawkesbury River
        </a>
        in early1803. They were joined by seven other families—Arndell, Bushell, Grono, Cavanough, Jacklin, Suddis and Jones—and met regularly on Sundays for services on Mount Ebenezer in the homes of settlers. These settlers were people of various denominations, but they came together as one congregation.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1808, at a special meeting in the home of Dr Thomas Arndell, each family pledged itself to the building of a church and a school. They raised the 400 pounds themselves without government assistance and the land was donated. Built of locally obtained materials like sandstones, cedar wood and hardwood, it was constructed in 1809. The building still stands and Sunday's celebrations of the 208 years reflected the strong community commitment to the historic church. I should also note that work has been put into maintaining the church, including by a descendant of two of the original founders, John and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Turnbull" rel="nofollow">
         Ann Turnbull
        </a>
        . The Prime Minister made significant contributions some years ago to help repair the leaking roof.
       </p>
       <p>
        Peter Worland, the executive director, Uniting, spoke to the congregation and challenged them to work to help the most vulnerable in our society. Congratulations to all of those who were involved in the day, including Reverend Rodel Palma, Reverend Geoff Stevenson, church secretary Ted Brill, and people like Jennifer Turnbull and Dawn Case. I want to make special mention of the wonderful homemade refreshments. I had the best sponge cake I have tasted in a very long time. It was a privilege to be part of a wonderful celebration of the Hawkesbury's history.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to talk about an upcoming event in my electorate of Macquarie, the Winter Magic Festival in Katoomba on Saturday. This festival attracts tens of thousands of people to Katoomba. It is always a cold day, but the atmosphere is always very sunny. The main streets are closed. It is packed with stalls. The 11.30 parade is a display of community, from local kids through to disability groups and political activists. It is a diverse cross-section put together by volunteers. They deserve congratulations for the work they have done to make Saturday's event happen. I look forward to being there.
