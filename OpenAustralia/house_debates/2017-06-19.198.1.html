        I rise in this place to celebrate Refugee Week, which began on Sunday, 18 June and will finish on Saturday, 24 June. The theme this year is 'With courage let us all combine'.

        tomorrow. Refugee Week recognises people who have sought a safer place to live and now call Australia home.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my electorate of Herbert, the Townsville Multicultural Support Group supports new refugees and in the past year has settled 170 new residents. Townsville is also home to the Townsville Intercultural Centre, where migrants and refugees can seek help after the six-month settlement phase. During the week, the Townsville community along with the Townsville Multicultural Support Group welcomes new residents and celebrates the significant contributions and achievements of those refugees who have made our community their home.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia is a nation built on migration and Refugee Week is an opportunity to hear the many positive stories of those who have sought asylum in Australia and help people to understand the many challenges that refugees face. Labor believes in a compassionate approach to asylum seekers so that genuine refugees can progress their claims safely, securely and in a timely manner. At a time when the number of displaced people fleeing from war, conflict or persecution is at its highest since World War

        , Australia, as a responsible global citizen, has a role to play in helping with this extraordinary humanitarian crisis. We have all benefited from the invaluable contribution that refugees have made to our society. Let us celebrate Refugee Week.
