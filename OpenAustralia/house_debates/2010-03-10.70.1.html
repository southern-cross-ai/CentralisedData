        I think that we would all agree that it is important to encourage and support young people who demonstrate a commitment to their communities and to active public leadership. It is for this reason that last year I established the Gorton Young Leaders Awards. The Gorton Young Leaders Awards recognise local young people who have shown an exceptional commitment to public service, specifically through involvement in voluntary work, student leadership or community service.
       </p>

        I am extremely pleased to inform the House that the electorate of Gorton has produced some outstanding young leaders who have demonstrated a commendable level of commitment to their communities and to greater public life. The achievements of these leaders were diverse, ranging from sporting accolades and volunteer work for a refugee-tutoring program to charity work for the Victorian bushfires relief fund and the St Vincent de Paul Society.

        Last month I had the great pleasure and privilege of meeting these young leaders at a morning tea that was convened in my electorate office in Keilor. I would like to thank my electorate staff for providing that opportunity. It was a great event. It allowed us to discuss their effortsâ€”not only what they do in the curricular area of school but also what they do in the extracurricular area: providing support in the community, as I said, and involving themselves in very important altruistic initiatives. I look forward to charting the progress of these young leaders in the years ahead. I am sure the House will join me in congratulating them on their efforts and wishing them well in the future. Indeed, if the Gorton voters allow me, I certainly look forward to acknowledging the 2010 Gorton Young Leaders Award recipients in about a year from now. It is a magnificent tribute to the efforts of those young people as well as a tribute to their parents and families. In the end, it is important that as local leaders we acknowledge such good work, and for that reason this type of award will continue, I hope, for many a year.
