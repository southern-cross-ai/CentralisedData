       <p>
        Today I want to talk about roads, and roads in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Trobe" rel="nofollow">
         La Trobe
        </a>
        . La Trobe is the fastest-growing electorate in the country. When it comes to road funding, the federal government funds the roads that are called 'roads of national significance', such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monash_Freeway" rel="nofollow">
         Monash Freeway
        </a>
        . When it comes to other roads, local roads, it's normally up to the state government and the councils.
       </p>
       <p>
        When it comes to roads of national significance, I'm very proud to say that stage 2 of the Monash Freeway is well and truly underway. Initially I announced $500 million back in March 2016, when Prime Minister Scott Morrison was the Treasurer. We saw stage 1 completed in conjunction with the state Labor government of Victoria. That was an extra lane from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Gippsland_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         South Gippsland Highway
        </a>
        to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrigal_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Warrigal Road
        </a>
        . For stage 2, we've committed another $683 million for an extra lane from South Gippsland Highway to Warrigal Road, but, importantly, from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clyde_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Clyde Road
        </a>
        to Cardinia Road. The construction is well and truly underway, and it's expected to be completed in 2022. I fought very hard to ensure that the Beaconsfield interchange would be included as part of that roads package, to include the missing on/off-ramps, and also the extension of O'Shea Road. I actually lobbied for two lanes, and state Labor changed it to three lanes. I know that's upset a lot of residents, and I can understand why.
       </p>
       <p>
        When it comes to McGregor Road—and Prime Minister Scott Morrison visited McGregor Road—we committed $13 million. That was based on the Cardinia council's estimates for putting in missing on/off-ramps and making it a dual road along McGregor Road. We committed $3.5 million for the state Labor government to deliver this project. Amazingly, even though the council estimated that it would cost $13 million, it's come back with a price tag of $122 million. Unfortunately, the state Labor government will not contribute further funding to that project, or, in fact, any funding. I'm now on a mission to secure extra federal funding, but I must say that it makes it extremely difficult.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's the same with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racecourse_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Racecourse Road
        </a>
        and Bald Hill Road. Again, Cardinia council estimated that the cost would be $70 million. It's now blown out to $210 million. We've already paid the state Labor government $6.5 million. I really hope they come to the table to put extra money into this project. Again, they've committed zero funding. When it comes to Kangan Drive, this time the Casey council estimated the Kangan Drive upgrades—the extra right-hand and left-hand lanes—would be $10 million. Again, it's blown out to $30 million, and Clyde Road has also blown out. We really need the state Labor government to get their costings for road construction in Victoria—
