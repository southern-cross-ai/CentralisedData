        . Will the minister update the House on the government's plan for small business? How will the budget encourage small business to grow and create jobs, particularly in my electorate of Eden-Monaro?

         It is great to get a question from the member for Eden-Monaro—a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
          CEO
         </a>
         of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry; a lifetime dedicated to supporting enterprising men and women through
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCI" rel="nofollow">
          ACCI
         </a>
         ; and now in our nation's parliament. What an example of the kind of commitment to those enterprising men and women he represents. It is a testament to all the people on this side of the House. He brings good advice and he brings insights, and that is why our Jobs and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Business" rel="nofollow">
          Small Business
         </a>
         package has so hit the right spot. It is a game-changer for those enterprising men and women, because the Abbott government listens to, collaborates with and engages the men and women of small business—something that has ensured that our program hits the right spot.
        </p>
        <p>
         For the 12,000 small businesses in the member's electorate, this is a particularly positive budget. It has been received so well. We have seen examples that the member has conveyed to me. Peter Dickson Motors in Queanbeyan has seen a great increase in interest in motor vehicles available through him to support enterprising men and women. We saw John when we went to Googong's Yellow Belly Cafe with the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. Those expansion plans are something that is being energised by this budget commitment. There was the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batemans_Bay" rel="nofollow">
          Batemans Bay
         </a>
         small business forum—what a great occasion that was—where we had dozens and dozens of enterprising men and women share with us their ambitions and what we can do. We do not need encouragement from those opposite; we just need some action.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is pleasing that yesterday the Prime Minister was able to recognise that the Leader of the Opposition had clarified Labor's position. We heard the Leader of the Opposition deride the asset write-off as a giveaway to start a fire sale at a second-hand car yard and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Norman" rel="nofollow">
          Harvey Norman
         </a>
         . That did sound a tad derogatory. We saw the member for Oxley unable to agree with the member for McMahon about the virtue of a small business company tax cut. At least Labor has now landed in the right place. They will do something to support the Small Business and Jobs package, and that will help energise enterprise and encourage those men and women who are going to be creating the jobs of the future, supported by a government that has the policy settings right. That is good news. Now all we need to do is see this legislation for the reduction in the small business company tax rate to take it to the lowest it has been since 1967. All we need is this parliament to pass the instant asset write-off and get it over to the Senate so that, when the Senate reconvenes, one of their early orders of business can be to get these measures passed, so that the confidence and the positivity can be turned into action. We do not need any funny business with committees to ponder the imponderable. Just get behind this measure, just like this government has got behind enterprising small business men and women. Let's see if Labor has got follow-through and not just backswing.
