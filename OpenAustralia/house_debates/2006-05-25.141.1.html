        I understand that behind the scenes considerable pressure is being exerted on government to allow supermarkets to have pharmacies incorporated into their businesses. This pressure should be strongly resisted by all members of this parliament as there are no or extremely minimal benefits for consumers. Of the top eight brands sold in supermarkets, six are cigarettes. The top eight brands are a story in themselves: Coca-Cola, $750 million-plus; Longreach cigarettes, $750 million-plus; Winfield cigarettes, $750 million-plus;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jackson" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Jackson
        </a>
        , up to $750 million; Horizon cigarettes, up to $750 million;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benson_and_Hedges" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        cigarettes, up to $500 million; Huggies disposable nappies, up to $500 million; and Holiday cigarettes, up to $500 million. Pharmacists would argue, rightly I believe, that pharmacies located in supermarkets where cigarettes, tobacco and alcohol are being sold is not sensible, not compatible, and would send exactly the wrong message to the community at large, particularly our young.

        During 2005, the large supermarket chains were giving every indication that they wanted to be involved in pharmacies. Is this a good thing? What are the risks? Will consumers be better off or not? These were questions I put to local pharmacists Paul Drury of Largs North and Nick Tsamaidis of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mawson_Lakes" rel="nofollow">
         Mawson Lakes
        </a>
        in my electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Adelaide" rel="nofollow">
         Port Adelaide
        </a>
        . Paul and Nick argue that up to 70 per cent of drugs dispensed are subsidised by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pharmaceutical_Benefits_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
         Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme
        </a>
        controlled by the Commonwealth government. On these items there can be no price competition whatsoever, because the price is set and the introduction of pharmacies in supermarkets would not change that. There are no cost benefits whatsoever to consumers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pharmacists would also argue—there are more than 5,000 in Australia—that local pharmacies do more than just dispense medicine. They give free advice estimated to be up to 80 million consultations each year. They provide home delivery services, asthma care, baby clinics, wound care and much more. Around 40,000 pharmacists and pharmacy assistants are on hand to help with the medicine needs of the community. Local pharmacies are key assets in every community and they are much too good to lose. Supermarkets already sell around 20 per cent of the products found in pharmacies. Arguments that supermarkets will provide savings appear to be illusory.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I indicated at the beginning of my speech, supermarkets are the biggest sellers of cigarettes. They are also the biggest sellers of alcohol. How appropriate is it then for supermarkets to sell regulated medicines? Pharmacists are bound by a code of ethics, and one of them is a duty of care to patients. How important would that be to supermarkets, especially the big chains? I do not believe governments should be swayed by the large supermarket chains, and I will watch with interest their responses to the challenge and risk of our community pharmacies. In the minute remaining, I have to say that the air in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">

        is just so devoid of moisture it is a health hazard.
