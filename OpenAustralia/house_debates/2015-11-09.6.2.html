           Mr Speaker, this Wednesday, 11 November is
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
            Remembrance Day
           </a>
           and marks the 97th anniversary of the armistice which ended
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
            World War I
           </a>
           . In the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, we pause to commemorate all Australians who have died or suffered in wars and armed conflicts. Clearly, the world has changed beyond recognition since the early decades of the 20th century. With the passage of time, we have seen the last of the survivors of World War I pass on. Ninety-seven years may have passed, but their service has not been forgotten. We as Australians owe it to the men and women who enlisted, who served and who gave their lives fighting for our nation to preserve their memory and to honour their sacrifice—and honour them we do. The exploits of Australian servicemen during the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War" rel="nofollow">
            First World War
           </a>
           have rightfully become part of Australian folklore. In particular, the bravery of the diggers on the shores of Gallipoli came to define the identity of our nation. The Army barracks located in my electorate was renamed
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gallipoli_Barracks" rel="nofollow">
            Gallipoli Barracks
           </a>
           in honour of those who served and died in that conflict. This is just one of many such tributes around the country. I also commend the ongoing work of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
            Australian War Memorial
           </a>
           , under the directorship of Dr Brendan Nelson, in keeping the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZAC" rel="nofollow">
            ANZAC
           </a>
           memory alive.
          </p>
          <p>
           The war weighed heavily on the resources of our young nation. It is fascinating to go back through
           <i>
            Hansard
           </i>
           to read about the extent of preparations for the war effort. For example, on 14 April 1915 the then Prime Minister,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Fisher" rel="nofollow">
            Andrew Fisher
           </a>
           , provided a detailed update to the House on the equipment required to clothe and arm Allied forces across the Commonwealth—the requisitioning of the output of 22 mills to provide the wool for the uniforms; and the supply of two million yards of cloth for jackets and more than one million yards of flannel for shirts and blankets, and the supply of one million pairs of boots. Much of this burden was born by Australia—a nation just 14 years old and home to a population of less than five million people; less than a quarter of what we are today.
          </p>
          <p>
           On 29 April 1915, the Minister for Defence confirmed to parliament for the first time that Australian forces had landed on the Gallipoli peninsula. That minister was Sir George Pearce, a senator from
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Western Australia
           </a>
           and my great-grandfather. On the day of the original armistice, 11 November 1918, he was once again Minister for Defence, albeit under a new prime minister. World War I exacted a terrible human toll on our nation. More than 60,000 men and women lost their lives in the conflict, and a further 156,000 were wounded, gassed or taken prisoner. The death and dislocation caused by the war were so great that the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
            Bureau of Statistics
           </a>
           figures show the population of Australia declined in 1915 and again in 1916—the first and to date only years in post-Federation recorded history that this has occurred. I use the term 'recorded history' advisedly because, at the time, most
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
            Indigenous Australians
           </a>
           were not recorded in census statistics, nor were they permitted the right to vote. Nevertheless, the Australian War Memorial estimates that more than 1,000 Indigenous Australians fought in the First World War. Many more attempted to enlist but were denied on the grounds of race. Those who managed to successfully enlist enjoyed equal pay and generally equal treatment to all solders, a rarity at the time. Sadly, equal treatment was not extended in the postwar period, and it would be five more decades until Indigenous Australians were accorded equal rights under the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Constitution" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Constitution
           </a>
           .
          </p>
          <p>
           Mr Speaker, as the motion notes, in terms of the numbers of deaths and casualties, the First World War remains the most costly conflict in Australian history. I am sure that it is the fervent wish of all Australians that its human toll is never surpassed. History recalls that the world did not fully heed the lessons of the First World War and was doomed to repeat the cycle of destruction a generation later in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
            Second World War
           </a>
           . Even in these relatively more peaceful times, war and conflict remains a fact of life for millions of people worldwide. On this Remembrance Day like all others, we should pause to reflect on the memory of those Australians who have died in wars and armed conflicts. A grateful nation honours their sacrifice, and their legacy is a safer and more peaceful world.
          </p>
          <p>
           Lest we forget.

            I commend the member for Ryan on this motion to recognise
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
             Remembrance Day
            </a>
            . I have represented the opposition at ceremonies in northern France on Remembrance Day. I have stood on the beach at Gallipoli. I have represented Australia in a very junior capacity at the Commonwealth cemetery in Berlin. Both my grandfathers served in the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War" rel="nofollow">
             First World War
            </a>
            . My maternal grandfather, John Peek, served in the 3rd
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_Horse" rel="nofollow">
             Light Horse
            </a>
            and the family are very proud that he was commissioned in the field in 1917. My paternal grandfather, Hauptman (Captain) Bruno Danziger served in the German heavy artillery and won the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Cross" rel="nofollow">
             Iron Cross
            </a>
            . Both served on the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Front" rel="nofollow">
             Western Front
            </a>
            , both were officers and both survived; obviously, otherwise I would not be here. Both of my grandfathers had very different fates. John Peek returned to Australia and was honoured, as we should honour all our veterans. I have to record, sadly, that my paternal grandfather, Bruno, and his wife, Margarethe, were murdered in the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War" rel="nofollow">
             Second World War
            </a>
            in Auschwitz. Nothing compares to standing on the beach at Gallipoli, and when you see those gravestones just by the water's edge it really communicates the sacrifice that Australians made in the pursuit of our national identity.
           </p>
           <p>
            My part of Melbourne was heavily affected by the war. Up from Beaconsfield Parade, we recently remembered the Anzac girls with a wonderful ceremony for the matron there, Matron Grace Wilson. The Lemnos Greek community organised a wonderful ceremony that was part of the Centenary of Anzac commemorations. Australian personnel were shipped from
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Melbourne" rel="nofollow">
             Port Melbourne
            </a>
            . Melbourne was the capital of Australia in those days. A total of 126,753 servicemen, medical chaplains and nurses embarked from Port Melbourne. On 19 October 1914, the first troop ship left from there. You can see those iconic pictures in almost every
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
             RSL
            </a>
            in the country: pictures on the wall of the Anzacs leaving with all the streamers being thrown and big crowds down below. It was also to Port Melbourne that fewer returned. Almost one-third of the 60,000 Australians who died in the war were Victorians.
           </p>
           <p>
            As a little boy I remember my grandfather marching to the

            and then going with him up that scary European-style grill elevator to where we used to have the Christmas party for kids.
           </p>
           <p>
            Representing the opposition, as I said previously, I visited the

             World War I
            </a>
            battlefield at Villers-Bretonneux. I remember walking up the hill and seeing the sandstone wall on which the names of 10,000 Australians who were killed in the First World War and who have no known grave were engraved. I found on that wall the name of my grandmother's brother, David Swan, one of the thousands of Australians butchered in some of the ill-fated military operations, such as the

Most monuments and speakers, including in this House, recall the horrors that war inflicts on soldiers, their families back home and, of course, the civilians caught up in the fighting.

            The terrible situation in some parts of the world today is a reminder that war has lost none of its brutality. But these commemorations of the 97th anniversary of Remembrance Day remind us of the sacrifice that Australians have made for our country, for the freedom of other people's countries and for their comrades in arms. The motion for the recognition of Remembrance Day is a valuable reminder of the debt we owe to those great Australians. It is also a useful occasion for remembering those people who are on active service now in places around the world, and those who have made equal contributions in conflicts in the Second World War, Korea, Malaysia, Vietnam and, more recently, the Gulf.

             after more than four years of continuous warfare. At the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month, Allied nations simultaneously pause to consciously and solemnly remember not only those who lost their lives in

             but all those who have fallen in times of warfare.
            </p>
            <p>
             World War I mobilised more than 70 million people and saw a death toll somewhere in the vicinity of nine to 13 million people. For Australia, such a young nation with such great hopes, the losses were catastrophic. Out of a population of only 4.9 million in 1914, more than 60,000 Australian lives were lost and 156,000 were wounded, gassed or taken as prisoners of war. Consider for a moment the gravity of that loss. Ponder for a mere moment that as many as one-third of the dead have no known grave, that for each one there was a grieving mother who could not consolidate her loss with a physical burial. Almost an entire generation of young Australian men were wiped out in the most costly conflict in our history.

The one soldier who will ever remain unknown is emblematically representative of all fallen soldiers. Across the nation, whether in small community memorial gardens or here in Canberra at the Australian War Memorial, Australians will pause in memory. I and my family will remember in particular my husband's late great-uncle, Private Ernest Marshall Baskerville. He set sail on the

             on 11 December 1915 from Sydney as one of the 1 Infantry Battalion 9 to 12 Reinforcements. I have no doubt that, as he watched the Sydney skyline fade into the distance, his heart was full of pride to fight for his country and his head was full of hope for the safe return of himself and his mates. Sadly, Ernest was injured in September 1917 at the battle of

             . As Ernest's surviving family, we are able to tell his story and honour his sacrifice, knowing where, when and how he died. My heart goes out to those families who are not so fortunate as to know the stories of their loved ones. They do not and may never know where and when and how they fell. This is why Remembrance Day is so important, and why the tomb of the unknown soldier holds such great significance. I have been fortunate enough to visit the final resting place of Ernest. As I paid my respects, I contemplated the wretched heartbreak of so many mothers across the world who lost their sons—some who were mere boys as they marched off so bravely.

             On Remembrance Day I along with many other Australians will wear a red poppy as a symbol of my respect and to honour those who have served and are serving in our armed forces. The iconic red Flanders poppy has long been a symbolic part of Remembrance Day. The red poppy was among the first flowers to bloom following the devastation of the battlefields in northern France and Belgium. Lieutenant Colonel John McRae was at the front line during the Battle of Ypres in May 1915. His best friend, Lieutenant Alexis Helmer, was killed by a German shell on 2 May 1915 and the following day, Lieutenant Colonel John McRae looked out at the fields of blooming red poppies and penned his famous poem,

May we never take for granted the great sacrifices made by those who have gone before us, and by those who are defending and protecting us today and into tomorrow. I urge all Australians to pause at 11 am on 11 November to remember, honour and contemplate the sacrifices and the great loss of life upon which this nation's freedoms and liberties are won.

              approaching on Wednesday this week, I thank the member for Ryan for bringing this motion before the chamber today. It is very timely. The Australian story, quite frankly, is an extraordinary one—one that is filled with significant events that have helped to forge our nation's identity through our achievements and through our experiences. However, in getting to where we are today, tribute must be paid to the many who have played a role in defending our nation; in particular, to those who have made the ultimate sacrifice.

             <p>
              The story of the Anzac legend started with our involvement in the

               First World War

              </a>
              landed on the beach in Gallipoli, and everyone knows the story of how hard fought the battle was. But it was not the battle: it was the courage and integrity of the Australians and New Zealanders that helped forge this spirit. Bear in mind, this was the war that was supposed to end all wars. In fact, it was the most bloody and most destructive conflict that we have ever been engaged in, with over 300,000 soldiers taking part in the conflicts, including 1,000 serving Indigenous members of the military. The war lasted for four years, and saw the wanton destruction of nearly three million lives. When the armistice was signed to end hostilities on the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Front" rel="nofollow">
               Western Front
              </a>
              on 11 November 1918, more than 61,000 Australians had been killed and 156,000 wounded, many of those sustaining permanent incapacities. At the time, Australia had a population less than five million citizens, making the numbers of casualties during the war almost too incredible to believe, in terms of the weight carried by this small and yet emerging nation.
             </p>
             <p>
              On Wednesday, I will join with other members and senators at 11 am at the

              sub-branch, the Canley Heights RSL sub-branch and the Mounties club. These commemorative services are a salient reminder of the sacrifices that have been made by our Australian servicemen who have served our nation and who we owe so much for the lives that we live today. As a nation we must never forget the debt that we owe these Australians and we must never forget the responsibilities we have to their families. For that I commend Legacy on the work that they have done and continue to do today.

               branches across Australia, in communities, institutions, schools and workplaces, let us all join together at 11 o'clock this Wednesday in observing one minute's silence. Although there are no longer any remaining living veterans of the First World War in Australia, we must honour their memory amongst our younger generation and migrants in promoting awareness of the sacrifice that our veterans have made. The significance of their contribution is just as relevant today as it was nearly a century ago. It is seen in our democracy, culture, institutions and values which form the basis of our great Australian society and it has allowed us to enjoy prosperity in peace.
              </p>
              <p>
               The lesson we can learn for our current and future generations of Australians is of greater patriotism, loyalty to our country and service to our nation. We must fight vigorously against the emerging counterculture and anti-establishment elements in our society which seek to undermine our proud national heritage. Referred to as the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_War" rel="nofollow">
                Great War
               </a>
               and the 'war to end all wars', this significant conflict in our national history has contributed to our Australian national identity and the values which we hold dear, including devotion to duty, loyalty to one's mates, personal sacrifice and service to our country.
              </p>
              <p>
               At that time, Australia was a young nation, barely 15 years out of Federation, and the First World War represented our first substantive entry onto the international stage. Patriotic Australians, keen to do their duty for king and country, enlisted in the

               unleashed the horror of modern warfare on an unprecedented scale with the development of small arms and automatic weapons with high, sustained rates of fire, chemical weapons, and artillery with explosive ordnance. Never before in history had such lethal and effective weapons been deployed on the battlefield, inflicting heavy casualties and loss of life. Australian troops were confronted with the sombre reality of entrenched machine gun positions and the appalling stalemate conditions of trench warfare. In these conditions of hardship and deprivation, the Anzac spirit was born out of our troops' support of each other.

               From a population of 4.9 million Australians, 416,809 men enlisted, of which 59,357 were killed between 4 August 1914 and 11 November 1918; 155,133 were wounded and 4,044 were taken prisoner. On average, 38 Australians died each day during the 1,560 days of the war. There were 431,448 hospitalisations. The highest rate of enlistment occurred in my home state of

                Western Australia

               , where 32,231 men enlisted, representing 9.9 per cent of the state's population.

              <p>
               The contribution by women to the war effort must also be recognised. A total of 2,139 women served with the Australian Army Nursing Service, and 130 worked with

               </a>
               . A further 423 nurses served in hospitals within Australia. Twenty-three of these women died in service during the war.

               In the context of a world that is faced with conflict and security concerns, it is important that the Anzac values be maintained and passed down to future generations of young Australians, so that we may meet and overcome the future security challenges that we face as a nation in uncertain times. The nature of war and conflict is evolving from engagement between sovereign nations and states to terrorism and guerrilla-style conflict between organised militias. Just as the diggers were confronted with modern weapons, today we are faced with new security threats in the war on terrorism.

Our community has a long and rich military history; a history of victories and of pain, and a history of which we are proud—particularly in the Seymour area, home to Puckapunyal Army base, which is still being used as a mobilisation and training area, as it has done since before World War I. Seymour is the home of the famous

                in Turkey. It is said that Keith was shot through the neck on the first ridge around 300 yards inland. He was digging trenches for the stretcher bearers leading onto Anzac Beach. Right across the electorate on honour rolls in Kilmore and Lancefield are the names of family members who answered our country's call. On 30 October I had the honour of attending the official unveiling of the Whittlesea township avenue of honour plaque upgrade, rightfully ensuring that these men's and other local diggers' names will never be forgotten.

                shaped our identity as a people and a nation. The Gallipoli campaign in particular has come to exemplify powerful Australian values of mateship, sacrifice, loyalty and pride. As we undertake our commemorations over the next week, I encourage everyone to honour the memory of those who served by looking up into the branches of their family trees and at the stories behind the names on our local honour rolls. Try to find out, if you can, the history of your family's service. Together let us learn the story of the people who fought and who found the courage to do the truly extraordinary.

                Sadly, our Indigenous brothers who fought for Australia found on their return to Australia that, instead of recognition and grace, Aboriginal diggers received ignorance and racism. They were not eligible for returned servicemen's land grants or even membership of the
