        I rise this afternoon to place on the record and pay tribute to those in my community who were recently named as Citizens of the Year at recent local government Australia Day Awards ceremonies in my electorate. These awards are always one of the highlights of the year, as they acknowledge those who work tirelessly to ensure that their community is a great place to live, work and play. Sadly, due to current events, ceremonies were held virtually or with capped numbers.

        I also want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the many other unsung heroes in my community who didn't make any official list but whose work in our community over the past year certainly hasn't gone unnoticed. To those people I say thank you. Our communities are far richer for your tireless and selfless contributions.
