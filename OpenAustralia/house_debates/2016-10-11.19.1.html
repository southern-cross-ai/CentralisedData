       <p>
        On 14 September 2016, I delivered my maiden speech to this House. I spoke of my father's death by suicide some 20 years ago. I had not been adequately prepared for the effect that this story would have. Since the speech thousands of Australians from every background, from every shade of political opinion and from every walk of life have approached me to share their stories of being bereaved by suicide or of their personal struggles with mental illness. It has been humbling to share these very personal stories with other Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        What has also impressed me is hearing about the number of organisations that are trying to improve services for those suffering from mental illnessâ€”from established organisations like Lifeline to emerging organisations like Batyr, which goes into schools to talk to young people to try to remove the stigma associated with mental health issues. Yesterday, I had the privilege of meeting with Professor Patrick McGorry, a board member of headspace, an organisation that provides early intervention mental health services for 12 to 25 year olds, along with assistance in promoting young people's wellbeing.

        Today marks the first national headspace day. Over the past decade more than a quarter of a million young people have sought help and advice from headspace centres. I would like to acknowledge all those who support headspace and in particular I would like to acknowledge the great work on my constituent Elizabeth Goh, who has been an ambassador and senior youth advisory group board member at the Chatswood headspace centre since 2013. A new headspace centre opened in

        in June this year and it is already provided assistance to more than 74 young people. I wish everyone a happy headspace day.
