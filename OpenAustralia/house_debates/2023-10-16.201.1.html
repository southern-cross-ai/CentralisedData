        I rise today to highlight two very important initiatives for the people in my electorate of Dawson. In celebration of Seniors Month, I recently attended two men's sheds meetings. The men's sheds welcome everyone of all ages who want to tinker with handyman projects, play cards or simply enjoy a cuppa and a chat.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first visit was to the Burdekin Men's Shed, for which I want to thank President Bob Ritchie and all the blokes there. These amazing individuals give their time to not only support each other but also support the students of all abilities at the Burdekin school next door. The gents teach them the tricks of the trade to hone their handyman skills and boost their confidence and independence.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second visit took me to the Cungulla Men's Shed, which boasts over 30 members, an impressive number for a small coastal town. The shed hosts all the usual activities and doubles as a community hub. You'll often find the members busy organising special community events, which range from fundraisers to memorial days, such as Anzac Day. This year marks the 30th anniversary for men's sheds. This incredible milestone is testament to the volunteers who have built and continue to drive this movement forward in all of our communities. I've been a supporter of men's sheds for many years, and I will continue to support them for many more to come. Well done, men.
