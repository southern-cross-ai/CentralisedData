       <p>
        I rise in the chamber today to express my genuine concern at the appalling performance of the Beattie Labor government in Queensland. I think it is singularly unfortunate that Queensland currently is saddled with a government which appears not to be able to control any of the issues and does not seem to be able to provide the good government that Queensland expected.
       </p>
       <p>
        As far back as 1989, when the Goss Labor government was elected, it was wise enough to appoint the honourable member for Griffith as chief of staff to the then Premier. I suspect that, had the member for Griffith been the chief of staff to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         Premier of Queensland
        </a>
        today, we would not have a situation where people are not able to receive hospital treatment, where in fact the government appears to be totally out of control.
       </p>
       <p>
        When one looks at the complete lack of leadership at the very front of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
         ALP
        </a>
        , it is clear that the ALP is not prepared to take the necessary steps required to bring themselves before the people as a serious alternative contender for government at the time of the next poll. The member for Griffith is undoubtedly the most able member of the Labor Party frontbench, and I certainly hope that is not a kiss of death.

         <p>
          I thank the minister. If the Labor Party is not prepared to use the talents of the member for Griffith by appointing him Leader of the Opposition then maybe the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Premier_of_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
           Premier of Queensland
          </a>
          might look to repeat the actions of his predecessor, Mr Goss, and seek the advice of the member for Griffith in an attempt to paper over more effectively the cracks of a number of years of ineffective Beattie government in Queensland.
         </p>
         <p>
          We should not forget that
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Health" rel="nofollow">
           Queensland Health
          </a>
          has been plagued by serious problems: long waiting lists, insufficient numbers of doctors, underpaid, disgruntled staff and the list goes on. We even had a situation at the Caboolture hospital where there was a motor vehicle accident just a short distance from the entry of the hospital and yet the hospital, because it did not have an emergency section, was not able to look after the people who were injured and they needed to be carted off to hospital in Brisbane. I think the
          <i>
           Courier-Mail
          </i>
          , no friend of the coalition in Queensland, actually asked: ‘What do you call a health system that can’t cope with a car accident outside a hospital? A sick joke’. That was the very appropriate headline in the
          <i>
           Courier-Mail
          </i>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          Queensland of course is rightly celebrating the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_Origin" rel="nofollow">
           State of Origin
          </a>
          win last night and no doubt the Premier of Queensland joined other Queenslanders in celebrating that happy event. However, the Queensland Labor government under Mr Beattie remain in a serious state of confusion and chaos. They lost the member for Noosa—no real loss—a few days ago when she walked out over the dam decision. The dam decision is a disaster but so is the member for Noosa and I hope that the Liberal candidate,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Elmes" rel="nofollow">
           Glen Elmes
          </a>
          , is successful at the next poll.
