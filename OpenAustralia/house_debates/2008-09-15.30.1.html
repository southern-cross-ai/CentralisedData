        My question is to the Prime Minister. Given the Prime Minister believes that he could not live on the single age pension of $273 per week, how much more does he think that single pensioners need in order to survive?

         The Treasurer, the Deputy Prime Minister and I—and I believe others in response to that question—have been straight up and down about this. We have been clear-cut in our language in saying that there is a massive problem in terms of the ability of age pensioners to live on the current age pension. That is what we believe. We have said that. That is why we have a program of action to deal with it.

               The survey, the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics Survey of 2001-05, which is a period in which those opposite were in a position to do something about this, says that older Australians missed out on the increase in the standard of living in Australia over that period. In fact, it said that their standard of living increased by just 0.7 per cent across that time.
              </p>
              <p>
               The second point I would make is that across that 2001-05 period revenues to the government from personal income taxes grew from $77 billion a year to $112 billion a year.

                  The Household, Income and Labour Dynamics Survey shows that there was a real problem in 2001-05 in terms of the standard of living of older Australians, including pensioners. In that same period the revenues going to the Howard government went through the roof. If you look at what happened with company tax in that period, you will see receipts went up from $31 billion to $49 billion. Despite the fact that the data showed clearly that we had an emerging problem of cost-of-living pressures for pensioners in that period and despite the fact that the public revenue of Australia in their period in office was awash with cash, the opposition did nothing about it. Here is the point for all members of this House to consider: they were the pressures in 2001-05—we have the data—and that is how much money the opposition had to deal with it, but on 11 August last year when, according to the

                   Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order, once again on relevance. There are thousands of seniors waiting to hear this answer.

                    The problem for those opposite is that the past does not exist. It is as if the problem with cost-of-living pressures suddenly emerged on 24 November last year. My question to the member for Bradfield is: what did you do in cabinet 12 months ago when this was put before you and you had money to deal with it? What did you do as—

                      The question is: when could this have been dealt with properly? Those opposite sat there in cabinet—the member for Bradfield; the member for Curtin, she who interjects most robustly, given her deep, longstanding compassion for the poor in this country; the member for Wentworth, given his deep, longstanding compassion for the poor—

                        The member for Aston will resume his seat. When the member for Aston earlier raised a similar point of order on this question I said I would be listening carefully. I simply say that, in the traditions and precedents of this place, the answer that the Prime Minister is giving is relevant. If people have a problem with that then, as I have suggested ad nauseam, there are other ways in which the House might address a perceived problem.

They were all there and prepared to act, but they did nothing. This government is getting on with the business of implementing reform.
