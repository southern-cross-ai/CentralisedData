       <p>
        by leave—I have one or two opinions on what has just happened this afternoon in the chamber, but, in the interests of the communities and people of northern Australia, I won't make any further comment on it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Opening remarks
       </p>
       <p>
        I rise today to make the annual statement on northern Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Acknowledgements
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to begin by acknowledging the traditional custodians of the land we are on today and pay my respects to the Ngunnawal and Ngambri people, their elders past and present.
       </p>
       <p>
        I extend that respect to Aboriginal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        people here today as well as all traditional owners across northern Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also reaffirm the government's commitment to the Uluru Statement from the Heart, and our commitment to deliver on its recommendations in full.
       </p>
       <p>
        I acknowledge the member for Maranoa and the Leader of the Nationals as the former Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Australia
        </a>
        and also Senator Susan McDonald as the shadow minister for northern Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Bipartisan support for the north's development is vital for enduring success. I also want to recognise those members of this place that represent the electorates across northern Australia:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        These members, as well as all the Senators from across three states, represent the people of Northern Australia. Most of these seats cover vast distances and encounter many challenges, and I want to thank each of these representatives for their commitment to their communities and to recognise the ambition we all hold for the great vast north of this nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I would like to acknowledge key partners in developing Northern Australia. Some of them are in the Speaker's Gallery today, and I'm sorry for the delay. These include members of the Northern Australia Indigenous Reference Group led by Chair Colin Saltmere, along with Jerome Cubillo,

        for Developing Northern Australia, Anne Stünzner, Chief Scientist Allan Dale, and General Manager Carla Keith.
       </p>
       <p>
        In this, the seventh annual statement, and my first as minister, I would like to reaffirm this government's commitment to the north. This is a commitment to the people of northern Australia and a commitment to delivering sustainable and resilient growth across the north for decades to come.
       </p>
       <p>
        This government intends to deliver a collaborative agenda for liveable, safe, sustainable and healthy communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        It will empower
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        Australians to be partners and advisors in the development of some of the most significant resource and renewable energy projects Australia has ever seen.
       </p>
       <p>
        The northern Australia agenda presents us with one of the most significant opportunities to increase our national productivity and living standards in decades.
       </p>
       <p>
        It will drive our decarbonised future.
       </p>
       <p>
        It will position Australia as a renewable energy superpower—at the same time as delivering transformative prosperity and opportunity for communities in the north.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is about a just economy where fairness and prosperity go hand in hand.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have a responsibility to improve the lives of those living in our northern communities and to support them to take advantage of tremendous opportunities for nationally significant growth.
       </p>
       <p>
        The people of northern Australia are as remarkable and as resilient as the landscape and environment in which they live. It is a region that also presents significant challenges for policymakers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Among them are vast distances, a dispersed population, thin markets and economies of scale that don't always lend themselves to traditional modelling. Significant and sometimes unique challenges require policy responses that are thoughtful and fit for purpose. Responses that might work well in other regions of Australia will not necessarily be the best fit for the north.
       </p>
       <p>
        While the north might be challenging, it also presents unique opportunities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The north offers a young, diverse and multicultural population, a rich First Nations culture, truly unique world-class visitor experiences, suitable climates for forestry, aquaculture and agriculture, as well as globally significant critical mineral reserves and renewable energy sources to drive the development of Australia's future net-zero economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Working together: First Nations people and the ministerial forum
       </p>
       <p>
        Close collaboration between stakeholders and decision-makers sits at the heart of our government's approach.
       </p>
       <p>
        Northern Australia's First Nations people are key partners in our vision for the north.
       </p>
       <p>
        Their knowledge, built on tens of thousands of years of traditional custodianship, is informing our policies across a range of portfolios. From cultural conservation, land and ecological management, biosecurity surveillance, culturally appropriate health and housing, to community and justice solutions.
       </p>
       <p>
        In July, I joined an official meeting of the Northern Australia Indigenous Reference Group in Mackay, on Yuwibara country. The passion and dedication of its members, and the expertise and experience they bring to contemporary policymaking is deeply impressive and I thank each one of them for their commitment and service. The Northern Australia Indigenous Reference Group ensures our First Nations have a strong voice in the northern Australia policy. And the group is already making a significant contribution. The Indigenous reference group has worked to identify how localised business support, individualised workforce development and connectivity are vital for First Nations businesses and communities to prosper in northern Australia. I look forward to continuing to work with the IRG, and collaborating with my colleague the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">

       </p>
       <p>
        This government is committed to the north, its people and its prosperity. That is why one of my first actions as Minister for Northern Australia was to re-establish the Northern Australia Ministerial Forum. The ministerial forum met for the first time since 2019 at the end of October in Darwin, on Larrakia country
        <i>
         .
        </i>
        The forum brought together my state colleagues—Queensland minister for regional development Glenn Butcher,

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        Minister for Northern Australia and Trade Nicole Manison.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the meeting, my colleagues and I agreed to a range of priorities to diversify and strengthen the north's economy and support our people. These priorities are grouped around the important themes of human capital, enabling infrastructure, and economic development and diversification. It was the first collective meeting of portfolio ministers representing northern jurisdictions since 2019 and I want to thank its members for their positive and collaborative approach.
       </p>
       <p>
        Development of sustainable industries
       </p>
       <p>
        In May, Australians voted for a change of government. A government that is taking real action on climate change. Australia now has legislated targets of 43 per cent emissions reduction by 2030 and net zero by 2050, and northern Australia will play a key role in getting there.
       </p>
       <p>
        Critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt, rare earths, platinum and silicon are the foundation for most, if not all, clean energy technologies such as electric vehicles, batteries and solar panels. Northern Australia's substantial deposits of these critical minerals combined with the incredible global demand for them provides an exceptional opportunity for northern Australia. Those resources will play a crucial role in helping both Australia and the world achieve our net zero commitments.
       </p>
       <p>
        An example of how this government is assisting in developing the new resources economy in the north is in my home state of Western Australia. Our government is investing $250 million into the expansion of the existing Pilgan Plant, at which Pilbara Minerals produces spodumene concentrate—a key raw material for lithium-ion batteries. This support consists of a $125 million loan from each of the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF) and Export Finance Australia. This project is aligned with the government's resolve to develop northern Australia, grow our world-class critical minerals sector, diversify global supply chains, and meet growing demand for batteries, electric vehicles and clean energy technology.
       </p>
       <p>
        Housing and skills development
       </p>
       <p>
        Our nation needs people, skills, and opportunities for people to have rewarding careers. We know that the attraction and retention of skilled workers remains a challenge in the north, as does employing seasonal workforces, particularly for the agricultural, hospitality and tourism sectors.
       </p>
       <p>
        Digital connectivity enables our existing and emerging industries to thrive, and builds resilience to future natural, economic and social disruptions. Our investments into modern, high-quality digital connectivity are addressing the challenges of geography such as remoteness and low-density population. Regions with extractive industries are also highly reliant on fly-in fly-out workforces, and there is a flow-on effect for community livability and access to amenities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Through our new Growing Regions; Precincts and Partnerships; and Priority Community Infrastructure programs our government is working with states and local councils to invest in place based projects that transform regional centres across Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        These are matters that this government is tackling head-on.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our government's Jobs and Skills Summit in September explored ways to address these workforce issues on a national level. One of the most pressing issues raised in the jobs and skills roundtables I hosted was access to suitable and affordable housing. In response, our first budget in October made a substantial investment in northern Australia to help build livability and tackle housing issues. Among the investments was $100 million to Northern Territory homelands and remote housing.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to addressing the issue of housing, we will also place particular importance on social infrastructure that can benefit communities directly. It is all too common that social infrastructure taken for granted in our metropolitan areas and larger regional centres is not available in communities in the north. This is simply not fair. Government support for the north should not be limited to resources and agriculture based proposals, but must look further afield to smaller projects that create social infrastructure for the benefit of the wider community. Ideas for these social infrastructure projects should come from communities in the north themselves and not be imposed on them from Canberra.
       </p>
       <p>
        The NAIF
       </p>
       <p>
        The Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility plays a significant role in supporting the government's regional and northern Australia agendas, including our ambitions on climate, investing in manufacturing and renewables to create more local jobs, and achieving better outcomes for First Nations peoples.
       </p>
       <p>
        The NAIF is financing infrastructure development, with $3.9 billion in loans approved for projects to date, $2.6 billion of which is now contractually committed. These investments are forecast to generate around $29 billion in economic benefit and support more than 14,800 jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am pleased that in our first budget last month this government confirmed an additional $2 billion investment into the NAIF. This will ensure we can continue to grow the pipeline of investment into northern economies and boost local employment opportunities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Budget
       </p>
       <p>
        This government's first budget in October saw many new investments benefiting northern Australia including:
       </p>
       <p>
        In Western Australia:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        In Queensland:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        In the Northern Territory:
       </p>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <ul>
       </ul>
       <p>
        This is just a snapshot of what will be happening in the north.
       </p>
       <p>
        A recurring issue that is raised everywhere I travel in northern Australia is connectivity. There is a significant digital divide in this country and Northern Australia is on the wrong side of it. Inadequate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        and community wireless services are holding back innovation and community connection in the north. To address this, this government has committed $656 million through the Better Connectivity Plan for Regional and Rural Australia package to help make sure people in the north get the same access to digital services as those enjoyed by the big cities in the south.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRCNA" rel="nofollow">
         CRCNA
        </a>
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge the work of the Cooperative Research Centre for Developing Northern Australia. Their core business is with industry-led research and development projects which resolve industry challenges and enable the sustainable economic development of northern Australia. In the five years since the CRCNA was established it has invested in 75 projects and I thank them for the important work they have done and continue to do.
       </p>
       <p>
        In summary
       </p>
       <p>
        Since being sworn in as minister, I have visited and met stakeholders right across the north, and I've been honoured to meet outstanding northern Australians committed to their communities. And to demonstrate its commitment to northern Australia, this government held its first cabinet meeting outside of Canberra in the north, at Gladstone in Queensland in June.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the Minister for Northern Australia, it is my ambition that northern Australians should be able to enjoy opportunities, services and a quality of life as good as, or even better than, anywhere in Australia. Most people in Northern Australia would not swap their lifestyle for the world. But many rightly worry that their communities are being left behind, as much of the prosperity generated in the north is seen to provide a much greater benefit to the big cities and towns in the south.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is our responsibility to ensure that policies are developed and implemented to deliver the north the opportunities and prosperity it deserves, and to support the great ambitions of those pioneers of northern Australia that have long recognised the economic potential of this vast region.
       </p>
       <p>
        Strengthening our north strengthens Australia as a whole.

           I firstly acknowledge the minister and congratulate her on her first ministerial statement on northern Australia.

            Northern Australia
           </a>
           is a remarkable, resilient and dynamic part of our nation. One thing that really stands out is its sheer size. Going along that dividing line between Carnarvon in WA, across the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">

           , Northern Australia is 53 per cent of our landmass yet is home to only five per cent of our people. Despite a small population, the north has always punched well above its weight. In agriculture alone, the numbers speak for themselves. With 12.5 million beef cattle, this region makes up 64 per cent of the national beef herd and 90 per cent of our live cattle exports. It also produces more than 95 per cent of our sugar, 94 per cent of our bananas and 93 per cent of our mangoes. This is a region that deserves investment. It deserves its fair share of infrastructure and deserves every opportunity to grow into the future. Every dollar of funding that goes into northern Australia goes towards building our entire nation.
          </p>
          <p>
           When we reflect on the achievements of the federal coalition government during our time in office, what we did for northern Australia was among the most significant of those. With the change of government, it's worth reflecting on what was achieved, and so, on behalf of the coalition, I want to recognise and express our sincere thanks to the former ministers Keith Pitt,

           , as well as the former assistant minister Michelle Landry and former special envoy Senator Susan McDonald, who all served with distinction and have left a huge legacy in this part of Australia that they should be very proud of. I also want to recognise our partners in this portfolio who contributed so much: the Indigenous Reference Group, the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility and the

           for Developing Northern Australia. Thank you for all of your knowledge and your guidance.
          </p>
          <p>
           In government, the federal coalition made growing northern Australia its priority. We were able to deliver a nation-building future for this vast region that was underpinned by more jobs, new economic opportunities and better essential services. The north was an essential part of our record 10-year $120 billion infrastructure pipeline. The north was at the heart of our national plan to create 450,000 jobs in regional Australia over the next five years. By securing enormous amounts of federal investment, we were capitalising on the north's competitive advantages to grow agriculture, resources, critical minerals, energy, defence, manufacturing and tourism. It's as simple as this: the coalition's plan, vision and track record of delivering for northern Australia were rock-solid, and it was making a real difference.
          </p>
          <p>
           Our government cut taxes for workers and small businesses, making it easier for them to operate. We funded almost $3.5 billion worth of major projects through the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility. We invested in major road upgrades to the

           </a>
           . We established the Cooperative Research Centre for Developing Northern Australia, which is headquartered in Townsville and will plan future investments in the north. We also invested in more accessible rural and remote health services, upgraded defence facilities and created an Indigenous procurement policy, through which $5.3 billion flowed to more than 2,100 Indigenous businesses.
          </p>
          <p>
           During our time in office, the coalition was delivering on our plan to turbocharge the north by unlocking the incredible potential that it offers. This plan for a stronger northern Australia was built on the white paper we released in 2015, with major investments including delivering $2.6 billion to develop the Northern Territory into an industrial energy powerhouse, which included major upgrades at
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Arm" rel="nofollow">

           . Our government had committed $9.3 million to develop master plans to accelerate regions of growth to strengthen the northern Australian economy. These master plans will deliver a 20-year blueprint for economic development, with the first three master plans focusing on: the Beetaloo basin to Katherine to Darwin;
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt_Isa" rel="nofollow">
            Mt Isa
           </a>
           to Townsville; and Broome to Kununurra to Darwin. Building on this strategic framework, the next priority region growth corridor was Cairns to Gladstone.
          </p>
          <p>
           We were growing Australia's food bowl, with $1.7 billion locked-in to expand irrigated agriculture in Central and northern Australia, providing food security not just for Australia but also for our export markets. There was $1.5 billion to transform the Pilbara into a major energy hub. We made commitments of $678 million to seal a further thousand kilometres of the Outback Way, linking Winton in Queensland with Laverton in

           </a>
           . We were rolling out the Our North, Our Future initiative, which included $111.9 million for the Northern Australia Development Program to support business grants.
          </p>
          <p>
           Northern Australia is crucial to the health of our biosecurity, and this was always a priority of our government. We had made more than $1 billion available for biosecurity and export programs in the 2023 budget, and during the election we committed more than $61 million to boost our northern biosecurity frontline. Under the Modern Manufacturing Strategy our government was partnering with 19 manufacturers in the north by providing over $160 million in grants to projects valued at $900 million, which was expected to create thousands of jobs.
          </p>
          <p>
           In terms of boosting regional communications, the coalition had committed $157 million to improve mobile and broadband connectivity in northern Australia, which is in addition to the $380 million delivered under the Mobile Black Spot Program that funded more than 1,200 mobile base stations in regional, rural and remote locations around the nation.
          </p>
          <p>
           The north is rich in resources, and as a coalition we'll always support this sector to reach its potential. We invested over $2.5 billion to support the development of our critical minerals sector through targeted loans, research and development and regional grants to accelerate projects across Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland. We committed to the Beetaloo basin, with over $224 million of investments to secure development of this strategic gas basin in the heart of northern Australia. This project will create jobs, wealth and investment in local communities in the Northern Territory, further supporting our regions. Further to this we continue to develop our offshore gas potential, supporting investments like the Scarborough and Barossa projects, which provide hundreds of secure, long-term jobs for Western Australia, and the Barossa-Darwin

           extension, securing production in Darwin for the next 20 years.
          </p>
          <p>
           We know that securing private investment is essential to securing the future of northern Australia. That's why the coalition established the groundbreaking Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility, or NAIF. By the time we left office the NAIF had supported more than 32 investments, worth almost $3.5 billion, which are expected to generate an economic benefit of $25 billion and create over 13,000 jobs. In January this year our government was pleased to announce an extra $2 billion for the NAIF in response to the strong demand for its investment, taking it to $7 billion. The transformative projects which the NAIF is supporting include: $150 million for the expansion upgrades to Darwin,

           airports; $300 million to expand Darwin Harbour, including a new ship lift facility; and $175 million to Pembroke Resources to develop the Olive Downs Coking Coal Complex, a large steelmaking coalmine in the Bowen basin. There was $50 million to redevelop the

           . It's clear why the NAIF has been an integral part of the coalition's vision for building northern Australia. While we welcome the fact that the government will be keeping the NAIF operating, their introduction of legislation to require the NAIF to take into consideration projects' contributions to meeting Australia's emissions reduction targets is deeply concerning and has the capacity to hold up crucial nation-building projects in the north.
          </p>
          <p>
           In office the coalition was getting on with the job of building the dams and water infrastructure that Australia needs for its future. Indeed, many of these essential projects are located in the north. However, in line with their entire approach to regional Australia, this government has chosen to decimate crucial water infrastructure in the bush by ripping them out of the budget entirely, or just kicking them down the road. Our commitment to the National Water Grid Fund was $8.9 billion because we understand the importance of this resource. That's why the coalition was proud to commit $5.4 billion to Hells Gate Dam in Queensland. This would have generated economic growth across the whole region, opened up new agricultural export opportunities and locked in long-term water security. Instead, the government will scrap it. The coalition was proud to commit $483 million for the Urannah Dam. This too will be scrapped by the government. It's a devastating blow to these communities in Central Queensland. Not content with ripping out dam projects for the north, the government has also decided to tear up the dedicated agriculture visa. Australia is 172,000 workers short from paddock to plate. The ag visa was a reform that the coalition secured not only to give our farmers access to a sustainable workforce; it would also have brought in the next generation of migrant workers to help build regional Australia, particularly in the north. When it comes to a workforce for farmers, the government needs to understand that the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PALM" rel="nofollow">
            PALM
           </a>
           scheme, by itself, isn't going to do the job.
          </p>
          <p>
           In addition to these appalling actions, the government needs to explain to the beef cattle farmers of northern Australia how more they'll pay for Labor's decision to break their election promise and sign up to the Global Methane Pledge. In fact, their budget includes $80.7 million to support voluntary action by farmers to lower methane emissions. This plan doesn't stack up. This plan will force farmers to buy more-expensive food for their cattle, making farming more expensive. The result will be an increase in meat prices, which will push up food bills for families around Australia. Actions like these are neither what the people of northern Australia want nor deserve.
          </p>
          <p>
           The previous coalition government fought hard to deliver the tremendous amount of federal funding into building critical infrastructure in the north. One such initiative was the Building Better Regions Fund, which delivered $256 million into community projects in northern Australia, including $10 million for the Rockhampton Art Gallery, $9.7 million for the redevelopment of the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Flying_Doctor_Service" rel="nofollow">

           , $6 million to upgrade the

            Cable Beach

           foreshore in Broome, and $3.6 million for the Tiwi Islands Welcome Centre. In handing down its October budget, the government scrapped the BBRF. The government's cuts and delays to infrastructure in regional Australia amount to billions of dollars, and northern Australia will feel the impacts of this.

           and Regional Development Plan has been gutted.
          </p>
          <p>
           The coalition committed $800 million to build the Rockhampton Ring Road. Now this Labor government has thrown it into delay and uncertainty. Those opposite need to recognise how important this project is to Central Queensland. Each day, 2,600 trucks pass through Rockhampton during peak traffic times. Local industry leaders have already invested heavily in both equipment and staff in preparation for the project to start early next year. They are outraged by this decision.
          </p>
          <p>
           This approach is in stark contrast to our track record. In the north, it was a coalition government who delivered $1.9 billion for the Roads of Strategic Importance Initiative, committed an extra $678 million for Outback Way and secured $300 million under the Northern Australia Beef Roads Program. It was our government who invested over $10 billion for the Bruce Highway upgrade program, including $397.9 million for the Mackay Ring Road and $184 million for the

           stage 5.
          </p>
          <p>
           To conclude my statement, I want to reaffirm just how proud we as a coalition are on this side of the House about what we achieved in northern Australia during our time in government. All the funding, all the infrastructure, all the projects, all the investment, all the hard work—we put northern Australia front and centre of our efforts to build our nation and secure Australia's future. The 1.3 million Australians who live in this part of the country can be assured that we will hold this government to account for their cuts, their delays and the real consequences that these decisions will have across the north.
