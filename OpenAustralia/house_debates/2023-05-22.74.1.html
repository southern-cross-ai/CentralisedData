         I join with everyone in wishing you a very happy birthday, Member for Kennedy. You are indeed 78 years young!
        </p>
        <p>
         I thank you for your question. But I want to recognise the very close relationship that the member for Kennedy has with places like Garawa, Doomadgee and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mornington_Island" rel="nofollow">
          Mornington Island
         </a>
         . I very much respect that relationship and I am very conscious, as the member for Kennedy has pointed out, of the huge gap in life expectancy, particularly in the communities that he represents. I thank the member for Kennedy for his question. I know that it is very heartfelt.
        </p>
        <p>
         Constitutional recognition through a voice to parliament is all about making a difference on the ground in communities like those in North Queensland. It is about making sure the voices of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         in remote and regional communities are heard and not ignored, and I think that, when you have a look at the Uluru dialogues and the way in which attention was particularly paid to Queensland, that is very obvious. In fact, recognition through a voice is about making sure communities like those in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
          Far North Queensland
         </a>
         , who I know the member for Kennedy cares about, have a say in the policies that impact them and their communities. It is indeed those practical outcomes that the member for Kennedy is very much concerned about.
        </p>
        <p>
         The stark reality is that Indigenous Australians in the remote communities that the member for Kennedy represents experience a shocking and unacceptable gap in life expectancy. Something has to change. More of the same is not good enough. Later this year, all Australians will get a chance to do something about it, and I invite the member for Kennedy to be part of that journey by voting yes for recognition through a voice and giving people like the people in North Queensland a real say.
        </p>

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Can_I" rel="nofollow">
          Can I
         </a>
         finish up by saying that Mayor Andrews and the Yarrabah Council support the Voice, and it is very strong. On the issue of market gardens, I have spoken with the member about this previously, and I look forward to having further conversations with the member for Kennedy about things like market gardens that make a real, practical difference in the lives of
