       <p>
        Today I rise to make comment on some of the ridiculous accusations levelled at the federal Labor government. The remarks have been coming from the former twice-failed leader of the Victorian Liberal Party. Before I outline not only why these are unfounded opinions from a man still fighting for relevance in his own party but also why it is utter hypocrisy, let's have a look at what he said.
       </p>

        The former failed leader of the opposition
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_Guy" rel="nofollow">
         Matthew Guy

        stood in the Victorian parliament to talk about discriminatory policy against Indians accessing visas managed by the federal government. He talked about several incidences of Indian healthcare workers living in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        trying to visit family here—people who have good jobs and property and who have been able to travel to other countries. But what is the actual situation? It's important we have a look.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are genuinely people trying to visit their families in Australia, with many people still seeking opportunities to be reunited with loved ones in the post-COVID era. There are four states in India that have a higher-than-usual refusal rate—this is due to the associated risk ratings implemented by the Australian government. These risk ratings are determined through related overstays of visas, protection visa claims once in Australia, and the 26,000 degrees that have been voided, owing to their credibility, by the Indian government itself. These factors can negatively affect our immigration system or part of our security framework—a framework that has been implemented in a bipartisan manner, or so we would think, to ensure the immigration and national security system remains strong. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Home_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Home Affairs
        </a>
        processes more than two million visitor visas a year. These risk ratings are a way to assist the decisions that need to be made.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to highlight this so-called bipartisan approach, because it is key. Let's have a look at the coalition government's record regarding immigration and the Australian-Indian diaspora. The former coalition government's record with migrant workers, overseas students and, by extension, the Indian diaspora was abysmal. Just look at the state of our migration system after nine years under the coalition: there were a million visa applications in backlog. They couldn't even hit 200,000 visas a year in their nine years of government. If you want to talk about visa application, where was this outrage, Matthew Guy, when you had your own incompetent party at the helm? What we've seen today is the member for Longman let the cat out of the bag in the parliament when he said that they don't want migrants to be able to buy houses and purchase a home. In fact, they want to rehash their 2017 policy. And we've heard it again tonight, where they are blaming immigrants for the housing crisis. It is just factually wrong. If you want to have a look at where this is, it's aimed squarely at the Indian community.
       </p>
       <p>
        You couldn't believe that this is going on in modern Australia, but this is what we've got. This has left members of the Indian diaspora and student migration communities with levels of uncertainty, stress and financial hardship. Despite the fees it takes to gain visas, and the costs that international students take on to get their education—where was the outrage then? Why wasn't he standing up for vulnerable Indian working visa holders who had jobs in Australia? These people had their own means of getting here and were willing to do 14 days of hotel quarantine, but we didn't hear a pip out of the little squeak then. He can make the claim that the government is being racist but it's false. Let me tell you: you don't need to pander to the right wing of your party. If you want to have a look at what racism is, get a mirror. The former state leader of the opposition is using the immigration issue and not engaging with what the government is doing to help those currently affected. It's a ploy just to get cheap political points and to do his best to become relevant again.
       </p>
       <p>
        We've seen time and time again that the Indian community have been used as a fundraising source for the Liberal Party. But don't worry; I'm sure the collection of dregs in the Victorian Liberal Party will be desperate to have him back at the helm again soon. If he had an ounce of sincerity he would be out there working with the community, not trying to make a cheap political point. But I guess that's what you get from a guy who has done dodgy deals on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phillip_Island" rel="nofollow">

        and would rather spend time eating lobsters with mobsters than getting in there and helping the community he's supposed to represent.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are working to get through this nine-year mess we were left with. We're approving around 300,000 visas a year. We're working with our Indian community, having forums about how we can reach out through temples and community leaders to get the current issues addressed and to resolve community concerns. We are working with the Department of Home Affairs and Minister Giles. This will help provide insights and dialogues with the community to get the best outcomes. We shouldn't be doing what those opposite did for nine years—that is, cut and shut out the Indian community. We should be welcoming them here. We know that when the Indian community get here they fight hard for a great future.
