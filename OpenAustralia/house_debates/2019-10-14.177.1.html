        We had three shows in Canning on the weekend. The first was the Mandurah Boat, Caravan, 4WD and Camping Show. It was their inaugural show and was held at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rushton_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Rushton Park
        </a>
        in Mandurah. All the latest boating, caravanning, camping and four-wheel driving products and equipment were on offer and on display for people to see. Many exhibitors were local Mandurah businesses. It was a perfect fit for us; we are the recreational capital of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        . I congratulate the organiser,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Rogers" rel="nofollow">

        , and his team on the show and also on the amazing freestyle motocross demonstration they put on. It was a great place to take the family on the weekend.

        The 2019 Live Lighter Perth Hills Festival, which again was run by the Hills Orchard Improvement Group, attracts up to 8,000 visitors every year and more than 160 exhibiters. This year was their 36th year. Last year, HOIG supplied over 1.2 tonnes of fresh fruit and giveaways. Congratulations to Bruno and Brett DelSimone from HOIG.

        Finally, there was the Waroona Show, organised by the Waroona Agricultural Society. The society has been going since 1925. It's the only show in the Peel region and, according to the
        <i>
         Mandurah Mail
        </i>
        , this year it's the biggest one-day show in Australia. This year the committee tripled the number of farm animals that could be interacted with and added a new look farm shed for children to experience firsthand what life is like on farms. Well done to the team!
