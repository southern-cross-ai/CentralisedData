        Madam Speaker, my question is to the Assistant Minister for Employment. Would the minister update the House on government reforms to ensure that job seekers attend their appointments? Minister, how many appointments are being missed each year?

           <p>
            I will update the House on this very important matter. I regret to inform the House that out of 12.75 million appointments with employment service providers during 2013-14 almost 4.5 million appointments were missed. That is a staggering figure, almost 4.5 million missed appointments by job seekers. That is a failure rate of 35 per cent. What that means is millions of wasted hours for employment service providers. What that means is unnecessary red tape as employment service providers are required to contact job seekers and reschedule appointments. And what that means is hours wasted preparing reports for the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Human_Services" rel="nofollow">
             Department of Human Services
            </a>
            . But what it means for the job seeker is wasted opportunity: missing out on the opportunity to attend a meeting with their employment service provider and get information on where the latest job opportunities might be, on how they can better present to an employer for a job, how they can better get by and improve their job search plan. So it is not only a loss to the taxpayer and a loss to employment service providers but it is also a loss to the job seeker.
           </p>
           <p>
            It is regrettable that so many appointments are being missed by job seekers who simply cannot be bothered turning up. We have had excuses like 'I forgot' or that they could not be bothered or that they did not think it was worthwhile. Just as workers have to turn up at their place of work on time and as required, job seekers have to turn up for appointments on time and as required. If a job seeker is unable to attend an appointment, it does not take long to pick up the phone, to contact their employment service provider and say that they cannot make it and have that appointment rescheduled.
           </p>
           <p>
            As a result of this poor performance in the area of appointments, I have introduced legislation that is going to provide stronger incentives for job seekers to turn up to appointments. Even the members opposite recognise this. When they were in government they introduced legislation that went some small way to improving the situation and rates of attendance and appointments marginally improved. But clearly 4.5 million missed appointments tells us that the current situation cannot continue and that more has to be done, and that is why I have introduced that legislation. I can inform the House that the protections for vulnerable job seekers are retained and the reasonable excuse provisions are retained. We are about helping job seekers into work. I look forward to the members opposite supporting this legislation so we can get more job seekersâ€”
