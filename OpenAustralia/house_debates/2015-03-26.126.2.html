        I rise to pay tribute to Melton South Primary School and its vibrant community of students, teachers and families. Established more than 90 years ago, Melton South Primary School has enjoyed a proud tradition of serving our local community since 1923. On Tuesday, 11 November last year—
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Remembrance Day
        </a>
        —I was invited by Melton South Primary School to address its grade 5 and 6 students and to reflect upon my duties as a federal member of parliament. It was a valuable morning with a lively discussion and some very shrewd questions and insightful comments. I do find sometimes that students can have a way of exposing you to questions and disarming you in a way that the gallery in Canberra sometimes fails to do. It was a great morning. The students were enthusiastic and I really enjoyed my time there.
       </p>
       <p>
        The grade 5 and 6 students were keen to learn more about what it means to be an effective, contributing citizen both locally and in our country at large ahead of their school camp trip to the nation's capital. I hope they found the discussion edifying. For my part, I can say that I certainly relish the opportunity to participate in these sorts of visits. Indeed, visiting schools and meeting students are amongst the most worthwhile and rewarding things one can do as a parliamentarian, whatever your political persuasion. Indeed, when I do visit my local schools and I speak with the principals I say, 'I go there on one condition: I want to speak with students, not just teachers and not just principals.' I always like to spend time with students. And whether they be in the younger years, or the later years, I always find it instructive and inspiring. I also hope I can lend my experience to them as to what it means to represent their constituency. It is a great experience all round.

        I would like also to take this opportunity to acknowledge the principal, Mrs Marilyn Costigan. The relationship between the Melton South Primary School community and I extends back to the time when I was first elected in 2001, as the member for Burke. Back in 2002, I recall addressing a group of Melton south students in the hospitality area of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . More than a decade later, I am pleased that our ongoing association continues. My message to the students remains the same. To the students of Melton South Primary School past and present, and to other students in the electorate of Gorton, I say this to you: with hard work and commitment you can achieve anything to which you set your mind. The sky is your limit. I thank Melton South Primary School again for the invitation, and look forward to seeing its students and paying the school another visit sometime in the near future.
