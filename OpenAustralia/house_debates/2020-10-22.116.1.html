        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSU" rel="nofollow">

        's future. They're concerned about the veracity of the figures that have been published by CSU surrounding deficits, which, to be clear, started last year, well before COVID. They are asking about the long-term staff that are being let go and further rounds of redundancies. They're asking about CSU's reserves and also its financial controls. The public rightfully expects these issues to be dealt with in an open and transparent way. It's taxpayers' money at stake.
       </p>
       <p>
        Like many in the central west and beyond, I've been trying to get answers about these matters. That's why earlier this year I called for an independent external audit to ensure community confidence and government trust in the university's finances. Following my calls, on 5 June 2020, CSU's council passed resolution
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNL" rel="nofollow">
         CNL
        </a>
        143/1, agreeing to a fully independent and external audit into its financial performance. This was commendable. The council also agreed to provide the report to the Australian and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        governments. I was advised the resolution passed with an overwhelming majority. Yet, despite the council's agreement to undertake an independent and external audit, both the vice-chancellor and the council have declined to honour the resolution to provide the report. Simply put, this situation is unsatisfactory and contradicts the express undertakings in the resolution. As of today, the report remains hidden from the communities CSU serves. It's a secret report.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I outlined earlier, many citizens in Calare and beyond are concerned about CSU's financial integrity. I share those concerns, as CSU's chancellor has flagged with me in my office a litany of systemic issues that required investigation, including CSU not being able to account for the number of vehicles in its fleet; time sheets for overtime that had been submitted up to 12 months after work had been purportedly carried out; alleged and/or apparent fraud; and possible referrals to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Independent_Commission_Against_Corruption" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption
        </a>
        of individuals who were not identified to me or my staff.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's important that students, staff and the communities which CSU serves are provided with a full, open and transparent audit, to assure taxpayers and the Australian government about the future of the university. We need to ensure appropriate levels of accountability and governance are in place, especially in the face of further planned redundancies. More than anyone, I want to see CSU thrive and prosper, and that's why I, along with all the country universities, supported the Job-ready Graduates Package. Now is the time for CSU to act. It's time to live up to its commitments by providing the report and giving the communities which CSU serves confidence about its future.
