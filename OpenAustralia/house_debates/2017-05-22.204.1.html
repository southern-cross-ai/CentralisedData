        Madam Deputy Speaker Claydon, I rise in support of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Holdfast_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         City of Holdfast Bay
        </a>
        in my electorate, especially in and around the suburb of Glenelg, which you had the pleasure of visiting with me last Friday. It has made recent requests, together with the local businesses on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jetty_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Jetty Road
        </a>
        , for funding assistance to mark the completion of the tram works along Jetty Road. Jetty Road is recognised as one of South Australia's major shopping and tourist destinations, offering a diverse range of hospitality, retail, restaurants and cafes. I urge my colleagues on both sides if they are in Adelaide to, please, stay down in Glenelg and support the Jetty Road traders and businesses.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jetty Road has undertaken necessary tram-track works. It is completely being changed. This will result in Jetty Road being closed for a couple of weeks. That is not good for the businesses there. It will be followed by a further week in which the intersection of Jetty Road and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Brighton Road
        </a>
        will be blocked. This will have a severe impact on visitors to Jetty Road, affecting traders' profits.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_City" rel="nofollow">
         The City
        </a>
        of Holdfast Bay has been proactive in implementing initiatives to curb the negative impact on traders and other businesses at a considerable expense to the council. These initiatives include promoting that Jetty Road is open for business, even though there are roadworks taking place. We are urging people to go down there and to spend their money there. The shops are still open. They are even waiving their parking fees. I commend them for their good work and support them in applying for funding to plan an event that will generate considerable interestâ€”
