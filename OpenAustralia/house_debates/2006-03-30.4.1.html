        </a>
        amends the Australian Trade Commission Act 1985 by making changes to the governance arrangements of Austrade which will establish an executive management structure with a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        directly accountable to me, and bring the agency under coverage of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_Management" rel="nofollow">
         Financial Management
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability_Act" rel="nofollow">
         Accountability Act
        </a>
        and the Public Service Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        Austrade is responsible for the delivery of valuable assistance to Australian business efforts to export and develop international business. Austrade plays a key role in promoting opportunities to business arising from the government’s trade negotiations, including Australia’s free trade agreements, and administers the Export Market Development Grants scheme, which last year delivered over 3,200 grants valued at $124 million to small and medium exporters.
       </p>
       <p>
        The changes introduced in this bill form part of the implementation of the government’s response to the review of corporate governance of statutory authorities and office holders that was conducted by Mr John Uhrig. The government is reviewing all statutory agencies in the context of the review recommendations, to ensure that we have the most effective accountability and governance structures across the whole of government.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government has assessed Austrade’s existing governance structure against the recommendations and principles of the Uhrig review and identified that the executive management template is more suitable to Austrade’s role as the government’s trade facilitation agency.
       </p>
       <p>
        The changes are of an operational and enabling nature. The amendments do not impact Austrade’s functions, nor Austrade’s delivery of export promotion and facilitation services to Australian business. Austrade will continue to be focused on assisting Australian businesses to enter and develop export markets.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the government I would like to thank the current and previous Austrade boards. I am grateful for their time and expertise. The views and interests of Australian business will continue to inform the government’s trade promotion activities. I will be ensuring that appropriate mechanisms exist to ensure that the best possible assistance is provided to Australian business. I present the explanatory memorandum.
       </p>

        Debate (on motion by
        <b>
         Mr Gavan O’Connor
        </b>
        ) adjourned.
