        This year's Tabulam races will be held on 7 November. Earlier this month it was one of four finalists for the award of Best Community Racing Club in New South Wales. I would like to acknowledge the hard work and dedication of Tabulam Racing Club's executive, president Mike Hynes, treasurer

        and secretary Milton King. Last year the race attracted over 2,000 people, with 500 people choosing to camp there. It has a very long history; it is believed to have started in 1896. After a break, it resumed 66 years ago. On 7 November this year, I encourage everyone to get along. It is always a great day out. Congratulations on being a finalist.

        Eating is something most of us take for granted. Becky and Rodney Holland live in Lismore with their daughter Eleanor. Eleanor was born with her spinal cord protruding out of her back, and it had to be surgically closed. She suffers from Arnold-Chiari, a brain malformation that causes speech, feeding and growth issues, and fluid on her brain. All of this means that she has, until now, been unable to eat. Eleanor has been tube fed for several years, but, now, after overcoming so many challenges in her first five years, she is ready for the final step. She and her family recently told their story on

        and are fundraising to help Eleanor to eat again. She needs an operation, and training which is only available in Adelaide. I wish the whole family all the very best with that.

John won International Benchrest Rimfire Shooting Championships in Brisbane last month and sits 17 points clear of his nearest rival going into the final qualifier. John shoots at the Sporting Shooters' Association range in Grafton. He credits his success to the very competitive competitions on the North Coast. If successful, he will represent us in Portugal next year. Good luck, John.
