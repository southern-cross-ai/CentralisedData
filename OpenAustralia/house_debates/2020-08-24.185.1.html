       <p>
        I rise today to acknowledge and thank the incredible generosity and sense of community we have in the southern suburbs of Adelaide. This was evident yet again in response to my winter appeal. This year my appeal was run a little differently to normal. Many generous community members approached me asking how they could help people in need in our community during these difficult times while still being conscious of social distancing. That is why this year, rather than collecting canned good, I gratefully received supermarket and shopping gift cards. I then distributed these to local emergency relief support organisations who assist people in our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would particularly like to make mention of the following generous donors: Southern Montessori School for raising over $550, South Coast Optometrists for donating two $100 vouchers for eye care services; Mrs Kingsley from

        </a>
        , who donated $700; the Menzel family from Christie Downs, who donated $500;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs_Whitehouse" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , who donated $200; Mr Casey from Woodcroft, who donated $100; and all those others who contributed what they could, which together made up over $2,000. In total, we received $5,000. I also received hand-knitted items from individuals in the community who kept themselves busy as they self-isolated. I would like to thank the residents of Perry Park Nursing Home, in particular, for their hand-knitted items.
       </p>
       <p>
        The gift cards will go to many organisations that help those in need, and I thank them very much for their work.
