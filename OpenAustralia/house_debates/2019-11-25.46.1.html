        It's been a devastating week for many across our region who have experienced the devastating bushfires. Many of these fires are still burning and, sadly, a number of lives have been lost. Many houses have been destroyed and there has been enormous damage to both constructed property and physical property. I visited a number of the people devastated by the local fires in their homes and their businesses. There is no doubt that they'll need a lot of support to recover. The grazing industry, the dairy industry and forestry are all suffering as a result.

        I'm really pleased that the Commonwealth government announced and enacted pretty much immediately the agreement to allow disaster recovery payments, which allow for $1,000 for adults and $400 for eligible children. For those who have lost their income or their business livelihood, or whose workplace has been deemed unsafe or unusable, the Commonwealth government is also providing 13 weeks income support via the disaster recovery allowance.
