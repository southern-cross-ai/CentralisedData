        I had great pleasure a couple of weeks ago to announce that five bridges in the electorate of Lyons had been funded under the Australian government's Bridges Renewal Program.. Nearly $3 million has gone to these projects that will enable local government to make necessary repairs to infrastructure around their communities and provide access and increase productivity in those areas. The

        council were very successful in receiving funding for the Cornwall Road Bridge replacement, $110,000 contributed to a $220,000 project; as well as for the Golden Fleece Rivulet Bridge replacement program, $682,000 out of a $1.36 million project. The

         Derwent Valley Council
        </a>
        has two bridges: the Tyenna Road and the Newbury Road bridges. I was able to visit both those sites with the mayor,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martyn_Evans" rel="nofollow">
         Martyn Evans
        </a>
        , in last couple of weeks. There is $270,000 that is being contributed by the Commonwealth to a $540,000 upgrade of those two bridges. They provide access to working forests there. I acknowledge the contribution also by

        was successful with the Lake River Bridge on the Macquarie Road at Delmont, securing funding to replace a single-lane timber bridge with a two-lane concrete bridge. That is $719,500 to a nearly $1.4 million project.

        . They are one of the three naval cadet groups around the country that are vying to become the best naval cadet group in the country. I just want to pass on my thanks and recognition to Michelle Montgomery, who is the commander of the TS
