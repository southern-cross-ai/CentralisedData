        My question is to the Prime Minister. Why does the Prime Minister constantly change his plans instead of delivering them? Last year it was 'reopening by Christmas' and 'we're at the front of the queue'. In June it was 'vaccine horizons', in early July it was 'a new deal with a four-phase plan', two weeks ago it was a different four-phase plan and last week it was a fast-track vaccination policy 18 months into the pandemic. How many plans will the Prime Minister announce before he delivers one?

        <p>
         The objective of all of our government's efforts, the objective of all the plans that we have put forward has had two objectives: to save lives and to save livelihoods. More than 30,000 lives have been saved as a result of the collective actions of Australians, the actions of governments and the leadership of our government, and a million Australians have got back into work after last year's COVID-19 recession.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Labor Party have put this to us. They have said to us: 'Why do things have to change?'. The Leader of the Opposition may be unaware that COVID-19 is a voracious virus which sets its own rules. What we have done as a country and what we have done as a government is be responsive to ensure that we can address the many challenges that have come from COVID-19 and do so as a federation and in a way that has saved more than 30,000 lives and put a million people back into work. The Leader of the Opposition may be disappointed by those outcomes. He may be.

           Yes, Mr Speaker. There are a series of allegations you cannot make about other members of parliament, and what was just alleged by the Prime Minister should be completely outside debate in this House.

             —all throughout this crisis, as we've brought Australians together and ensured that more than 30,000 lives have been saved and a million Australians have been able to get back into work. That is the product of the efforts of Australians under the policies and under the leadership of this government, working together so closely with the states and territories, through the Federation.

               that requires us all to come together and achieve the 70 per cent and 80 per cent vaccination rates, which we are now approaching with great pace as we've addressed the serious issues we've had to overcome—the issues of supply and other medical advice—that have impacted the vaccination program. We are overcoming that and we have turned the corner. Australia is on the path to living with this virus. We will be on that path and achieving that at the same time as we are ensuring that we have had one of the lowest fatality rates from COVID-19 in the world and one of the most successful economic records through the COVID-19 crisis, including maintaining a
