        I rise to take this opportunity to congratulate the veteran community in Cowper on receiving funding from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Veterans'_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Veterans' Affairs
        </a>
        to improve the health and wellbeing of local veterans.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Cowper we have a significant number of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        veterans, and community groups such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF
        </a>
        Association
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffs_Harbour" rel="nofollow">
         Coffs Harbour
        </a>
        and District Branch and the Veterans Centre Mid
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         North Coast
        </a>
        , who proactively work towards providing assistance, support and social opportunities not only for veterans and their families but also for current ADF and essential services personnel.
       </p>
       <p>
        With the Centenary of Anzac being a significant milestone for our country and the Defence Force in particular, it is fitting that we acknowledge and applaud these two community groups, whose sole focus is to enhance the lives of people who have served their country. The two grants provided by Department of Veterans' Affairs at $9,280 each will assist the Coffs Harbour and District Branch of the RAAF and the veterans centre to run a series of day trips aimed at reducing the social isolation experienced by some veterans after leaving the Defence Force. These trips not only promote friendship and camaraderie but also foster the discussion of experiences which veterans usually keep to themselves. These are very healthy and positive outcomes which would be lacking if these two organisations were not part of our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        In addition to the role these groups have in reducing social isolation, there will be a new veterans drop-in centre, which is getting close to being completed. The centre will be available not only for the veteran community but also for emergency services personnel. The veterans centre's founding partners—the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellinger_River" rel="nofollow">
         Bellinger River
        </a>
        , Coffs Harbour, Dorrigo, Sawtell, Urunga and Woolgoolga
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        sub-branches; the Coffs Harbour and District Branch of the RAAF Association; and the mid-North Coast ex-service young veterans group—have worked tirelessly to get the drop-in centre up and running. It will be a very important and much-needed facility. This centre will be a one-stop place for veterans, their families and current ADF and emergency services personnel not only to receive assistance in their interactions with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVA" rel="nofollow">
         DVA
        </a>
        ; it will also be a place where counselling and support will be offered. Again, there is a significant focus on creating an area where there can be social interaction, where people can share experiences in a non-judgemental and positive manner. I commend these groups on their great work in providing this important new service.
