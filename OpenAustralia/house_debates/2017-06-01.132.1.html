        On 16 May I attended the Revesby Rovers football club committee meeting at Amour Park in Revesby. It is a fantastic club in my electorate with more than 300 players and a history that dates back some 60 years. There have been a number of issues, though, at Amour Park in recent times and it is important these issues are addressed. This year the start of the season was delayed due to issues with the preparation of the field, specifically the inability of the council to get the field ready for the start of the season. That was very disappointing and something that absolutely needs to be addressed. I look forward to working with the club on that and many other issues. I would like to thank Ev Tsoukalas for all her work and advocacy and also the club's president,

        , and for more than 20 years the heritage and historical society has fought the good fight to preserve the history and environment of Oatley. Most recently, the society has worked to ensure the heritage value of Oatley train station is maintained. It has an active plaques program, where historical information about specific locations in Oatley is affixed to different landmarks, which provides a lot of very useful information for residents and visitors about the history of the suburb. Thank you to the president, Julian Sheen, to

        Last Sunday, 28 May, I attended the Mortdale Heights Cricket Club in Revesby to present the Banks Outstanding Sporting Achievement Awards. The club is celebrating its 60th anniversary, and it is always great to visit and to talk with Matt Boland, the president, and the parents there as well. The club has kids from five years of age in their teams right up to senior players. This year, the 10A team won the premiership, which is a fantastic achievement. I would also like to acknowledge Alexia O'Sullivan, who is a very active member of the committee and this year's runner-up in the Banks Volunteer of the Year Awards, which were presented by
