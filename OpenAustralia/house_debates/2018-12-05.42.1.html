       <p>
        I want to speak about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        , which is something that is very close to my heart. On this side, we remain proud of the NDIS and we're determined to make it a success. A future Labor government will strive to ensure that the NDIS and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIA" rel="nofollow">
         NDIA
        </a>
        are properly funded and appropriately staffed. Labor's calculations on its funding were signed off by the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS" rel="nofollow">
         MS
        </a>
        , as well as the poor consistency and lack of support for those who are not able to advocate for themselves. These problems need to be fixed if the NDIS is going to work in the way it was designed. I've seen this not only as a politician but also as a paediatrician. I am inundated now with people coming to see me, people in great need, who need a better functioning NDIS. The fact that those opposite deny there is a problemâ€”
