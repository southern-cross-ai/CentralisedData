       <p>
        On Monday night the member for Dobell launched a vicious attack on a community based volunteer group, Coastal Voice, and its president,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Thomson" rel="nofollow">
         Craig Thomson
        </a>
        . Tonight I would like to correct the record and address the comments made by the ill-informed member for Dobell, who has made only nine speeches in parliament this year. Two of those have been attacks on people outside the parliament. Coastal Voice, the group that the member for Dobell attacked, was founded after a community age care forum on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        . Whilst the member for Dobell was invited, he failed to attend, even though 25 per cent of the people living in Dobell are aged over 55, a fact acknowledged by the member in his first speech in this parliament. Having a member that does not listen to his electorate, the community had to get their message to this government through other means.
       </p>
       <p>
        Coastal Voice was formed after the aged care forum, as it became obvious that there were many issues that governments at all levels needed to address. It was logical for those attending the forum to fight to have these issues addressed, hence Coastal Voice was formed. Invitations to the official launch, which was held last Saturday, were sent to all local, state and federal politicians. The member for Dobell again failed to attend or even reply to the invitation. Apologies were received from the member for Robertson and other representatives.
       </p>
       <p>
        The member for Dobell asserted that Coastal Voice was an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
         ALP
        </a>
        front. That may be the way the Liberal Party acts, but it certainly is not the ALP way. Coastal Voice has members from both sides of politics and from no sides of politics. Members of the ALP are members of Coastal Voice. I would expect that as they are people who are committed to social justice and a better community for everyone. The member for Dobell has made allegations regarding the involvement of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast_Mariners" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast Mariners
        </a>
        . It is my understanding that it was as a result of direct threats by the member for Dobell that the coach of the Mariners withdrew as patron of Coastal Voice, but he and two of the Mariners still attended the launch.

         Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I am loath to do it but there are very substantial allegations being made here about the member for Dobell, suggesting that he made intimidating threats to individuals. I would ask that either a substantive motion be moved or the member stop making these sorts of allegations because they are very serious.

          I thank the minister. In calling the member for Shortland, I would draw her attention to that point and ask her to be aware of how she frames her remarks.

          <p>
           Thank you, Mr Speaker. Perhaps if the member for Dobell spent more time fixing local problems, he may not have a group of locals so concerned that they are not being listened to that they have to form a group to represent the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
            Central Coast
           </a>
           . To set the record straight, the Leader of the Opposition did not launch the group; rather he attended the launch, as he is interested in issues confronting the people of the Central Coast. The group’s website—www.coastalvoice.com.au—reflects the views of the community in a series of forums and everyone is welcome to subscribe and post comments. Coastal Voice will publish the numerous emails and comments sent from the member for Dobell. I encourage the community to visit the website and see how the member’s staff members spend their day working for the taxpayers of the Central Coast: sending nasty, scurrilous emails to a community group staffed by volunteers.
          </p>
          <p>
           The member for Dobell also viciously attacked
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Thomson" rel="nofollow">
            Craig Thomson
           </a>
           in this parliament on Monday night. I can assure the House that Mr Thomson has done nothing except work hard for thousands of
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_Services_Union" rel="nofollow">
            Health Services Union
           </a>
           members and their families. It is an honour to work with Mr Thomson. He is a colleague who is committed to the rights of workers. He is committed to a fair go for locals on various issues such as transport and Medicare. You will not stop Craig Thomson. He will stand up to the member for Dobell and he will stand up for the Central Coast. My advice to the member for Dobell is stop attacking community groups and his constituents and to concentrate on solving the problems that Coastal Voice has identified. This is an arrogant, out of touch, inept government with extreme views and an extreme agenda, and there is no better example of this than the member for Dobell.
