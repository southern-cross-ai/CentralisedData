        My question is to the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. Will the minister confirm whether contractors working or tendering for work on the Curtin Detention Centre during the election campaign with the firm Complete Site Services, or any related subcontractors, were required to agree to a confidentiality clause or agreement?

         This question is the latest instalment from the shadow minister’s campaign that there was some sort of secret plan to expand Curtin. Last week he said that he effectively had a smoking gun, because he found a contract for $2 million worth of fencing at Curtin. He said that it showed that there was a secret plan to expand the Curtin Detention Centre. I was at Curtin the day the shadow minister said that. I said to the centre manager at Curtin, ‘Show me this fence—‘

           I will, Mr Speaker, and it goes to the shadow minister’s claim that there is some sort of conspiracy. I said, ‘Show me this fence,’ and they said, ‘Here it is; it is around the existing accommodation.’ It has no relation to the government’s announcement.

                I rise on a point of order in terms of the provisions for a supplementary question. Such questions have always been allowed, according to House of Representatives practice and Senate practice, indeed, to be asked by the same member. It is a follow-up question to the question they have asked seeking additional information on the basis of the answer that has been given by the minister.

                 In other jurisdictions that is not exactly the case. I was not privy to the elite three members of this House who made the agreement—under 4.2, supplementary questions:

                    I think on this occasion that the difficulty is that the early parts of the original answer by the minister may have allowed this as a follow-up question, and I think that that is what I have to consider at this point in time.

                     Mr Speaker, further to the point of order, it is quite clearly the case that the supplementary question was in fact a supplementary question to the question the Leader of the Opposition asked yesterday, not a supplementary question to the question that the member here has raised.

                      I think that the Minister for Defence would be on very solid ground, except for the preamble to the answer that the minister gave.

                       I completely stand by the Prime Minister’s statements and my statements. The situation remains as the Prime Minister and I have consistently said. The department of immigration undertook contingency planning across a range of options at a range of centres. The situation is completely as the Prime Minister and I have repeated in the House and outside the House consistently since 17 September and before.
