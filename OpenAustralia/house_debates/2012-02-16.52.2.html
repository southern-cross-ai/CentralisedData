        I rise to congratulate the organisers of the Moggill Markets who, on 21 January, celebrated their third anniversary. These markets have developed into an important community event, where growers and producers are able to interact with the local community. Many of my constituents in this part of the Ryan electorate use the Moggill Markets as their primary shopping trip for fresh produce, and I encourage those in the neighbouring suburbs to join us on the first and third Saturdays of each month.
       </p>
       <p>
        After the devastating floods of January 2011, the markets have bounced back well and have settled in to their new home at the Brookfield showgrounds. I pay particular tribute to all of the enthusiastic volunteers who give their time so generously to ensure that the markets run smoothly. All funds generated at these markets are reinvested into the community, and I know many groups, including the Moggill Girl Guides and the Pullenvale School chaplaincy program, have benefited immensely from this event.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the day of their third birthday the markets also celebrated the Year of the Farmer, and many of them, despite a year of enormous challenges, brought wonderful, fresh produce which was appreciated by everyone. The Moggill Markets are a new tradition in Ryan, but I am sure that, with the ongoing support of our residents, they will continue to grow and nourish the local community. Events like these provide wonderful opportunities for everyone and we are fortunate to have several regular markets in Ryan, including Blackwood Street at Mitchelton,
