       <p>
        Recently I attended a very special medal presentation. It was the Graywood Medal presentation to the family of Chief Petty Officer Kane Vandenberg, aged 46. Kane's wife, Margaret, accepted the medal. Their sons, Josh, Hayden and Lachlan, were acknowledged. On the day, Margaret said: 'To receive this medal is such a significant recognition of Kane's 29-year service in the Navy. He would have been very humbled and would have felt undeserving. Kane lived his life according to the Navy values of honour, honesty, courage, integrity and loyalty.' Margaret explained that Kane did his good deeds by stealth, never announcing that he helped so many people in so many different ways. Mrs Vandenberg asked her son Hayden what this meant to him, and he said, 'They aren't given out lightly, and it's a sign of respect for Dad's life.' He added: 'It would be a great idea if this medal was recognised among all personnel. In the end they all make the same sacrifice, and in the end they deserve the same recognition.'

        The Graywood Medal is an association medal. Currently there is no official medal that recognises the service of Australian personnel who are permanently suffering or those who have given their lives.

        â€”but Australia has nothing. The Graywood Medal has been presented to many veterans, widows and family members from the Korean and Vietnam wars. Mrs Vandenberg was grateful that Kane had been chosen as a worthy recipient and said: 'I am hopeful that this presentation will be the beginning of the Graywood Medal's journey to official recognition under the Australian honours and awards.'
