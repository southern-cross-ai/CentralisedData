        I rise today to bring to the attention of the House the passing of Mr Jean Letaille
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        , who passed away recently in Bullecourt, France. Some members who have travelled to France are aware of the activities of Jean and his also deceased wife, Denise, with respect to the Bullecourt Museum, which commemorates the bloody battles that occurred there in 1917 when more than 10,000 Australians were killed or wounded. Jean passed away at the age of 83. He was a man who was dedicated to commemorating what took place at that time in that part of France. He had established in his farmhouse, in the barn, a museum to which, as Minister for Veterans' Affairs, I was very pleased to commit support for its refurbishment. I note that that refurbishment will lead to the reopening of the museum in a few weeks time, somewhere around Anzac Day.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jean was a great Frenchman and a great Australian honours holder. He and his wife dedicated themselves over the last few years to commemorating the Australian involvement in that area, the courage and the sacrifice of those who lost their lives or were wounded at that time so long ago. I honour their memory and I respect their contribution.
