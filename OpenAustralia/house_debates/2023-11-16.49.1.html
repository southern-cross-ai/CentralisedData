        I'm participating again in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youth_Voice" rel="nofollow">
         Youth Voice

        to Parliament campaign, championed by Ash, Gemma and the team at Raise Our Voice.

       <p>
        Today's submission is from Zara Freeman, a 14-year-old constituent from Cunningham. These are her words:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        My name is Zara, I'm 14 years old, and I live in the Cunningham electorate. The issue I'm delivering to you today is how children's Medicare bulk-billing is not being utilised to help families. Currently, the top pages of search engines say that Medicare bulk-billing completely covers
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        visits, paediatrics, dental work and immunisations for children under 16. But, in reality, these services are guilty of not bulk-billing like is claimed. A basic general practitioner's out-of-pocket gap is up to $40â€”$40 more than is claimed and $40 more than it should be.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The federal budget for 2023 intended to address this issue by tripling bulk-billing for children, but this has still not solved the problem. There's a direct demonstration that incentivising does not work to combat children's Medicare costs. Instead, we need to penalise for not doing it. That means that free, equal health care would be available for all children when they need it, not just when the budget allows. Through introducing financial penalties for not bulk-billing children's visits, it means that Medicare is utilised so that struggling families aren't affected by absurd out-of-pocket costs, reducing future financial and health burdens on the current youth.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you to Zara.

          Youth Voice
         </a>
         in Parliament Week, coordinated by Raise Our Voice Australia. I'd like to thank all the wonderful young people of Mackellar who submitted speeches. It was great to hear your thoughts and ideas, and I encourage you to keep speaking up.
        </p>
        <p>
         Today, I'm reading a remarkable speech by Tasman Cowper, who is 11 years old:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Imagine a world where we can harness the power of the earth itself to create clean and renewable energy. That's exactly what we'll be exploring today as we dive into the fascinating world of geothermal energy. Geothermal energy taps into the earth's natural heat beneath our feet. It's a bit like using the earth as a giant battery, and it's clean and renewable. Australia has immense geothermal potential, with hot rocks hidden deep underground. By investing in geothermal energy we can reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and cut greenhouse gas emissions.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         This isn't just about saving the environment; it's also about creating jobs and securing our future. Geothermal power plants require engineers, scientists and technicians to build and maintain them. This means jobs for Australians, especially in rural areas where these resources are abundant. Imagine a future where Australia leads the way in clean energy, where our air is clean and our climate is stable. It's a future I dream of. Let's take this step towards a cleaner, greener, Australia together.
