        On Sunday 27 April, I attended a special church service at John XX

        . The service was led by Archbishop Philip Wilson with the support of parish priest Father Peter Milburn and several other priests from neighbouring parishes. For the John XXIII Catholic parish it was an extra special occasion with the person whom the parish was named in honour of being made a saint. John XXIII is a relatively new church having been officially opened in 1975.

        The double canonisation mass was celebrated by Pope Francis and co-celebrated by

        at the Vatican on the same day, 27 April, in Rome. People from around the world converged on St Peter's Square to witness the historic double canonisation ceremony. It was also the first time that a current Pope and a former Pope co-celebrated mass. Pope Francis's decision to canonise two of the 20th century's greatest spiritual leaders could be described as a delicate balancing act, giving both the conservative and progressive wings of the Catholic Church a new saint.

       <p>
        John Paul II became an icon to the conservative Catholics, while

         Pope John XXIII
        </a>
        developed a reformist reputation, overhauling archaic beliefs and promoting peace and unity in more up-to-date thinking. Regardless of one's personal views about Christianity, the Catholic Church or sainthood, there can be no denying that both by

        and Pope John XXIII were extraordinary men who overcame great adversity and rose to head the world's singularly largest religious organisation. Having risen to a leadership position, they both went on to vindicate their selection as heads of the world's Catholic community. Both men served as Pope in the 20th century. John Paul II served from 16 October 1978 until 2 April 2005, and Pope John XXIII served from 28 October 1958 until 3 June 1963. Their backgrounds were, however, very different as was their individual achievements when in office.

        Å‚a, on 18 May 1920 in Wadowice, Poland, died on 2 April 2005. He was the youngest of three children. By the age of 21, his mother, father and siblings had all died and in the year following his father's death he made the decision to study for priesthood. He is perhaps best remembered as a charismatic, globetrotting conservative Catholic who clamped down on leftist movements within the church.

        Pope John XXIII, born

        on 25 November 1881 in Sotto il Monte, Italy, died 3 June 1963. He was a fourth child and the eldest son in the family of 14 and his upbringing was filled with the religious teachings of his family and parish. Elected as Pope at the age of 76, John XXIII is best remembered as a peacemaker who not only saved thousands of Jews when he was a Vatican envoy in Turkey during
