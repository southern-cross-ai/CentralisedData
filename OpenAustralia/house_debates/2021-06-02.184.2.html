        I want to talk about the Morrison government continuing to deliver for the people of Chisholm. Recently, I had the pleasure of ensuring that hardworking community oriented organisations received funding under the Stronger Communities grants program. Eleven organisations in Chisholm were awarded fundingâ€”organisations like the Monash Men's Shed, which under the experienced hand of its president, Greg Male, does marvellous work in the Monash area and will continue its capacity with this funding. The Blackburn Cycling Club and Mount Waverley Bowling Club were also among the grant recipients. With this money, I know they will contribute enormously to the people of Chisholm. I understand the clubs' presidents, Barry Woods and Barrie Epstein, are thrilled to receive these sorely needed grants. With this funding received under the Morrison government, they can build and develop their organisations, becoming even more effective in strengthening the community around them. I'm immensely pleased to see nearly $150,000 delivered to Chisholm through this program under the guiding hand of the Morrison government. It is fantastic that our government can support the hardworking volunteers of these organisations. It is important to see how they help people in Chisholm to get involved. This is exactly what I want to do: bring people together.
