         I thank the member for Warringah for his question. As I outlined to him yesterday, in fact 102 houses have been built since the last election. Of course, those opposite do not want to hear that because when you compare the number of houses that were built by the Liberal government—

           As I was saying, the reason they do not want to hear that 102 houses have been built since the last election is that, when they were last in government, in 2004-05 there were 94 houses built and in 2005-06 only 51 houses were built. These are the relevant comparisons for how many houses were built over a similar period of time. But the member for Warringah asked me what some of this money has been spent on so far, and it gives me the opportunity to outline what some of the money has been spent on. I will first go to the important scoping works—

            Plainly, those opposite have never been involved in building a house and thinking about what the scoping works are that have to be done before any house is built in any part of Australia. Has the shadow minister ever been responsible for building a house? Plainly not, because some of the money that has been provided so far has gone to make sure that we assess the state of houses that currently exist so that we know what level of refurbishment is needed. The availability of serviced blocks has had to be pursued so we can make sure that blocks are ready for houses to be built on. The training needs of the local community have been pursued so that local people can get construction jobs.

             I hear those opposite laughing about this—plainly, they have never taken any responsibility for making sure that local Aboriginal people have the chance to get a job as these houses get built.
            </p>
            <p>
             There has been the design work; design, of course, is a necessary part of scoping work that is done before a house is built. All of this is a necessary part of the work that happens before any house is built in any part of Australia. All of this is vital work that is done properly at the start of a program to make sure that we avoid problems down the track.
            </p>
            <p>
             I might also let those opposite know that some of this money has also been spent on the upgrades of power infrastructure. Of course, not only do those opposite think it is not necessary to do any design work or any other scoping work but, plainly, they do not think it is necessary to make sure that we have the power supplies available for these houses to be built in these remote parts of Australia.
            </p>
            <p>
             This is where that money has gone. I have, of course, indicated to those opposite before this question was asked that I have had very serious concerns about the delays in the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
              Northern Territory
             </a>
             . That is why the Commonwealth has decided to take the unusual step of putting Commonwealth officers into this program. We will put Commonwealth officers into this program on a permanent basis. They will also be part of the alliance process to make sure the 750 houses that will be built are built on time and on budget.
