        My question is to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. Can the minister confirm that the Inspector of Transport Security only works part time? Can the minister confirm that, despite the government’s undertaking in May 2005 to support the role of the Inspector of Transport Security with legislation, no such legislation has been introduced? Can the minister confirm that 100 per cent of checked baggage on international flights out of Australia is not X-rayed? Minister, when is the government going to get serious about transport security?

         It is obvious to everybody that the Inspector of Transport Security is a part-time position. He will be called in to undertake particular responsibilities as required. He is not, as the Leader of the Opposition and sometimes the member for Brisbane have tried to pretend, some kind of ‘el supremo’ who is in charge of all airport security in Australia. That is the job of the Office of Transport Security. It has several hundred staff, supported by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">
          AFP
         </a>
         , Customs, Quarantine, security authorities and, of course, the various employees of the particular airport. It is not his role to take on some particular oversight of all of the transport security arrangements in Australia. His task is to undertake specific inquiries on a no-blame basis into issues for which he has been commissioned by the government, and he is currently undertaking an inquiry into surface transport. That work is being done in cooperation with the state authorities and others who have a particular responsibility in that area.
        </p>
        <p>
         Let me also add that the legislation to underpin his work is a priority. We have needed to secure the support of the Australian states in order to agree on appropriate powers for the Inspector of Transport Security. So, if the Leader of the Opposition is interested in progressing this legislation, he might like to do what he can to encourage the Labor states to agree on an appropriate course of action and arrangements in relation to the Inspector of Transport Security. We are seeking to work constructively with the states. The states have been helping the inspector in relation to his current inquiry, and I think it will deliver good results for all the people of Australia.
