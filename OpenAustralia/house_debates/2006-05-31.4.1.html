                       If you want to be in here all day, we can do that—on the basis that you have ruled her in breach of standing orders 89 and 90. I do point out, Mr Speaker, that, while clearly the member for Lalor was in breach of standing orders 89 and 90, the member for Lalor used precisely the same words in withdrawing as the Leader of the House did in parliament last Thursday. In fact, Mr Speaker, you ruled yesterday on page 5 of

                                  Given the withdrawals by the Leader of the House, the motion was a valid motion. I also note that the House endorsed the ruling by the Deputy Speaker to this effect, by negativing the motion of dissent from that ruling.

There is nothing further to add. I will look at what the member for Grayndler said and consider a response as is appropriate.

                                         I did. Currently, the ombudsman’s power is limited in relation to investigation and mediation of disputes. He receives and investigates complaints but only has formal jurisdiction to resolve them in respect of disputes with funds. This frustrates consumers, who have no clear alternative path of redress.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         The private health sector is a partnership between health funds and health care providers, including hospitals, doctors and ancillary service providers. It is not appropriate to impose close scrutiny on one part of the sector—namely, the funds—while not applying the same rigor consistently to the providers of services for which the funds pay benefits to their members.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         This bill therefore aims to ensure that the ombudsman will be able to effectively represent consumer interests arising from all aspects of their privately insured experience. Currently, the ombudsman’s powers centre on complaints and investigations relating to the activities of health funds. The bill expands the responsibilities of the ombudsman to include receiving complaints by, and in relation to, health care providers and health insurance brokers. This effectively imposes the same obligations on all parties involved in a privately insured episode, instead of placing accountability solely on health funds.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         The ombudsman will not intervene in matters of clinical care: that remains—and must remain—the province of registration boards and state health care complaints commissioners.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         The bill also expands the types of documents of which the ombudsman can require production, such as health fund, health care provider and broker records.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         The ombudsman will have a power to compel parties to a dispute to undertake mediation where he deems it appropriate. This may include deadlocks in contract disputes between health funds and providers.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         The ombudsman can currently make recommendations about the practices and procedures of health funds. This bill expands this power to the practices and procedures of health care providers and brokers.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                         Penalties will be included for parties, other than consumers, who fail to comply with matters relating to providing records, participating in mediation and reporting to the ombudsman. These penalties are in line with the penalties that currently exist in the National Health Act 1953 and will provide support to the ombudsman in relation to complaints and investigations. Furthermore, the bill ensures that the ombudsman and the staff of his office are protected from civil and personal liability as a result of their proper exercising of the increased powers.
