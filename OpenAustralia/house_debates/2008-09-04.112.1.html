       <p>
        I rise today to talk about a recent visit to my electorate of Franklin by my colleague the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’s Services. The member for Maribyrnong visited southern Tasmania early last month and accompanied me to Oakdale Services Tasmania in the suburb of Mornington. Oakdale Services Tasmania has been operating since 1970, but it has its origins in a family based, state-wide organisation established in the 1950s. Oakdale delivers services to people with a disability in the greater Hobart area. Currently, it employs nearly 100 staff, providing both residential support for clients and day support services. The services provided by Oakdale include hostel style accommodation, independent living units, acquired brain injury accommodation, community access, as well as a community living program, youth services and an ageing-in-place program. The ageing-in-place program was originally set up as part of a national pilot project in June 2003. It supports seven people with an intellectual disability who are ageing, so that they can remain within their home at Oakdale Lodge with their friends and their support network.
       </p>
       <p>
        The member for Maribyrnong visited Oakdale with me in December last year. He got talking with one of the local residents and discovered a shared love for the great game of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aussie_Rules" rel="nofollow">
         Aussie Rules
        </a>
        . We were invited by a local resident, Lindsay Appledorf, to visit his unit, and it was here that it became apparent that Lindsay was a very passionate

        supporter and, more particularly, a Carlton supporter. The generous member for Maribyrnong offered to talk to his contacts to get Lindsay some AFL memorabilia—and then one thing led to another and it quickly became clear that AFL was a shared passion amongst many of the residents at Oakdale. The result of the conversation was that the member for Maribyrnong contacted all the AFL clubs around the country and put together a range of memorabilia for all of Oakdale’s footy fans.
       </p>
       <p>
        So on a chilly Monday morning in Hobart, the member arrived at Oakdale with me to make good on his promise. He presented a variety of memorabilia, including two signed Hawthorn posters, a framed
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_Lions" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        poster, signed jumpers, footballs and caps—and of course some Carlton gear for his great friend Lindsay. I was delighted to be part of the visit to Oakdale and to see the smiles on the residents’ faces when they received their gifts. It was truly inspiring. The residents were so keen that we spent quite some time fitting the signed team jerseys, scarves and hats on the local residents.
       </p>
       <p>
        When the residents received their gifts at that packed morning tea they also presented a gift of their own to the parliamentary secretary—a handmade autographed card and some of their artwork. The artwork is now on display in the parliamentary secretary’s office in this building. It was clear that a great love of AFL was a universal thing amongst the supporters. It showed that sport can and does bring together people from all walks of life.
       </p>
       <p>
        I wish to place on the record my appreciation to all those AFL clubs the member for Maribyrnong contacted. They were all really happy to get on board and provide all the supporters memorabilia for the Oakdale team. I am sure those clubs appreciate the support of all their fans, and they are obviously keen to foster even more interest in the great game of AFL. As members of the House would know, many Tasmanians are loyal AFL supporters. Many great champions from Tasmania have played in the AFL, such as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Hudson" rel="nofollow">

        , from the

         Hawthorn Football Club
        </a>
        , of which I am a member.
       </p>
       <p>
        Later that day we also co-hosted, with Senator Catryna Bilyk, a forum for disability service providers in southern Tasmania. This was an opportunity for providers to speak firsthand with the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’s Services and to raise their ideas, issues and concerns. The attendees appreciated this opportunity and the parliamentary secretary was able to update the group on the government’s policy plans for the sector.
       </p>
       <p>
        This was the member for Maribyrnong’s third visit to southern Tasmania since taking up his new role. This shows that the government is serious about listening to local stakeholders and people with disabilities about the issues they face and serious about giving people direct access to government decision makers. It also shows that the government is serious about ensuring that Australians with disabilities are treated as equal and active citizens in our local communities.
