       <p>
        As we fast approach Christmas and the end of the school year, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the schools, students and teachers in my electorate. I have found that each year their interest in and their knowledge of politics and parliament continue to grow. This year it reached record levels in Calare. In fact, 72 schools have made the trip to Canberra to visit
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        and me, a total of well over 2,000 this year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, obviously, we are not always here each time the schools come, but, when they have come and we have not been here, we have made a conscious effort to go and see the studentsâ€”our young students, our next generation of senior Australians. The students continue to surprise me with their knowledge of the political system, and I must dip my hat to our teachers in Calare, who I believe set them up with some of the most difficult questions I have ever come across in my political career.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is great to learn how the young minds of our children operate. I will admit that, at times, they ask questions which are impossible to answer. But, I guess, not being constrained by those things which worry those of us who are adults, they get away with those questions, and I must admit I thoroughly enjoy the chance to meet with them and to be taught by them.
