        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to her unequivocal statement on Sunday, reiterated by Labor backbenchers today:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Every cent raised from pricing carbon will go to assisting households …
       </p>
       <p>
        How can the Prime Minister be trusted when the government entered into an agreement in December last year that requires the government to give a reported 10 per cent of any carbon tax raised to a

         The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has asked me how money raised from carbon pricing will be used. I refer her to what I said at the press conference last Thursday. When I announced the carbon pricing mechanism I said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Every cent raised from pricing carbon will go to assisting households, helping businesses manage the transition and funding climate change programs. And the government will always support those who are in need of assistance with cost of living pressures.
        </p>
        <p>
         That is where the money will go. When I was on the
         <i>
          Today
         </i>
         show on Sunday I said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … I do want to be clear. Every cent raised from pricing carbon will go to assisting households, to helping businesses transition, and to programs to tackle climate change. But the highest priority will be assisting households.

            say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition more broadly, I have very little idea of what she is on about but I am not on my own there. Whenever you meet one of the Liberal backbenchers in the corridors, they are very keen to offer an assessment about not knowing what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is on about

             <p>
              If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition has any real interest in assistance for Australian households than let me advise her of this: if she is really interested in assistance for Australian households, she will be supporting the government. Today, in a press conference shortly before question time, when her leader was asked about household assistance he said:
             </p>
             <p class="italic">
              It sort of defeats the purpose of making everything more expensive and it creates this giant money-go-round.
             </p>
             <p>
              Of the Leader of the Opposition’s utterances today, what we do understand is that he thinks that a carbon tax is the simplest way to price carbon and he is opposed to household compensation. That is what he said today. If the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is genuinely interested in household compensation, she will be endorsing the government’s position.
             </p>
             <p>
              On the question of foreign aid, what I can say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is that the government will make its own decisions. You will get yours from
