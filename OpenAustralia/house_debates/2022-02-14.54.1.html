        Luckily for us George Town locals, Dr Mooney has instilled his love for his community and rural medicine in his daughter Dr Caroline Mooney, who is now a principal in the practice, which he describes as a highlight of his 40-year career:

        For me personally, being able to provide a service for the community for this amount of time and raise my family here to the extent that one of my daughters is now a doctor and a partner in the practice, that's very gratifying.

       <p>
        Dr Mooney, you are beloved by so many in our local community, and from the bottom of my heart I want to say thank you. I'm personally thrilled to hear that you have no intention of retiring soon.
