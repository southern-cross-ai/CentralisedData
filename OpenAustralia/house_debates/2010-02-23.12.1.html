        My question is to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. As the minister has now twice admitted that he was made aware of the Minter Ellison report during discussions with his department, will he finally inform the House of when he was first informed about the existence of the report? Why did he not ask for a copy?

         I thank the honourable member for his question, and I refer again to the answers previously given by me in this place and also to an acknowledgement of the awareness of risks identified in the Minter Ellison report and in other inquiries undertaken by the department and consultations and discussions with them prior to the delivery of the Home Insulation Program on 1 July of last year. I go on to say, Mr Speaker—through you—that the specific response on my part to any risks that were identified by the department and brought forward to me resulted in my actions in relation to establishing not only a national—

          Mr Speaker, on a point of order on relevance: the minister has been asked on four occasions a specific question not about his responses but about the Minter Ellison report. Since it is clearly obvious that he will not answer the question, you should sit him down.

            Thank you, Mr Speaker. In particular, I acknowledge that, from a whole range of advices through the department to me, I was in a position to be able to bring forward and assess clearly the risks that had been identified and put mechanisms in place to deal with managing those risks. That includes the Installer Provider Register, that includes the audit and compliance scheme, that includes referencing Australian standards in the

            and it includes convening regular industry consultative roundtables in order to monitor the program’s rollout. The fact is that it was the department’s role to bring me forward advice on the basis of risks identified in their consideration, and on that basis it was for me to consider that advice and put in place a—
