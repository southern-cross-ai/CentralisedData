        Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Refurbishment of staff apartments—Australian Embassy complex, Tokyo, Japan.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade proposes to refurbish 43 staff apartments at the Australian Embassy complex in Tokyo, Japan. The Australian government built the existing embassy complex and has occupied it since 1990. The complex comprises the chancellery, apartments and recreational facilities. The proposal is to undertake internal refurbishment of all 43 staff apartments. The works will include upgrading building services and will ensure compliance with current standards and building codes and enhanced amenity for tenants, as well as protecting the government’s long-term commercial investment and rental value in the property.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government owns the embassy complex, which was valued at $315 million in 2007. The estimated cost of the proposal is $22 million. In its report the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to commence in early 2009, with completion in 2010. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support. I commend the motion to the House.

The works now proposed are required to overcome the limitations of current facilities to provide effective training to Navy officers and sailors to support Navy’s capability. The progression of the project will aid in the Navy’s recruitment and retention. The main components of the project include new and refurbished living-in, office and classroom accommodation and upgraded engineering services. The project will also provide modernised training and physical fitness facilities to support Navy training requirements at HMAS Creswell.

       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Defence proposes the relocation of Land Engineering Agency test services from defence site Maribyrnong to Monegeetta proving ground, Victoria. The objective of this proposal is to gain advantages from the co-location of Land Engineering Agency Test Services with its existing operations at Monegeetta. The proposed project involves a mixture of refurbished and new facilities, including supporting infrastructure. The estimated outturn cost of the proposal is $35.9 million, plus GST. In its report the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction could commence in late 2008, with completion in 2010. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support. I commend the motion to the House.
