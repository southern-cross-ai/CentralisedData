        I am pleased to rise in the chamber today to applaud a wonderful new cooperative ecumenical school,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_College" rel="nofollow">
         Unity College
        </a>
        at Caloundra, which was opened recently by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/His_Grace" rel="nofollow">

        the Catholic Archbishop of Brisbane,

         John Bathersby
        </a>
        , and the moderator of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniting_Church" rel="nofollow">
         Uniting Church
        </a>
        . It is a joint Catholic-Uniting Church school. The buildings are owned by the Catholic system but there is a cooperative arrangement with the Uniting Church, and I think this is a very positive initiative. The Australian government has given close to $4 million towards the establishment of Unity College, which was used for capital works. The money comes from the Australian government’s capital grants program for schools.
       </p>
       <p>
        The funds will go towards the construction of 16 general learning centres, learning support areas, two computer laboratories, pupil amenities, pedestrian travel, a physical education covered area and music, science, home economics and art rooms. The project also includes conversion works to provide an administration area and library as well as external services, site works and new furniture. The funding forms part of a $6.5 million project to further develop the school.
       </p>
       <p>
        I went to Unity College and I met Rudi Goosem, the principal, and I have to say that I am particularly pleased with the approach that Mr Goosem brings to Unity College and the vision he has for the future. I would like to commend the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Catholic" rel="nofollow">
         Roman Catholic
        </a>
        and Uniting Church communities at Caloundra for working together in this cooperative way to make sure that a wonderful new school that will provide for both primary and secondary education is established within the electorate of Fisher on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunshine_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Sunshine Coast
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I often think the Australian government does not get adequate recognition for the money that it spends on schools and schoolchildren. We must always remember, of course, that Australia’s schoolchildren are the future of this nation, and the funding to Unity College confirms the government’s continued commitment to a strong and effective school system, maximising the opportunities for young Australians. Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, you would be well aware that the Australian government will provide an estimated $33 billion in direct funding to schools and school students over the period 2005 to 2008. A key element of this funding package is some $2.7 billion for school capital works and infrastructure projects over the next four years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Just for the record, I would like to point out that Unity College commenced operation in January this year with 135 students. It is part of an increasingly regular form of setting up a school insofar as it is a prep to year 12 school. As I said, it is owned and operated by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_Catholic_Education" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane Catholic Education
        </a>
        in partnership with the Uniting Church parish of Caloundra. The enrolment has grown to 161 students, with 30 staff, catering to preschool to year 4 and year 8. Each year, as time goes on, new classes will come on line and Unity College will meet a very real need for additional education in one of the fastest growing areas of Australia. The Sunshine Coast, we anticipate, will approximately double in population over the next 10 to 15 years. One of the challenges we have as a community is to ensure that infrastructure keeps up with our rapidly growing population. The fact that the Australian government have given $4 million for new buildings at Unity College is an indication that the government are determined to assist Sunshine Coast school children, as indeed we do with respect to schools in other parts of the state and Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also should record that the Australian government contributed $41,920 under the Investing in Our Schools program to cover the entire cost for the installation of a shed for the storage of playground maintenance equipment and the purchase of a ride-on mower, whipper-snipper and other maintenance equipment. This is a wonderful program which picks up needs in school communities, in particular with government schools which state governments have failed to adequately fund. The Australian government’s Investing in Our Schools program is enormously popular with both government and non-government schools, because we have been able to carry out essential maintenance and improvements which are required and would not otherwise be able to be afforded by the school community. I commend Unity College and wish it every success in the future.
