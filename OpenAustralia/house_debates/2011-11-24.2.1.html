       <p>
        Today marks my 1,382nd day as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_House_of_Representatives" rel="nofollow">
         Speaker of the House of Representatives
        </a>
        . I have at all times tried to uphold the fine traditions of Speaker, and to the best of my ability have attempted to carry out my duties in the most independent and non-partisan manner possible.
       </p>
       <p>
        As members are aware in this the 43rd parliament, to further avoid controversial party political matters I have divorced myself from involvement with the federal parliamentary Labor Party. In this era of minority government I have progressively become frustrated at this stricture. My desire is to be able to participate in policy and parliamentary debate, and this would be incompatible with continuing in the role of Speaker.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a consequence, when I vacate the chair at the end of this short statement, I will visit the Governor-General to tender my resignation as Speaker of the House of Representatives.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank all members for their cooperation, which they have dispensed to varying degrees depending upon the individual.
       </p>
       <p>
        I thank everyone who works for the Department of the House of Representatives under the capable leadership of the Clerk,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Wright" rel="nofollow">
         Bernard Wright
        </a>
        , and Deputy David Elder. They serve us well. My gratitude goes to the diverse range of officers of the Department of Parliamentary Services: from gardeners to guards, technicians and tradies, researchers to reporters, Hansard. They serve us well. To Presidents Hogg and Ferguson, with whom I served as co-presiding officer, and the members and officers of the other place with whom I had interaction, I thank them for their forbearance. All these people ensure that the Australian parliament remains an enduring effective institution.
       </p>
       <p>
        My staff in the Speaker’s Office have assisted me and kept me well grounded. I believe that members would agree with me that they carry out their duties with integrity and professionalism.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I acknowledge my eternal indebtedness to my 'trouble and strife', Michele, and the four generations of my family without whose support I would never have been able to achieve the high office I hold.
       </p>
       <p>
        Late yesterday I ascertained that the Governor-General is available for my call before 9.30; therefore, I must depart. I go placidly with my humour intact. I wish you all well.

        <p>
         We have just had something very unusual happen in this parliament and, on indulgence, I wish to acknowledge the importance of the occasion which we have just witnessed—an occasion of which we had no notice. I say that without any criticism whatsoever of anyone. It is a remarkable thing for this parliament to witness, out of the blue like this, the resignation of a Speaker—a Speaker who has served this parliament with distinction for the last four years.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Honourable members: Hear, hear!
        </p>
        <p>
         I would like to say on behalf of the Liberal and National parties that Speaker Jenkins has been an adornment to this parliament in the chair. He has conducted himself in the chair with good humour, with impartiality, with forbearance and with patience. For that, he has our thanks and our enduring respect. Someone who has been one of the really superior Speakers of this parliament has left the chair—and, while we do wish him well in his retirement from the Speakership and we do wish him well in his re-entry into the internal debates of the Labor Party, one must assume that something extraordinary is happening inside the Labor Party for the Speaker to resign his office to go back into those debates.
        </p>
        <p>
         I simply wish to say, to mark this momentous occasion, that former Speaker Jenkins does have our respect and our gratitude, and whoever is to take his position will have our support and our encouragement.

          A remarkable thing has happened in this parliament this morning. It is my intention to make some statements about
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Jenkins" rel="nofollow">
           Harry Jenkins
          </a>
          later this day when he is in the parliament. As he has indicated, he has gone straight from this place to see the Governor-General. There will be remarks that we want to make about him as Speaker; there will be remarks that we want to make about him as a member of the Labor family. But, with your indulgence, Mr Deputy Speaker, I will do that later this day when Harry Jenkins is available to be with us.
