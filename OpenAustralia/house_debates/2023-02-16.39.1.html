        MULINO () (): Young people need to be involved in solving the problems they face. It is a particularly apt sentiment this week, with its focus on youth mental health. Youth Insearch, the peer-led youth intervention organisation behind End Youth Suicide Week, has turned around the lives of thousands of at-risk youth by including young people in devising the solutions that work for them. I see that in my own electorate, where diversity is celebrated as a key to good mental health because visibility matters. Mohamed Semra and his Endeavour Youth Australia organisation are doing so much to tackle the scourge of racism. Then there's the passionate Tigrayan Youth Association, which recently hosted a three-day wellness and cultural event.
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor won't be ignoring young people. As youth minister Anne Aly said, when announcing the Albanese government's innovative Australian Government Youth Steering Committee, young people 'are uniquely placed to tell us about the problems they are facing and to shape the solutions that work for them'. The youngest person on that committee, 13-year-old Taihan Rahman, lives in my electorate, and we are all so proud of his passion and commitment. It was inspiring when he visited my electorate office recently. I look forward to hearing much more from this dedicated group of young Australians.
