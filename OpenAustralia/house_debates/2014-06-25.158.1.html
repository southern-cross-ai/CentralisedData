        I rise to speak on behalf of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_Rugby_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Brighton Rugby Club
        </a>
        . This club plays on the Brighton Oval sporting complex in Hove in my electorate. I would especially like to recognise the efforts of the new local state member, David Speirs, the member for Bright, who has been strongly championing the interests of the club to make sure they get the facilities they need and were promised. During the recent
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        n state election the club was promised $1 million in state government funding to upgrade their clubrooms. This promise was not made by a candidate or a backbencher or the opposition; it was made by the local Labor member, a minister in the Weatherill government. Nor was the promise contingent on that member's re-election. She clearly stated in a letter she wrote to the club: 'I would like to propose that a Labor government would commit to a funding model wherein $1 million would be provided.' So convinced was the Weatherill government of the worthiness of this project that the letter also said: 'It is worth noting that I believe any government, regardless of political persuasion, would honour such a commitment.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor was successful in retaining government in South Australia and now they are trying to back away from the promise that was made. First, the Minister for Sport denied that they promised the $1 million in funding. Then he said it was a different Labor minister who made the commitment so it did not count. Then the Treasurer had to step in and save him by saying it would have to wait until the budget. The rugby club waited until the budget, which came down last week. There was no indication in the budget papers that the Weatherill government will be honouring this election commitment.
       </p>
       <p>
        This club has a long history in the local community and has been a significant player in the state rugby scene. Unfortunately their facilities are old, they do not comply with current codes and standards, and they are in need of upgrade. This is not just about putting marble countertops on the bar; it is for basic upgrades to make facilities more usable by the club and the community such as improved disabled access, appropriate facilities for female players—separate change rooms, showers and toilets—and improved security. Neither I nor the new state member for Bright, David Speirs, will allow the Weatherill government to get away with this broken promise, to just try and to sweep their election commitments under a rug. Labor is the government in South Australia and I call on them to stand by and deliver on their commitment to the Brighton rugby club.
