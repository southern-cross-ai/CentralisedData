       <p>
        I would like to bring to the attention of the chamber three extraordinary

        residents who have been awarded Medals of the Order of Australia. The first is Julie Cini, of Spinal Muscular Atrophy Australia. Ms Cini co-founded Spinal Muscular Atrophy Australia and has served it, first as the president and now as the chief executive officer, for the past 18 years. Ms Cini's two children, Montanna and Zarlee, both tragically lost their battle with this disease in the first year of their lives. During this period, Ms Cini also dealt with the loss of her partner. Despite these personal tragedies, she went on to found

        Australia just six weeks after Montanna's passing. I cannot think of anyone more deserving of a national honour than Ms Cini, who has helped countless families for almost two decades. I commend her selfless service to our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        The second is Robert Millen, awarded for services to the Scouts. Mr Millen has served in Scouts leadership positions since, incredibly, 1964, rising to his current role as chair of the Australian Scout Fellowship's

        heritage branch in 2013. As we all know, Gilwell Park is the home of Scouting. As a former
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Scout" rel="nofollow">
         Queen's Scout
        </a>
        , I again thank Mr Millen for all the great service he has done, especially for Gilwell Parkâ€”and, might I add, under the previous government $5 million was awarded to Gilwell Park to make it again state of the art.
       </p>
       <p>
        The third is Sharon Reynolds, awarded for services to pistol shooting. Mrs Reynolds has been involved in pistol shooting for more than 40 years and currently holds several senior positions in Australian and international organisations. She has also spent more than 20 years as a competitive judge for the Olympics and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games" rel="nofollow">
         Commonwealth Games
        </a>
        and has given this sport such incredible service and devotion. I'm glad to see that Mrs Reynolds has been recognised for her decades of service to pistol shooting, from local club leadership to her work on the highest international level of sport.
       </p>
       <p>
        All these great Australians have done incredible work in the La Trobe community. I again thank them for their service, for their dedication and for making Australia great. To receive the order of Australia is something they can be very proud of. Very few people get to receive this award. Again, on behalf of all residents of La Trobe and all people of Australia, we congratulate them.
