        My question is to the Minister for Education. Would the minister please outline to the House how the Morrison government is supporting students during this difficult time, including through the provision of mental health support?

         I thank the member for Boothby for her question. I know I speak for all members in this House when I say to all students: we understand the difficulties that you've been facing this year, in particular the challenges that year 12 students are facing. This year has looked like no other for youâ€”the idea of going to formals, looking forward to schoolies, having the uncertainty as to when your exams might be, and, earlier in the year, not knowing whether there might be mass repeating, not understanding whether there might be a year 13 that you would have to undertake. These have been incredibly trying times for you. In Victoria in particular, where students haven't had face-to-face contact with teachers and haven't been able to go to school, it's been extraordinarily difficult. Things have been happening where they've had to ask questions, where they've have had to seek help. I know that parents right across the board have been working with their students to make sure that they understand what is happening. I had a call from a student yesterday when the state of emergency was extended for 12 months, saying, 'What does this mean for me? Does this mean that I might not be able to get back to school for another year?', and I was having to allay those types of fears.
        </p>

         What the government has done is put in a range of measures to help and support students. The health minister, with
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_Blue" rel="nofollow">
          Beyond Blue
         </a>
         , has worked with the department of education to put in place Be You, the National Education Initiative, which provides teachers and students with help and support. This includes information to help early learning communities look after children's and their own mental health. There's been a 70 per cent uptake by schools of this resource. I say to all those other schools: please, look at this very important resource.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Australian government has a student wellbeing hub, found at studentwellbeinghub.edu.au, which has a range of measures to help students deal with COVID-19. There is also hope for students. As the Treasurer said yesterday, 150,000 jobs have been created recently for young people, so there will be employment opportunities. We are also providing extra places in vocational education, which will be really important as well, and in higher education. So employment opportunities, vocational education opportunities and higher education opportunities will be there for you when you finish this year.
