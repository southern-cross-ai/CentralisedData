       <p>
        I thank both the member for Lyons and the member for Braddon for the contributions they have made today about the very important issue of fruit fly being discovered in Tasmania. This pest has the potential to devastate the state's agricultural industry and trade capacity, not to mention tarnish Tasmania's national and international reputation as a viable export state.

        and the Prime Minister must take responsibility for the fruit fly outbreak that has occurred on

        and north-west Tasmania. Will Hodgman, in his first budget, cut $1 million from Tasmania's biosecurity budget.

        government failed to identify the control of fruit fly and control strategies as a priority during the development of a national fruit fly research, development and extension plan. Tasmania's farmers are now paying the price of Will Hodgman's biosecurity cuts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Biosecurity Tasmania staff have been put under huge workload pressures due to a reduction in full-time staff and resourcing, and we have heard from the member for Lyons of the increase in activity at our ports and airports. Labor's federal and state investment in irrigation schemes reinvigorated our agricultural sector and saw our high-value exports skyrocket. This has resulted in jobs and more investment, and we've also heard from the member for Braddon of the difference between the export of high-quality fruit into China and its export into

        . Half the price is being realised. This is an absolute failure by the Hodgman Liberal government.
