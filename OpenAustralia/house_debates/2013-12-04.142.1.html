        Communities with strong bike infrastructure are communities that are prepared to address the difficult transport issues of today while meeting the important challenges of tomorrow. In my electorate of Corio there is an increasing need to make Geelong a more bike friendly city so that commuters have the opportunity to choose cycling with the knowledge that they can safely travel from one place to the next. This need was precisely what the previous Labor government was working to meet, having committed more than $1 million to the Barwon to Bay cycleway, a 2.4 kilometre two-lane separated bike lane between the Geelong CBD and the

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        This was funding provided under
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDA" rel="nofollow">
         RDA
        </a>
        round 5 after this project was selected on its merits through a competitive process. This is funding that formed part of this year's budget, which went through the parliament. Now there are reports today that the Abbott government will now cut this funding and therefore cut this project. Once again the Liberals come to the electorate of Corio, promising nothing but ripping money out. These paths would save lives and prevent injuries.

       <p>
        In June I spoke about the disturbing reality of cyclist fatalities in Geelong. This was brought to my attention after a meeting with Mr Barton van Laar, the President of Bike Safe Geelong. The need to recognise that Geelong is far from a bicycle friendly city in order to really tackle this issue remains prevalent. Since 2009, 20 per cent of Victoria's 30 bicycle fatalities have occurred in Geelong. Not only are members of our community losing their lives as a result of these tragic bicycle accidents but also, in the last financial year alone, hospital admissions related to cycling accidents in Geelong have increased by 30 per cent. Without the proper investment in cycling infrastructure, these tragedies will continue. The Geelong community, and other regional communities all over Australia, are therefore bitterly disappointed that the federal government has taken the step to cut round 5 of the RDA grants.
       </p>
       <p>
        Effective bike infrastructure not only is about addressing safety issues but also stands as an integral part in meeting the increasing transport challenges of our community. At the last census less than two per cent of Victorians travelled to work by bike. This is a strong indicator that we need to give commuters of Geelong the genuine opportunity to cycle instead of drive. Bike infrastructure such as the Barwon to Bay cycleway will provide people with the assurance they can travel safely and, in turn, give them an incentive to use cycling as a real transport alternative. This supports the health and fitness of those who take up cycling, eases traffic congestion and car-parking costs and, importantly, contributes to a more sustainable transport system by reducing transport emissions. So this is what the Barwon to Bay cycleway would have meant for Geelong. It would have meant saving lives, preventing tragic accidents and taking on our increasing transport challenges by supporting cycling as a real alternative for commuters, and increasing the revitalisation of Geelong CBD and surrounding areas. Tony Abbott is now stopping this from happening.
