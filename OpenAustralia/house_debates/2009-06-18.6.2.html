        and replace it with a fair and balanced workplace relations system. This new system based on the newly enacted Fair Work Act 2009 comes into effect on 1 July this year and will be fully operational by 1 January 2010. Provisions to ensure a smooth, simple and fair transition to the new system while providing for certainty in employment arrangements are set out in the two transitional and consequential bills which were passed by the House on 2 June. These two bills are the

         Fair Work (State Referral and Consequential and Other Amendments) Bill 2009
        </a>
        .
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Senate" rel="nofollow">
         The Senate
        </a>
        has now passed these two bills.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Fair Work (State Referral and Consequential and Other Amendments) Bill was passed without amendment. The Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill has also been passed by the Senate but with a number of amendments. The House now has to consider these proposed amendments. First, I remind the House that the government accepted amendments in the Senate to the substantive Fair Work Bill where they were in accord with Labor’s commitment to the Australian people in Forward with Fairness and improved the operation of the legislation. The government will take the same approach in relation to these bills and, accordingly, as well as a number of amendments moved by the government we will be accepting the two amendments moved by Senator Xenophon and passed by the Senate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I now briefly outline for the House the amendments moved by the government in the Senate. In respect of unfair dismissal, during the Senate debate on the Fair Work Bill the government made a commitment to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senator_Fielding" rel="nofollow">
         Senator Fielding
        </a>
        that, until 1 January 2011, the threshold used to define a small business for the purpose of applying the unfair dismissal arrangements would be less than 15 full-time equivalent employees. The amended provisions now before us reflect that commitment. The calculation of the number of full-time equivalent employees is based on the number of ordinary hours of an employer’s employees over the previous four weeks, including periods of authorised leave, whether that was paid or unpaid. At Senator Fielding’s request, it was agreed that the ordinary hours of employees on parental leave are excluded where that employee has been on parental leave for more than four weeks. From 1 January 2011, the threshold will be based on a simple headcount of employees as provided for in the Fair Work Act. The government has also made a commitment to Senator Fielding to add a further clause to the objects of the Fair Work Act that acknowledges the special circumstances of small and medium sized employers, and this has been done.
       </p>
       <p>
        The amendments moved by the government and passed by the Senate are intended to improve and clarify a small number of provisions in the bill. In respect of ballots, the bill originally provided that protected action ballots and authorisations under the Workplace Relations Act will be of no effect from 1 July 2009. A government amendment passed by the Senate now allows limited preservation of Workplace Relations Act protected action ballot authorisations after 1 July 2009 on application by a bargaining representative to Fair Work Australia. This will mean that employees and unions who are midway in an industrial campaign will be able to continue to rely on a secret ballot authorisation across the 1 July bridging period avoiding the cost, delay and inconvenience of running a new ballot process.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are also a number of government amendments passed by the Senate which are intended to further assist state and federally registered organisations to rationalise their affairs and simplify their operations across multiple jurisdictions. These amendments include changes to the provisions allowing federal organisations to extend their eligibility rule to reflect the broader rules of an equivalent state association. There are also changes to ensure that settled demarcations are not reopened by allowing Fair Work Australia to make a federal representation order that reflects a state representation order in situations where a federal organisation has altered its eligibility rules to reflect those of an equivalent state association.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, the list of Senate amendments contains a number of small technical and moderate changes which the government introduced in the Senate. These include provisions for the Federal Court or the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Magistrates_Court" rel="nofollow">
         Federal Magistrates Court
        </a>
        to have the discretion to extend, where appropriate, the 14-day time limit in relation to certain general protection and unlawful termination court applications.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two additional amendments were moved by Senator Xenophon that the government is also prepared to accept. The first amendment seeks to set out an approach that Fair Work Australia may take when considering an application to resolve the uncertainty or difficulty under item 26 of part 5 of schedule 3 to the bill relating to the interaction between a transitional instrument and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NES" rel="nofollow">
         NES
        </a>
        . The second amendment adds additional factors to be considered in the award modernisation process and is expressed substantially in terms already set out in the modern awards object in section 134 of the Fair Work Act 2009. Accordingly, the government accepts the amendment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government will accept these amendments made to the Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009 made by the Senate. The list of amendments that we are now considering deserves to be approved by the House because the changes are all consistent with, and help to promote, the government’s overarching commitment to fairness, balance and flexibility in Australian workplaces. I commend these amendments to the House.

         The opposition will accept the motion. The government amendments are relatively noncontroversial. The amendments of Senator Xenophon deserve greater thought. The most serious problem with this

          Fair Work (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill 2009
         </a>
         is that there are aspects of it that will directly destroy tens of thousands of Australian jobs. You do not need to take my word for that; you can listen to any of the industries that are going to be affected. They have got independent research. In the fast food industry, 18,000 people are going to be thrown out of work unless this government decides to change tack. In the pharmacy industry, thousands will be thrown out of work. Research done in my home state of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         says that almost 700 people will lose their jobs unless this government listens to reason on this so-called award modernisation process.
        </p>
        <p>
         The amendments of Senator Xenophon go only a very small way to addressing our concerns. The coalition had far superior amendments, but the government, the Labor Party, would not change tack, they would not listen to reason and they are hell bent on pursuing this course of action no matter what the consequences are for average Australians. Some of the most vulnerable workers in our community are literally going to be thrown out of work unless this government listens to reason and changes aspects of their industrial relations regime. This so-called award modernisation process is in pursuit of what we consider to be a laudable aim. But, like so much that the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Ms Gillard, pursues, it has been completely bungled and botched. This is a minister who cannot give the time required to her massive brief, so she bungles in education and she bungles workplace relations, but the consequences in workplace relations are particularly severe because we are talking about people’s livelihoods. We are talking about the ability of Australians to be able to go out there and get a job, particularly in industries which traditionally employ very vulnerable Australians—people who might not be able to find work elsewhere. These amendments will be accepted, but the reality is that the debate about Labor’s industrial relations system, in particular this so-called award modernisation, has a long way to go.

          I rise for the purpose of placing on the record the reasons for rejecting the opposition’s amendments. Applying a global test to the National Employment Standards for transitional instruments as suggested by opposition amendments (1) and (2) would deprive almost all employees of the safety net and, we believe, would be unworkable and uncertain. It is inconsistent with the government’s commitment to ensuring that the National Employment Standards, which underpin employment conditions across the country, are operational from 1 January 2010. The employer cost orders proposed by opposition amendment (4) are also unnecessary, we believe. The award modernisation request already requires the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Industrial_Relations_Commission" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Industrial Relations Commission
          </a>
          to consider transitional arrangements and the government has made a submission urging the commission to take account of increased or decreased labour costs in each industry or occupation.
         </p>
         <p>
          Opposition amendment (7) would take away the ability of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to tailor transitional arrangements for particular industries or sectors, entrenching state based inconsistencies in terms and conditions for another five years, and then providing that they must automatically cease. This big bang approach, we believe, is a recipe for chaos. The commission is best placed to set out an orderly transitional arrangement and arrangements in the awards themselves. Opposition amendment (3) would require the commission to take into account business profitability in carrying out award modernisation. We note that this concept is already covered off in the existing criteria, which require the commission to consider economic sustainability, reducing the regulatory burden on business, the creation of jobs, productivity, high levels of employment and also labour force participation.

           I will be brief, because I am very keen to assist the business of the House today. But I cannot let the comments of the Attorney-General—the acting minister—go without making some response. What he said was not correct. If he could have been present for the debate yesterday in the Senate he would have heard that the new junior employment minister—granted he has only been in the job for a very short time—was completely unable to address the concerns that were raised by the opposition, the Greens and the Independent senators about the amendments. In relation to our own amendments, what they do in reality is alleviate the worst aspects of the so-called award modernisation process that is going to throw tens of thousands of Australians out of work. That is what we are trying to do. They are considered amendments. The government come back with this nonsense about unintended consequences; they come back with this nonsense, ‘Oh well it’s covered off in other areas.’ If it was, we quite frankly would not have needed to move the amendments.  Do not just listen to the opposition; listen to any of the industries that are going to be affected by these diabolical changes. This is a government that talks about creating jobs and about caring for the employment prospects of Australians, but then we see them come into this House and do things that directly destroy jobs. As I said, this debate has a long way to go.
