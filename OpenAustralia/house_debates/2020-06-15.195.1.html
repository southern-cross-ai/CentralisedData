        It is no secret that COVID-19 has devastated people and businesses in Moreton. My electorate has a large population of international students and people on working holiday visas. Once COVID-19 restrictions were in place, the travel bans made it impossible for these people to return home, yet they were left to fend for themselves by this coalition government. Thankfully, the Korean Society of Queensland stepped up and took action. Over the course of six weeks, The Korean Society received 1,235 applications for help, and they have delivered a staggering 1,101 food hampers right across Brisbane and as far away as the

        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . When I dropped into the Korean Society of Queensland I saw a highly organised, compassionate and energetic community who were putting together hampers and meals for international students. It was an impressive operation, to say the least. I wasn't surprised by the amazing effort. I have enjoyed many events with the Korean community over the years and I have found them to be incredibly warm, welcoming and professional. The effort was named the hamper project. It was made possible due to donations from community leaders, businesses, restaurants, clubs and religious groups. The volunteers from the Korean Society of Queensland are an incredibly generous and community minded group of people. Their effort during COVID-19 is nothing short of incredible and they deserve acknowledgement from the Australian parliament. So a big thank you to the Korean Society of Queensland or, as they say, gamsahabnida.
