       <p>
        Today I am speaking with a sense of pride to acknowledge and celebrate the milestones and progress that have been made within the Mallee community, highlighting the dedication and collaborative effort that have led to these achievements.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to first focus on the Jeparit riverfront project, an initiative that transformed a key community space through a $750,000 grant from the former coalition government's Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program. This project, led by the Jeparit advancement committee and supported by long-term residents, has revitalised the riverfront area. It is a place of fond memories and community significance. The riverfront—once a humble swimming hole where schoolchildren, including Mr Wiedermann some 70 years ago, earned their
        <i>
         Herald
        </i>
        certificate—has been magnificently transformed. This transformation is not just about physical renovation; it's a celebration of shared history, connection to place and the natural beauty there but also the collective resilience of the community. I was proud to be down there a couple of weeks ago.
       </p>
       <p>
        The modernisation of the riverfront signifies the community of Jeparit's dedication to preserving and enriching the lives of community members and the generations to come. Today it boasts an elegant platform and steps leading down to the river, replacing the once sludge-laden banks with welcoming sand. Additionally, a new amenities block and outdoor kitchen have been installed. These work superbly with the existing two-bedroom units which overlook the river from the cliff above, enhancing the appeal of an already beautiful place. These improvements reflect a broader commitment to upgrading community facilities and promoting local heritage and recreational opportunities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LRCI" rel="nofollow">
         LRCI
        </a>
        Program, initiated by our government, aimed to support communities in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. During my first term in parliament, I was part of securing more than $92 million in funding under this program, emphasising the importance of investing in local infrastructure across Mallee. It is crucial that the current government continue to support local infrastructure funding programs to maintain and expand on these advancements.
       </p>
       <p>
        Similarly, in Nhill, we have seen the positive impact of the Karen community's integration, growing from five Luv-A-Duck workers and their families in 2010 to around 200 Karen people there today. This integration has been beneficial for the whole community, culminating in the construction of Nhill's first purpose-built caneball court. This facility supported by the LRCI program and Hindmarsh Shire Council is the first of its kind in western Victoria. It caters to the traditional game of chinlone or sepak takraw, reflecting our commitment to cultural diversity and inclusion.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've long been incredibly impressed with the Nhill community and I also attended the Karen new year there earlier this year. This event, meticulously planned by the community, was attended by over 1,000 people from across Victoria and beyond. Among the attendees was Mira, who travelled from Perth with her family to join us. Mira, like many others, may have relocated, but continues to consider Nhill her Australian home. This sentiment underscores the deep connections formed within the community and highlights the inclusivity that defines those who live in Mallee.
       </p>
       <p>
        The impact of the Karen community on Nhill is significant and inspiring, with 18 per cent of the local workforce and more than 10 per cent of the population being Karen. Their contribution to the Nhill community is undeniable. Almost 60 Karen families own their own homes in Nhill and contribute to local businesses. These figures are a testament to the successful integration and mutual respect that exists in Nhill.
       </p>
       <p>
        The developments they celebrate today underscore the potential of government programs and community collaboration in fostering development and improving the quality of life in local regional communities. As we move forward, it's essential to continue supporting these initiatives, ensuring they have the resources needed to sustain and enhance their impact.
       </p>
       <p>
        In conclusion, I would like to thank all those involved in bringing these projects to fruition. Their efforts have significantly contributed to the development of the Jeparit and Nhill communities as a whole and add to the progress we continue to make in Mallee.
