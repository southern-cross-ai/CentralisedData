        My question is addressed to the Minister for Ageing. How are older Australians with chronic dental health problems going to meet the cost of dental care when the Rudd government scraps the Medicare dental scheme?

        <p>
         I thank the honourable member for her question. Dental care is a major concern, particularly after 12 years of neglect under the previous government. Indeed, it was the Howard government that scrapped the Commonwealth dental scheme, which caused so many difficulties particularly for older people right throughout our community and which has caused so many health problems as well. Dental concerns are not just about poor teeth; they can also lead to future, serious medical problems. It was a major concern that for 12 long years the Howard government neglected that.
        </p>
        <p>
         The Rudd government are committed to making sure that right throughout this nation there is better access to dental care, firstly through our Teen Dental Plan, but also through our plan to bring back the Commonwealth dental plan, which will enable older Australians to have access to a dentist, which they were not able to get for so many years. Many older Australians have told me how desperate they were to have a federal government that listened to their concerns in relation to dental care. We have certainly listened, as is shown through our dental plans for older Australians and also our Teen Dental Plan.
