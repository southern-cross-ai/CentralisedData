        My question is to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acting_Prime_Minister" rel="nofollow">
         Acting Prime Minister
        </a>
        . I refer the minister to an electricity bill from Mr Brett McDonald, managing director of Homebush Export Meat Company in my electorate. It shows his energy costs rising $6,000 each year as a result of the carbon tax. What is standing in the way of the government keeping its election commitment to abolish the carbon tax and reduce energy prices?

         This example is just so typical of what is happening to businesses right across the nation. The impact of the carbon tax on their costs is costing jobs, it is costing competitiveness, and it is making Australian industry think twice about whether they can invest in this country. The meat processing sector is one of those that is affected perhaps worse than most by the carbon tax because they are hit in so many different ways. Someone like Homebush Export Meat Company is affected as a result of the carbon tax that they pay on their direct emissions. They pay it on their electricity. They pay carbon tax on their gas. They pay carbon tax on their water. They pay carbon tax on their refrigerants. And, of course, if the Labor Party has its way, they will also pay carbon tax on transport. This all makes the Homebush Export Meat Company, like all other meat exporters in Australia, just so much less competitive than they otherwise would be. There was $6,000 on his electricity bill alone. But he would also be paying much higher refrigeration costs for his refrigeration needs. In fact, the unit price for the gas that is used in his refrigerants and his freezers has gone from $129 to $2,492. The unit price has gone from $129 to $2,492 as a direct result of Labor's carbon tax. This is the kind of burden that Australian meat exporters can ill afford and have to try and address.

         The carbon tax will be a hindrance to everyone in business until it goes. Unfortunately, we have an opposition that has not listened to what the people have said in their judgement on the carbon tax. This tax has to go. We have a mandate from the people to get rid of it.

         as it is as a result of this carbon tax, without resisting the legislation even further. It is time we get on with the task of getting rid of this carbon tax so Australian businesses can be properly competitive.
