        I'd like to thank Treasurer Josh Frydenberg for visiting the Bonner electorate last week to meet with a local business that had graduated from JobKeeper. Wallum Nurseries managing director Peter Long welcomed us for a tour of the facility and to meet with his team. When the global pandemic created nationwide uncertainty, Peter and his team prepared to bunker downâ€”that is, until JobKeeper was announced. I have appreciated Peter's feedback throughout the past 12 months, all of which has been passed on to the Treasurer, to advise how our support measures are working. As Peter told us during the tour: 'Josh and the government told us to spend to keep the economy going, and that's exactly what we did. We put all our staff on JobKeeper, even hiring new staff during the pandemic, including two apprentices under the wage subsidy scheme. We utilised the cash flow boost and instant asset write-off, purchasing a tractor, a ute, shade structures and a fridge. All of this was spent to put back into the community. We couldn't have done any of this without JobKeeper.' Wallum Nurseries are grateful for the government support. As Peter explained, he did what was asked and, as a result, Australia is getting back to normal and our economy is improving. Australia's economic position is envied by the world. However, it would not have been possible without Australians like Peter Long and Wallum Nurseries backing our plan, spending in the community and supporting their staff during such an unprecedented time.
