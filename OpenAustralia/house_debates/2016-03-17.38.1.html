        As the patron of the Redwater Creek Steam and Heritage Society I had the great pleasure on the weekend of attending SteamFest 2016 in the beautiful town of Sheffield in the municipality of Kentish. I just want to highlight what a wonderful event this is. Where else in the world would you see traction engines reversing in a crowd of people, with young kids mingling between machinery that, in some cases, is 150 years old? Where else in the world would you see a team of bullocks making its way through a crowd of people?

        Mr Deputy Speaker, you would have been very proud to know that a former member in this place, Mr Tim Fischer, had the privilege of opening SteamFest 2016. Whilst I understand that he was always known as 'Two-minute Tim'—and he did go on for a little bit longer than two minutes—nobody could have been in any doubt as to the passion that he has for steam. I congratulate President Chris Martin, Marc, Lizard and the other members of the committee for an extraordinary event that is a highlight every year. I encourage anybody who has not attended SteamFest previously to block out the long weekend in March next year.
