        Caboolture Indoor Sports Centre has been around for over 25 years, first starting on Morayfield Road, next to the Caboolture tenpin bowling, before moving to its larger current location on Lear Jet Drive in Caboolture. On weekends and school holidays, families enjoy 'inflatable world', where kids can jump and climb without fear of injury, while locals enjoy sports during the week such as beach volleyball, indoor netball, indoor soccer and, my personal favourite, indoor cricket. Most Tuesday nights when I'm not in Canberra I'll be running around with the team I play in, comprising players with ages ranging from 15 to 54â€”and I'll leave it up to you to work out where I fit into that, Deputy Speaker! I give a shout-out to the boys, who went down in the grand final on Wednesday night: well done on a great season, fellas.
       </p>

        Recently the centre went through a change of ownership, with long-time owner Tony Joyce, or Joycey, as we fondly know him, selling the centre to Stephen Mogg, who also owns two other indoor sports centres, one located right here in Canberra. We wish Tony all the best in his future endeavours, and we wish Stephen great success and we welcome him to the Longman community. Stephen has made a commitment to the local community to invest in the centre to upgrade equipment and facilities, which is a demonstration of his confidence in the people of Longman and their reputation for supporting local businesses.
       </p>

        No matter if you're young or old, male or female, if you're looking for a bit of great fun and a good way to get fit, or you just want to bowl a bouncer at your local member, come on down to Caboolture Indoor Sports Centre.
