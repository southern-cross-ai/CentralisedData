        In my rural electorate of Maranoa, a town is not just some dot on the map where you live; it is a place you call home, raise a family, and form connections and relationships with people around you. This community bond is one true element that presents in every town in Maranoa. In Warwick on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Downs" rel="nofollow">
         Southern Downs
        </a>
        , a group of very dedicated people came together with an odd idea of dressing trees for the winter. What they did not know was that 14 years later their Jumpers and Jazz in July festival would turn into a premier event not just for the Southern Downs but for all of Southern Queensland. The Jumpers and Jazz in July festival has developed the yarn bombing of Warwick's deciduous trees into a remarkable exhibition that attracts tens of thousands of visitors to the town every year. This year's much anticipated theme is 'meander'.
       </p>
       <p>
        Warwick CBD is transformed into a living gallery with more than 100 handmade artworks installed on the bare winter trees. Inspirational and charming, yarn bombing warms the hearts of visitors even on a cold winter's day in July. Visitors enjoy live outdoor and indoor jazz performances by some of Queensland's most popular jazz musicians to the backdrop of colourful knitted art and cosy winter fires. Highlights include clever winter coated trees, yarn bomb surprises around every corner, art and craft markets, multiple art and textile exhibitions in traditional and unusual spaces, and the exceptional and inspirational talents of international and local artists on display. Personally I am glad to make it home for this one. Jumpers and Jazz celebrates community, and this event is supported by many wonderful and dedicated volunteers.

        In Maranoa, we are very community minded. We are proud of the history of lending a hand, with many of us volunteering in services like church based groups, local sporting and youth clubs, emergency services and everything in between to overcome challenges and to bring people together. I would also like to mention that many of my local service clubs and Lions clubs will soon host their annual change-over dinners to welcome in their new leadership teams. Their work is invaluable, particularly in smaller rural and regional towns. Although I am sadly unable to make all of these events, I wish members new and old all the very best for the year ahead and I thank them for their steadfast dedication to preserving the spirit of volunteering to our country. Volunteers are the backbone of our community and rural communities are where you will feel at home and supported. I thank all of my local service clubs and members for their tireless work in our community and wish Jumpers and Jazz in July festival all the very best.
