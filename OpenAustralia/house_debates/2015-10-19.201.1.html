        I draw the attention of the House to the recent
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noble_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Noble Park
        </a>
        art show, which had its 10th birthday celebration at the Noble Park Community Centre. The opening was on Friday, 9 October, but it was an exhibition over that weekend. This is a really impressive local exhibition of art work within the local community, and it has been growing over that 10-year period in a very impressive way. I have had the privilege of attending on several occasions now and seeing just how talented many of the people in the local area are with respect to art.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not only schools that are involved; it is also individuals, and some of those individuals have gone on to exhibit professionally. It really highlights the fact that there are a lot of people locally who are very skilled. I, for one, who basically have no skills when it comes to art, was in awe of many of the presentations there.
       </p>
       <p>
        In total, there were nearly 150, I thinkâ€”no, more than that. At the end of the day, there were somewhere in excess of 300 actual presentations as part of the overall display. It was a great opportunity to meet local residents and a great opportunity to see the skills on display, and it is something that the community of Noble Park should be very proud of.
