        area property portfolio presently comprises seven sites, accommodating approximately 880 full-time staff and over 300 part-time staff and students, across a total of 126,000 square metres of laboratories, technical and specialist support facilities, and commercial office space. CSIRO is proposing to reduce its property portfolio in the Greater Sydney area to five key sites, with the goal of reducing surplus accommodation capacity, providing relief in managing currently escalating property operating, repair and maintenance costs, and delivering fit-for-purpose scientific facilities for current and future science operations. The reduction will be achieved through a mix of divestment, expiry of lease and consolidation of CSIRO capability at five existing sites.

        The estimated outturn cost of this project is $113.7 million, excluding
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        . The cost estimate includes construction costs, consultant fees, furniture and fittings, escalation and risk provisions. The project will provide significant employment opportunities for local construction industry businesses and support services. Subject to parliamentary approval of the project, construction is expected to commence in late 2019 and be completed in mid-2022. I commend the motion to the House.

        has a program of gallery renewal that will redevelop the current permanent galleries into three distinct spaces with a linked narrative experience that will tell the story of Australia. These works are part of the National Museum of Australia's asset replacement program. The first phase of the program is the redevelopment of the current Old New Land exhibition space with a new 1,500 square metre permanent exhibition of environmental history, provisionally entitled Life in Australia; a new multipurpose mezzanine for both exhibitions and functions; and new external stairs. The work will be within the existing National Museum of Australia building, located on the

        The estimated cost of the works is $19.4 million, GST exclusive, and the total cost is $20.5 million from 2015 to 2016 and will be fully funded by the National Museum of Australia. This cost estimate includes construction costs, consultant fees, furniture and fittings, escalation and risk provisions. The fit-out will create jobs during the construction and fit-out works and support local trades and services through ongoing maintenance and supply requirements. Subject to parliamentary approval of the works, construction is expected to commence in mid-2019 and be completed by the end of 2020. I commend the motion to the House.
