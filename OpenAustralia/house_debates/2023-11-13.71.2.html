        My question is to the Prime Minister. The Minister for Foreign Affairs yesterday claimed that Israel, in carrying out its defensive war against terror group Hamas, is breaching international law and should undertake a ceasefire. Is this the government's position?

         The transcript of yesterday's interview says that she did not say that. What the Minister for Foreign Affairs spoke about was perfectly consistent with the motion that was moved in this parliament that was supported by the opposition on the floor of this parliament and that, indeed, we continue to support. I think it provides a principled way of moving forward. It stated that the House 'unequivocally condemns the attacks on Israel by Hamas'. It asserted 'Israel's right to defend itself'. It also called for the 'immediate and unconditional release of all hostages'. It condemned antisemitism. It went on to recognise that 'Hamas does not represent the Palestinian people, nor their needs and aspirations'. It acknowledged the 'devastating loss of Israeli and Palestinian life and that innocent civilians on all sides are suffering as a result of the attacks by Hamas and the subsequent conflict'. It said that this parliament 'supports justice and freedom for Israelis and Palestinians alike'. It said—and this was backed up by the foreign minister yesterday—that the House 'reiterates Australia's consistent position in all contexts is to call for the protection of civilian lives'.

          I raise a point of order, Mr Speaker, on relevance. The question didn't relate to a motion before the House. It related to reckless comments by the foreign minister yesterday, and the question was: is this the government's position? Can the Prime Minister provide a straight answer?

           The Prime Minister was asked about the government's position. He is reading the resolution of the House. He is being relevant to the question and he has dealt with the issue of the comments being made in the question as well. The Prime Minister has the call.

           <p>
            The resolution reiterated that 'Australia's consistent position in all contexts is to call for the protection of civilian lives and the observance of international law'. The opposition voted for that a few weeks ago. Is that not their position now? The motion acknowledged that 'what has unfolded is deeply distressing for many in the Australian community'. It condemned 'all forms of hate speech'.
           </p>
           <p>
            The position in the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
             Middle East
            </a>
            is a complex one and one that we know is causing great distress for

             Jewish Australians
            </a>
            , for Palestinian Australians and for people of Islamic faith as well. We know that. We have a responsibility to not seek to politicise these matters but engage in a principled way going forward. I condemn unequivocally, as well, the decision by some to have a demonstration in Caulfield on Friday night, as I condemn unequivocally the decision to ride motorbikes through the eastern suburbs of Sydney—I condemn that sort of provocation. It is vital at this time that people in positions of leadership exercise that leadership in a responsible way and seek to bring people together.
