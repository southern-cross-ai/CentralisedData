        So often people live struggles that are unknown to others. That's why I was so thrilled last week to spend some more time at Karrinyup Community Men's Shed, along with Richard, Jim, Frank, Norm and others, having a look at the new dust extraction system that's been put in place, with thanks to a Stronger Communities Program grant. This program allows MPs to get out into their communities, see what needs there are, have an independent panel assess those needs and then make the funding commitments. These are small on a financial scale but massive in terms of human impact. Richard shared with me stories of men who had come to the shed emotionally dark and who are now bounding with joy and full of life. Richard was very clear with me, though. He said there are men who would not be alive today if it were not for the community that they have found at the shed. Some additional men were unable to work in the shed due to respiratory issues caused by dust, and with the new dust extraction system these gentlemen are back on deck. To meet the growing demand, planning is now underway to install another demountable building, thanks to a further $20,000 in grant funding. This will allow the shed more room to enable even more people in our local community to overcome some of those personal struggles and to thrive together along with their new mates.
