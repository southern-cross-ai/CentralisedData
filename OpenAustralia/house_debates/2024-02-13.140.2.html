       <p>
        Small businesses are the cornerstone of country communities. They operate across every industry and are found in every corner of our nation, from your favourite coffee shop to your terrific local tradie, trusted health professionals and hospitality superstars. While their footprint may sometimes be small, their role and their impact are undeniably vast.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are around 2.6 million businesses in Australia. The vast majority of these, 97 per cent, have fewer than 20 employees. Particularly in the regions, small businesses are an important source of investment and job creation. In fact, just over 30 per cent of small businesses are located outside of greater capital city areas compared with around one-quarter of large businesses. Notably, small businesses in the bush go the extra mile, providing goods and services to areas where larger firms may choose not to operate.
       </p>
       <p>
        While small businesses are the bedrock of the bush, it's undeniably an incredibly challenging time to be a business owner. It's a very concerning time as well. The latest data from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Bureau of Statistics
        </a>
        reveals that the number of business exits is at its highest point in five years, and that there is a very modest growth in the number of new small businesses opening up. These numbers point to the harsh economic environment that business owners are facing, and, as I have indicated, it is very concerning. Small-business conditions and confidence have declined over the past year. Business owners are battling high inflation and even higher interest rates. The increase in costs and prices leads to cash flow problems, forcing businesses to decide whether to take the hit and absorb the additional costs themselves or to raise prices and perhaps lose more customers as a result.
       </p>
       <p>
        A report by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reserve_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         Reserve Bank
        </a>
        of Australia in September 2023 found that growth in aggregate retail sales values has slowed considerably over the past year, and sales for small retailers have declined. On top of this, the availability of labour has remained tight, which has in many cases constrained operations, including in country areas. In my electorate, extreme weather events such as drought, bushfire, storms and floods which have devastated our region over the past few years have had a shocking impact on many local small businesses. We have to remember it's our businesspeople who take risk and invest funds to build their businesses—often their life savings—borrow money and lie awake at night wondering if someone is going to pay them so they can pay someone else and repay the bank. The government needs to be mindful of the challenges and the very difficult operating circumstances that businesses find themselves in at the moment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite these extraordinary challenges, businesses have been pushing forward and achieving great things against the odds. In my electorate of Calare there are many outstanding businesses which are thriving, demonstrating ingenuity, resilience and a commitment to excellence that must be applauded—businesses like the Oriana, in Orange. In 2015, Espen Harbitz and my good friend the late Ted Marr began a huge renovation on the motel, which was built in 1969. In the seventies, the Oriana was the jewel of Orange. More recently, it was looking a little world weary—that is, until Espen and Ted decided to put their heart and soul into turning it into something truly spectacular. With the Oriana reopening in 2018, Espen, Ted and their amazing team did an absolutely stellar job working hard to transform the Oriana into what we now know as 'the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Springs" rel="nofollow">
         Palm Springs
        </a>
        of Orange'. Their hard work has paid off, with the Oriana recently taking home gold at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        Tourism Awards, winning the 4 to 4.5 Star Deluxe Accommodation category—

       <p>
        I take the interjection from my friend from the Hunter. The much loved site now features a unique accommodation space with themed rooms, cocktail bars, a pool club, a martini bar, 250 gardens seats beneath festooned lights and a stunning in-house restaurant called
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Peacock_Room" rel="nofollow">
         The Peacock Room

        . The Oriana team has 55 staff members who are passionate about hospitality and strive to create dining, accommodation and tourism experiences to remember.
       </p>
       <p>
        We must also mention Thomas and Kristen Nock, whose Byng Street Boutique Hotel in Orange took silver. The Byng Street hotel in Orange is becoming an icon and a new standard for accommodation in Orange. I'd like to congratulate Thomas and Kristen on that wonderful result, as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Huge congratulations must also go to Peppertree Collection in Mudgee, which won gold in the Self-Contained Accommodation category at the New South Wales Tourism Awards. The Bathurst Visitor Information Centre also won gold in the category of Visitor Information Services.
       </p>
       <p>
        Owing to their big wins on the state stage, the Oriana in Orange, the Peppertree Collection in Mudgee and the Bathurst Visitor Information Centre will represent New South Wales at the Qantas Australian Tourism Awards to be held in Darwin in March. They had each better pack very light, because I know they'll be bringing back a lot of gold to the

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Another Central West business which is also very deserving of recognition is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Gold" rel="nofollow">
         Black Gold
        </a>
        Motel at Wallerawang. The motel recently won the Excellence in Large Business Award at the 2023 Business New South Wales State Business Awards. A massive congratulations to Linda and Bob Cluff and their brilliant team which beat a strong field of businesses from every corner of the state to take home the top gong. Black Gold started out as the old Wallerawang school, built in 1881, and 27 years ago Linda and Bob bought the site and began transforming it to the award-winning Black Gold Motel and the Crib Room Restaurant that everyone knows and loves today. Congratulations to those award winners.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to congratulate Peita and Rob Mages and the team at the Clever Cookie Academy, who took on the top gong at the 2023 Western New South Wales Business Awards Business of the Year. The business also bagged the Excellence in

        Award and the Excellence in Innovation Award.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another phenomenal success story in our region is that of Leatherwood Bespoke Rosin. Andrew Baker, Emma Quirk-Baker and their small team were finalists in the Australian Export Awards held in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House

        in Canberra recently. In the foothills of

        </a>
        , Leatherwood Bespoke Rosin make resin which is applied to the bows of stringed instruments, such as violins. Congratulations, Andrew and Emma, on this very high achievement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Well done to all of those award winners. Congratulations to them. I know that business owners, like Thomas and Kristen Nock, are very proud of what they have achieved in a very small period of time.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the 2023 Orange Business Awards, there were also many winners, too numerous to mention. The Outstanding Business of the Year went to Diesel &amp; Blue Doggie Daycare and Grooming. The team also took out the Excellence in Innovation Award.
       </p>
       <p>
        There were and many other award winners around the region. At the 2023 Bathurst Carillon Business Awards, for example, the Excellence in Large Business Award went to Harvest Cafe &amp; Store. The Excellence in Micro Business Award went to Oxygen Recruitment &amp;
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HR" rel="nofollow">

        , and the Excellence in Small Business Award went to Loveridge Digital. The Bathurst's Favourite Business Award went to Ben's Small Motor Repairs.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 2023 Lithgow Black Rose Excellence in Business Awards, the Excellence in Large Business Award went to Westfund Health Insurance. The Excellence in Small Business Award went to Tablelands Sports &amp; Spinal Physiotherapy, and the Excellence in Micro Business Award went to Pretty Party People. The

       </p>
       <p>
        I would also, while I have a few minutes remaining, just like to mention some of the other award winners in Orange. Orange's favourite business award went to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JH" rel="nofollow">

        Hair Artistry, run by Jemma Hansen. The excellence in micro business award went to Lumiere Beauty, run by Maggie Morris. The excellence in small business award went to BNB Made Easy, run by Tim Mortimer. The excellence in large business award went to pmwPlus, run by Ray and

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        It's, as I have said, not easy to be in business at the moment. The operating conditions are very difficult. But, through all of the difficulties and sometimes the pain, there are great things happening in small business. We need to acknowledge that, and also the government needs to acknowledge the great work that the sector is doing. I should also say to everyone out there: support your local businesses and, where you can, shop local. Congratulations to all those businesses whom I have been able to mention in this House tonight.
