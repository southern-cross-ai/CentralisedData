        Earlier this year,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RMS" rel="nofollow">
         RMS
        </a>
        proposed the introduction of clearways on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittwater_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Pittwater Road
        </a>
        , in both directions, from 6 am to 7 pm on weekdays and from 9 am to 6 pm on weekends. While RMS may have good intentions, the proposed clearways would have a huge adverse impact on local communities, businesses and jobs running along the coast of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Beaches" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Beaches
        </a>
        . There are hundreds of small businesses along Pittwater Road which all depend on on-street parking for a significant amount of their patronage. Cafes, supermarkets, stores and surf lifesaving clubs—like Stay Grounded, Collaroy Books, IGA X-press, Ocean Bakehouse, the South Narrabeen Surf Life Saving Club, and hundreds more—not only create approximately 5,000 local jobs; they also form an integral part of our local beach culture. The proposed clearways would not only throttle business along the beaches; they would affect the use of the beach itself.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Every_Sunday" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , 300 Nippers train on Collaroy Beach, and surf lifesaving volunteers often rely on on-street parking so that they can undertake their patrols without constantly having to move their car. It is simply ill-considered to introduce these clearways in light of inadequate parking alternatives. The strength of feeling in my community against this proposal is palpable.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 28 October, more than 500 community members attended a protest rally at Collaroy to send RMS a message. Communities along the beaches are not unreasonable. We are extremely fair, and willing to accept some changes. There is a strong view that the clearways that are already in effect during peak hours adequately ease congestion without compromising parking availability. The important campaign has been extremely visible in Mackellar, with more than 4,000 community members signing my petition against the proposed clearways.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was a pleasure to join with community advocates and local business owners to present the petition to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        minister for roads,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melinda_Pavey" rel="nofollow">
         Melinda Pavey
        </a>
        , and RMS executives at a recent meeting to discuss the proposed clearways. I'm grateful to the minister for taking the time to hear our concerns and I'm pleased that she's undertaken to not make any decision for at least six months and until such time as RMS has reviewed all submissions. I look forward to a positive outcome being reached which is not detrimental to local communities and businesses. I thank everyone who has expressed their concerns. The fight is not over, so please continue to sign my petition which is available on my website at jasonfalinski.com.au.
