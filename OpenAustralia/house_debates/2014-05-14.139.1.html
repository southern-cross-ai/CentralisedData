       <p>
        Last night's federal budget locked in funding for the delivery of key election commitments in Petrie. The coalition government has delivered a budget that tackles debt and deficit but also, importantly, builds for the future. Building for the future includes the biggest infrastructure investment our nation has ever seen, with $13.4 billion in investment for Queensland alone. In addition to locking in almost $1 billion for the Gateway Motorway North upgrade, the budget reaffirmed the government's commitment to ensuring the Moreton Bay Rail Link becomes a reality for the people of Petrie. The coalition government has allocated $108 million towards the Moreton Bay Rail Link project for the 2014-15 financial year. So, whilst this project has been spoken about before, it is this coalition government that is actually allocating and delivering the funds.
       </p>
       <p>
        The budget is part of the coalition government's
        <i>
         Economic Action Strategy
        </i>
        to build a strong and prosperous economy and a safe and secure Australia. Last December I attended the official sod turning of the Moreton Bay Rail Link. Since then, Thiess has been working on the 12.6 kilometre dual track line that will deliver six new rail stations, including four in the Petrie electorate: one at Kippa-Ring, one at Rothwell and two at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mango_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Mango Hill
        </a>
        . It is estimated that thousands of jobs will be created throughout the south-east region and hundreds locally from the Petrie electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        The rail link will also attract new investors and business opportunities; however, there are more than just economic benefits from this project the coalition is delivering. This new vital piece of infrastructure will provide a reliable and economical alternative to people commuting to the city. School children and their parents will also benefit, as the rail link provides an additional transport option for children who attend local high schools, including Grace Lutheran, Mueller College, St Benedict's,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Lakes" rel="nofollow">
         North Lakes
        </a>
        , and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lakes_College" rel="nofollow">
         The Lakes College
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The Moreton Bay rail link will significantly improve transport access for locals and it will lessen the traffic burden on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Bruce Highway
        </a>
        . The new rail link means that people living in suburbs like Rothwell, Mango Hill, North Lakes, Griffin and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deception_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Deception Bay
        </a>
        will no longer have to rely on buses and private vehicles alone to commute to the city. Residents in the electorate understand how vital this rail link is for the region and in 2016 it will become a reality. I am very happy to confirm, again, that in this year's federal budget $108 million has been allocated by this coalition government to deliver the infrastructure.
