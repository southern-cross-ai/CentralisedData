       <p>
        I want to put on the record and call attention to an event which took place on Saturday, 10 October this year. On that day, the governments of Armenia and Turkey reached agreement about future diplomatic relations. The two governments signed a protocol in Zurich and, while the details have aroused controversy on all sides, I am quietly hopeful that we may see the beginning of a more normal bilateral relationship between Turkey and Armenia. It may be that we are at a point in the 21st century where the two parties can begin the long, hard process of reconciling what happened during the first two decades of the 20th century.
       </p>
       <p>
        I know that everyone in this place will be familiar with the tragedy and misery faced by millions of Armenians and others during and after the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         First World War
        </a>
        as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" rel="nofollow">
         Ottoman Empire
        </a>
        collapsed and modern Turkey was created. Indeed, so serious were the mass killings and deportation of Armenians that 20 countries around the world have officially recognised these events as genocide. I have heard firsthand accounts from members of the Armenian diaspora in my electorate. Invariably the stories are from older Armenians now settled in Australia, desperately sad tales of loss of homeland and family. The pain is in their faces, in their language and in their songs, and each year, on 24 April, Armenians gather for what to them is one of the most important days to remember past wrongs.
       </p>
       <p>
        But now, with the October protocol, there is the hope—just the hope—of something different. It is an agreement to start internal political consultations in two areas: the establishment of diplomatic relations and the development of bilateral relations. Significantly, Armenia and Turkey also agreed to form a historical commission which will investigate the tragic events of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
         World War I
        </a>
        . I welcome this first step in what has been a long history of tragedy and hostility. I say that, but at the same time I recognise there has not been any universal welcome for this protocol. I recognise and deeply respect the concerns of many Armenians and Turks—both here in Australia and overseas—about the signing of this agreement. The events of 1915 cannot be erased.
       </p>
       <p>
        But I note in particular the comments of the Turkish foreign minister who said in the Turkish parliament only a short time ago:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We aim at reconciliation between Turkish and Armenian communities in the diaspora and at opening healthy communication channels through the elimination of exploitation based on historical sufferings.
       </p>
       <p>
        I note as well the comments of Armenian President Sargsyan, who said just prior to the signing of the protocol:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It’s important that our nations are able to establish normal relations.
       </p>
       <p>
        This protocol has the support of the Australian government, as well as the United States, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EU" rel="nofollow">
         EU
        </a>
        , France, Russia and Slovenia. The protocol sends a message to the world that understanding between peoples burdened by tragic pasts is possible, and I hope that this dialogue of resolution between the Turkish and Armenian government continues with civility.
