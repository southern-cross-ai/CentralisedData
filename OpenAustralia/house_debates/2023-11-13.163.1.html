        I rise today to give an update on some of the work I've had the privilege of undertaking with the schools in my electorate of Fadden. I deeply value education and appreciate the contribution of our local primary and secondary schools in shaping the youth of Fadden. It is where we entrust our kids to be educated and inspired, producing the leaders of future generations, which is why I find it incredibly important to stay up to date with our local schools and to support them wherever possible.
       </p>

        One of my great honours is to bestow schools with an Australian flag that they can fly at their school. I recently attended a special flag-raising ceremony at Biggera Waters State School to unveil the new flag poles that were recently installed at the school. They were jointly funded by the P&amp;C association of the school and by the member for Broadwater and Queensland Leader of the Opposition, David Crisafulli MP.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm proud to have commenced an initiative in conjunction with local schools to recognise and promote well-rounded role models who excel in all aspects of their academic, sporting and cultural endeavours. The Cameron Caldwell MP Leadership Medal recognises high-achieving students who lead by example and demonstrate a high level of enthusiasm and involvement in school activities. It has been an honour to present these awards in recent weeks.

        I was pleased to attend a meeting of the 'precinct P' alliance of schools, and I would like to take this opportunity to thank Clay McCann, the principal of Gainsborough State School, for the tireless work he does for his school and in his capacity as the chair of the alliance. I commend Clay and his colleagues—

        I also recently met with the

        principal, Karen Lindsay, and her leadership team to receive an update on their current programs and initiatives. I was pleased to attend the 2023 academic awards evening, where I presented the inaugural Cameron Caldwell MP Leadership Medal to Ewan Libke. I want to make special mention of the deputy, Tracey Eaton, on an outstanding event to recognise the students of that school.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've also been fortunate to reconnect with the Coomera Rivers State School principal, Vic Graham, and Corina Profke, the president of the P&amp;C association, and I look forward to joining the students, staff and families for their Colour Run next week.
