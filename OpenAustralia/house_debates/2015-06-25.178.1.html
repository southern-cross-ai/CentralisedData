        It is a pleasure to share with the House the achievements of Mars Food Australia, an outstanding successful local manufacturer located at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Vale" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        in my electorate of Dobell.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mars Food Australia has been located on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        for 22 years and has made an investment of $13.6 million in local manufacturing. Its state-of-the-art facility officially opened in 1992, and since then it has continued to expand operations to become one of the largest employers on the Central Coast, employing over 300 people, who work in manufacturing, engineering, market research and development, human resources, finance and supply and logistics.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rather than refer to their staff as employees, Mars refers to them as associates and each associate has a direct role to play in the pursuit of business objectives. This common purpose links all who work in the company. The majority—that is, 99 per cent—of Mars Food Australia products are manufactured at the Berkeley Vale site, with many of their quality ingredients sourced from reputable Australian suppliers and local Australian farmers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mars Food Australia is part of the privately owned
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Incorporated" rel="nofollow">
         Mars Incorporated
        </a>
        group, originally founded in the United States in 1911, that employs more than 72,000 people worldwide. Mars Food today offers over 500 products in categories as diverse as mustards, marinades, relishes, sauces, herbs and spices, pasta and stir-fry sauces. Australians would be familiar with the Mars Food brands, including Masterfoods, Dolmio, Kan Tong and

         Uncle Ben's
        </a>
        , all of which are manufactured on the Central Coast. Although most sales are in

         Australia and New Zealand

        , Mars Food Australia exports to more than 30 countries around the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a family owned, private company for over a century, Mars is guided by five principles: quality, responsibility, mutuality, efficiency and freedom. As a company they are committed to these principles. Mars Food Australia are committed to offering stimulating, high-demanding and rewarding careers, while providing excellent lifestyle choices, with their facilities located in major regional centres such as the Berkeley Vale site. With their emphasis on providing a great place to work, Mars were recognised and named in the

        's top 25 best places to work in Australia. They were the winner of the 2013 Australian Corporate Health and Productivity Management Award, having been nominated by their associates, many of whom have worked for the company for more than 10 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mars Food Australia supports local charities and community projects throughout Australia. This support is focused on three themes that reflect and complement their business: environment, which contributes to a safer, cleaner and healthier environment; healthy active lifestyle, promoting sport and healthy eating; and pet welfare, supporting the welfare of animals. In terms of community engagement with the Central Coast, Mars Food Australia donated more than $400,000 in 2013 alone to local community partners and 481 hours to local charity, and has donated more than 360 food hampers to local organisations every year. Another example of community support is Mars Food's sponsorship under the Masterfoods brand of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast_Mariners" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast Mariners
        </a>
        . Many of us who attend the Mariners home games at Gosford stadium have also been entertained by the flying sauce bottles that are part of Mars Food's sponsorship. Mars have also provided assistance to local charities such as St Vincent de Paul at Wyong and Coast Shelter that provide assistance for the homeless.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mars Food Australia has a clear purpose and vision as an employer of choice for Central Coast residents: to make food today for a better world tomorrow. Mars Food has a commitment to excellence that extends to being a leader in improving the health and nutrition of Australians. It is committed to the production of healthier and tastier food that Australians share every day with their families and friends. Eighty per cent of Australian homes have at least one Mars product in the pantry and 68 Mars Food Australia products have been granted the National Heart Foundation's tick. Mars Food Australia continues to improve the nutritional value of its recipes. Through reformulation, it has added one million kilos of vegetables per year to Australian diets. This is equivalent to nearly 13.5 million serves per year.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are many social benefits for families that come together to share a meal at least once a week. They are more likely to eat healthier foods, less likely to experience eating disorders and, according to the

        , less likely to suffer from substance abuse. A key member of many families is the family pet. Mars has also created better lifestyles for these treasured family members with the production of products to promote pet nutrition and wellbeing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mars Food Australia is a prime example of an outstanding corporate citizen who leads by example. I invite other such corporates to follow Mars Food's lead and consider making my electorate your next corporate home. We will make you most welcome.
