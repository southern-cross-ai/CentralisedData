       <p>
        I rise today to highlight the continued success of Louise Adams in this year's
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Factor" rel="nofollow">
          X Factor
         </a>
        </i>
        competition. Louise is a versatile performer and new mum from my home town of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt_Gambier" rel="nofollow">
         Mt Gambier
        </a>
        . Louise has made it through to the grand final of this year's competition after surviving an elimination sing-off against
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_T" rel="nofollow">
         Big T
        </a>
        . It was a nail-biting contest which came down to a split judges' panel decision. The decision was turned over to the public to determine who went home and I am happy to say that Louise won the day.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is fair to say that Mt Gambier has gone Louise Adams crazy. There is palpable excitement across the city as we approach the final of
        <i>

        <i>

        </i>
        , which is to be held over the next two nights. Louise enjoyed a superstar homecoming to Mt Gambier when she visited last week with her mentor,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Blunt" rel="nofollow">
         James Blunt
        </a>
        . Some 6,000 locals turned out to hear her perform and it was quite a show. I would like to take this opportunity to say that I am proud of Louise's achievements this far. I know the whole electorate is behind her as she prepares for the final, and I know this is just the beginning of what is certainly going to become a successful career in the music industry. Louise is an inspiration to the people of Mt Gambier and I commend her on her efforts. I should note that I have had the privilege of working with Louise as a solicitor in Mt Gambier. I note that people across my electorate of Barker will join me with their continued support of Louise long into the future, regardless of the outcome of the
        <i>
         X Factor
        </i>
        competition, which I have every confidence Louise will win.
