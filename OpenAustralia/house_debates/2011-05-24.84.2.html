        On Saturday, 14 May it was my pleasure to attend the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Evelyn" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Evelyn
        </a>
        Football Club for a very special celebration for a great club builder and stalwart in Ted Jenkinson. Ted started playing at the club in 1946. He became a club member in 1945. The Mount Evelyn Football Club was founded in 1931, which means that Ted Jenkinson has been part of the club's history for 66 of those 80 years. Not only did he play with the club, he has been instrumental in the club's development of nearly seven decades. He was the inspiration behind the founding of the junior football club back in 1970. He has been on the club committee too many times to remember. He is, of course, a life member of the club. He has been one of the key organisers of the club's website with the history of the club. It was a very special occasion for the Mount Evelyn Football Club and the Mount Evelyn community.

        My friend, the member for Holt, who I know spends a bit of time like me looking at history would be interested in an anecdote I pointed out: if Ted started playing in 1945, two great things happened in 1945. One, of course, was the end of World War

        . The other was Carlton defeating

        in the bloodbath grand final played at

        . I pointed this out to Ted—he is not a Carlton supporter—but now we know three great things happened in 1945.

        Ted has put in a wonderful contribution to the club and it was great to see all of his family there: Jennifer, Robyn, Aaron, James and Daryl, who came along for the special occasion. To the club President,

        , who does a wonderful job, and the club committee: congratulations on a wonderful day. It culminated with the presentation to Ted of a plaque and the opening of the Ted Jenkinson Wing, known as Pinky's Wing, where he has watched countless games of football over many years. There is a sign on the wing at the Mount Evelyn football ground to mark his great service over the last 66 years to the Mount Evelyn Football Club.
