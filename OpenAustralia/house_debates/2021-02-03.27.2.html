        In December last year, Ipswich lost one of its greatest leaders. Former mayor Des Freeman passed away at the age of 95. He lived with his wife Colleen in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Ipswich" rel="nofollow">
         East Ipswich
        </a>
        for many decades. Des was a life member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        , having joined it in 1961. He served as Ipswich's mayor from 1979 to 1991. He received an Order of Australia for his services to local government and the community. Des left school at the age of 13 to work on the family dairy farm in Tallegalla. He ended up working in a local coalmine because the pay was better, and for 40 years he served as a union rep and worked for better conditions for workers and their families. He served on the local ambulance and fire brigade boards and chaired the local health authority.
       </p>

        Both Des and Colleen have been community minded and, motivated by their Catholic faith, committed their lives to the service of others. Beloved and deeply respected, they were a formidable leadership team in Ipswich. They were married for 65 years. Des's time in Ipswich is to be remembered. He oversaw major transformations—huge investments in sewerage, water infrastructure and flood recovery—and he transformed the Ipswich CBD. Des never forgot his roots. He was a true believer, a man of integrity and determination, a mentor to many and a hero to me. His legacy lives on. My sincere condolences to Colleen and family. Vale Des Freeman.
