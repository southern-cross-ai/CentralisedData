        has been not only an extraordinary success for the host city but a great success for Australia as well. Currently, and I do say 'currently' because of the medal tally is going over like an odometer at the moment, we have won, as before

        , 123 medals, including 46 gold. There are joyous stories everywhere we look, and breakout stars announcing themselves on the world stage as well as household names showing their class. There are five days to go but there is lots more for us to look forward to.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want, on behalf of the parliament and all Australians, to congratulate the competitors and those people behind the scenes too—the dedicated support staff and coaches but also the proud loved ones, the mums and dads who took little Ariarne or other swimmers off to swimming training at 5 am, day after day, to make an enormous difference.

        Emma McKeon has become the greatest Commonwealth Games athlete of all time, with a total of 14 gold medals, six of which were won at these games. Jess Stenson triumphed in the women's marathon but soon after embraced her teammates and fellow mums

        and Sinead Diver to share the moment with them. In the T53/54 wheelchair marathon, Maddie de Rozario triumphed again. Ariarne Titmus won gold and set a games record in the 400-metre freestyle. She won the treble—200, 400 and 800. Sprinter

        claimed the Australian athletics team's 200th Commonwealth Games gold medal, winning the men's T37/T38 100-metre sprint. Our oldest team member, 63-year-old lawn bowler Cheryl Lindfield, at her first Commonwealth Games, won the silver medal in the para-pairs B6-B8 with partner Serena Bonnell. The men's wheelchair basketball team won gold in the 3x3. Nina Kennedy cleared 4.6 metres to win gold in the women's pole vault. The women's rugby sevens team claimed their first ever Commonwealth Games gold medal, defeating Fiji 22-12. Paralympic swimmer

        finished fifth in Birmingham, in her very last event before retirement—a true champion.

       <p>
        In coming days we look forward to the Diamonds, our women cricketers and Peter Bol in the 800-metre final. We look forward to watching these wonderful competitors who—for those who continue in sport over next four years—will be in regional Victoria when regional Victoria hosts the games in 2026. To all involved: well done.

         I join the Prime Minister in congratulating our

         team. The most important news, of course, is that we are 20 medals ahead of England. That's a great accomplishment. I wanted to get it in, just in case it tightens over the next few days. But having 46 gold and a total of 123 medals so far is a great credit not just to the athletes but to the trainers and to their family members—all of those back here and those who have been able to travel—who have sacrificed an enormous amount, including the sacrifice that the parents made during the athletes' childhood in turning up to training regularly. It is a credit to the coaches and to all of those that have provided sponsorship. It is an incredible accomplishment not just personally but for those who love and surround those athletes.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to acknowledge the top four Australian individual medal winners being women, the rugby sevens win and the Australian women's cricket, netball and hockey teams, to name a few still in the medal hunt. It shows the strength of women's sport here in Australia.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to say thank you very much to all of those who are glued to their

         s, providing encouragement and sending messages. That is incredibly important, because I know that the athletes read those messages and are encouraged by them.
        </p>
        <p>
         There have been amazing individual performances: Mollie O'Callaghan obviously bursting onto the world stage, and Emma McKeon's beautiful performance, winning her 18th Commonwealth Games medal. These are truly magnificent Australians who make us very proud. Sport is a great unifier and an incredible part of the fabric of Australian society. We celebrate their success to date and what will unfold between now and the closing of the games.
