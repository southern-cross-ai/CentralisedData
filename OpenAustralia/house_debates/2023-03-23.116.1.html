        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Change
        </a>
        confirms what my community on the north side of Brisbane already knowsâ€”there is a rapidly closing window for real climate action both at home and around the world. Global warming has increased at an unprecedented rate over the past decade. By the 2030s, every region in the world is expected to face increasing risks from climate change. We know that this will have a devastating impact on our communities, just as my community saw last year during the unprecedented February floods.
       </p>
       <p>
        After a decade of denial and delay, Australia finally has a federal government that is committed to taking serious action on climate change, not just talking about it. As part of our Powering Australia plan, the Albanese government is it investing in the decarbonisation of existing industries and the creation of new clean energy industries through our $1.9 billion Powering the Regions Fund. At least $600 million of this will assist safeguard facilities in reducing their emissions through energy efficiency upgrades, shifts to lower carbon processes or fuel switching to electrification, hydrogen and biofuels. The safeguard mechanism laws are the first chance to implement the transformative climate action that my community has been begging for, real action that actually gets us down to net-zero after a decade of delay and dysfunction.

        Northsiders are always quick to step forward when a friend or neighbour needs a helping hand. Volunteers are the backbone of our community and their selfless contributions make all of our lives better. While we know these volunteers do not do their work for the credit, their hard work does deserve to be recognised and appreciated. If you know a Lilley resident, business or community groups who deserves to be recognised for their volunteer work and community spirit, please nominate them for a Lilley volunteer award. Award recipients will be announced during National Volunteers Week in May.

        Northside families are getting excited for Welcoming the Babies, a proud annual tradition in our community more than 20 years strong. The pram pro-am running of the babies is back this year, hopefully, with a drier track than last year. My twins are sporting several more kilos than last year, so we are not the favourites. If you're taking up the challenge, make sure to bring your A game and strap your baby into their pram, as there will be prizes up for grabs for the winners. Free activities will also be a available for the kids at Welcoming the Babies including a petting zoo, a jumping castle, facepainting and arts and crafts. There will also be early education information stalls for mums and dads and, I hear, a visit from the
