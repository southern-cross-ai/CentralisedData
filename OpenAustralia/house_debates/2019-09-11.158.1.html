        Today I want to highlight the work of two local councils in my electorate of Menzies—namely, Nillumbik and Manningham—that work towards preventing domestic violence, promoting gender equality and helping our children who are struggling with a range of issues affecting their long-term health and wellbeing. First, Nillumbik Shire Council is offering grants of up to $500 to community groups as part of its 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence campaign. These grants are to support awareness-raising community led projects that will be undertaken from 25 November to 10 December this year. For anybody interested in making an application for one of these grants, they close on Friday 20 September. People can visit the website nillumbik.vic.gov.au for further information.

        In Manningham, the mayoral ball will be held this year on Friday 25 October and all proceeds will go towards supporting the welfare organisation Doncare, which is celebrating its 50th anniversary serving the Manningham community. Funds raised will expand Doncare's service provision in response to the increasing demand for private support for vulnerable children. One of the programs, the Resilient Kids—Positive Futures program, provides a holistic response to children struggling with anxiety and depression; trauma caused by bullying, social issues, family breakdown or family violence; social exclusion due to disadvantage; self-esteem and self-confidence issues; and academic pressures.
       </p>
       <p>
        Through the children's counselling program, family violence services and information and emergency relief services, Doncare comes into contact with a large number of children presenting with complex issues. For example, 75 per cent of children attending counselling have experienced violence, 11 per cent of children aged 12 to 17 have self-harmed, 17 per cent of students in Manningham have been bullied at school, and 41 per cent of parents with children aged four to 11 did not seek help for their children because they could not afford it. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, this is a relatively well-off area of Melbourne, and these are concerning and indeed alarming statistics in relation to what's happening with many young people in the area.
       </p>
       <p>
        Doncare's priority is to provide support and education to prevent the additional stress on families which increases adolescents' vulnerability. Once again I urge anybody listening to this broadcast or reading
        <i>

        who wants to support the wonderful work that Doncare does in Manningham to buy a ticket to the mayoral ball. That can be done by visiting manningham.vic.gov.au.
