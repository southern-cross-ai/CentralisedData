         I thank the member for his question, and let me assure the member I am all for the facts in this debate. In fact, one of the sharpest contrasts between the government and the opposition in this debate is: we are dealing with the facts; you are dealing with fear. We accept the climate change science; you do not. We accept the advice of economists that the most efficient way to act is to price carbon; you do not. We accept the collection of data from around the world about how other economies are moving, including China, and we have asked the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Productivity_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Productivity Commission
         </a>
         to report on that very fact; and I have got no doubt whatsoever when the Productivity Commission comes out with its work, then over there on the opposition benches they will distort it, they will misquote and they will go on a campaign of misleading to fit with their fear campaign, which is drawing them closer and closer to the extremes of Australian politics.

          Mr Speaker, on a point of order: the Prime Minister has been speaking for one minute and she has not addressed China or the quote from the chairman of

           The member for Casey could also look at the second and concluding aspects of his question. We now get into this debate about whether things are relevant or directly relevant, and there was the expression ‘relevant to part’. I believe we are left with that it can be directly relevant to part as well. So far the Prime Minister’s response, whilst overly debating, is still directly relevant to the second part. The Prime Minister has the call.

            Thank you very much in directing my attention to the second part of the question that the member asked me. The second part of the question would lead people to conclude that somehow having a price on carbon, advocating a price on carbon, does not mean that you care about Australian jobs. Well, let me quote a statement from someone who had the aspiration to have ‘the most comprehensive emissions trading scheme anywhere in the world’. Would the member assert that the person who said that did not care about Australian jobs? Then let me go on and quote words by the same person, who said:

              will resume his place. I am listening to the answer, but when a question concludes with ‘why is she insisting on the introduction of a carbon tax that will—‘ and adds argument, I think that I am obliged to listen carefully to where this is going. But the Prime Minister knows that she needs to be directly relevant, and the Prime Minister has the call.

               Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. Those words that I used, ‘the most comprehensive emissions trading scheme anywhere in the world’ are the words of former Prime Minister
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Howard" rel="nofollow">
                John Howard
               </a>
               . In saying those words, why was John Howard then insisting on a price on carbon the way I am insisting on one now? I would suggest it is because we went through exactly the same thought processes, which is: climate change is real. I believe John Howard accepted the science.

When he received it he read it and responded to it rationally—something that the opposition is now incapable of: reading, thinking and responding rationally—and, having done that, he determined that the best way forward for this country was an emissions trading scheme. He said the nation should price carbon. I believe the nation should price carbon, and that is why we will bring legislation to the Australian parliament to do just that.

                     Order! The Prime Minister will resume her seat. I am now completely aware that because so many people talk and yell they do not listen. I said, ‘The Prime Minister will conclude her answer’—and the yells continued. The Prime Minister has the call and I have invited her to conclude her answer.
