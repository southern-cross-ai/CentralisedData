        My question is to the Minister for Defence Industry. How is the Albanese Labor government investing in Australia's defence industry? Why is it important to implement better policies for the future of this critical industry sector?

        </p>
        <p>
         The government will invest record amounts into the Australian defence industry. We're lifting defence spending by 0.2 per cent of

         above the current trajectory by the end of the decade. We're investing in nation-building projects to construct nuclear powered conventionally armed submarines in Australia. This will not only give the ADF the capability it needs; it will support Australian industry, jobs and the economy. It will create 20,000 high-skilled secure jobs. It stands in stark contrast to the Liberal Party that wanted them built in Japan and then were on and off again with the Attack class. And, as recently as March this year, the opposition leader—

           Mr Speaker, I'm not sure if this minister wasn't listening when the earlier point of order was taken, which you upheld. Once again, we've got a commendably drafted question, but this minister is now ranging freely across matters which are not within the scope of the question, and he should be brought back to the question.

             On the point of order, I draw your attention to the second half of the question which asked, 'Why is it important to implement better policies for the future?', which goes directly to 'better than what'. You can't describe something as being better without providing the comparison.

              <p>
               As recently as March this year, the opposition leader was arguing that all the new submarines should be built in the United States, surrendering 20,000 Aussie jobs. We're not just increasing defence funding and capability investment but we're also spending that money wisely, guided by the priorities of the Defence Strategic Review, including on guided weapons. For the last two years, those on the opposite side talked about guided weapons, but what did they produce when they were in power? It was one thing—a single media release. By contrast, we've moved $1.5 billion into the forward estimates, and we'll be making missiles in this country in 2025. Australia will have a missile manufacturing industry in two years time, increasing our self-reliance and sovereignty.
              </p>
              <p>
               Industry also needs clarity. We've done that through the Defence Strategic Review, and we'll build on this work in the upcoming Defence Industry Development Strategy. I'm also asked, 'Why it is important to have better defence industry policies?' The truth is that it's because we've inherited 10 years of neglect and mismanagement. When the opposition leader was defence minister, he left 28 major defence projects running a combined 97 years late and $6½ billion over project. He had a naval shipbuilding college that spent $114 million and trained zero Australians. By contrast, the Albanese government is taking defence and the defence industry seriously. We won't have a revolving door of ministers. Unlike those opposite, we've shown that we care more about capabilities for the ADF than photo-ops and empty promises.
