       <p>
        I rise today to speak on a culturally unique experience that takes place annually in my electorate of Curtin, the Sculpture by the Sea exhibition. In fact, one of my very first contributions in this chamber was to put on record the importance of this event to my local community and my home state of WA.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now in its 16th year, and this year running from 6 to 23 March, this event attracts established and emerging artists from all over the world to showcase their incredible works of art in the beautiful setting of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cottesloe_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Cottesloe Beach
        </a>
        . The event brings artists to huge audiences and makes art come alive to thousands of people who might not otherwise be exposed to the beauty of sculpture. It brings together the community, from young to old; it has a strong educational program; and it's a huge boost to tourism and the local economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        A recent Oxford Economics report evaluating the 2019 exhibition confirmed the overwhelmingly positive economic benefits that this event brings to WA and to my local community. The exhibition attracts people to holiday, to see our sites and to spend money at our local businesses, boosting our economy and creating jobs. It was estimated that in 2019 the event contributed $6.8 million in direct interstate and international spending, and $13.7 million in total spending for WA. The event attracted over 210,000 visitors in 2019, including 3,500 people from interstate and overseas who came to Perth specifically to see the exhibition. I know, from talking and meeting with the local businesses in my electorate, how important this annual event is to them and how much they gain from it economically.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, the long-term future of Sculpture by the Sea is uncertain. This is a consequence of the increased popularity of the event, with the cost of producing it continuing to rise, now to the tune of approximately $2.2 million per annum. On this note, it is both surprising and disappointing that the state Labor government won't commit any substantial funding after 2020 for the exhibition's sustainability into the future, particularly given its positive economic and tourism components. I'm also disappointed that the funding provided by the

        for the Arts is coming to an end, particularly in light of the council's recent report into the positive impact of arts and creativity on Australia's tourism strategies and the economy more broadly. So I will continue, alongside my WA state colleague Dr David Honey
