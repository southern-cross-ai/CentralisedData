      <h4>
       Petitions
      </h4>
      <h5>
       Syria
      </h5>
      <p class="italic">
       To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives:
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       This Petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House:
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Since early March of 2011, the citizens of Syria have been calling for their
       <i>
        freedom of speech, basic rights, freeing of political prisoners
       </i>
       and for
       <i>
        democracy
       </i>
       through peaceful demonstrations. In reaction to these protests, the Syrian government has put all their efforts into suppressing these calls by cutting off food supplies to cities and medical supplies to the injured, silencing protestors through barbaric killings by means of security agencies. Up till now,
       <i>
        over a thousand
       </i>
       people have been
       <i>
        murdered
       </i>
       , including
       <i>
        innocent
       </i>
       <i>
        women and children
       </i>
       , with thousands more citizens forced to flee their homeland.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       The Syrian embassy in Canberra has also been adding to the suffering of the citizens in Syria. Syrian diplomats from the Syrian Embassy have been sent by the Syrian government to spy on Australian's of Syrian heritage. As a result, many Australian's of Syrian heritage have had their families in Syria threatened for taking part in protests against the Syrian government.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       We therefore ask the House:
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       To
       <i>
        urge
       </i>
       the United Nations to take
       <i>
        immediate
       </i>
       action in protecting the citizens in Syria from these atrocities being committed by the Syrian government's tyrannical regime and to
       <i>
        close down
       </i>
       the Syrian Embassy.
      </p>
      <p>
       from 14 citizens
      </p>
