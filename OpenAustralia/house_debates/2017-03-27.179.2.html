       <p>
        It gives me great pleasure today to introduce members of the Wodonga &amp; District Turf Club and friends to the House, because we want to pay tribute to the Victorian turf club volunteer of the year 2016, Mr Terry Maher.
       </p>
       <p>
        Terry was born to a strong racing family. His dad and mum, Jack and Monica Maher, were already entrenched on the committee of the Wodonga &amp; District Turf Club. From day 1, Terry was around horses and always going to land a role in the industry. As a 17-year-old aspiring trainer, Terry joined the Wodonga &amp; District Turf Club committee alongside his dad, Jack, who was president from 1958 to 1960.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Maher family, I have to say, is a three-generation racing family in our community. We currently have Terry and Gail working. We have Peter and Julie Maher, Jack, Sam and Alex. It is not often you get a chance in parliament to sing the tributes of a family that has made such a difference to our local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Not only has Terry been awarded volunteer of the year; I would also like to acknowledge Kevin, Paul and Tom, who have made the effort to come to parliament today, because we are seeking funding to build a convention centre at the Wodonga race club. It is already a fantastic facility, and we want to make it bigger and better. I know this is the right committee to do it, and I am calling on the minister to come forward and give us the funding we need. Thank you.
