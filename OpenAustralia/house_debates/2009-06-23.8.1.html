           When I referred a dealer to the Treasurer’s office for assistance, did he have a phone conversation with the dealer before referring them to the Treasury? Did the Treasurer also receive updates on this case to his home fax?

                  <p>
                   I have always sought as a member of parliament and as a minister to deal as directly as I possibly can with people who have problems, and in this case there were lots of car dealers with some very big financial headaches and the employment of thousands of Australians was on the line. So, many, many people were calling my ministerial office, many people were calling the Treasury directly and many people were going through their industry organisation, and all of these things were being handled in the Treasury. As regards those that contacted my office, they were all forwarded on to the Treasury to be dealt with as quickly and as effectively as was possible. Certainly, many were. It is also the case that some dealerships may not have fitted the criteria for assistance that could have been provided either through
                   <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OzCar" rel="nofollow">
                    OzCar
                   </a>
                   or by existing finance companies. I am more than happy to follow up the details that the member for Grey has asked about, but the one thing that I can say is that the government and I, through all of these times, were motivated by one central factor, and that was to support the industry at a time of global financial crisis that was threatening jobs and threatening the supply chain right through to the auto manufacturers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   This was a very serious situation. Many people thought that they were indeed probably going to lose their finance by March. That is what it was like in February and, as I indicated to the House the other day, the Prime Minister and other ministers and I spent a lot of time on this issue through that period—day after day working with the Treasury; day after day making sure that we could get OzCar up and running, knowing through all of the period while OzCar was not up and running the only option available to the Treasury, which was in receipt of the information about those financiers who were staying in the market and those dealers who might be without finance, was to work with them all. There were updates coming through to me through that period. Some did go to my home fax. Many went to my email tray in the office. It just depended on where I was. But, in relation to the ones that went to my home fax from Mr Grech, they simply went there because he hit ‘reply all’ to a communication from my office. That is why they ended up there. I never asked for them to be sent there—in the first instance—by Mr Grech because my office was using my home fax to put a lot of material through. I do not apologise for one minute for having sensitive material sent to my home fax, because during this period we were working right around the clock, not only on this issue but on many other issues. I do recall that, as we were doing this, we were opposed every inch of the way by those opposite. So not every car dealer sought a conversation, but I certainly hope that every car dealer that went through my office got the treatment they should have received through the Treasury.

                    <p>
                     I thank the member for Cunningham for her question. Misuse of public resources is of course a serious matter. With respect to investigation of any allegations of misuse of public resources, anybody who has any knowledge or any involvement or any connection with such alleged misuse has an obligation to make information available to investigating authorities to help clear up the matter.

                     I would remind members of an investigation that is currently occurring with respect to an email, which has now been determined to be a fake email, that was, according to the

                      Australian Federal Police
                     </a>
                     , created on a Treasury computer and emailed from Treasury to the computer at the home of Mr Grech. Although it was subsequently deleted from the Treasury computer, the
                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFP" rel="nofollow">

                     </a>
                     was able to determine the origins of the email. In response to these extraordinary events, the government has been quite prepared to make available all of its computer records with respect to the inquiries that are proceeding—by both the Auditor-General and the Australian Federal Police—in order to ensure that they can complete their investigations and that they can get all of the available information that they can in order to determine whether any offences have been committed and, if so, by whom. Unfortunately, the opposition thus far have not agreed to make available their email and computer records to the inquiry by the Australian Federal Police in order to assist in the investigation of these matters in order to determine the origins of the email and any parties involved in its dissemination or in any way connected to the email and its dissemination more broadly.

I might add, having indicated to the chamber that I will listen carefully to the answers, whilst I appreciate that some might not appreciate the robustness of the answer, the answer has not gone into territory which should cause concern under the standing orders.

                                     r TANNER—Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I will not further speculate on what the Leader of the Opposition means by full cooperation, but I would in conclusion draw your attention to a few statements that have been made today by the Leader of the Opposition and by the shadow Treasurer, the member for
                                     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
                                      North Sydney
                                     </a>
                                     . I note, for example, that when he was asked on
                                     <i>
                                      Sunrise
                                     </i>
                                     today whether he had ever seen the fake email the Leader of the Opposition said that he was ‘not going to compromise the police investigation by answering that question’. I note also that there has been some confusion between the Leader of the Opposition and the member for North Sydney with respect to contacts that may have occurred between them and Mr Grech prior to the Senate hearing on Friday, which is when this matter first appeared in the public domain. I note, for example, that the shadow Treasurer stated on the doors, ‘I’d imagine people in the opposition did have contact with Treasury officials,’ in response to the question, ‘Did you or anybody in the Liberal Party have contact with Mr Grech prior to his testimony?’ Then the shadow Treasurer said, ‘I would expect that this is the case. I don’t want to compromise police investigations at all.’ In other words, far from providing full cooperation, they are now using the existence of police investigations as an excuse to maintain a smokescreen and to refuse to answer questions about their knowledge of these matters.

                                     <i>

                                     , the shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney, when asked what his knowledge of the email was, said:

I think that the way this question is being answered is an imputation and an improper reflection on members, in particular the Leader of the Opposition. I would ask that you rule this out of order.

There was nothing said after that caused me to change my mind. As I have indicated before, sometimes there are things said in this place, because of its robust nature, that cause concern for people. But I have listened carefully to the minister for finance. He will respond to the question and, as I have invited him to do, he will commence to sum up his answer.

                                                 Thank you, Mr Speaker. I would remind the House in conclusion that what we are dealing with here is the fallout from an accusation made in public on Friday against the Prime Minister alleging that he was corrupt and that he had lied to the Australian people. That is what we are dealing with. I will read the quotation for you again, if you would like. That is what we are dealing with. I note, and his behaviour today is underlining it, that on 25 August 2008 the member for Warringah described the Leader of the Opposition thus:
                                                </p>
                                                <p class="italic">
                                                 At his worst, Malcolm can be a bit of a volcano.

                                                           I do think the Leader of the Opposition, and the opposition as a whole, have got some very serious questions to answer, because they have been involved in a grubby smear campaign against the Prime Minister and myself and particularly my family. They have been very active in the last four or five days putting around their smears against the Prime Minister and myself. What has happened in the last few days is that the basis of that smear has now emerged—there has been a fake email, which the Leader of the Opposition—

Where does he get that logic? He has no credibility—no credibility whatsoever. All of this today is just to camouflage the very serious questions that each and every one of those frontbenchers over there needs to answer. Did any member of the opposition or their staff have an electronic or hard copy of the text of the email in their possession before Friday? Did any of them? When did any member of the opposition or their staff first see the text of the fake email?
