       <p>
        During 2017 complaints about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
         NBN
        </a>
        rollout skyrocketed across the Bendigo electorate. On a daily basis we were receiving phone calls and complaints from constituents and businesses about their experience with NBN and the rollout. That prompted the launch of an electorate-wide survey asking people to detail their experiences. Remarkably, over 3,000 surveys were returned via post, with central Victorians complaining about their experiences. The results are presented in this report that I have in front of me. The findings are damning and highlight the government's complete failure to deliver the NBN speeds that central Victorians need and the reliability that central Victorians both need and were promised. The summary of the findings include: three out of four people complained about their internet connection; 73 per cent of those surveyed said that the connection to the NBN resulted in an unreliable service, slow service, unusual speeds and dropouts; 27 per cent of the electorate is still on

        , refusing to connect to the NBN until it's a more reliable service; 80 per cent of people on Sky Muster have said that they've experienced slow speeds; and 25 per cent said that they've had an increase in bills. This is from one electorateâ€”a damning report on the Prime Minister's failure to deliver the internet speeds that central Victorians need.
