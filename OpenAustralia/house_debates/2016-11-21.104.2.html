         <p>
          Thank you, Mr Speaker, apologies. In relation to the bill, which is the Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2016, perhaps the most significant reforms in this bill relate to increasing access to treatment for mental health disorders, which, thanks to the good work of support and advocacy services in this field, the Australian community is having a growing understanding about.
         </p>
         <p>
          Around 150,000 veterans with service related disabilities are being supported by the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Veterans'_Affairs" rel="nofollow">
           Department of Veterans' Affairs
          </a>
          and of these almost 50,000 have an accepted mental health disorder. This means that nearly a third of service related disabilities that are supported by the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVA" rel="nofollow">
           DVA
          </a>
          are accepted mental health disorders. Increasing access to treatment for these disorders is a very good thing. Common conditions include anxiety disorder, depression, stress disorder and alcohol dependence. The stigma of mental health disorders has long been at issue in the greater community, but it can be an even greater challenge to deal with in the military, where Defence Force personnel are trained with a high degree of discipline, encouraged to deal with adversity and to get on with the sometimes dangerous task at hand.
         </p>
         <p>
          In 2010, the ADF mental health prevalence and wellbeing study, which covered nearly half of all ADF members, found that within a 12-month period almost 18 per cent had sought help for stress or emotional, mental health or family problems. More than 27 per cent were concerned that reporting a mental disorder might result in them being treated differently. Almost 27 per cent of personnel feared their career might be harmed, and almost 37 per cent worried that reporting a mental health condition might reduce their opportunities for future deployment. The study found that personnel who were not deployed had the same rate of mental health disorders as those who had been deployed. That may say something about the challenges of military life quite apart from the challenges of active service. Sadly, the number of ADF members contemplating or planning suicide was found to be double the rate of the general population.
         </p>
         <p>
          This bill seeks to remove delays and impediments for tens of thousands of eligible current and former members of the Australian defence forces by helping them secure early intervention and treatment for a range of mental health conditions. We know that experts point out that early intervention in mental health conditions result in much more effective treatment and better outcomes.
         </p>
         <p>
          Post-traumatic stress disorder is a well-known condition facing many veterans, especially but not limited to those who have seen active service in recent theatres like Iraq and Afghanistan. Previously, Defence Force members were required to have either three years of continuous service or operational service and then lodge an application under the Veterans' Entitlements Act, and have a diagnosis confirmed to then be able to access immediate, non-liability health care. These rules meant that they were denied early treatment and the chance for improved health outcomes. It makes no sense to treat people who suffer the same conditions differently. After all, the impact of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTSD" rel="nofollow">
           PTSD
          </a>
          on the individual does not alter in scale according to their particular service record. Again, it just makes sense to treat patients with the same level of compassion.
         </p>
         <p>
          This change will benefit those affected by post-traumatic stress disorder and a range of other conditions, including depression disorder, anxiety disorder, alcoholism and substance abuse. It will see an estimated 67,000 additional current and former ADF members become eligible for non-liability health care.
         </p>
         <p>
          At this point, I would like to acknowledge the advocacy of an old friend, Jason Parrish, a long-time Army reservist of many years who has regularly brought to my attention this unfair restriction on gaining help by virtue of time of service. I hope the sensible changes supported by Labor are welcomed by Jason and his comrades in arms in the West.
         </p>
         <p>
          Importantly, this bill also helps victims of abuse in the ADF who have found themselves ineligible because of the period of service in which they served. The issue of abuse—sexual, physical or psychological—has been a stain on our military. This provision goes some way to further addressing this issue by demonstrating compassion and justice to those victims. In relation to this challenging time in our Defence Force, I commend the actions of my friend the Hon.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Smith" rel="nofollow">
           Stephen Smith
          </a>
          who as defence minister did so much to shine a light on practices of bullying and assault. Without confronting this behaviour, reform in our Defence Force would have been impossible. In signs of great progress, our military have acknowledged the shortcomings in their culture and have done good things and worked very hard to ensure that a culture exists that meets the expectations of the community, from which Defence Force members come and to which they return following their service.
         </p>
         <p>
          The other reform in this bill aligns the cut-off age for incapacity payments to the increased pension age. Again, this is a relatively small and routine change that benefits only a particular number of Australians each year, but it is a big and important change for the individuals concerned who will benefit from it. The stories of the brave women and men who have defended our country and ideals of Western liberal democracy around the world are part of the fabric of Australian culture. Our soldiers, sailors and aircrew have sacrificed so much, up to and including their lives. It is a debt we can never fully repay.
         </p>
         <p>
          With this bill we can at least show our appreciation to both current and former ADF members. With it we can show understanding to those families who support both current and former
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Defence Force
          </a>
          members through thick and thin. I understand that the total financial cost of all of these changes to Australian taxpayers is estimated at just under $44 million by 30 June 2020. I am sure the Australian people would not baulk at this investment for the welfare of our current service personnel.
         </p>
         <p>
          It has been my pleasure to speak on this very important bill today. I want to thank the shadow minister for veterans affairs, the Hon.
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amanda_Rishworth" rel="nofollow">
           Amanda Rishworth
          </a>
          , for so eloquently putting the opposition's position and, indeed, I thank all speakers for their valuable contribution and support of this legislation. It is always heartening and powerful to see what can be achieved in this place when both sides of the corridor work together, and this has been one of those times.
         </p>
         <p>
          It has been particularly heartening for me, the daughter and granddaughter and sister of service men, and a friend and colleague of those who have served, to speak on this bill today. The treatment of our service men and women and veterans will always be a priority for the Labor Party. With

          </i>
          ; a very moving moment. One can only guess what the emotions and feelings were amongst the families and service people going off to do their very hard and dangerous job.
         </p>
         <p>
          I look forward to continuing to work cooperatively over this term of parliament to explore what more we can do for those who are prepared to serve this country and defend it when called upon to do so.

          <p>
           I am particularly proud to speak on this Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget And Other Measures) Bill 2016 this afternoon. My mother was a war widow. Her husband was in the 2nd/28th Battalion and was killed while serving in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
            New Guinea
           </a>
           . So matters to do with our Defence Force members and veterans are very close to my heart.
          </p>
          <p>
           I want to acknowledge the outstanding work that is done by
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
            RSL
           </a>
           s right around Australia and particularly those in my electorate of Forest. I also want to acknowledge, because I take part in the Defence Force program on a regular basis, this afternoon that I have
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrant_Officer" rel="nofollow">
            Warrant Officer
           </a>
           Sean Campbell spending some time with me in the House this week, in the reciprocal program, learning about the role of a member of parliament. I have had firsthand access to our outstanding people—they are not just great Defence Force members, they are absolutely outstanding people.
          </p>
          <p>
           The launch of the program was held here today in
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
            Parliament House
           </a>
           . I would encourage all members of this place to take the opportunity to spend time with our Defence Force members on deployment or wherever the opportunity comes. It gives you firsthand experience of what life is like wherever our Defence Force members are serving. You get to see how well they are trained and how passionate they are about their work. It is also good for them to have access to members of parliament, and they can talk directly to us about the issues they face whilst on deployment as well as issues faced by their families.
          </p>
          <p>
           I am particularly pleased to talk about this bill today but, more importantly, to talk about the people who will be better off as a result of measures in this bill. We do recognise very well that our current and former Defence Force members develop a range of mental and physical conditions and the earlier they seek treatment the more effective the likely health and other outcomes will be. So streamlining the process is particularly important. That is one thing contained in this bill. Delay causes uncertainty and greater stress on the applicant veteran, especially if that has to come from a range of government departments and sources. That is the sort of thing this bill is amending and it is contained throughout this bill.
          </p>
          <p>
           Simplifying the process is particularly relevant when you consider that around 67,000 additional current and former permanent members of the Defence Force will become eligible to receive NLHC treatment for mental-health conditions, should they have need of it as a result of this. The proposed changes will remove administrative and financial barriers to accessing mental-health care for past and present Defence Force members and will allow them to seek treatment as quickly as possible. It is an important part in achieving good long-term outcomes and increases the likelihood of an individual returning to a healthy and productive life. That is what we want to achieve, whether it is as a result of post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, alcohol-use disorders or substance-use disorders. They are some of the issues that the government, in our budget, committed $37.9 million to extend eligibility for.
          </p>
          <p>
           The changes proposed by the government in this bill will provide much greater support for our veterans and their families. I think it is critical for the coalition government to continue the support for our great service people and veterans. Nobody who understands the sacrifice of service and risks faced by our military personnel could possibly begrudge them the support that they require following their service. This government does not and will not forget our service men and women once they start receiving their pension payments.
          </p>
          <p>
           While I am here, I want to talk about the 11th/28th Battalion. I look at our reservists, who do an amazing job, and I look at the 11th/28th in my part of the world. Just last Sunday, the Royal
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
            Western Australia
           </a>
           n Regiment battle group, the11th/28th, had an Army training session in Bunbury. They showed the community how the development of life skills, with leadership and teamwork, is part of that training. People got the opportunity to see the actual equipment that they use and to talk to real soldiers. They saw some of the training and were able to find out more. I am hoping that more young people in my part of the world choose to sign up to be reservists and perhaps consider entering the Defence Force.
          </p>
          <p>
           The 11th/28th came out of what was the 2nd/28th, in which my mother's first husband served.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Leonard" rel="nofollow">
            Jack Leonard
           </a>
           was his name. He saw service in the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
            Middle East
           </a>
           as well as in New Guinea. He was one of the oldest people in Western Australia to enlist in World War
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
            II
           </a>
           . But, at that time, the war was well and truly on our doorstep and he could see what that meant for his family and his community. He was killed on the banks of the Busu River in New Guinea. It was a very rough crossing of the Busu River, and, during the night, the particular servicemen had to patrol the beach because the Japanese had a very strong foothold and were using their machine guns to keep our forces back. Jack and a 19-year-old serviceman were the forward scouts. They had to dig a hole on that beach that night, whilst the Japanese fired intermittently over their heads. It rained all night, and they had to try to keep their rifles and ammunition dry and their noses out of the water as the hole filled up. The Japanese stormed the beach the next day. Jack was found with a ring of six dead Japanese soldiers around him that he had taken on in hand-to-hand combat in that particular battle. He was killed by a head shot from a sniper.
          </p>
          <p>
           My mother was at home on the farm in Brunswick, and it was a very hot day. I read her diary, and in it she talked about the fact that the young girl from the post office rode her pushbike out to tell my mum and give her this telegram—in those days you got a telegram. My mum, with my two older sisters—these two dear little girls—got in her car, caught the train with her mother and went to a place called Bridgetown, a couple of hours away, to let Jack's mother know in person so that she did not have to hear simply by a telegram. I often think of the courage that my mother showed. That was replicated frequently by families in our part of the world. Between a couple of small towns, we lost 16 members of the Defence Force in that time. It had a profound effect right across the whole community, and it still does to this day.
          </p>
          <p>
           While I am here, I really want to acknowledge those Defence Force members who are currently operating around the world on behalf of our country. Whether it is in Afghanistan, whether it is in border protection with

           The other thing I would like to acknowledge is their extensive work in emergency services support, particularly by the reservists. We see this particularly during bushfires and floods. I understand that during the current earthquake damage in

           was deployed to assist. These are often the things that we do not actually see but that happen on a regular basis. Nothing gives our Australian communities greater confidence than to see the members of our Defence Force arrive in their communities. They are very well trained, they are very capable and their capacity with logistics in very limited circumstances is just extraordinary.
          </p>
          <p>
           I am particularly proud to have Warrant Officer Sean Campbell with us for this week. He has a very interesting history and lists his career highlights as time spent serving at sea during numerous operational deployments, including the first operational deployments for
           <i>

           and
           <i>

           , and serving as a career manager before assuming the position of ship Warrant Officer. He is an officer member of

            Engineers Australia

           , has done a range of things during his time and has served Australia in its Defence Force particularly well. While he is with us today, I will say thank you so much for everything you have done and for what your family has contributed, because it is not just the individual Defence Force member, it is the family as well who contribute to what happens.
          </p>
          <p>
           I want to speak as well about the government's initiative in the Veterans Employment Program. We know that each year around 5,000
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Defence Force
           </a>
           members leave Defence, and they want to pursue careers. We are encouraging more small to medium enterprises to see the opportunity that exists in these very well trained and capable people who are all very highly qualified. The government is pursuing a range of initiatives in this space, just another example of how committed the government is in assisting veterans or people who have chosen to leave defence for whatever reason.
          </p>
          <p>
           I spent time in Afghanistan in 2007 during a deployment in Tarin Kot and in Kandahar. We went out to a forward operating base, Camp Wali, in the Mirabad Valley. I will never forget the two young men who gave us a briefing out there. They were very young men but the most capable young people that I have come across. That capability was replicated in each one of these Defence Force programs that I have had the honour of being able to attend. Nothing quite gives you the knowledge and experience as being on the ground. The other thing it does do is give Defence Force members a direct opportunity to talk to us as members of parliament and it is amazing how much very genuine information we as members of parliament got out of that particular engagement. I will probably value forever that opportunity.
          </p>
          <p>
           I am particularly pleased to be able to support this bill today. The coalition government has taken numerous measures to support our veterans and will do so ongoing. But given the commitment that they and their families give to this nation, it is really the least we can do. I am proud to support this and I would say that if my mother were alive she would be even prouder of the work of this government.

            <p>
             It gives me great pleasure to rise to speak on the Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2016. The health and wellbeing of our returned service men and women must be one of the chief priorities of any government on any day. When it comes to our veterans, bipartisanship should always triumph. That is why I am proud to be standing here today to support the amendment on this important bill.
            </p>
            <p>
             This amendment will give equality to our returned soldiers and other service men and women similar to those of any other worker in Australia. Our veterans and their families deserve world class care and support; they do not need added stress to their life created by financial worries whilst going through health matters like
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTSD" rel="nofollow">
              PTSD
             </a>
             , depressive disorder and anxiety disorder. No worker should be on less than their normal weekly earnings when seeking treatment for work related matters and this includes our highly regarded Defence Force men and women. This is important because, currently, when a member discharges from the ADF there can be a period of time before incapacity payment amounts can be determined and while superannuation entitlements are finalised. These periods can last months and have the ability to increase the health concerns of the veterans. Some members may experience financial hardship during this period. These amendments will enable veterans to receive their normal salary during this period.
            </p>
            <p>
             Labor will always encourage and support measures designed to ensure that programs take account of the mental health requirements of veterans. Veterans' mental health continues to be an issue of significant concern, and an area in which Labor is committed to identifying where more support can be provided. Just recently I had the pleasure of presenting a certificate of appreciation to Mr Stephen Parley in my electorate, a returned serviceman who served in Afghanistan. Unfortunately Stephen has suffered many injuries and illnesses from his time serving and he spoke to me about the issue of producing evidence just to gain these entitlements. It was a fraught experience that no-one should have to go through. I thought: here is a man that has done the right thing by the country and yet, on his return, we expect him to jump through hoops to get the treatment he needs. One would assume this would be a simple process. Stephen is not alone; many face such a problem on their return. The thought of people serving our great nation, coming back to deal with a paper-shuffling process and then having to survive on less money than what they were being paid is overwhelming and, I think, un-Australian.
            </p>
            <p>
             Australians have always come to the front when their country has called them. History tells us this in graphic and tragic detail. What is less detailed is the after effect on veterans—the injuries, the addictions, the family break ups and the silent deaths. Too often, these are the stories that go unheard. I am proud to say that Tasmania has a detailed history when it comes to serving. We have sent many young men, mainly young men, and some young women off to war to proudly serve their country. It was the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boer_War" rel="nofollow">
              Boer War
             </a>
             in
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa" rel="nofollow">
              South Africa
             </a>
             which really established the pattern of overseas military service as an essential element in defence throughout Australia's colonies. The frontline of Tasmanian defence since 1899 has always been on foreign battlefields. Tasmanians have travelled the world in the name of country and queen and perhaps will do so in our own name one day. About 860 Tasmanians served in the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_African" rel="nofollow">
              South African
             </a>
             war. From 1901 to 1914, Tasmanian defence continued in the hands of a small voluntary force. A cadet system was developed, and universal military training for males between the ages of 12 and 26 was introduced in 1911.
            </p>
            <p>
             The war did open deep divisions in our community, as those of us in the Labor Party well know, but there was almost universal agreement that Tasmanian interests were tied to the needs of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire" rel="nofollow">
              British Empire
             </a>
             and that it was necessary for Tasmanians to fight overseas to help win the war. More than 13,000 Tasmanians embarked as members of many different units, including about 80 nurses and over 100 members of the air flying corps and others in the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
              Royal Australian Navy
             </a>
             . But nearly 75 percent were members of the infantry units of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Imperial_Force" rel="nofollow">
              Australian Imperial Force
             </a>
             —the 12th, 40th, 26th and 15th Battalions—and the main artillery unit, the 3rd Field Artillery Brigade. The cost was high. More than half of the Tasmanians who went were casualties. Two thousand, four hundred and thirty-two were killed, and many more were wounded in body and spirit. They returned home heroes but broken. Support fell on few and it was demanding. Stories are only now being told about what those returned men had to face and the very little support that they had over the rest of their lives. Treatment was basic and it had a dramatic effect that could not be measured in those times. One can only imagine the poor veterans' issues that were bottled up and released through abuse of substances, such as drugs and alcohol, well before better support was made available.

             , Tasmania's defence interests were again universally perceived as being served by contributing men and materiel to fight elsewhere. Tasmania itself, unlike other areas of Australia, was officially regarded as an 'isolated locality', not a likely target for attack or invasion. However, 5,000 people joined the Civil Defence Legion by the end of 1940, and Japan's entry into the war in December 1941 sharpened fears of air raids and submarine attack. About 31,000 Tasmanian men and women enlisted in the military forces, more than two-thirds joining the Army. The majority served outside Tasmania, either overseas or in other parts of Australia, and 1,066 died.

             , more than 1,500 Tasmanians serving there between 1965 and 1974. Seven hundred and four of them were conscripted national servicemen. Seventeen Tasmanians died in Vietnam. The introduction of conscription during the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War" rel="nofollow">
              Vietnam War
             </a>
             witnessed another reorganisation, to accommodate an increase in numbers. More recently, Tasmanian soldiers have continued that tradition, whilst serving in Iraq, Iran and Afghanistan, to name a few areas of modern conflict. It is these men and women who, on return, must have our fullest support, and I am pleased to say that these days I think we are better equipped as a society to provide that support. That is one of the things that this amendment legislation today seeks to address.
            </p>
            <p>
             In my electorate I have seen the great work that organisations like the vets club at Bridgewater, Mates4Mates, Gagebrook Men's Shed,
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCYC" rel="nofollow">
              PCYC

             and
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSPCA" rel="nofollow">
              RSPCA
             </a>
             do to encourage interactions with returned veterans. These organisations are bearing the load that we, in government and opposition, create when we send our service men and women off to war. The Headstone Project, which I have spoken of in this place, aims to ensure that no grave of a returned soldier goes unmarked. It is a project I fully support. Any assistance needed to care for and respect our veterans should be front and centre in this House, and it should be supported by all sides of this parliament.
            </p>
            <p>
             The bill seeks to make three specific adjustments, and I support the three amendments as tabled in the legislation. Firstly, the amendments in schedule 1 provide for payments of interim compensation to incapacitated current or former ADF members while the actual amount of compensation is being determined. Secondly, it is recognised that, for some mental health conditions, early intervention can result in better outcomes for clients. Prior to this change, ADF members were required to have three years either continuous full-time service or operational service, to lodge an application with the Veterans' Entitlements Act and to have a diagnosis. Under these changes, clients will be able to access NLHC immediately and only need to have served one full-time day. It is estimated that around 67,000 additional current and former permanent members of the ADF will become eligible to receive NLHC. This includes victims of abuse in the ADF who may have previously been excluded from NLHC coverage due to the period in which they served or the length of their service. Thirdly, schedule 3 aligns the incapacity payment cut-off age to the increases in age pension eligibility.
            </p>
            <p>
             This remains a priority area for Labor. We will continue to work cooperatively with the government over this term of parliament to explore what more can be done to support those who have served and fought for our country. I truly believe it is our duty to do so, supporting the veterans who serve this country and risk life and limb. They deserve the best possible treatment when they return home, and I think the $43.6 million this adjustment will cost is some of the best spent money by this parliament ever. I will be a proud member of parliament when the day comes that I am able to look veterans in the eye and know they have been given the best treatment and support that any Australian government could possibly put in legislation.

              The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2016 reminds me of a number of things. It reminds me of a Vietnam veteran I met at the Bulimba bowls club on Anzac Day this year, who told me about having lost more of his comrades in the past year to suicide. It reminds me of a current serving member of the armed forces I spoke with on the day of the commemoration of the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Long_Tan" rel="nofollow">
               Battle of Long Tan
              </a>
              . He spoke to me not just about suicide but also about the ongoing effects of post-traumatic stress disorder on people he had worked with and served with, who were still overseas or who were returning from overseas. It reminds me of the peacekeepers I have spoken to in my electorate, who have told me some harrowing stories of the work that they have done in places like
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
               East Timor
              </a>
              and the ongoing impacts on their lives. It reminds me of a very young former soldier I met. You probably remember that

              , and produced an exhibition called

               After Afghanistan
              </i>
              . I remember going to the exhibition when it was held in my electorate, at

              in Brisbane, and seeing the incredible paintings and meeting two people who had been the subjects of the paintings. One of them, as I say, was very young. He had joined when he was still a teenager and had gone over to Afghanistan. He would have been 22, I think. He had left the Defence Force. He was looking at what to do next with his life. He talked to me about the experience of serving over there and the experience of what it was like afterwards. But probably the most memorable part of that event was hearing someone older than me, a mature man, speak at the exhibition about his own work as a leader of soldiers in Afghanistan and seeing him cry in the middle of his speech, in front of all these people, and, in doing so, really talk about the impact of service on him.

              and suicide following military service. It was a great service that was conducted just outside where we are now. One of the people present at that service was the widow of someone who had been lost and another was his daughter. I spoke to them after the service, and they were so pleased that this parliament was acknowledging the losses that have occurred as a consequence of PTSD and of suicide.
             </p>
             <p>
              Only just this weekend, on Saturday, I held a mobile office and a young man came to see about an issue unrelated to military service. We got to talking and I asked him what he had done before what he was doing now—he is currently at
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
               TAFE
              </a>
              getting ready to go to university and study engineering—and he said, 'I was in the Army and I had two tours in the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East" rel="nofollow">
               Middle East
              </a>
              .' I asked, 'Did you go to Afghanistan?' He said, 'I was there only really briefly,' and I asked what it was like. He said, 'While I was there I was a pallbearer.' There had been losses while he had been there. That made me think about these young Australians who go to very, very distant places and who do so not for glory, personal satisfaction or personal fame but out of a sense of duty, obligation and service. They are incredible people. It is incredible to think of voluntary enrolment in the defence forces and the willingness to go and serve.
             </p>
             <p>
              My great-grandfather was a prisoner of war. I remember him still. My parents were young and my grandparents were young; so I have strong memories of my great-grandfather. He never spoke to me about that experience but, when my grandmother passed away a couple of years ago, one of her personal effects was something that I had never seen, and it was his diary from when he was a prisoner of war. She had kept it. I do not think anyone in my family had seen it. It is a harrowing thing to look at. He was a young man and he had two daughters when this was happening to him. My great-grandmother had taken them up to Yorkshire to keep them safe. So he was not as young as some of the other veterans.
             </p>
             <p>
              The sacrifices that are made but also the fear of what might happen to you or the fear of the consequences and the impact of living on after your comrades have been injured, maimed or killed are things that everyone in this place should think about—and I am sure that all of us do think about. When we think about veterans, we really need to be very careful to ensure that those who are left—those who do survive, those who do grow old, those who are wearied by age—are cared for as well. That is why I think that this bill is so important.
             </p>
             <p>
              PTSD is a serious medical condition, and that is why I am really pleased that the Gallipoli Medical Research Foundation, which is based in my electorate, is undertaking some world-first research into PTSD for veterans. The foundation has partnered with
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
               RSL
              </a>
              Queensland for that purpose. Since 2013, the RSL has given almost $7 million to the Gallipoli Medical Research Foundation for this world-first research into PTSD. The foundation is talking to 150 Vietnam veterans who have been diagnosed with PTSD and 150 who have never been diagnosed. It is working with those people to understand the science of PTSD, to look at the genetics of PTSD and to look at the physical effects. I think sometimes the physical effects are not front of mind for us when we talk about it.
             </p>
             <p>
              Some of the initial findings from the research is showing that, if you have PTSD, you are something like three times more likely to be acting out your dreams while you are having them, you are much more likely to have restless legs and you are much more likely to have fatigue during the day. And there is a range of other physical effects that flow on from PTSD. So I wanted to take the opportunity while speaking to this bill to acknowledge that that partnership is ongoing in Queensland and to thank the Gallipoli Medical Research Foundation and
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
               RSL Queensland
              </a>
              for the work that they are doing. They estimate that there are around 4,000 Australian veterans of Afghanistan alone who have PTSD. Of course, if you look at all of the conflicts and all of the people who have served, there would be many more. So I wanted to acknowledge them and thank them.
             </p>
             <p>
              I also wanted to take the opportunity to thank those people who have served and to thank those people who are still serving. It is always a great honour as part of our role as federal members of parliament to participate in memorials and commemorations of conflicts and wars. Just a couple of weeks ago I was at a commemoration for the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War" rel="nofollow">
               First World War
              </a>
              . In my electorate there is a First World War memorial that was laid in 1916. It is one of the earliest war memorials in the country. We were commemorating the centenary of that memorial. One of the reasons it is such a great honour to be part of those commemorations is that you do get to acknowledge the work of people who have made sacrifices, people who have served, people who have not come back, people who still serve and their families. That was of course no exception, and I had the pleasure of speaking with people on that day. So, in the course of speaking to this bill, I really want to acknowledge and thank all those who make sacrifices in defending the nation. The work that they do is invaluable.
             </p>
             <p>
              We cannot do enough to express our gratitude and, if we are sincere about that gratitude and we really mean what we say when we talk about those who have served when we go to those commemorations, that has to be backed up with genuine support for veterans. That is why I am pleased to support this bill today. It is a bill that will make adjustments. It will adjust payments of interim compensation to incapacitated current or former ADF members, which happens while the actual amount of compensation is being determined. Instead of being paid at the minimum wage while you are waiting for the determination, you will be paid above the minimum wage. It will be a compensation situation with recognition for what was earnt.
             </p>
             <p>
              As a consequence of this bill, there will also be some changes in relation to post-traumatic stress disorder, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, alcohol use disorder and substance use disorder. It is estimated that around 67,000 additional current and former permanent members of the ADF will become eligible to receive this particular benefit, the NLHC, and that includes victims of abuse in the ADF as well. Finally, there is the alignment of the incapacity payments cut-off age to the increases in the age pension eligibility, which is a very important measure and one that advocates for Defence Force personnel in my electorate have been calling for for some time.
             </p>

              Looking after veterans is a priority for Labor. We have a great shadow minister in

              . In the time that she has been the shadow minister for veterans' affairs she has done a lot of work to work with the community and to really speak with veterans about what needs to be done. She is continuing to pursue policy change that will continue to support veterans. I note that shadow assistant minister Brodtmann is also here with us today. She has been a tireless advocate for the Defence community, including for veterans and the families of Defence members. Every time A

              visits me, I get a nice story about how great she is and what a wonderful advocate she is. It is really pleasing for me to be able to stand here and support a bill that I know she supports very strongly—as does the shadow minister—and to commend the bill to the House.

               : I trust you are doing great work, that you are working with our fabulous shadow minister for veterans' affairs to ensure we provide to our veterans—those veterans who have served our country so selflessly—with the conditions and the support they deserve, and that veterans are acknowledged and, most importantly, are cared for as they age.
              </p>
              <p>
               Our veterans and their families deserve world-class care and support, and Labor will always encourage and support measures designed to ensure that existing programs take account of the mental health requirements of veterans. Veterans' mental health is a huge issue at the moment. Everywhere you go, people are talking about it. I have spent a lot of time at
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldier_On" rel="nofollow">
                Soldier On

               events. They do great work in terms of helping veterans—particularly young veterans coming back from Afghanistan—transition back into life. They do not just work with the veterans; they also work with the families. I am the daughter-in-law of a Vietnam vet, and my late mother-in-law always said that she got a different man back from that war. It is not just the impact that it has on that individual in terms of the effect, trauma and shock of war. It is also the impact it has on their spouse or partner and their family. We hear reports of intergenerational trauma. We see that from Vietnam vets and I am sure that it is bound to happen with our vets from Afghanistan too.
              </p>
              <p>
               It is absolutely vital that we as a nation honour the service of our veterans—and honour the service of those who are currently serving as well—and ensure that they are supported, protected and safe when they return, because the incidence of mental health issues is increasing. We read about it more and more each day. This is because we are gaining a greater understanding of it. During
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
                World War I
               </a>
               it was shell shock, and the treatment for that was pretty primitive and pretty barbaric and most people were shunned. A lot of people who experienced shell shock were shunned. It was the same situation in World War
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">
                II
               </a>
               . We are now gaining a greater understanding of the symptoms and the effects of trauma and also the symptoms and effects of the trauma of war and conflict. It is vitally important that we provide a sophisticated level of service and support to our veterans, because we have an increasingly sophisticated understanding of these issues and the many ways in which they manifest themselves.
              </p>
              <p>
               As has been mentioned by the many speakers on this side who have been talking on Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2016, the amending legislation makes three specific adjustments. The amendments in schedule 1 provide for payments of interim compensation to incapacitated current or former ADF members while the actual amount of compensation is being determined. Currently, applicants are paid at the national minimum wage amount while their claims are being processed, which can be less what they were earning at the time of the injury. I have had conversations with veterans about that.
              </p>
              <p>
               It has also been recognised that, for some mental health conditions, early intervention can result in better outcomes for clients. Prior to this change, ADF members were required to have had at least three years continuous full-time service or operational service and then lodge an application under the Veterans' Entitlements Act and then have a diagnosis. Under these changes, clients would be able to access the coverage immediately and would only need to have served one full-time day. It is estimated that around 67,000 additional current and former permanent members of the ADF will become eligible to receive this coverage, and this includes victims of abuse in the ADF who may have previously been excluded from coverage due to the period in which they served or the length of their service. This extension is limited to the following conditions: post-traumatic stress disorder, depressive disorder, anxiety disorder, alcohol use disorder and substance use disorder. Again, that just underscores the greater sophistication in understanding of the many different ways in which trauma can manifest itself: substance abuse, alcohol abuse, anxiety, depression and

               .
              </p>
              <p>
               Schedule 3 aligns the incapacity payments cut-off age to the increases in the age pension eligibility. There are a range of elements that are covered in this—most importantly, those dealing with mental health challenges. Again, I just want to thank and acknowledge the work of everyone who has been involved in the consultation on this bill—and that it does acknowledge that there were gaps in the market, that there were gaps in coverage and that they have now been addressed.
              </p>

               I had the great fortune of attending, with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, the 65th commemoration of two specific battles of the

                Vietnam War
               </a>
               as a forgotten war but after my visit to this commemoration in Korea I believe that there is a very limited understanding of our involvement in the Korean War, and I do believe that it is the forgotten war.
              </p>
              <p>
               As I said, we were there to acknowledge those two very significant battles in which Australian troops played a major role in securing really critical areas of land, at Kapyong and Maryang San. I want to thank the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, with whom I tagged along—I represented the Leader of the Opposition there—I am very grateful to him for that because it gave me the great pleasure of meeting eight extraordinary veterans. I do hope that they are listening to us now: Graham Connor, 1RAR;

              </p>
              <p>
               What was so extraordinary was the fact that there was a genuine curiosity there. There was a degree of reservation and hesitation about returning to areas where they had lost mates—and there was that degree of reservation and hesitation. These men—we are talking mid- to late-80s to early-90s—had the constitutions of oxen. They were extraordinary. We were up at the crack of dawn. The pace was just constant throughout the day. We were getting to bed at nine o'clock. But there they were: chipper, chirpy, up at five in the morning, ready to take on the new program for the day, 'eating like pregnant sharks', as my mother says. They were keeping up with the drinking with some of those young things from 3RAR. They were breathtakingly resilient.
              </p>
              <p>
               They were there to enjoy themselves and to commemorate and honour the mates they had lost, the contribution they had made and the contribution of the Korean people. So, if any of them are listening, I say: 'Hello to you all. I miss you. I missed you a lot when I got back from Korea. I must admit I really enjoyed our conversations. It was great talking to you about your experiences.'
              </p>
              <p>
               They were just overwhelmed and amazed at the change in Korea in those 65 years. When they left, four million were dead—two million from Korea. The country was completely decimated by the ravages of war. There was poverty. There were people wandering around in rags, in tatters. There were people who had lost loved ones—relatives. There were people whose villages and houses had been completely blown apart, whose lives had been completely shattered. Then they went back to
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" rel="nofollow">
                South Korea
               </a>
               and saw what it is today. We went to Busan and Seoul and we saw this economic powerhouse that is Korea now. It is quite extraordinary. They could not believe the transformation of that nation. They acknowledge their contribution to it, but they attribute it to the strength of character, the courage and the bravery of the people of Korea, because it is quite a transformation in a very short period of time, particularly for a nation that went through a real hit with the Asian crisis in the late 1990s. And again their response to that was quite extraordinary.

               Just going back to the Korean War—as I said, the forgotten war—18,000 Australians served, 340 died. Many of the Australians who went over to serve in the war were basically reconstructing Japan just after the

                Second World War
               </a>
               , so they essentially moved over from Japan straight into action in Korea. This is something that not many people know: it was the first and the only

              </p>
              <p>
               The amount of Australians who served, the amount of Australians who died there, fighting to ensure prosperity for future Korea—the fact that it was the
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
                UN
               </a>
               actively involved in this. There were 20 or 30 nations involved in it, and they also lost young people there. It was a significant international contribution to ensure the security and the prosperity of the Korea of today.
              </p>
              <p>
               There are many wonderful stories that I gleaned from that commemorative visit but what I was really touched by was the fact that the vets were accompanied by young current members of 3RAR. I asked these young men, 'So how did you get chosen to come on this mission?' and they all said, 'It was our good looks.' I do not know about that but, anyway, they were there and they were respectful and decent and they are young soldiers of whom we can be proud. 3RAR made a significant contribution to the war. It was essentially where it was nicknamed '
               <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Faithful" rel="nofollow">
                Old Faithful
               </a>
               '. 3RAR was there at the beginning and was there at the end, and you could always rely on 3RAR, Old Faithful, to be there to help you out during difficult times. So these young men were there to commemorate some of their former members who had lost their lives in the Korean War. At Busan United Nations War Cemetery, they held little services at each of the graves of the members of 3RAR. They laid a poppy and they paid tribute and acknowledged the contribution that 3RAR had made.

              <p>
               I want to acknowledge, and make mention of, three extraordinary Australians because their stories kept coming up during the course of time that we were there. The first one really touched me. In fact, when I was told about this story by the historian, I burst into tears. I was a complete mess. She was used to it; she has heard this story a million times but, for me, it was a first. Sixty-five years ago, Sister Nancy Hummerston married her beloved Captain Ken Hummerston in Tokyo. Six weeks later, Captain Hummerston was in Korea when the jeep he was driving was blown up by landmine. He and his driver were killed in the explosion and were the first Australians to die in the Korean War. Captain Hummerston had been in Korea just six days and had been married for such a very short time. Nancy was heartbroken but threw herself into her work and returned to Japan to continue nursing. She never remarried and she devoted her entire life to helping veterans. Her one wish—and I hope I am going to get through this—was that when she died her ashes would be buried with him. It was about six years ago, I think, that those ashes were returned to his grave and she was buried with him, her great love—finally, beside the love of her life, Captain Kenneth Hummerston, 60 years after they last parted ways. Rest in peace—I did not quite get through that without getting emotional.

               Another extraordinary Australian, Private Horace Madden—one of 29 Australians taken prisoner in the Korean War. He was a signaller with 3RAR and was captured at Kapyong on 24 April 1951. He was forced to march 300 kilometres in freezing conditions to

               . Despite poor health and deprived of food, he defied his captors and gave the little he had to those more needy, and he died of malnutrition just months later–again, an extraordinary Australian.

               It is a privilege to speak on this bill today and, most importantly, a privilege to honour the veterans of our nation and those who are currently serving. To those Korean War veterans, I look forward to seeing you again, hopefully next year when you are here, for another acknowledgement of your service. I miss you. Again, thank you so much for all you have given to our nation, to all the veterans who have given so much to our nation, to our people, to our democracy. Lest we forget.

                By way of summation to the second reading debate on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2016, and on behalf of the minister, I would just note that the bill gives effect to three of the veterans affairs 2016 budget measures, all of which will benefit the defence and ex-service community. The first of the three budget measures will expand access under the Veterans' Entitlements Act to non-liability health care for certain mental health conditions for all current and former permanent members of the Defence Force. The reference to the provision of non-liability health care describes treatment for conditions that do not need to be linked to the service of the member, and is regarded as being separate from any claim for compensation. To provide for the expanded access, the government has committed $37.9 million in the 2016-17 budget to extend eligibility for non-liability health care for five mental health conditions. Those are: post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, alcohol use disorder and substance use disorder. The amendments being made by this bill will also ensure that access to treatment for the listed mental health conditions will be quicker and easier by removing the need for a formal diagnosis at the time the request for treatment is made.
               </p>
               <p>
                The remaining measures both relate to the payment of compensation in the form of incapacity payments under the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. The first measure will assist members and families by ensuring that interim incapacity payments will be payable at 100 per cent of the normal earnings of the member. That means that for a former Defence Force member, interim incapacity payments will match the regular salary payable at the time of discharge. Under the current incapacity payment provisions, the amount of compensation payable cannot be finally determined until superannuation entitlements are finalised by the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation. So this measure will ensure the appropriate level of support is maintained commensurate with the former Defence Force member's salary whilst the superannuation entitlements are being calculated.
               </p>
               <p>
                The remaining measure will improve support for current and former Defence Force members and their families by aligning the cut-off age for incapacity payments with the increases in the pension age at which age pension will be payable under the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Act" rel="nofollow">
                 Social Security Act
                </a>
                . In most cases, incapacity payments cease when the current or former member reaches 65 years of age. In the circumstances where the injury occurred on or after the age of 63, the maximum of 104 weeks of incapacity payments will be payable. The amendments to be made by this bill will ensure that eligibility for incapacity payments will continue to keep pace with the scheduled age pension age increases. These 2016 budget measures are further examples of the government's commitment to recognising and meeting the needs of current and former members of the

                and their families.

                I would like to acknowledge the contribution to the debate of this bill made by the member for Kingston, the shadow minister, in which she noted the importance that early intervention can have in mental health treatment. This bill will ensure that we provide our veterans with the help they need as soon as possible. The member for Kingston also noted that the extension of eligibility and delaying of the requirement for a diagnosis are common sense changes that will have a huge impact. The shadow minister also noted that the other measures in the bill address the problems caused by the low level of interim incapacity payments to veterans. The government welcomes her support for another commonsense change that will increase these payments so that no veteran is left in financial difficulty. I would also like to thank on behalf of the minister, the member for Wright, for his point that while we might see physically fit veterans returning from conflict, we need to make sure that the injuries that are hidden are treated as soon as possible. The member for Wright has also made the point that in these commonsense changes, we are not just assisting veterans access to treatment they need, but that they are being provided with simpler and more streamlined systems.
               </p>
               <p>
                Additionally, I would like to thank the member for Lingiari for his contribution to this debate. As a former minister for veterans' affairs, he knows better than most the challenges that face veterans and serving personnel. As he noted, this bill forms part of a broader canvas of reforms to ensure that all veterans receive adequate treatment and support when transitioning from service in the defence forces. It continues a tradition of bipartisan support for the veteran community.
               </p>
               <p>
                Finally, I would like to recognise the member for Ryan's input in regard to her continual advocacy for our Defence personnel and veterans. Be it through supporting ex-service organisations that provide an important service for veterans in our community, improving care for older veterans receiving a pension or ensuring that persons transitioning to civilian life have resources and assistance readily available to them, she has been a steadfast supporter of veterans in her own community, and I thank her for her contribution.
               </p>
               <p>
                This bill is not only a commonsense bill but one that will fundamentally change the way our veterans receive assistance for mental health. I commend the bill to the House.
