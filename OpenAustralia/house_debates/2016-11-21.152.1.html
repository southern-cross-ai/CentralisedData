        Recently I attended the presentation day of Saint Josephs Riverwood Sports Club. This fantastic group in my electorate gives the local kids the opportunity to play a wide range of sports: cricket, netball,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tee_Ball" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Oz Tag and touch football. It was a terrific presentation day down there at Peakhurst West school on Ogilvy Street. It was good to see all the kids there having such a great time, making use of the dunking machine, the jumping castle and various other things on the day. I would like to congratulate and acknowledge the hard work of the committee led by its President, Matt Carr. Saint Josephs Riverwood Sports Club has been a very important part of our community for some 45 years, and this season was as successful as all the others. Thank you so much for what you do in promoting sport and healthy lifestyles for kids in our region. I look forward to continuing to work with the club in the future.

        The Bankstown region has a very active football community. Recently I attended the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGM" rel="nofollow">
         AGM
        </a>
        of the Bankstown District Amateur Football Association held at the Bankstown Sports Club. Six of the 21 football clubs in the Bankstown region are within my electorate. It is always good to catch up with those clubs and learn about the issues that they are facing in their respective suburbs. Thank you to Chairman Glenn Rufford for his chairing of the AGM and also to General Manager Shane Merry, who only recently took on the role but has already had a very substantial and positive impact on the football community in our region. Of course more people play football every weekend than are involved in any other community activity, so the BDAFA is a particularly important organisation in our community. I am proud to be a supporter of the BDAFA. I look forward to further activities next year.

        and all of the young men who were involved in the service. There are more than 100 young people involved in the Riverwood squadron learning about aviation and learning ways of working together. They are growing immensely as individuals in the process. To Chris Bailey and everyone at the Riverwood squadron: thank you very much for your continuing great efforts in our community.
