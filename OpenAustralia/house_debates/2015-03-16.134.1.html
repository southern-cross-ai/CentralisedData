        I rise tonight to advise the House of the great work that is happening in my electorate with my four local mayors. John Brent is the Mayor of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenic_Rim" rel="nofollow">
         Scenic Rim
        </a>
        Regional Council.

        is the Mayor of the

         Lockyer Valley
        </a>
        Regional Council—and the House needs no reminder of the devastating floods that went through our electorate some years ago, when we suffered enormous sacrifice. I recognise Tom Tate over on the

         City of Gold Coast

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_City" rel="nofollow">
         Logan City
        </a>
        Council. Recently in the media cycle, Pam Parker has announced that she will not be recontesting the city mayoralty.

        say that these four mayors, irrespective of their political persuasion, have been great advocates for the electorate of Wright. Each have quite different skill-sets in the work that they do in representing their communities. I will start with Pam Parker. I have never met a more qualified and enthusiastic mayor in her advocacy of Logan City. She advocates aggressively for her city, which sits between Brisbane and the Gold Coast, two major cosmopolitan cities. For your contribution to your community—and in the face of adversity, and with some headaches that you have had to deal with at a local level—I say to you, Mayor Parker, on the public record, to be recorded in
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        forever, that I am truly indebted to your commitment to your community and for the work that you have done in conjunction with your committed staff. I truly thank you, hand on heart, for the work that you have done. Those will be big boots to fill for any person who follows in your footsteps.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pam is a true advocate for Logan City and I thank her for her contribution. I wish her well in the final days of her mayoralty.
       </p>
       <p>
        I recognise John Brent, Mayor of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scenic_Rim_Regional_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Scenic Rim Regional Council
        </a>
        . They call it the Scenic Rim because it truly is a most beautiful part of Australia. Its landscape viewed from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Tamborine" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Tamborine
        </a>
        is a scenic vision. As you stand on the top of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Tambourine" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Tambourine
        </a>
        you can see the Gold Coast landscape and the cityscape. Within the area of Scenic Rim, there are no fewer than 22 private polo fields. It is the playground of those who choose to invest in the sport of polo. Underneath that Scenic Rim there is a low socio-economic area. John Brent's leadership of no fewer than 39 years in local government, is attributable to his contribution despite the enormous challenges that faced him. He is a personal friend of mine. Often John will just roll into the house and ask what is on the table for dinner that night. My good wife knows always to prepare extra in case the mayor decides to roll in.

        , the Mayor of the Lockyer Valley and his most motivated council over in the Lockyer Valley do an outstanding job in representing the diverse views of the Lockyer Valley—which is predominantly agricultural, but also has urban sprawl into those areas—and dealing with the future development. In particular, there are projects that Mayor Jones is lobbying for.
       </p>
       <p>
        I recognise

        , the Mayor of the City of Gold Coast, for his advocacy for the Gold Coast to host the

        . He is always looking for the next cutting edge.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a federal member, I can find no greater pride than in having this representation around me. In the relationships that I have with my mayors, I make sure that on a quarterly basis I spend time with each of them. In my speech tonight, I advise the Australian public that as a federal member I have some of the best regional mayors in Australia. I thank them.
