        Over the past few weeks I have had the pleasure of officially opening two new school redevelopments. Where the focus has been on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM" rel="nofollow">
         STEM
        </a>
        , both Burnie's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leighland_Christian_School" rel="nofollow">
         Leighland Christian School
        </a>
        and the Devonport Christian School received federal funding under the Capital Grants Program. This investment by the Morrison government reflects our ongoing commitment to today's students and that we are willing to back them to ensure they are equipped with the skills they will need for the jobs of the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        If the students at Leighland Christian School and at Devonport Christian School reflect the students right across the nation, then our nation is, indeed, in good hands. Their excitement to embrace the new technology, their willingness to learn and to challenge themselves across the STEM subjects is impressive and infectious. No longer is science, technology, engineering and maths something that's taught from a textbook. It's hands-on and immersive.

        Congratulations to the principals, Elizabeth Scheu and Chad Smit, who were at the head of the support staff and the parents of these great children as they attended to play an important part in the children's education at the opening ceremonies. Today we're making your students' journey through the educative process positive and exciting, ensuring they are ready to take advantage of every opportunity that's ahead of them.
