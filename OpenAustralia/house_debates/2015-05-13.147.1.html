        This year, the Centenary of Anzac saw services held across Australia that were attended in record numbers, and had an understandably special intensity. That was certainly the case in Fremantle, where a huge crowd gathered in the dark for a moving dawn service at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monument_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Monument Hill
        </a>
        , which included the ceremonial unveiling of plaques that listed all 849 of the Fremantle men who lost their lives in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
         World War I
        </a>
        . This project, initiated by Chris Grisewood, a former warden of Monument Hill, has been many years in the making and was only possible through the work of the city of Fremantle's history and heritage staff, especially its archivist, Andrew Pittaway.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the week before Anzac Day I had the honour of launching a book by Andrew called
        <i>
         Fremantle Voices of the Great
        </i>
        <i>
         W
        </i>
        <i>
         ar
        </i>
        , which draws on letters, diaries and oral histories to tell the story of the 3,000 Fremantle souls who went off to Gallipoli, Palestine and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Front" rel="nofollow">
         Western Front
        </a>
        . The toll, measured in the lives of young men, was felt heavily in the Fremantle community. One-third of working age men were lost. At least now their families have a place they can visit to see them remembered by name, and a book in which their stories are told. For example, in
        <i>
         Fremantle Voices
        </i>
        , gunner George 'Chitter' Brown describes the harsh reality of his first days on the Western Front:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I lost my best pal Sgt Henry Robinson from Fremantle. He was captain of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Fremantle" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        juniors and extremely popular with all who met him … He leaves a young wife and child at North Fremantle.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have chosen that excerpt partly because there were so many members of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Fremantle_Football_Club" rel="nofollow">
         North Fremantle Football Club
        </a>
        killed or seriously wounded in World War I that the club was unable to remain part of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Australian_Football_League" rel="nofollow">
         West Australian Football League
        </a>
        after the war. That story is told in full in a wonderful book by Baden Pratt called
        <i>

        </i>
        <i>

        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        I was also glad to attend events that were focused on young people. The Beaconsfield Primary School Anzac service did a brilliant job of exploring and explaining the different aspects of Anzac Day, rather than assuming that kids will simply absorb its significance by repetition over the years. The Cockburn
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        's annual Anzac Youth Parade was again excellent—featuring 26 local schools, 1,400 school children, and doing a particularly good job of acknowledging the role of Indigenous servicemen.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Centenary of Anzac was an opportunity for everyone in the Australian community to pay their respect to those who have served this country. And as much as we honour those who have served and who serve today, we cannot allow young people to believe that the courage and sacrifice of the Anzacs, as well as the other fine human qualities like camaraderie and compassion, and even good humour, that can emerge in extreme circumstances, in any way glorify or justify the folly, futility and the terrible damage of that military disaster and, indeed, all wars.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the words of the 10th Light Horse Regiment Sergeant Hubert Ulrich:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I was in the thick of it often but thank God I came safely through. I saw many splendid young fellows pass out. It was heartbreaking, war is terrible! Pray God it may soon be over.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is over. It began 100 years ago and will never be forgotten. We will remember them.

         I also rise today to reflect on the Centenary of Anzac commemorations, particularly in the electorate of Macquarie, that were held in April this year. I would particularly like to express my appreciation to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
          RSL
         </a>
         sub-branches, local clubs, and all other community organisations throughout the Hawkesbury and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains" rel="nofollow">
          Blue Mountains
         </a>
         for their dedication, commitment and love for the Centenary of Anzac commemorative services. The continued commitment of these organisations ensures that the legacy of the men and women that served, not only during the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_War" rel="nofollow">
          Great War
         </a>
         but since, is remembered and honoured.
        </p>
        <p>
         In particular, a record crowd of 10,000 people gathered at McQuade Park in Windsor to attend a combined service hosted by the Windsor and Richmond RSL sub-branches, and this service was supported by the Anzac Centenary Local Grants Program. A beautiful memorial present at the service will be relocated to the grounds of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Western_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
          University of Western Sydney
         </a>
         . I was privileged to attend many Anzac Day services, including the combined Windsor and Richmond RSL sub-branches dawn service; the Hazelbrook Bowling &amp; Sporting Club's Anzac Centenary March and service; the Blaxland-Glenbrook RSL march; and commemorative events at Hawkesbury district agricultural show and the Springwood RSL sub-branch sunset service.
        </p>
        <p>
         I also had the privilege of attending commemorations at a number of schools, including
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Riverview" rel="nofollow">
          Mount Riverview
         </a>
         and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bligh_Park" rel="nofollow">
          Bligh Park
         </a>
         public schools. It was wonderful to see so many children at Anzac Day services but also in their school commemorative events, honouring their own forefathers and telling their personal stories. At Bligh Park, the librarian takes responsibility for the commemorative service, which has been held for many years and honours not only the families of service men and women represented at the school but also the current serving personnel from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
          RAAF
         </a>
         Base Richmond. There were a number of parents present who are current serving personnel, and it was wonderful to have them there. This year was particularly special, with people of all ages wearing their families' medals, and descendants marching with photographs and other memorabilia of their family.
        </p>
        <p>
         We remember, during this the centenary commemoration of the Great War, those who made the ultimate sacrifice, and their families, their mates and those who returned, never to be the same. They loved their nation and they loved their families, and their courage was so that we could enjoy the freedom that we have. I honour them today.
