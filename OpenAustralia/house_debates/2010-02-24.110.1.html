        Populated areas of the Canning electorate remain without reticulated sewerage. The Peel region is a hypergrowth area, exceeding six per cent growth in some parts, yet thousands of homes rely on outdated and unreliable septic tanks that were always designed to be temporary. Thirteen Canning locations were listed for completion under the infill sewerage program between 2009 and 2016 at the cost of $35 million. But the deferment of the program indefinitely by the state government means that homes in Dawesville, Mandurah, Falcon, Ravenswood, Waroona and

        have been shafted. I have recently surveyed residents in these affected areas and the response has been overwhelming—almost 300 responses, indicating they were appalled by the poor service and disappointed by broken promises. Most confirm that they would connect to deep sewerage immediately.
       </p>
       <p>
        While there are concerns about the cost of the connection, most owners would gladly pay. Renters would lobby their landlords, which would not be a hard sell because deep sewerage improves the amenity of the area, allows for subdivision and adds to property values. Many built and bought their homes on the promise that they would have sewerage years ago. No price is too high to pay for the health of the residents and the preservation of the

        listed Peel-Yalgorup estuary and wetlands. Besides the obvious sewage run-off causing contamination of the waterways, a number of other concerns have emerged. Some report that the older septic tanks have become completely unreliable and were not designed to cope with modern washing machines and dishwashers. In fairness, some people said that they found septic tanks very efficient. That is great news, but there is always a risk. I call septic tanks ‘toxic’ tanks. They are time bombs. Many of the respondents said that their tanks were put in during the 1970s. In Waroona, some of the septic tanks date back to the 1930s. Reports of clogged and leaking tanks are common.

        Most of the unsewered locations lie dangerously between the coast and the river. Tree roots cause interference and there are concerns about the watertable being so close to the surface. One constituent who used to work for a septic tank company confirmed just how far septic waste leaches into the groundwater. Septic tanks are expensive to pump. One in good condition costs about $600 a year to pump out. Mr Orohoe of

        said that his system relies on an electric pump which has failed twice in the last eight years; now he is on to his third. Mr Berry from Falcon sums up the situation well when he says:

       <p class="italic">
        The reality is that it is 2010 and if septic tanks were safe and healthy systems we would be installing them in new homes. Most are very old so leaks occur and we worry that you can smell the neighbour when it’s full.’
       </p>
       <p>
        I will be writing to the Premier and the water minister seeking immediate action with a firm financial commitment to sewering the affected areas, providing residents with basic services that were promised years ago.
