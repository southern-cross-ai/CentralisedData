        </a>
        more broadly. Darwin is strategically vital for Australia's defence, being the only port capable of providing war facilities to support naval maritime activities conducted in the region. Competition for wharf space in Darwin has increased a lot over the years, and the new wharf will alleviate current constraints. The project will also include the construction of a new fuel facility that will store larger quantities of fuel for berthed vessels. This project aligns with the 2016 defence white paper's advice on the importance of key enabling capabilities of defence bases. The paper foreshadows the upgrading of HMAS
        <i>
         Coonawarra
        </i>
        to support the new offshore patrol vessels.
       </p>
       <p>
        This project will employ up to 240 skilled contractors and construction workers. The estimated project cost is $272.6 million, excluding
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">

        ; future personnel and operating costs are estimated at $4.1 million. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to start in October 2019 and be completed by mid-2023. I commend the motion to the House.

        The Department of Defence proposes to redevelop the Larrakeyah Defence Precinct in Darwin,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">

        <i>
         Coonawarra
        </i>
        and the Larrakeyah Barracks, to address shortcomings in engineering services, accommodation and infrastructure. Addressing the deficiencies in infrastructure will allow for future expansion and population growth in the area. The 2016 defence white paper identifies the importance of key enabling capabilities of defence bases and foreshadowed the upgrading of Larrakeyah Barracks and HMAS
        <i>
         Coonawarra
        </i>
        to support more offshore patrol vessels and enable ADF operations and exercises.
       </p>
       <p>
        This project also supports HMAS
        <i>
         Coonawarra
        </i>
        as a key maritime precinct and home port for 12 Armidale class patrol boats. The precinct provides support functions to ADF troops, and major fleet units for joint and combined operations as well as humanitarian and disaster relief. The estimated cost to deliver the project is $223 million, excluding GST. The cost includes upgrading North-West Mobile Force accommodation, a new shared user facility, upgrade to the base entry precinct, and improving electrical potable water and firefighting infrastructure, sewerage, and stormwater works, and

        infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project will employ a diverse range of skilled consultants, contractors and construction workers. Opportunities for upskilling and on-the-job training are anticipated. The project will employ about 290 personnel and an average construction workforce of 130 personnel. The Larrakeyah Barracks is home to 700 personnel, which comprise ADF personnel, contractors, public servants and

        (East), Critical Infrastructure Recovery Program, Sydney.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Defence is proposing to undertake repairs, installation and replacement works to wharfs and base-wide engineering services at Garden Island in Sydney. Stage 1 of the project addressed the remediation of the cruiser wharf and oil wharf. Following consideration by the Public Works Committee, the parliament agreed that it was expedient to carry out the work on 14 June 2017. Stage 2 of the Garden Island infrastructure recovery program will address the condition, capacity and compliance issues with the remaining wharves, engineering services and supporting infrastructure to ensure they are fit for purpose and able to support the Royal Australian Navy's current and future operational requirements.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposed work will include an upgrade of the electrical services and fuel network, and upgrade and repair selected portions of the hydraulic services. The work also extends to repair and upgrade the fleet-based east wharves and the east and west dock wharves. The 2016 defence white paper identified the important of key enabling capabilities of the Defence estate, including bases and wharves, and foreshadowed the upgrading of Garden Island to continue to support an expanded fleet and accommodate larger platforms, such as the Canberra-class amphibious ships. This capital investment in infrastructure at Garden Island will bring economic benefits to the local

        economy, with short-term employment opportunities predominantly in the building, construction and labour markets. The works will also provide opportunities for suppliers involved in the manufacture and distribution of construction materials and equipment. The estimated cost to deliver the project is $286.5 million, excluding GST. This includes construction costs, escalation allowances, professional service fees, design, and construction and design contingencies. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is scheduled from late 2018 to late 2023. I commend the motion to the House.
