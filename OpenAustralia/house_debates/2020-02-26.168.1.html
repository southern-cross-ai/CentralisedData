        â€ŽWe live in a momentous time in women's sport across our country. Women's sport on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        continues to go from strength to strength. Wherever you go, Australian women are making headway and, in doing so, they inspire the next generation of sports superstars. I'm thrilled that this year saw the Gold Coast officially launch its first women's national team, the

        Women's competition in 2020. It's been a strong start to the season, including a home ground win against the

         The Gold Coast

        has a thriving sports culture. It's been two years since we hosted the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_Games" rel="nofollow">
         Commonwealth Games
        </a>
        and we support the 2032 South-East Queensland Olympics bid that will take our sports culture to the next level and bring economic benefits to our wonderful city. It's important that we celebrate women's sport, particularly given some of the hurdles they face, including access to facilities, funding, and social and cultural barriers.

        The Gold Coast has some remarkable sports stars, and I'd like to acknowledge a few of them. Daphne Pirie was a nationally ranked track and field athlete who captained the Queensland women's athletics and hockey teams and represented Australia in hockey. She's now a world ranked masters athlete, having won eight gold medals in international competitions. In 1989 Daph was awarded an Order of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Empire" rel="nofollow">
         British Empire
        </a>
        , and in 2012 she was awarded an Order of Australia for her service to hockey. Daphne Pirie is a Gold Coast treasure. She has dedicated the majority of her life to supporting women and girls in sport. She's done a tremendous job to raise the profile of women in sport at both grassroots and elite levels.

         Sally Pearson
        </a>
        left an incredible legacy over her 16-year representative career as a hurdler. Ms Pearson is one of Australia's most awarded athletes, having won eight major championship medals. In 2014 she was also awarded an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Australia_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Order of Australia Medal
        </a>
        for her contribution to sport. Sally has marked her place in history and is an example for a generation of young women to follow in her footsteps.

        Sport promotes social inclusion and a sense of connection, improves physical health and helps build relationships through shared experiences and achievement. Sport is also a social leveller. It provides opportunities regardless of postcode.
