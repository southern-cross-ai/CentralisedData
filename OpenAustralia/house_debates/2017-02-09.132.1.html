        Today I would like to pay tribute to a very significant community figure in Campbelltown, Councillor Fred Borg, who passed away on 20 December last year at the age of 73. Fred was born in Malta in 1943, and like many of Maltese origin he came with his family to Australia after World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        to build a new life, arriving in 1951. Fred gave so much to the people of Campbelltown and he worked hard to ensure our community thrived. He established the 24 Hour Fight Against Cancer, Macarthur's biggest charity event, which raises funds for the Macarthur Cancer Therapy Centre, the oncology ward and the paediatric ambulatory care unit at Campbelltown Hospital as well as the palliative care unit at Camden Hospital.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over the years, I had a lot to do with Fred, who was a very kind and caring man who made sure that Macarthur received the health funding it deserved. He was a life member and one of the pioneer board members of the Campbelltown Catholic Club. He loved the

        rugby league team and did all he could to support them. Through owning and running his own printing business he became president of the Campbelltown Chamber of Commerce at a very important time, when Campbelltown was transitioning from a region to a city.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fred was a long-term campaigner for something to be done about the dangers on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appin_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Appin Road
        </a>
        , an issue that everyone in Macarthur is very concerned about and very passionate about, even now. I am doing my best to make sure that Fred's dream of having a safe Appin Road will come true.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fred was an independent councillor on Campbelltown council for 17 years. He is one of the only council members whose name was a household word in our community. Early last year Fred received a special acknowledgement for 50 years of service to the community of Campbelltown, and this year he received a very well deserved posthumous Order of Australia award.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fred knew he lived in a great place with wonderful people, and he supported those people throughout his entire time in the Macarthur community. He loved his community but he loved nothing more than his family. He was the father of four and a grandfather of 11. He is survived by his beautiful wife Maria. Ironically, Fred was very passionate about fighting cancer, and cancer is what finally drew his life to a close. He died, I believe, with great dignity.
       </p>
       <p>
        When I announced that I was standing for election in the last federal election, Fred rang me to tell me that he was a friend of the incumbent,

        , my opponent, but he would still do whatever he could to support me. He made sure that at every community event he was at I was acknowledged, and he was very positive about me. I am very grateful to him.
