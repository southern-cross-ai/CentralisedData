       <p>
        What a ridiculous sideshow this government has become. Five long years they've subjected this country to, and then yesterday they made a mockery of our roles as representatives of our community and the institution of parliament itself—and it continues today. This is not a government; it is a circus. Like the member for Jagajaga, like people across Australia, we all want to know: who is the Prime Minister? This coalition of the unwilling, this 'no-alition' of the Liberals and Nationals cannot govern the country. They have wasted their time in government. They have wasted the great privilege of governing Australia. What have they delivered? Power prices are through the roof. Wages have flatlined. Penalty rates to the lowest paid workers of this country have been cut. There is chaos in aged care and in health care. There are cuts to health and cuts to education. They have sought to destroy the industrial relations system of this country and to demonise the great trade union movement. To top it all off, they have sought to destroy the most trusted institution in this nation, the ABC.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Prime Minister stands for nothing—and it looks like no-one on the other side of this House stands for him. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM" rel="nofollow">
         PM
        </a>
        is the incredible shrinking man of this ramshackle circus, and he is disappearing before our very eyes. Actually, I've changed my mind. It's not a circus; it's a horror movie, and a B-grade schlock horror one at that—so predictable and so stupid it makes you laugh out loud. But I tell you what: it's not funny. This performance of the Liberal-National no-alition is not what the people of Australia want to see and is not what the people of Australia need to ensure the continued prosperity of this great country. This government is selling this nation and its people short. They should be ashamed and, quite frankly, they should leave. We are sick of this. I know the people of Rockingham and Kwinana in my electorate are disgusted by it—indeed, all of

        and Australia joins in on that. They are crying out for real leadership, and the

         Australian Labor Party
        </a>
        stands ready to provide that leadership.

        leads a united and hardworking team that is focused on the best interests of the people of Australia, and Labor is ready to govern. Labor has better policies, policies that are fair and policies that put people first.

       <p>
        In Western Australia, Labor is ready. In Canning, we have the wonderful Mellisa Teede, a strong advocate for regional funding and her community. In Stirling, Melita Markey's working hard, representing her community. Knocking on doors and talking to the whole community of Pearce is the strong, steady and brilliant Kim Travers. In Hasluck, long-serving local councillor

        is in touch with the community and has his ear to the ground. In Swan, Hannah Beazley is working hard and defending, always, defending the Australian public healthcare system that did nothing less than save her life. They are all brilliant Labor candidates who are ready to join me and the WA Labor lower house team of Ann Aly, Matt Keogh,
