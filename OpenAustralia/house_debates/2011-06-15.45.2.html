        I have been contacted by residents in my electorate regarding the lack of Medicare facilities in the vicinity of the

        and Narellan areas. Residents who live in these areas must travel to Campbelltown or Camden to access Medicare services, which is a huge inconvenience to them. In this part of my electorate there is little to no public transport and the population is ageing. Many elderly or disabled residents must rely on family members to take time off work to drive them to a Medicare centre. The surrounding area is expected to grow by 320 per cent over the next 30 years, with more than 200,000 people moving into new developments at

        I accept that we live in the age of technology and that the service is now online, but some residents in Macarthur need face-to-face interaction to manage their healthcare needs, not electronic transactions. I believe that every Australian should be able to access the government services they need, especially when it comes to their health and wellbeing.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        is an excellent service, but we need better accessibility to these services in the Macarthur region. At present only some claims for simple

        consultations can be made online. There are many customers who still need to attend the centre to make their claims in person or to use a Medicare drop box.

        Residents in my electorate who are elderly, living with a disability or suffering ill health have asked for help and they should not be ignored. Medicare Australia has vowed to improve convenience and access for all Australians by improving a range of service options, including online, to meet public needs. I call on the government to consider opening a Medicare centre in the Narellan town centre so the most vulnerable residents in my electorate can access the services they deserve. A Medicare centre at Narellan would be a great outcome for the people of Macarthur.
