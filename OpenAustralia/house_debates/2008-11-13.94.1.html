        The winner of the 2008 Paterson Junior Citizen Award is Jade Alexander. Jade is an enthusiastic, diligent student and excellent role model. Jade has given many hours to help with school fundraising events, with $3,000 to be donated to local charities. The winner of the 2008 Paterson Corporate Citizen Award is Nelson Bay Golf Club. The club went to extraordinary efforts in raising over $130,000 for our local community, in particular raising over $30,000 for the Gibson-Tarrant families, which were touched by tragedy in a house fire which claimed the life of dear little Taya Gibson earlier this year.

        The 2008 Paterson Citizen of the Year is Ron Pile. Ron is an inspirational volunteer and a true leader for the Bulahdelah Rural Fire Service. Ron was a founding member of the brigade when it started with no more than a lean-to shed. Ron has been on call for the Bulahdelah community 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for over 50 years. Ron has always put the community needs before himself.

        A special mention must also go to an exceptional nominee, Myrtle Rissler, who is the tender age of 95 years. Myrtle has been volunteering at Raymond Terrace St Johns Church of England for over 60 years and has been a member of the Raymond Terrace Senior Citizens Committee for over 20 years. Congratulations to all those nominees and winners. Your efforts are more than appreciated by the community of Paterson.
