        I present the committee's advisory report on the Judicial Misbehaviour and Incapacity (Parliamentary Commissions) Bill 2012 and the Courts Legislation Amendment (Judicial Complaints) Bill 2012, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee.

        by leave—I table the advisory report of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs into the Judicial Misbehaviour and Incapacity (Parliamentary Commissions) Bill 2012 and the Courts Legislation Amendment (Judicial Complaints) Bill 2012, and in doing so I would particularly like to mention the efforts of the previous member for Denison and now President of the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_Kerr" rel="nofollow">
         Duncan Kerr
        </a>
        , in making this legislation become reality. The Courts Legislation Amendment (Judicial Complaints) Bill 2012 seeks to introduce greater transparency and accountability in the handling of complaints about judicial officers in the federal courts other than the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Court_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         High Court of Australia
        </a>
        . The Judicial Misbehaviour and Incapacity (Parliamentary Commissions) Bill 2012 introduces a framework for the establishment of a parliamentary commission to investigate misbehaviour or the incapacity of a judicial officer.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important legislation; however, I would point out that the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs has had three policy inquiries, we have had 10 bills inquiries tabled, we have a foetal alcohol spectrum disorder policy inquiry underway and six more bills coming towards us. It is certainly a hardworking committee, as I am sure the member for Pearce opposite would agree. I thank the hardworking secretariat for putting up with the amount of work that is going through this committee, and I note that Rebecca and Natalya are here in the chamber.
       </p>
       <p>
        As these bills are the subject of a concurrent inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, to avoid burdening stakeholders with a request for multiple submissions on the same bills and in light of the work we are doing, the committee decided to reference the submissions accepted and published by the Senate committee. This committee held a public hearing with the Attorney-General's Department and the Law Council of Australia to clarify matters.
       </p>
       <p>
        This advisory report, which is the Social Policy and Legal Affairs Committee's 11th, addresses a number of issues that were raised in the submissions and at the public hearing, such as payment for legal representation, the exemption of heads of jurisdiction and High Court justices from complaints handling, and the appointment of parliamentary commission members. The committee also makes comment on some issues that caused it concern, such as the specific need for the two bills, the protection of the reputation of the judiciary and the potential for political interference.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ultimately, however, the committee concluded that the bills achieve their objectives and do not warrant any amendments. The report contains the committee's recommendation that both of the bills be passed by this House. I actually stood to do this several months ago but was not given leave. I thank the committee for their work, particularly the Hon.

        <p>
         by leave—First, may I say that I concur with the comments that the member for Moreton has just made in thanking the secretariat for their work given the extraordinary workload that this committee has now been charged with. I also thank the father of the House, the member for Berowra, for his contribution and long experience in this place on this particular matter. As the member for Moreton said, he became a member of this committee for the duration of this inquiry.
        </p>
        <p>
         A key element of Australia's separation of powers is an independent judiciary which enjoys a strong security of tenure. Removal of judicial officers is deliberately difficult, primarily to ensure that the decisions are not influenced by the threat of removal from office. But, as public officers, those appointed to the judiciary are expected to maintain the highest of standards. The drafters of the Constitution settled on the amorphous phraseology in section 72 that removal is by a resolution passed by both houses of parliament, on the grounds of 'proven misbehaviour or incapacity'.
        </p>
        <p>
         Constitutional scholars have since grappled with what constitutes 'proven' and 'misbehaviour' and the process through which these should be investigated. Also, with the expansion of the federal judiciary well beyond what was first contemplated under the Constitution, there is a difficult question of how complaints against officers are to be dealt with, particularly as referring these claims, many of which are vexatious, to the federal parliament would be extremely cumbersome.
        </p>
        <p>
         The concerns were canvassed in a wide ranging Senate inquiry by the Senate
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_Committee" rel="nofollow">
          Standing Committee
         </a>
         on Legal and Constitutional Affairs entitled Australia's Judicial System and the Role of Judges, tabled in 2009. A recommendation of that inquiry was to establish formal mechanisms dealing with complaints handling and investigation. The recommendation is the foundation of the two bills inquired into by this committee, namely, the Courts Legislation Amendment (Judicial Complaints) Bill 2012 and the Judicial Misbehaviour and Incapacity (Parliamentary Commissions) Bill 2012.
        </p>
        <p>
         The first bill sets out an enabling framework where the principal judicial officer, such as the chief justice of the particular court, determines in-house whether a claim has initial merit. This is in line with standard procedures across government for an internal examination before deciding on any further action. A full system cannot be legislated, as this could potentially conflict with the procedures under chapter 3 of the Constitution and, if challenged, could invalidate the whole system, but the committee was satisfied that the non-legislative system enabled by this bill has enough safeguards to ensure legitimate complaints are not sidelined or stifled.
        </p>
        <p>
         The second bill establishes a procedure for the investigation of alleged misbehaviour. Specifically, it allows for a parliamentary commission consisting of at least one former or current federal or state judge and two other officers, appointed by the Prime Minister after consultation with the Leader of the Opposition. This commission has wide ranging powers to collect evidence and hear from witnesses. The proposed system reflects similar procedures established, but later repealed, during the investigations of the former High Court judge
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_Murphy" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         in 1986.
        </p>
        <p>
         Concern was raised during hearings regarding the wide ranging investigative powers of the commission, the ambiguity over the role of the commission to either 'advise or 'compile' information to present to the parliament and the potential for political interference. Further, as allegations of misbehaviour against the judiciary are extremely rare, the committee queried the need for this legislation. As in the case of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_Murphy" rel="nofollow">
          Justice Murphy
         </a>
         , ad hoc provisions could be just as useful as a standing legislative process. Regardless, the committee did not see this as enough to warrant dissention against the bill and has therefore recommended both bills be passed without amendment. I commend the advisory report to the House.
