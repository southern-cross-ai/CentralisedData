       <p>
        Each of our electorates has people who leave their mark on our communities after they are lost to us. These people are the salt of our community—the people who put in, treat people with respect, pass on their skills and wisdom, and give unconditionally of their time to improve the lot of others. Dennis 'Noddy' Reeves was one of these people and he has been lost not only to his loving family but to an embracing community.
       </p>
       <p>
        For young men, it is important to have connection with significant others—significant others who provide that little bit of guidance, that word of affirmation when things are a bit tough and an approach to life that includes humour and hospitality. Dennis was that significant other to many. It is not so important what we do in life, but it is important who we are.

        . A 20-plus-year stint as president of the Burnie club, and his maverick leadership of the Rocky Cape Shack community, means his legacy will be long remembered and will live on in others. Together with Senator Stephen Parry, I would like to pass on the sympathies of a grateful electorate to Dennis's wonderful family—his wife of 34 years, Marisa; his much-respected children, Karli and Brennan; and his wider family.
