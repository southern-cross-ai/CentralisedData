       <p>
        I rise to make a really important contribution to this parliament, because last night the parliament passed Labor's tax cut plans, which will provide relief for 13.6 million Australians. All taxpayers will be provided with tax cuts as a result of the Labor plan, and, from 1 July, in my electorate of Gorton, we'll see 78,000 taxpayers receiving cost-of-living relief through these tax cuts. It's important to note that 88 per cent of the taxpayers of Gorton will be better off than they would have been under the Liberal plan that was initially the matter considered by the parliament. Although the Liberal opposition supported the plan last night, we really don't think they had their heart in it, and we know that, if they were in government, there is no way this plan would have ever succeeded and ever been enacted by the parliament.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now, for the people of the electorate of Gorton, it means there's an average of $1,426 a year for each taxpayer. For example, a nurse in Gorton earning $78,000 will get a tax cut of $1,579 a year. A truck driver in Gorton earning $77,000 will receive a tax cut of $1,604. A primary school teacher in Gorton earning $80,000 will get a tax cut of $1,679 a year. Labor's tax plans are about giving more help to

        to help with cost-of-living pressures, making sure that they keep more of what they earn.
       </p>
       <p>
        Gorton is a relatively young electorate, with about 40 per cent of the population under the age of 30. Over the last year and a half, I've engaged and spoken with many young people in my electorate about the broad range of issues that are of concern to them. In my role as Minister for Skills and Training, I've spent considerable time visiting
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">

        s and businesses that hire apprentices and have spoken to countless young people. What many of them tell me is about how cost-of-living pressures are making their lives challenging, which is why I'm very proud of the fact that this government has introduced fee-free TAFE initiatives. With more than 350,000 Australians enrolling in fee-free TAFE and a further 300,000 courses starting from this year, there are more opportunities for young people across the nation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether it be providing tax relief through Labor's tax cut plan or providing fee-free TAFE courses in areas of demand, the Albanese government will continue to provide support for people that are doing it tough too often, and we'll continue to do so as we go forward.
