       <p>
        As members would be aware, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        government has announced a positive COVID case and a seven-day lockdown. I and the President of the Senate have already sent out to the building a list of the exposure sites in the ACT as well as all COVID-19 testing locations. As you know, we have imposed strict restrictions here in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        for this entire sitting period, and the measures, as I said two Mondays ago, have been above and beyond the current ACT COVID rules. We have had much lower occupancy in the building, Parliament House has not been open to the public, all catering has been takeaway only and, of course, mask-wearing has been required.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's also important that I inform members that parliamentarians who remain in the ACT are classified as essential, as well as their staff that are essential and those staff essential for the operation of the building, and journalists are also permitted to attend the building for work. I urge everybody to regularly check the exposure location sites on the ACT Health website and to follow all the ACT Health directives. Again, as I've said before and as you all know, should anyone in the building experience any symptoms, no matter how mild, do not attend Parliament House; get tested and isolate. I just wanted to make that statement for the information of members.
