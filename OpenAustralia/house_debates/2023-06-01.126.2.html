        Today I want to share a vision of our rural health workforce. It's a vision to train our next generation of doctors, nurses and allied health practitioners; to attract research excellence and innovation to our region; to bring together our major health education institutes,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
         TAFE
        </a>
        s, universities, Defence and Albury Wodonga Health. It's a vision to make Albury Wodonga Health the regional health research and education capital of Australia. We will do this by establishing a collaborative education and research centre co-located at the new hospital in Albury currently under redevelopment. This centre will be a purpose-built facility which brings together clinical practice, research, education and training. It will pool resources for regional health research, and it will enhance our cross-border data collection and analysis.
       </p>
       <p>
        Albury Wodonga Health is the only cross-border health service in the nation. It services a large catchment of 300,000 people with higher than the national rates of chronic disease. Within 15 years this catchment will grow by a third. By 2040, we will need a hospital and workforce capable of handling 150,000 emergency presentations, 40,000 surgeries and 1,900 births every year. This centre is the key to attracting, training and retaining high-quality staff to meet this surge in demand. This joint proposal has come from Albury Wodonga Health, the University of

        Last month I sat down with these partners to discuss what this proposal could mean for us because, if there is one thing I know, it's rural health care. Before becoming an MP, I spent my whole career in rural health, firstly as a clinical nurse and midwife, and then as a researcher. One of the key things that were looking at was one of the best ways to grow and retain a strong regional health workforce. I've seen how people suffer when we fall short, but I have also seen what success looks like. At the University of Melbourne Department of

        we pioneered this model, and I want to see this grow and develop on the border.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trust me when I say I know this proposal will work. I know what this means for our region. It's a big vision. Like every journey, it starts with a single step, and the first small step is this one: a modest funding request to scope and develop this proposal. When I leave this Chamber, I'm off to see the Minister for Health and Aged Care. I will also be seeing the Assistant Minister for Rural and Regional Health. I hope they get used to seeing me, because we need this funding and we need it urgently to get this journey on its way.
