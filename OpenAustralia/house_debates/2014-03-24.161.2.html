        Yesterday I had the privilege of attending the program launch for the Woodend Winter Arts Festival, something I know the Deputy Speaker would be fond of. The Woodend Winter Arts Festival started 10 years ago. Over the June Queen's Birthday long weekend it brings together acclaimed Australian and international talent in music, literature and the arts. It also brings together the community of the stunning

         Macedon Ranges
        </a>
        The result is a world-class showcase in the heart of Victoria's best food and wine region of both vibrant and traditional thought-provoking performances and events.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Woodend Winter Arts Festival was the brainchild of local arts director Jacqueline Ogeil and the president of the committee,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_O'Donnell" rel="nofollow">
         John O'Donnell
        </a>
        . The committee was established in 2004 and the festival quickly became one of the hallmark events on the calendar for the arts in our region. The festival is held every year over the long weekend and brings some energy and warmth to a community which otherwise would be shivering in the dead of winter. It attracts over 5,000 visitors to the Macedon Ranges annually and has grown to a program of more than 30 events. The program involves music, such as the classics and jazz, and literature events, as well as a visual arts program. It brings together young and old through a series of free events in the community as well as through some paid events, which help fund the program annually. The festival's classical music program is broadcast annually over

        </a>
        and also internationally through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Broadcasting_Union" rel="nofollow">
         European Broadcasting Union
        </a>
        , which speaks volumes for the talent in the festival.
       </p>
       <p>
        This year is a special year, as it celebrates the 10th anniversary of this festival. This year's program is one of the most ambitious yet. It will include opera, a string quartet from Vienna and a leading international cellist from Singapore, as well as a few favourites, including the Italian violinist David Monte. It is a rare opportunity to bring opera to the Macedon Ranges, and I am sure it will be a success.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Bendigo electorate is home to a number of growing arts professionals, and the festival is one of our local success stories. With the right mix of commercial, public and community investment, our cultural industry will continue to grow. But funding for this festival is an ongoing struggle. Whilst we have the commercial and community investment, what we do not have is public investment. It is time for Regional Arts Victoria and Regional Arts Australia to get behind such fantastic festivals as the Woodend Winter Arts Festival, which, I am sure, this year will be another success.
