       <p>
        I want to pay tribute to one of my most admired constituents,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Bull" rel="nofollow">
         John Bull
        </a>
        , who died at the age of 70 last month. John was a vital member of the Berowra
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Lions Club
        </a>
        . He served two terms as president, in 2017 and 2019, despite battling an illness at the time. As president, John welcomed me to the club when I joined. He led the club with distinction through some difficult times and was a mentor and inspiration to all. He initiated many projects, including the Warrina Street exercise equipment project in Berowra. He worked tirelessly for years to make it a reality, and it was fitting that he was president at the opening of stage 1 of that development last year despite being gravely ill.
       </p>
       <p>
        John was a regular at Lions barbecues and other public functions and could often be found at the Berowra Lions op-shop when it was operating. He became affectionately known in the club as 'The man of steel' or simply 'Our Superman'. Last year John was awarded the Melvin Jones Fellowship, the highest honour that a Lions Club can bestow, in recognition of his leadership and his dedicated work for the Berowra community. Completely lost for words, John was surprised and humbled when he was presented with the award. For many years he proved his doctors wrong. They would repeatedly tell him he wouldn't survive until Christmas, and yet year after year he did.
       </p>
       <p>
        John Bull was a vital part of our community. He inspired all of those around him, particularly those members of the Berowra Lions Club. To his wife, Jen, and his broader family, may John's memory be a blessing and may he rest in peace.
