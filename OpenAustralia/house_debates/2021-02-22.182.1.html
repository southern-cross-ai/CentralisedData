        Just last Monday, 142,000 doses of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine arrived at Sydney airport. Today, priority groups will begin receiving their first COVID-19 vaccinations. This includes aged-care and disability-care workers and residents, frontline healthcare workers, and quarantine and border workers. I really am pleased to see how quickly this next step is being taken to ensure that the vaccine is available to those in our community who are the most vulnerable to COVID-19. Vaccination locations include more than 240 residential aged-care facilities, located across 190 towns and suburbs, as well as 16 Pfizer hubs across Australia. I am pleased to say that there are four locations on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        where the vaccine will be prioritised for residential aged-care and disability-care residents and staff. These include:

        . This vaccine is a safe, effective, voluntary and, of course, free vaccine. Residents from across the Robertson electorate can be assured that Australia has secured more than enough doses for all who choose to have the vaccine. The government has a comprehensive plan to offer these vaccines to all Australians by the end of October, and more information on priority groups and who will receive the first doses of the vaccine can be found at the Department of Health's website: health.gov.au. I'd encourage as many locals as possible to come forward and play their part in helping to protect themselves, their families and their community.
