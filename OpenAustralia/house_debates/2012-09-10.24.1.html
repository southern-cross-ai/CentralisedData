        I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the United States of America from 27 September through to 9 October 2011 and ask leave of the House to make a short statement in connection with the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.

        It was a pleasure to join my colleagues Senator the Hon.

        This was a very informative, bipartisan delegation to the United States. It had as one of its key focuses meeting with the Midwest. Quite often the focus is purely on Washington,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York" rel="nofollow">
         New York
        </a>
        or indeed the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         West Coast
        </a>
        . This trip focused on the Midwest, starting in Seattle and meeting with the Boeing aircraft manufacturer but then quickly moving through to Chicago, where we had the opportunity to address various concerns, through to venues such as the exchange where agricultural commodities are traded.
       </p>
       <p>
        The report outlines two recommendations. Firstly, the delegation recommends that the Australian government continue to develop and pursue avenues and opportunities for Australian businesses and education in the United States, and particularly avenues for business and education in the Midwest of the United States. Secondly, the delegation recommends that the Australian parliament give consideration to the establishment of an independent centre devoted to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Constitution" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Constitution
        </a>
        and civics education more generally.
       </p>
       <p>
        While I and my colleagues enjoyed all of the debate, discussion and dialogue that occurred through this whole trip, the one thing that we found absolutely fascinating was the approach by the American people and through the American government to have a centre which focuses on explaining and presenting to people the nature of their constitution and the way in which it was built, what their rights and responsibilities are under their constitution and the ongoing education about that.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee as a whole thought that there was a great opportunity that perhaps here in Canberra there should be a greater presentation opportunity, perhaps utilising
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Old Parliament House
        </a>
        as a venue for greater understanding by the community. I know that we have the Parliamentary Education Office for young people who come through. There is an opportunity for an expansion of the understanding of our Constitution and perhaps engaging in further dialog as people want to expand upon and focus on issues within the Constitution. Many people focus on whether or not we should be a republic and who the head of state should be. I say to the House, as I have said in previous speeches in this parliament, that there are more issues in our Constitution, which has matured over the last 100 years, that need to be addressed, rather that just who the head of state should be.
       </p>
       <p>
        The report has been tabled and presented and I encourage people to read it. With some of the contacts we had there and the opportunities afforded to us we appreciate the efforts of all, particularly our colleagues who worked throughout the United States, and our various embassies and consuls. We thank them for their support. It was a good trip and well worth the educational value it afforded us.
