        Just before I left for Canberra prior to last week, I attended the inaugural Cannington Cops versus Clontarf College football game down at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtin_University" rel="nofollow">

        oval, which was
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">

        . The game was a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WA_Police" rel="nofollow">
         WA Police
        </a>
        engagement initiative aimed at building relationships between police, Indigenous students and families, and the broader community in the South-East Metropolitan police district. They had held one previously with the local Islamic association, but that was a soccer game.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was great to see so many community members come down to watch the game and enjoy the free sausage sizzle with friends. I commenced the official proceedings by tossing the coin, and then the game got off to a cracking start. The Clontarf boys opened with a strong first half, leading the Cannington Cops by 35 to nine by half-time, but the Cannington Cops pulled back across the third and fourth quarters and managed to pull off an unexpected win against Clontarf, winning by just eight points, 64 to 56.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to thank Superintendent Brad Sorrell, Sergeant Matt Sharp and the principal of Clontarf, Troy Hayter, for their efforts in organising this important event. It's a great opportunity to encourage relationships between our local police and their community. It was also great to see so many of the Clontarf boys chatting with the WA Police on how they can actually get into the academy.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to congratulate both sides on an awesome afternoon of football. I look forward to seeing the next Clontarf versus Cannington Cops challenge next year, with Clontarf coming back stronger in next year's game.
