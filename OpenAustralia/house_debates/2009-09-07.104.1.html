        These volunteers all work in a whole variety of places, dedicating their time and effort to their local communities. As you heard, there was a range of different ages from right across the age spectrum, with Mr Matthew Long being the youngest. These are people who give their time, efforts and not some service in length of years. There was more than 25 years of service from some of these individuals. For others, it is the number of hours they do each week. All of these people contribute significantly to ensuring that the southern suburbs have vibrant community groups, whether they be service groups such as Meals on Wheels and Rotary or sports clubs to allow our young people to have sporting activities in the area.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank everyone for coming. It was a great success. All of these volunteers were supported by their friends and families. I was very pleased to be able to put on this event to recognise the significant contribution. We are hoping to do it again in the future because these volunteers are critically important to our local area in ensuring that we have a vibrant community in the south of Adelaide.
