        My question is to minister representing the Minister for Women. Will the minister outline to the House how the next National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children is being established and developed to address the scourge of domestic violence?

         I thank the member for Reid for her question and commend her on her strong work in parliamentary committees on this issue and note that she spoke about domestic violence in her first speech to this place. There is no excuse for family, domestic or sexual violence. Excuses like, 'It's not that bad,' 'I can't help it, 'Someone else made me do it' are no excuse, which is why we will not rest and there is always more work to be done.
        </p>
        <p>
         One in six women have experienced physical or sexual violence by a current or previous partner since the age of 15. Sadly, things that draw communities together can also tear families apart. We saw that during COVID when we all stayed home to stay safe. But for many women, home was not a safe place to be. Last year the Morrison government was able to deliver $150 million in a domestic violence response package because of the changing needs of COVID, in addition to our $340 million record investment in the fourth action plan. As we across the parliament address some of the shocking allegations and behaviours that have come to light, it's important that we focus on outcomes—outcomes for the women we represent, outcomes for the women who are counting on us out there.

          <p>
           Governments have a crucial role to play but so does each and every one of us. Research has shown that, while four in five people agree that violence against women starts with disrespect, many people are not confident that they know how to confront the issue. Taking action on the issue can seem overwhelming but, if we all take steps together, it will add up to positive change for Australia. I encourage everyone to look at the suite of resources on respect.gov.au and start a conversation about respect with the people in their lives.
          </p>
          <p>
           With respect to the sexual violence we have seen in our workplace, it is never okay. The Prime Minister and each and every one of us in this House has made that clear. Change is coming. We all need to be part of that change. We all need to be part of getting our House in order. As we develop the consultation leading up to the fifth national action plan to reduce violence against women and their children, we will hear from all of the voices out there that have been raised in support of women, in support of equal opportunity and in support of human rights, and we are determined to leave no-one behind.
