       <p>
        As this government does not appear to have a plan for jobs in regional Queensland and specifically my electorate of Herbert, I have taken up the challenge myself. Since taking up this role last year I have had numerous people raising concerns with me about Townsville projects going to southern businesses. This is deeply concerning for businesses in our community, especially as our unemployment rate is so high and our economy is struggling. There appears to be no good reason why local businesses and contractors cannot secure this work. Many businesses have also discussed with me that the definition of 'local' being
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_and_New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        is somewhat problematic in the region.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our local businesses and contractors have excellent technical skills, but sometimes they are challenged by the daunting requirements of writing tenders, identifying and managing risk, and managing contractual obligations. That is why I looked for a local business that I could work with to assist small businesses and contractors. I found and collaborated with LEAD Consultants in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         North Queensland
        </a>
        , a local business that offers advice to businesses, community organisations and contractors to assist them to develop successful tenders and contract management. Together we agreed to run a free workshop that would be beneficial for local people. On 13 March I co-hosted a free workshop which was well attended by businesses, community organisations and contractors. The workshop offered an overview of tendering, contract administration, risk management and security-of-payments processes. Participants were given a booklet to take home. We must create jobs for our local communities.
