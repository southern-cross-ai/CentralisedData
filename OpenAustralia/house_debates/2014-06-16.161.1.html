        The 2014 budget is expanding education opportunities for all Australians by offering a broader range of education choices which will stand among the best in the world and strengthen our higher education system. A world-class higher education system is vital to a world-class economy and world-class living standards. The coalition government has made the decision to not only compete but to surpass the quality of education worldwide and deliver the best higher education system in the world for all Australians. Student support will come in the form of a $15.6 billion funding scheme provided to Australian universities, deregulation of the university sector and the largest ever Commonwealth scholarships scheme.
       </p>
       <p>
        Starting with an improved Commonwealth scholarships scheme, the coalition government's plan will enable our smarter students to receive a world-class education regardless of their economic background or geographic placement. That includes expanding the Commonwealth funding system for students studying not just degrees but diplomas and associate degrees, and enhancing the ability of regional and outer metropolitan higher education providers to improve course options and quality, as well as facilitating partnerships between

        s, private colleges and universities to help less prepared students succeed at university. The coalition government recognises that for too long regional Australians have had limited choice in high-quality education.
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to further the coalition's global emphasis on education, along with Senator Brett Mason I recently farewelled students at

        hopes will encourage a genuine two-way flow of students between Australia and the Indo-Pacific region. This initiative follows a similar plan undertaken by the University of Queensland School of Languages and Comparative Cultural Studies, which involved a government grant to assist students in undertaking a semester based program at a university in Japan. These initiatives are wonderful opportunities for Australian students to gain the skill set necessary to build successful individual careers, as well as strengthening business and diplomatic ties in light of the globalised world.
       </p>

        As well as university students participating in the Colombo plan,

        and Lord Mayor Graham Quirk are determined to make Brisbane Australia's new world city in every way. Brisbane City Council has worked for many years to attract international students to the Brisbane education system. Nineteen university students from around the world have been appointed Brisbane International Student Ambassadors by Lord Mayor Quirk, with the role of promoting Brisbane as an education destination to their home countries. This initiative is only one of many, including welcome days, exhibitions and friendship ceremonies held by the lord mayor to thank international students for choosing to study in Brisbane and to encourage them to remain lifelong friends of our city.
       </p>
       <p>
        The coalition government understands that excellence in education directly translates into national prosperity and productivity and believes this plan to help Australia achieve a world-class education will equip Australians with the skills to participate in employment.
