        T. M. BUTLER: To move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) in the document 'Our Plan', the Liberals and Nationals promised Australians, prior to the election that: 'We will deliver greater stability and certainty on superannuation—we won't move the goalposts. … We will ensure that no more negative unexpected changes occur to the superannuation system so that those planning for their retirement can face the future with a higher degree of predictability';
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the Government has subsequently revealed, in breach of that promise, that there will be a freeze on superannuation guarantee increases until at least July 2025;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) the Prime Minister has said of the changes that: 'By delaying the increase in the superannuation guarantee levy we are keeping more money in workers' pockets';
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) between 7 September 2013 and 2 September 2014, the Fair Work Commission received thousands of applications for approval of enterprise agreements; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) enterprise agreements' nominal expiry dates can be up to four years after the enterprise agreement is approved;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) recognises that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) parties negotiate the terms of enterprise agreements, including terms providing for pay increases, having regard to, among other things, the superannuation guarantee rate;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the parties who negotiated enterprise agreements for which applications for approval were made between 7 September 2013 and 2 September 2014 would have done so on the basis that the superannuation guarantee rate would increase during the life of the agreement;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) employees to whom such enterprise agreements apply are generally covered by 'no further claims' provisions, so they are not at liberty to negotiate for greater pay increases; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) accordingly, any money that is not going into their superannuation fund will also not be going into their pockets, despite the Prime Minister's claim; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) accordingly, calls on the Government to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) concede workers, whose enterprise agreements were negotiated between the election and 2 September 2014, have lost 'money in their pocket' because the negotiations were conducted on the basis there would be 'no negative change to superannuation'; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) enable those workers to renegotiate pay increases, to compensate for the unexpected freeze on superannuation.

        SUPERANNUATION: Resumption of debate on the motion of Ms T. M. Butler—That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) in the document 'Our Plan', the Liberals and Nationals promised Australians, prior to the election that: 'We will deliver greater stability and certainty on superannuation—we won't move the goalposts. … We will ensure that no more negative unexpected changes occur to the superannuation system so that those planning for their retirement can face the future with a higher degree of predictability';
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the Government has subsequently revealed, in breach of that promise, that there will be a freeze on superannuation guarantee increases until at least July 2025;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) the Prime Minister has said of the changes that: 'By delaying the increase in the superannuation guarantee levy we are keeping more money in workers' pockets';
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) between 7 September 2013 and 2 September 2014, the Fair Work Commission received thousands of applications for approval of enterprise agreements; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) enterprise agreements' nominal expiry dates can be up to four years after the enterprise agreement is approved;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) recognises that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) parties negotiate the terms of enterprise agreements, including terms providing for pay increases, having regard to, among other things, the superannuation guarantee rate;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the parties who negotiated enterprise agreements for which applications for approval were made between 7 September 2013 and 2 September 2014 would have done so on the basis that the superannuation guarantee rate would increase during the life of the agreement;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) employees to whom such enterprise agreements apply are generally covered by 'no further claims' provisions, so they are not at liberty to negotiate for greater pay increases; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) accordingly, any money that is not going into their superannuation fund will also not be going into their pockets, despite the Prime Minister's claim; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) accordingly, calls on the Government to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) concede workers, whose enterprise agreements were negotiated between the election and 2 September 2014, have lost 'money in their pocket' because the negotiations were conducted on the basis there would be 'no negative change to superannuation'; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) enable those workers to renegotiate pay increases, to compensate for the unexpected freeze on superannuation.
