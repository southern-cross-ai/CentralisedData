        Last Wednesday, I attended the Windale Health and Safety Expo. It was run by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WICA" rel="nofollow">
         WICA
        </a>
        , a community group based in the suburb of Windale. Windale is a fairly socially disadvantaged suburb and the WICA group have worked hard to raise the level of community involvement and help the community come together. They have been very successful in doing that. To me, the highlight of the day was when the students from Windale Public School sang the national anthem both in the Awabakal language and in English. It really impressed everybody present that day. I would like to thank all the stallholders who came along and gave up their time. There was information on every aspect of community and government there for people to access. It was very rewarding for those people who came along. The information that was obtainable and the support that people received will continue to be available into the future. This is an annual event; it will happen again next year. Last year it was also very successful. I congratulate the WICA group on the fine day that they organised.
