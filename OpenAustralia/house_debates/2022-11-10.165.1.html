       <p>
        I rise to acknowledge two very different community events which took place in my electorate in recent weeks. The first was the end-of-season awards presentation of the United Khalsa Hockey Club, which I attended just a couple of weeks ago. This vibrant youth sporting club runs out of Craigieburn, in the northern part of my electorate, and serves a community of mostly Sikh families. It was an absolute delight to witness the enthusiasm of all the young hockey players—from as young as the under 10s through to the under 17s—and hear from many of them about the difference that organised sport plays in their lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        Coach Inderjeet Singh Sandhu and his team of volunteer team managers constantly teach the young players about the importance of consistency, dedication to improvement, doing their best and self-confidence. The club includes both boys and girls and young men and young women in their teams, which are not divided on gender lines. With a stick in hand and training that emphasises teamwork, community service and good character, everybody can and does play hockey together. Both mums and dads contribute as umpires, team managers and club administrators, providing strong role models for the next generation of leaders.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the theme of strong leaders, I want to acknowledge a noteworthy event that takes place tomorrow night, which is the celebration of 20 years of service by Gina Dougall,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        of the Banksia Gardens Community Services. Banksia Gardens is a dynamic neighbourhood house located in Broadmeadows in the southern end of my electorate. Gina Dougall has been at the helm for almost as long as I have been the federal member for Calwell, so we've worked together for quite a significant period of time.
       </p>
       <p>
        Gina is a powerhouse of a community leader—inspiring, encouraging, energetic and innovative. She has built an incredible team of people, and together they have transformed Banksia Gardens into one of the largest neighbourhood houses in Victoria, with a suite of award-winning programs that challenge poverty, injustice and disadvantage in a radical and effective way. These programs include the youth justice partnership; Project REAL; the Northern Centre for Excellence in School Engagement; Good People Act Now, a youth-led action for gender equity; Aiming High, which supports aspiring secondary school students; and Towards Equality 2020 &amp; Beyond, supporting grassroots women's groups.
       </p>
       <p>
        Gina is one of the best known community activists within the city of Hume, contributing to numerous boards, committees and organisations as well as undertaking the incredible work she does leading Banksia Gardens. It is not common for someone to remain in such a challenging position in the community sector for so long, so I am absolutely delighted to congratulate Gina Dougall on her 20-year commitment to our community, which we both know and love and spend a lot of our working lives in. Congratulations Gina, and here's to the next 20 years.
