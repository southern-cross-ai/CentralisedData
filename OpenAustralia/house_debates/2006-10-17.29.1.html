        My question is addressed to the Minister for Industry, Tourism and Resources. Would the minister update the House on government initiatives to encourage renewable energy generation in Australia? Are there any alternative approaches to reducing greenhouse gas emissions?

         Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Standing order 100(d)(vi) says clearly that questions are out of order if they are ironical.

          I think the member for Grayndler would be well aware that, if I were to enforce that rule strictly, most questions would probably be ruled out of order. I call the minister.

          <p>
           I thank the member for Bonner for his question and his ongoing support of government policies to ensure not only that the economy continues to grow but also that we continue to address our renewable and environmental issues. Since this government came to power, we can stand tall on our record on renewable energy investment. Government policies are currently seeing $123 million placed into the expansion and extension of the Renewable Remote Power Generation Program, $100 million into the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renewable_Energy" rel="nofollow">
            Renewable Energy
           </a>
           Development Initiative and $75 million into the Solar Cities program, which I had the pleasure of launching the Queensland leg of with the member for Herbert. That was extraordinarily well received by the people of Townsville. As well, there is the $500 million Low Emissions Technology Demonstration Fund, which is accessible to renewable energy technologies. We should not forget the mandatory renewable energy target, which is expected to see some $3 billion worth of investment in the renewable energy sector.
          </p>
          <p>
           The results speak for themselves. Under this government, wind energy capacity has increased in Australia by 7,000 per cent—from 10 megawatts in 2000 to 700 megawatts in 2005. Solar energy has also grown, with the number of solar hot-water system sales doubling since 2000-01 and extra capacity in solar photovoltaic also being installed. These are impressive gains, but the government has not been putting all of our eggs in one basket. We are focusing on a broad range of technologies that include renewables, clean coal technology and potentially nuclear technology.
          </p>
          <p>
           But I was asked about alternative greenhouse policies. Unfortunately, from the Labor Party there is nothing that could be considered credible. Despite what those opposite will tell you, taxes and targets do not constitute a credible greenhouse policy. Without the technology in the first place, taxes and targets simply mean that Australian industries and jobs will be exported.
          </p>
          <p>
           But there is light on the other side, as there always is, from the member for Batman. In the
           <i>
            Australian
           </i>
           newspaper earlier this year, when talking about Labor Party emissions targets, the member for Batman said:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           The problem for countries, not just Australia, is fronting up to how we’re going to achieve those targets.
          </p>
          <p>
           He went on to say:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           You can’t just think up some harebrained idea and impose it on industry if you want to keep jobs in Australia. You have got to work out the detail.
          </p>
          <p>
           I could not agree more. And that is exactly what this government is doing: working out the details and finding technology based solutions to greenhouse gas emissions.
