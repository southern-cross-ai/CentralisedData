        I want to talk about the Prime Minister's signature election policy commitment of a $275 cut in electricity prices—an iron-clad commitment, a very big feature at the recent election campaign and a solemn undertaking. It was the absolute centrepiece of Labor's energy policy at the election, so much so that the first sentence of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube" rel="nofollow">
         YouTube
        </a>
        video announcing Labor's energy policy was: 'Labor's Powering Australia plan will cut power bills by $275 a year for homes.' It was not ambiguous and not qualified in any way. Even more so, three days before the election, there was a particularly important, big speech at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Press_Club" rel="nofollow">
         National Press Club
        </a>
        —everyone was there. When raising the energy plan, what did the Prime Minister say on 18 May? 'It is the best way to cut power bills for families and businesses, saving families $275 a year'. So it was very clear.
       </p>

        This is interesting too. On 12 July, after the election, there was a big speech on energy. It was such a big speech that the word 'energy' was mentioned 41 times. How many times was the saving mentioned? None. Not at all. In fact, I don't think the Prime Minister has mentioned it once since the election, which seems a remarkable oversight. But the Australian people won't forget, because this was a fundamental commitment.
