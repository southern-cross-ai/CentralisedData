        , I wish to make some comments on Australia's close relationship with our neighbour New Zealand. My electorate has a special connection with New Zealand given that according to statistics provided by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Casey" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        there are approximately 5,000 residents of the local population who were born in New Zealand and who are now living in my electorate of Holt.
       </p>
       <p>
        New Zealand residents in the electorate of Holt have enriched our local community and have definitely brought their rich culture to the fore. The New Zealand residents in my local community have also brought with them, somewhat disconcertingly, their passion for rugby to suburbs like

        that starts on 9 September this year in New Zealand. I understand that even our local Mayor of the City of Casey, Councillor Shar Balmes, has New Zealand heritage. In recent times the thoughts of this community and the local community generally have been with New Zealand as our close neighbour across the Tasman has experienced a profound series of tragedies in recent months. The first was when an explosion ripped through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pike_River" rel="nofollow">
         Pike River
        </a>
        mine in November last year. Obviously, Australia was quick to respond and offer assistance by sending our specialists, experts and machinery to assist with the recovery effort. Unfortunately, as we know, 29 brave individuals died as a result of this tragedy, including two Australians, and our thoughts are with them and their friends and family. Following this tragedy the city of Christchurch, which had already experienced a 7.1-magnitude earthquake in September 2010, suffered a more severe 6.3-magnitude earthquake closer to the surface on 22 February 2011. This earthquake caused widespread damage across Christchurch, particularly in the central city and eastern suburbs, with damage exacerbated by buildings and infrastructure already weakened by the 4 September earthquake and its aftershocks.
       </p>
       <p>
        Significant liquefaction affected the eastern suburbs of the city, producing around 200,000 tonnes of silt. In total, 181 people were killed in the earthquake, making the earthquake the second-deadliest natural disaster recorded in New Zealand. Following the earthquake 300 members of the Australian police, as the

        and our

        costliest natural disaster. Given the loss of life and the profound suffering experienced by those in Christchurch and New Zealand and particularly given the number of people in my electorate who have New Zealand heritage and background, it has been a very difficult time for them but I reassure them that our thoughts are with them at this very difficult time and I note there have been some aftershocks subsequently and even recently. These people make a significant contribution to the life in our multicultural community and they are a significant part and a good part of that community. (
