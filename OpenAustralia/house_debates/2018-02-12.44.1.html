       <p>
        I've come in here today to talk about Gai Hawthorn, an absolute living legend in my electorate of Lindsay, and to say thank you to her for organising the 10th Penrith Community Kitchen Christmas which happened in December.

        party involves all people in my electorate who are marginalised, don't have a family to call their own or just need some companionship and friendship over the time of the year that the rest of us are generally celebrating with our families.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, Gai didn't do it on her own. I'd like to thank the Penrith Rotary Club, Penrith
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">

        , Hog's Breath, our new cafe, Mr Watkin's bar, and also Cafe Fred, for providing the food that was served at the luncheon and the hampers. Over 150 hampers went home with the families who were in attendance, and 300 male and female care packs were also distributed. Toys from the Penrith RSL giving tree and Penrith Rotary, which were donated by the good people of Lindsay, were given to all the children who were there. All items that were left over also went to other great agencies.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thirty volunteers, including me, were there on the day, helping to serve lunch to all those people and provide some friendship, support and socialisation to those members of our community. Our local dance studio also provided some fabulous entertainment and some wonderful songs and Christmas tunes for everybody. I always talk in here about how the greatest strength of my community is my people, and today that is absolutely what I would like to say.
