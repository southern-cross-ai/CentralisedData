        demonstrates the continued success of the Australian technical colleges (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATC" rel="nofollow">
         ATC
        </a>
        s) program and reflects the better than expected progress that has been achieved to date in implementing this Howard government initiative.
       </p>
       <p>
        I can report to the House that 24 of the 25 Australian technical colleges have now been announced and 20 of these have already signed funding agreements with the Australian government ensuring funding for their establishment and operations up until the end of 2009. At least 21 colleges will be in operation during 2007, with a forecast 2,000 Australian students studying school based apprenticeships at those colleges. This initiative has been implemented well ahead of the schedule announced at the 2004 election.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australian technical colleges have clearly been embraced by the communities, employers and industry in the regions in which they are being established. Other Australian communities also want an Australian technical college. My own electorate of Moreton wants one. I guess I have to put a lot of work into making sure that something like that does happen. Australian technical colleges provide opportunities for young people in regions throughout Australia to commence a trade qualification whilst completing their senior secondary studies. Australian technical colleges will ensure that, over the longer term, Australian business will have access to a supply of highly qualified workers who will be trained according to local industry requirements.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill will increase the total funding for the Australian technical colleges initiative from the original $343.6 million to $456.2 million, or an increase of $112.6 million over the period from 2006 to 2009.
       </p>
       <p>
        The additional funding will provide a capacity for ATCs to provide high levels of support to both students and the employers who engage students as Australian school based apprentices.
       </p>
       <p>
        The additional funding will also address a range of other factors.
       </p>
       <p>
        Strong industry and community support for the ATC program has meant more colleges than originally anticipated opening by 2007. This has resulted in additional costs over the five-year period.
       </p>
       <p>
        A key feature of the ATC program is flexibility, and each college has been encouraged to pursue a model that best meets the needs of the region in which it is established. This flexibility has resulted in the operational costs necessary to get each college up and running being far higher than was originally expected. These costs vary from college to college because the secret of the success of this program is listening to the regions and making sure that, if they have a different operational model, we can back that. So every operational model is different.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of the 24 announced ATCs, the business led boards of these colleges have recommended in more cases than originally anticipated that a newly established school will be the most effective delivery model to meet their particular region’s needs. This has had a significant impact on the cost of the program through increased operational costs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Several colleges have also identified the need for multiple campuses to ensure appropriate coverage of the region. The member for Paterson is here. He has championed the cause. A good example of this is the Hunter ATC, which has college campuses in Newcastle, Maitland and Singleton. We are doing more than ever originally planned for in the program, and we now have the funding to make sure that we can back those regions all the way.

          Thank you. The

          s need to ensure students are trained using the latest tools and equipment with a focus on enterprise, employability, business and information technology skills to ensure they are as work ready as possible. While all ATCs have been encouraged to work closely with existing training providers, including state government owned
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAFE" rel="nofollow">
           TAFE
          </a>
          s, to utilise existing infrastructure in their region, the ATCs have in many cases been required to contribute funding for this infrastructure to be refurbished or upgraded.
         </p>
         <p>
          Passage of this bill will ensure the steady progression of the Australian technical colleges initiative will continue and enable 7,500 young Australians per year to undertake high-quality education and training relevant to a trade career.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Australian government is committed to raising the profile of these nation builders—of vocational and technical education. Attracting young people to the trades is vital for Australia’s future success and is an important step in addressing the skills shortages that we are experiencing across a number of industries and regions at this time.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Australian technical colleges initiative offers a new approach to achieving this and forms an important part of the Australian government’s strategy for tackling skill shortages now and into the future.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Australian technical colleges will promote trade qualifications as a highly valued alternative to a university degree and will develop a reputation that will show students and parents that vocational education and training provides access to careers that are secure, lucrative and very rewarding.
         </p>
         <p>
          The Australian technical colleges initiative is just one of a range of vocational and technical education initiatives that the Australian government has been delivering during its entire time in office but is particularly delivering during 2006-09.
         </p>
         <p>
          In fact, the Australian government’s investment over this forward years period of 2006-09 will total more than $11.3 billion. This is the biggest commitment to vocational and technical education by any government in Australia’s history.
         </p>
         <p>
          I have a great deal of pleasure in commending this bill to the House.
