        My question is to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister says he cares about university research, but he abandoned universities during COVID, leading to 40,000 job losses, including 7,000 researchers. Research centres closed, including, unbelievably, the national flood research centre in Lismore. Why does the Prime Minister say he cares about university research when he obviously doesn't?

         thank the shadow minister for her question. I believe, actually, this is the first education question that she has asked since November last year. That's how much she cares about education in this place—the very first question asked of the Prime Minister or myself in relation to education all year!
        </p>
        <p>
         Now, in relation to university policy, as the shadow minister would know, we put an additional $1 billion of money into university research during the pandemic. Just yesterday, we announced $242 million of extra funding—just yesterday—for trailblazing universities who want to commercialise their research.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, on top of that, we've added an additional 100,000 university places, which of course provide opportunities for Australians but additionally support the university sector as well. So, then, when you look at the numbers and—you can go to the numbers, and I encourage the shadow minister to do that—you look at 2019 and the university sector received $17.3 billion from the Commonwealth. In 2021, it was $20.4 billion. We've been there to support those academics, we've been there to support the research, we've been there to create further opportunities for Australian students, and there have never been more opportunities for Australian students than there are today, and so many of those courses are cheaper under us as well, particularly those courses which lead into a job. Yesterday the Prime Minister announced further policy to support the university sector and translate their great ideas into commercial products, and they know that we are backing them.
