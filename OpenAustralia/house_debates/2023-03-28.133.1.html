        I stand to pay tribute to a woman whose passing has been mourned across the north-western suburbs. Today her family in four states and seven countries, across three continents, will hear her story being told in Australia's parliament. Theresa Zarb was better known as Tess. She and her late husband, Tony, migrated to Australia from Malta in 1961 with two young sons. In 1969 they settled in the home they built in Fawkner Crescent,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keilor_East" rel="nofollow">
         Keilor East
        </a>
        . Back then Keilor East didn't have sewerage or sealed roads and very little by way of public transport, but it did have Tess Zarb.
       </p>
       <p>
        By 1970 Tess and Tony's family was complete with four boys—Avan, Alex, Martin and Adam. The sons Tess was so proud of delivered a beautiful tribute to their mother at her funeral at the end of last year. It was held at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Peter's" rel="nofollow">
         St Peter's
        </a>
        , a parish that Tess and Tony played a crucial role in developing. The Zarb brothers spoke of a woman who, when she saw a need in the community, would leap into action. Tess founded the St Peter's social club. It was a place for locals, especially our local citizens. It was a place to meet and enjoy some company and play bingo. Tess was the president of the club from the day it began in 1985 until the day she died, a reign that prime ministers could only envy. Indeed, nobody dared challenge her in the role.

       <p>
        As an early adopter of recycling practices, Tess washed and reused plastic bags, and leftover bits of soap were re-formed as new cakes. As the boys said in their eulogy, 'Mum had an innate ability to stretch the life and use of any item.' She adored and loved her children, their partners, her 11 grandchildren and her four great-grandchildren. She was a most prolific knitter. She sewed. She wrote letters. She knew the birthdays, wedding anniversaries and contact details of everybody in the extended family. She was a tireless charity worker, a

        tuckshop lady who lunched, until the very end.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tess and Tony were both deeply committed to Labor values. Her only flaw appears to have been that she was—and I'm quoting Avan here—'a terrible cook'. Tess, up in heaven, he said it, not me! As her boys put it, Tess's phone was always engaged, her door was always open and the kettle never cold. Neighbours would come and go in Fawkner Crescent, but their ties to the resident of No. 10 were never broken. Once you made friends with Tess Zarb, she was your friend for life. She was one of those rare gems in our society who acts as a comforting, steady anchor, whose love of connection and community drives their passion for bringing people together, without expecting any accolades. The love expressed by Avan, Alex, Martin and Adam, and the people from all walks of life who came to St Peter's to celebrate Tess tells us all we need to know. Hers was a full life, well lived. Vale, Tess Zarb.
