        I spent last Friday in the company of dozens of Scullin electorate's youngest and newest citizens in a Welcoming the Babies event at the Galada Community Centre in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epping_North" rel="nofollow">
         Epping North
        </a>
        , in the heart of some of the growth areas that make up the Scullin electorate's suburbs, like Epping North itself, like Wollert and like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Morang" rel="nofollow">
         South Morang
        </a>
        â€”suburbs that have been experiencing a baby boom and suburbs full of young families. It was terrific to share what is an exciting time with all of these families and some other interested community members, but also to recognise that, while having a child, particularly a first child, is a great occasion of joy for parents and those who care for them, it is also often a challenging time.
       </p>
       <p>
        This event was brought together, through the good work of staff and volunteers in my office and many community representatives, to ensure that all new parents, particularly those from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds, have an opportunity to engage with their neighbours to share the experience of parenting and to make sure that they are connected with all of the community resources that are available to them, such as the library services, support from the local breastfeeding association, support from hardship programs, because we know that quite often income goes down and expenses definitely go up when people have children. I was appreciative, particularly, of the representatives of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarra_Valley_Water" rel="nofollow">
         Yarra Valley Water
        </a>
        . Healthcare organisations like
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Health" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Health
        </a>
        and Plenty Valley Community Health were there to provide support and to ensure that people linked up into maternal and child health. We saw the playgroup and early childhood coordinators from the Whittlesea council there to ensure that socialisation as well as childcare needs are appropriately met. Victoria police were also present to look at the challenges of safety, particularly in terms of cars and car seats. It was a great opportunity to bring the community together to share the joy of children arriving, as well as to share in the stories that make up the diverse communities of Melbourne's north.
       </p>
       <p>
        As well as building resilience for families and supporting our resilient families, I think events like these play a very significant role in building communities. It was appropriate this event took place in Epping North on a new estate, because often one of the challenges in these new areas is to enable people to build firm relationships with their neighbours as the community grows. It was a real privilege for me, as a local member, to see this take place. I thank the parents, the grandparents, the carers and friends who brought along their babies to share their joy with me and other members of the community. I thank all the stallholders and community organisations who came together to support parents at such a wonderful time in their lives. I also take this opportunity to thank the staff in the Scullin electorate office, particularly Sally Delaney, and all the community volunteers who did so much to welcome the Scullin babies.
