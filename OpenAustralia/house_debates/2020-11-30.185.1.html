       <p>
        Last Saturday I joined with locals outside
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Paul's_Cathedral" rel="nofollow">
         St Paul's Cathedral
        </a>
        in Melbourne to mark what was then 800 days that Kylie Moore-Gilbert had been held in Iran. Outside St Paul's Cathedral in Melbourne were 800 butterflies representing the good wishes of people in Australia thinking of Kylie in prison in Iran and sending their best to her. It was pretty amazing news to hear that Kylie was then freed. I acknowledge the member for Wentworth, who sent remarks—obviously it was in Melbourne and he couldn't be there—and Senator Rice, who joined us on the day. My message today is that, despite those 800 days, Kylie should know that her friends and family did not forget her at any point. Many of them were knocking on our doors and seeking for us and for Australia to do more to have Kylie freed. Today I say thank you to everyone from the government and the department who was involved in helping to free Dr Kylie Moore-Gilbert. It is a wonderful thing that she is home. We never, ever believed that she was not there for a good reason, and we're very pleased that she is now free in Australia, where she belongs.
