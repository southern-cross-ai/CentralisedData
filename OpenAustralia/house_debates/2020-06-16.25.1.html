        Higher education students have been doing it tough during this pandemic. Many study in cities far from their families. Many work in hospitality, which is among the hardest hit industries. All of them have been unable to physically attend university campuses this year because of COVIDâ€”universities that they spend thousands of dollars to attend. The Student Services and Amenities Fee is only making their lives harder. In this era of COVID, when students can't attend campuses, it's a tax for services they can't even use. It's a tax that's come at a time when they need the money more than ever to support themselves.

        There are 14,700 higher education students in Higgins. Many have complained to me that, even before COVID, funds were being put towards services that were in the politicised interests of a few. This government is committed to supporting students, and the first step for that is helping them to support themselves. Refunding the

         SSAF
        </a>
        paid by students this year is not only good policy for helping students; it's also the right thing to do. This year's SSAF must be refunded and consideration given to axing the SSAF altogether.
