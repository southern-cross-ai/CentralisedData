       <p>
        I want to take this opportunity today to recount some of the most unbelievable things that our taxpayer dollars are funding under this government. If, like me, you are a keen viewer of sport you will remember the massive ad campaign that the government ran during this year's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
         AFL
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRL" rel="nofollow">
         NRL
        </a>
        grand finals. The ad promoting the government's plan for energy policy in Australia cost the Australian electorate $760,000. This is a disgusting waste of money when you consider that the ad ran all over
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , a state that isn't even impacted by the government's energy plan.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let's not even get started on the waste of money that this government's same-sex marriage postal survey was. But perhaps my favourite example of stupid government spending is one that came from a constituent. Brett called my office to advice that he had accrued a 20c credit on his child support account that could not be refunded because it was such a small amount of money. He understood that he would probably never see his 20c again but he became incensed when he received a 50c letter in his mailbox a month later as a statement. His daughter turned 18 a decade ago and, since then, he has received that letter every month at a total cost of $82 since. For the same price, the government could have paid Brett back 410 times. For useless advertising campaigns, for a $120 million non-binding, non-compulsory postal survey, Australians have become increasingly frustrated by this government's waste.
