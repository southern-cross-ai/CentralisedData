       Dear Mrs Irwin

      <p class="italic">
       Australia Post - petition request for a postal outlet in North Tamworth
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Thank you for your letter dated 4 September 2008 concerning a petition submitted for the Committee’s consideration regarding a postal outlet in North Tamworth.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Under the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 Australia Post is responsible for the day to day running of the organisation, including all decisions relating to the location of postal outlets. As far as practicable it is required to perform its functions in a manner consistent with sound commercial practice.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Australia Post has advised that in determining whether additional postal outlets are required it takes a number of factors into account, including the location of existing outlets and the volume of business likely to be transacted.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       I understand that there are four retail postal outlets in the general Tamworth area for a population of around 40,000. Australia Post’s NSW management has noted the level of development taking place along Tamworth’s north-western corridor but considers that the likely level of new business to be gained is insufficient to support an additional outlet.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Australia Post has advised that its NSW management will continue to review its retail network in the Tamworth area. I am informed that an Australia Post service representative will contact Northgate Centre tenants regarding the possibility of establishing a Postpoint facility within their business. This would ensure that customers at the shopping centre had access to a limited range of postage stamps and other basic postal products.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       I trust this information will be of assistance.
      </p>
      <p>
       from the
       <b>
        Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy
       </b>
       , to a petition presented on 1 September by
       <b>
        Mrs Irwin
       </b>
       (from 441 citizens)
