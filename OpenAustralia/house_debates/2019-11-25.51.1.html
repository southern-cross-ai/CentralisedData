       <p>
        The past month has been a big month in my electorate of Canning. The Morrison government is delivering for the Peel region along a number of fronts. Firstly, there's transport. We are congestion busting. The Lakelands train station was announced last week. It is long-awaited—more than 10 years—and we are providing 80 per cent of the funding for this $80 million train station. We've also announced the Mandurah train station car park upgrade, which will provide 600 more car-parking bays for residents. We're going 50-50 with the state.
       </p>
       <p>
        With regard to aged care, a fortnight ago I opened the Quambie Park aged-care expansion. Nine new assisted living aged-care homes were officially opened, and we provided $1.67 million towards that project.
       </p>
       <p>
        Education: I recently opened two brand-new facilities. Salvado Catholic College has new primary school buildings, hard courts and a soccer pitch, and we provided $1.3 million towards those things. There is also the Fairbridge College redevelopment, where we provided a new commercial kitchen, dining area and practical training facilities for young people working in hospitality.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, communications: last week I went to two new Mobile Black Spot towers, one in the Shire of Serpentine Jarrahdale and one in Martin. The one in Martin was particularly satisfying because we had a grassroots campaign to get that funded. I'm very proud of these achievements.
