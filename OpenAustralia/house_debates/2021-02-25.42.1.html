        was a Hawaiian Olympic swimmer and a keen surfer, and it is said he had a smile so wide that it won over the hearts of all Australians when he visited in 1914. Upon his visit, he held a surfing exhibition at

        . In my younger years I was more into rowing than surfing. However, it is something that I always wish I had taken up. Thankfully, I have a daughter who is beginning to pick up the board and give it a go, and she drags me along just to teach me some humility.
