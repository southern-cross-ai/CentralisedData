        My question is addressed to the Deputy Prime Minister, representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Does the government have any evidence that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea" rel="nofollow">
         North Korea
        </a>
        is preparing to test-launch a long-range ballistic missile? What response does the government have to any such action?

         I thank the member for Fadden for his question. The government is very concerned by reports that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea" rel="nofollow">
          North Korea
         </a>
         may be preparing to test-launch a long-range missile, which we would view as a highly provocative act that would only isolate North Korea further. A long-range missile test would be contrary to North Korea’s September 2005 joint statement pledge to maintain peace and security on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Peninsula" rel="nofollow">
          Korean Peninsula
         </a>
         and in North-East Asia at large. On Friday we called in the North Korean Ambassador, Ambassador Chon, as a result of action the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPRK" rel="nofollow">
          DPRK
         </a>
         was taking to prepare for the launch of a long-range missile. We called him in again yesterday, after further international concerns were raised, and underlined the serious consequences that would follow any launch. We will continue to work closely with our allies and friends to persuade North Korea to maintain its 1999 self-imposed moratorium on ballistic missile testing.
        </p>
        <p>
         North Korea is gravely mistaken if it thinks a long-range missile test would improve its security or its bargaining position at the six-party talks. We call upon it to re-engage immediately and without condition. A missile test would place additional strain on an already deadlocked six-party process and would cast serious doubt on North Korea’s willingness to engage the international community and move towards denuclearisation. North Korea’s track record on missile exports adds to concerns about its development of long-range missiles. Australia continues to play an active role in combating missile proliferation, including through participation in the missile technology control regime. The government calls on North Korea to back away from preparations for a long-range missile test launch and return to the six-party talks without precondition.
