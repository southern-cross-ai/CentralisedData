        I'm delighted to inform the House about a local business success story in my community on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        . Craig International Ballistics, from Arundel, was one of 37 Australian businesses selected to be part of Team Defence Australia. Team Defence Australia travelled to Paris last week to showcase their products and capabilities amongst the world's best in the global defence industry, at the Eurosatory 2018 trade show. Craig International Ballistics is one of Australia's leading providers of lightweight, combat-proven body-armour systems for military and police personnel.
       </p>
       <p>
        Defence Team Australia and Craig International Ballistics have a key role in the implementation of the government's Defence Export Strategy. They're facilitating networking and engagement opportunities at the international trade show and ensuring access to global supply chains. This year's event had over 1,800 exhibitors, from 63 countries; 57,000 international visitors, from 153 countries; 227 official delegations, from 94 countries and four international organisations; and a staggering 641 journos. Exporting overseas will encourage growth, innovation and employment in my community and in other communities, and the work of Team Defence Australia and international events like this is to be commended. I look forward to seeing more of our local businesses taking advantage of these exciting opportunities to access defence export markets. Once again, congratulations to Craig International Ballistics and Team Defence Australia.
       </p>

        On the subject of defence, I'm delighted to be able to inform the House that we've been able to help out, in some innovative ways, one of my constituents, Mr Louis Smit, an Anzac veteran who served in World War
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/II" rel="nofollow">

        . Mr Smit is 97. He proudly lives at home in a lovely apartment, and he's only able to live at home because of the invaluable support of his carer, Mrs Santiago, an American national. Mr Smit's carer was facing deportation from Australia because she didn't meet the requirement for a carer's visa in that she wasn't a relative. However, I believed there were some compelling facts about this particular case, and I was backed up strongly by the minister. Mr Smit's daughter, who lives in the United States, and Ms Santiago have been best friends for 30 years. When Mr Smit's wife passed away in 2014, the Smit family, who could not leave the United States for work reasons, asked their long-time family friend to travel to Australia to care for Mr Smit, and Ms Santiago agreed. Her expenses are privately paid by the family and, as reported, it makes sense that Mr Smit is able to be independent at home without drawing on the taxpayer and is being cared for by a long-term family friend.
       </p>
       <p>
        So I'm delighted to report the department has reviewed the case and allowed

        veteran Mr Smit's carer, Ms Santiago, to stay in Australia to care for him, as per the wishes of the family, wishes that go back decades and decades. And she will return to America the day this great veteran sadly departs. Well done to the family.
