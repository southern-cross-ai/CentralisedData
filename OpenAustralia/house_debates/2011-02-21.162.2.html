       <p>
        by leave—I move:
       </p>
       <p class="moved">
        That the time and order of business for the sitting tomorrow, Tuesday, 22 February 2011, be as follows, unless otherwise ordered:
        <dl>
         <dt>
          (a)
         </dt>
         <dd>
          the House, at its rising, adjourn until tomorrow at 12 noon;
         </dd>
         <dt>
          (b)
         </dt>
         <dd>
          government business have priority from 12 noon until 2 pm and from 9.30 pm until 10.30 pm; and
         </dd>
         <dt>
          (c)
         </dt>
         <dd>
          during the period from 12 noon until 2 pm any division on a question called for in the House, other than on a motion moved by a Minister, shall stand deferred until the conclusion of the discussion of a matter of public importance.
         </dd>
        </dl>
       </p>
       <p>
        Speaking briefly to that, I do this as a courtesy to the House so that all members can be informed. I inform the House that tomorrow at 12 noon debate will recommence on the Tax Laws Amendment (Temporary Flood Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011 and the Income Tax Rates Amendment (Temporary Flood Reconstruction Levy) Bill 2011. This is important legislation which is a priority for this government and a priority particularly for those Queenslanders who need Queensland to be rebuilt, along with those who have been affected by the other natural disasters over the summer. In order to increase the time of the sitting, whilst minimising the extra sitting late at night, this is an appropriate measure.
       </p>
       <p>
        I can inform the House that, in order to make up for the cancellation of the adjournment debate tomorrow night in this chamber—debate will continue on the flood reconstruction levy legislation until 10.30 pm and there will then be no adjournment debate, so the House will finish at its ordinary sitting time—there will be a one-hour adjournment in the Main Committee, which will balance up that change. This has been agreed to by the Manager of Opposition Business, and I thank him for his cooperation on this matter. There is a need for the government to have this legislation passed this week. We will endeavour to not have the parliament sit late on Wednesday night in order to pass this legislation, but we will do what is necessary to ensure that that can indeed be carried, because this is legislation which is vital for the interests of Queensland in particular and, I think, the interests of Australians who want to see us getting on with the job of reconstruction.
       </p>
       <p>
        Question agreed to.
