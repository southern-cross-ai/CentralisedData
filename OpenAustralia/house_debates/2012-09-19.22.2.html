         Defence Housing Australia

        proposes upgrades of on-base housing for Defence at Larrakeyah Barracks, Darwin, Northern Territory. The project will upgrade 48 older houses located in the residential housing precinct on Larrakeyah Barracks, Darwin, to bring them up to the 2006 Defence minimum standard. These houses are from a portfolio of nearly 1,700 dwellings managed by Defence Housing Australia in Darwin to meet the housing needs of Defence members and their families posted to the Darwin area. The proposed upgrade project does not increase dwelling numbers on Larrakeyah Barracks. As the project involves upgrading existing housing, disruption to the local community will be minimised.
       </p>
       <p>
        Defence and Defence Housing Australia have evaluated options and jointly agreed that the upgrade of 48 dwellings on Larrakeyah Barracks is economically viable and represents good value for money. The houses are suitable for upgrading and will provide a well-located housing precinct that will serve Defence families for the next 20 to 30 years. The estimated overall project cost is approximately $25 million, including

        , contingency and escalation costs but excluding the cost of the land. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction will commence in February 2013 and be completed by April 2015.

        Defence Housing Australia proposes to undertake an upgrade of housing for Defence at

         RAAF Base Tindal
        </a>
        , Northern Territory. The project will upgrade a further 131 on-base houses to bring them up to the 2006 Defence minimum standard. The range of work on each house varies but may include new kitchens, new bathrooms, living room extensions, new bedrooms and double garages. Once upgraded, the total of 193 houses will greatly improve the amenity of Defence families living in this remote area. The upgraded on-base dwellings will offer a standard of amenity likely to attract and retain Defence members and their families in this remote area.
       </p>
       <p>
        The work will be completed in two stages, the first upgrading 68 houses, the second upgrading 63 houses. The estimated overall project cost is approximately $57 million, including GST, contingency and escalation costs but excluding the land cost. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction will commence in April 2013 and be completed by December 2015.
