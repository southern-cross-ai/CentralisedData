       <p>
        Eleven years ago today was my very first day in parliament and my proudest day as a politician. The apology to the stolen generations delivered by Prime Minister Kevin Rudd was a seminal moment for this nation, where the truth of this nation's history was formally acknowledged in this house of the people. It was an important step towards reconciliation, and I acknowledge the member for Jagajaga who had so much to do with that day.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today, I again acknowledge those people who were forcibly removed from their families, from their culture, from their community and from their country. The annual
        <i>
         Closing the gap
        </i>
        report tells us that there is still much to do and that's why Labor has committed $10 million to assist with the healing programs and will hold a summit on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">

        children so that all kids have the opportunity to have a happy, healthy childhood. A Shorten government is committed to closing the gap and building a reconciled Australia. There is much work to do.
       </p>
       <p>
        Eleven years ago, I saw some appalling behaviour in this chamber. There was some disgraceful behaviour from former Speaker Bronwyn Bishop and also from a couple of other members, who actually boycotted the apology. Most of them are gone. There is one person, however, who is still hereâ€”the member for Dickson, who has actually never properly explained why he did not attend the apology. He was the only frontbencher in Brendan Nelson's opposition to boycott that historic apology to the stolen generation.
