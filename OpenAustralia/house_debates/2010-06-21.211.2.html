        On 17 June 2010, I visited Goollelal Primary School, a very good local school in the suburb of Kingsley in the Cowan electorate. While I was there I had a brief conversation with the principal,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Clarke" rel="nofollow">
         Greg Clarke
        </a>
        , and the deputy principal, Kerry Hartmann. As I was leaving, I was approached by some of the students and I had a very good and quite significant conversation with three of the young ladies from the school. I would like to congratulate
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauren_King" rel="nofollow">
         Lauren King

        , who is in year 7. She is a bit of a soccer player and, hopefully, a future Matilda. Lauren is off to

        next year. I spoke to Sariah Richard, a year 6 student and again, hopefully, a future Matilda soccer player. Sariah is off to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Mark" rel="nofollow">

        ’s next year. I also spoke to Shan Williams, who is in year 6. Shan has already distinguished herself at school as a pianist and a singer of note. Shan is off to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Stephen" rel="nofollow">
         St Stephen
        </a>
        ’s next year. This was a good opportunity to meet with some very nice and impressive young people at Goollelal Primary School. They are certainly a credit to their school and to their parents. I have also had previous contact with Christopher Greed, a prefect at the school. Together, I think they are great examples of the excellent young people at Goollelal Primary School.
