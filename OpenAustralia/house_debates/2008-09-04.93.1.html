        A few weeks ago, on a large vacant block in an industrial estate in my electorate, I had the great pleasure of meeting Mr Kevin Kennedy, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Manager" rel="nofollow">
         General Manager
        </a>
        of Gippsland Group Training-Apprentices Victoria, who, I am sure, is well known to the member for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMillan" rel="nofollow">
         McMillan
        </a>
        , and a number of his senior managers.

        are one of Australia’s largest and most experienced group training organisations. They have been employing, training and supporting young people in apprenticeships, especially in the traditional trades, for more than 25 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        In July I received the news that they had been successful in receiving $2 million in funding under the National Training Infrastructure Program towards establishing a new multitrade industry centre in Derrimut, in my electorate of Gorton. The industry centre is scheduled to open in 2010 and will cater for 720 apprentices in automotive, electrical, plumbing and building construction trades, with 450 of these apprentices being directly employed and placed by GGT-AV, a very good learning institution, as the member for McMillan would know. That is why I went to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Kennedy" rel="nofollow">

        : to congratulate him and his team, and to inspect the site at first hand.
       </p>
       <p>
        I cannot overstate the significance of this announcement to my electorate and to neighbouring electorates in Melbourne’s west. Melbourne’s western suburbs suffer higher than average rates of youth unemployment. At the same time industry is crying out for skilled labour. At the moment many of the young people in my electorate who take up apprenticeships must travel up to two hours, each way, to the other side of town if they wish to participate in this particular type of training. The new industry skills centre will provide opportunities for young people in my electorate and will help local industry by providing a skilled local workforce. The Rudd government is committed to improving the skills of Australians. This contribution of $2 million to invest in the infrastructure of training is part of that commitment. I am very much looking forward to being at the opening of this magnificent learning centre.
