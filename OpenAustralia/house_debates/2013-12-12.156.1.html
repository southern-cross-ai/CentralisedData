        I am delighted to inform the House that at the 2013

        held in September, the Josef Chromy 2011 chardonnay was judged the world's best chardonnay. Northern Tasmania is now at the very top of the world chardonnay rankings, with the judges choosing the Chromy chardonnay over other fine wines from the United Kingdom, France,

        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        . The award is an enormous tribute to Josef Chromy
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        , who is the founder and principal of Josef Chromy Wines, and his chief winemaker, Jeremy Dineen.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jo Chromy is a remarkable Australian who fled Czechoslovakia in 1950 for a new life in Australia. He has not only prospered but has had, at last count, three very successful careers. Jo was a master butcher and established Blue Ribbon Meat Products, which he built into a quality small-goods manufacturer in northern Tasmania. When Blue Ribbon floated on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASX" rel="nofollow">
         ASX
        </a>
        in 1993, Jo used the proceeds to invest in winemaking. In 2007, aged 76, he launched Josef Chromy wines, and this trophy is one indication of his extraordinary Midas touch. His third career is in parallel. He has been at the forefront of urban renewal, transforming the old
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launceston_General_Hospital" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        via a creative development that created significant employment in the city and with a new tourism venture recently announced.
       </p>
       <p>
        I pay tribute to Jo Chromy not only for his success as a Tasmanian winemaker but also for the wonderful example he provides of migrant contributions to our Australian identity, economy and culture. Jo Chromy was also involved in the establishment of Jansz Winery at Pipers Brook. This part of north-east Tasmania has established a strong reputation over the last 40 years or so for fine wines. Vineyards such as Delamere, Dalrymple, Sinapius and Pipers Brook are well known and their wines have won many awards. There are other successful wineries closer to Launceston, such as Brook Eden at Lebrina and Goaty Hill Winery at Kayena.
       </p>
       <p>
        The only surprising thing about the success of northern Tasmanian wines is that the industry was not established earlier, given that the latitude of around 41 degrees south directly mirrors the latitude of some of the centuries- old vineyards in southern France and northern Portugal. Both climates are similarly temperate. But you cannot have wine without cheese, and Bass is well served in that department as well. Pyengana Dairy has been operating for more than 100 years and produces wonderful aromatic cheeses. A more newly established cheesery is Yondover Farm House Cheeses, which concentrates on a range of cheeses made from goats milk. I commend both to all honourable members. The cheeses they produce are as good as any you would get in Europe.
       </p>
       <p>
        My electorate is also fortunate to have one of the most picturesque farms anywhere in Australia. I speak here of Bridestowe Lavender Estate, which has been producing lavender since 1922 at Nabowla and which is a huge tourist draw card with rolling purple hills at this time of the year. Not only is lavender itself produced for harvesting but also a range of by-products, including lavender oil and the lavender scones—and lavender ice cream are to die for. Another successful niche industry in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamar_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Tamar Valley
        </a>
        is berry production. The Hillwood Berry Farm produces not only strawberries of the highest quality but also loganberries, raspberries and black and red currants and quince. Not only can you pick your own berries but the farm produces jams, currant liqueurs and fruit vinegars.
       </p>
       <p>
        I cannot finish this contribution about just a small number of the fine gourmet produce of the electorate I am privileged to represent in this House without a reference to Gourlay's. Gourlay's was established in 1896 in Launceston by William Gourlay and has produced its own sweets for more than 100 years—by the Gourlay family until 1970 and since then by the Woods family. I was delighted, as part of the shop's small promotion championed by the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_Business" rel="nofollow">
         Small Business
        </a>
        , to stand behind the counter in their wonderful shop only two weeks ago as part of encouraging Australians to support small business in their communities. The only danger for me in undertaking this task is that for years our family has made a habit of buying Gourlay's sweets for Christmas gifts, so I had to be very disciplined not to succumb to the wide variety of traditional confectionary available.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is great to be able to remind this House of some of the fine produce in my electorate, but in doing so it is also important that we all remember the serious side. In our modern Australian economy there are changes and stresses, but one thing is constant—small business is the lifeblood of our economy. If we all keep that in mind and give our local shops and services our support, we will retain a diverse and prosperous economy and local jobs for local people.
