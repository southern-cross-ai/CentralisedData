        are eight great local councils who are all doing an outstanding job of representing those who live and work in the region. It used to be said that the role of local government was roads, rates and rubbish. However, this is no longer the case. Over decades, councils' responsibility has expanded significantly. Local governments are the cornerstone of our regional communities and they are there to make sure that things function as they should on a day-to-day basis. Modern councils provide the range of services and facilities that our communities expect and deserve—roads, rates and rubbish, absolutely—but they're also there to plan and for building control, business and economic development, environmental management, and human and community services. Councils are the catalyst for building an area's local identity. They are at the forefront of building social cohesion, and the list goes on.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have great faith in our region's local councils. I have great faith in the mayors and the elected representatives who represent their constituencies and fight hard for their communities. I have faith in the general managers and the administration staff, who work tirelessly every day to deliver services to their communities. That is why I welcome the budget announcement that the Morrison government will provide an additional $1 billion for local governments through their Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program. This investment builds on the $500 million previously announced in May this year. This funding is a vote of confidence for our local governments' capacity to deliver projects. It will facilitate grassroots, community led recoveries right across the region. The funding will empower local governments in our region to deliver the roads and community infrastructure projects that are on their wish lists. These programs will progress shovel-ready local priorities, support local jobs, and support local businesses, and that's a great thing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Braddon's eight councils have been fantastic. They've been a fantastic support to me since my election and they have been instrumental in supporting the rollout of many of the Morrison government's key investments in the region. Right across the north-west, the west coast and King Island, projects of significance are progressing, and it could not have happened at a better time.

       </p>
       <p>
        Thanks to everybody who works in councils and the services that you do every day. I encourage anyone who sees their local mayor, councillor or council administration staff to make sure you say thanks for their great work.
