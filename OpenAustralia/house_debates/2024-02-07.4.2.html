        report, I acknowledge that an unacceptably high rate of people, particularly women, in Commonwealth parliamentary workplaces have experienced bullying, sexual harassment or actual or attempted sexual assault whilst at work. This misconduct is unacceptable, and I acknowledge the grave impact it has or continues to have on previous and current staff. For two years, the Parliamentary Leadership Taskforce has led the implementation of the set the standard reforms. The parliament thanks the taskforce for their continuous work and leadership.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today we recommit the parliament to positive change and acknowledge achievements to date, including: the establishment of the Parliamentary Workplace Support Service as a statutory body, offering independent and confidential support to everyone in Commonwealth parliamentary workplaces; reforms to modernise the members of parliament act to ensure employees are protected from discrimination, as well as refreshed professional development and improved management practices; the undertaking of reviews to further enhance inclusivity and dignity through access to Commonwealth parliamentary workplaces; the endorsement of clear and consistent codes of conduct, with consultations on the proposed Independent Parliamentary Standards Commission, expected to commence shortly; the support of the health and wellbeing of parliamentarians and staff, with enhanced wellbeing services; the improvement of work health and safety with a new framework to manage shared risks; and additional professional development opportunities to support leaders at all levels, particularly induction programs and training on safe and respectful workplaces.
       </p>
       <p>
        While significant progress has been made, the journey towards truly respectful and inclusive parliamentary workplaces is ongoing. Cultural change will only come with the goodwill of parliamentarians, and we must remain committed to building a workplace reflecting the nation's values and expectations, ensuring the safety and wellbeing of everyone who works in and supports the

        <p>
         Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, for your important words today and for the commitment that you show to this work every single day. Two years ago, this parliament acknowledged a hard truth: too many people who worked in this building, particularly women, were not being treated with respect and did not feel safe. It was not just a matter of individual behaviour; it was also a question of institutional culture. We made a commitment—all of us—to change that, and to change it for the better. We vowed to a set a higher, safer and more respectful standard. These regular updates to both chambers are designed to keep our efforts on track, to make sure we are accountable for our progress. There were 28 recommendations adopted by the former government with our bipartisan support. Thirteen of those recommendations have been fully implemented, and work is underway on the remainder.
        </p>
        <p>
         On 1 October last year we established the statutory Parliamentary Workplace Support Service. This is an independent agency that provides human resources support to parliamentarians and staff. It's the first time a statutory body like this has existed. The government has also delivered legislation to implement recommendations from a review of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Members_of_Parliament" rel="nofollow">
          Members of Parliament
         </a>
         (Staff) Act 1984. That reform modernised the employment framework for parliamentarians and their staff. A key priority for all of us in the year ahead is the establishment of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Commission. Our goal is to work across the parliament to have that organisation up and running by 1 October this year. We saw last year, in the passing of the parliamentary workplace support bills, the valuable role of the Parliamentary Leadership Taskforce and all the members and senators who serve on it. I thank all of them for the commitment and the constructive approach they've brought to their role, and I look forward to their cooperation in delivering this next set of reforms.
        </p>
        <p>
         Throughout my time in this place, I have always had a deep respect and a genuine affection for this parliament and its traditions. That's why I want to see the culture here continue to change and improve—for the sake of this place and for the sake of the country all of us are here to serve. The more that parliament looks like modern Australia, the better. It's better for the culture and better for our democracy. This is a very special place to work for all of us. It's a great honour to be able to sit in this chamber or in the other place. Everyone here—the attendants, the clerks, the tabling officers, the cleaners, the security guards—are making a contribution to the nation. The parliament is a unique workplace, of course, but it must be a safe workplace. The culture here will never be normal or typical, but it can and must be respectful. That's a task for all of us. Setting the standard matters, and so does upholding it. Let us dedicate ourselves to that in the parliamentary year ahead. I thank the House.

         <p>
          Thank you very much, Mr Speaker, for tabling the second annual report of the Parliamentary Leadership Taskforce. It's an important occasion to reflect on how we've reached this point. In March 2021 the former coalition government, with the support of the then Labor opposition and the crossbenchers, established an independent review into Commonwealth parliamentary workplaces. The review was led by Kate Jenkins, the former
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sex_Discrimination_Commissioner" rel="nofollow">
           Sex Discrimination Commissioner
          </a>
          . Ms Jenkins's report, entitled
          <i>
           Set the
          </i>
          <i>
           s
          </i>
          <i>
           tandard
          </i>
          , was published in November 2021 and contained 28 recommendations. One of these recommendations called for the formation of the Parliamentary Leadership Taskforce, comprised of parliamentarians across the political spectrum and an independent chair. The taskforce first met in February 2022, and in the same month the presiding officers delivered a joint statement of acknowledgement on behalf of the taskforce. That statement recognised the unacceptable history of workplace bullying, sexual harassment and sexual assault in Commonwealth parliamentary workplaces. The statement was also a pledge that all members of parliament would commit, both personally and collectively, to bring about necessary change: through our words and our deeds, we would set a standard to be emulated in workplaces across the nation.
         </p>
         <p>
          Whether we are an elected parliamentarian, a political adviser or a public servant, we all serve the public, and our service is a privilege. The Australian public's confidence and trust in this parliament and in the bureaucracy are directly connected to the conduct of all of those who have the privilege to serve their fellow Australians. Australians demand and expect of us higher standards, and we should offer nothing less in return. The Parliamentary Leadership Taskforce's annual report provides an update on the implementation of the recommendations of the
          <i>

          </i>
          <i>
           standard
          </i>
          report. I commend Dr Vivienne Thom for her work as the taskforce's independent chair, and I also acknowledge the previous chair, Dr Kerri Hartland. I'd also like to thank the members of the taskforce: the members for Farrer, Newcastle and Warringah, and senators Perin Davey, Jane Hume,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Farrell" rel="nofollow">

          </a>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          Good progress has been made since the last annual report. The number of recommendations fully implemented has increased from six to 13. The first six recommendations are partially implemented, eight are in progress and one is pending. Out of the seven recommendations which have been fully implemented since the last annual report—that is, Nos 8, 10, 11, 14, 15, 16 and 25—we have seen initiatives to promote respect and inclusion within political parties and parliamentary departments, the employment of new management practices and training materials to support performance, as well as new guidance provided for employee termination, and new health and safety obligations implemented. The coalition is proud of the large body of work which was completed when we were in government, in particular the establishment of an independent and confidential complaints mechanism and 24-hour support services for current and former parliamentarians and staff.
         </p>
         <p>
          Noting, however, that there are several recommendations in progress, I welcome the extension of the Parliamentary Leadership Taskforce's term until 1 October this year. The coalition believes that recommendation 22, the establishment of an independent parliamentary standards commission, must be given priority, given its responsibility for enforcing the behaviour standards and codes.
         </p>
         <p>
          But, today, on the tabling of this annual report, and on behalf of the coalition, I thank all of those who have contributed to the insights, work and initiatives which have come from the Jenkins review and the Parliamentary Leadership Taskforce. This has been critically important work over several years and there is more to do, but I'm confident that we will see the positive effects of this work in the decades ahead. We must ensure that we don't just set the standard but continue in our personal and collective efforts to maintain and elevate the standard.

           On behalf of the Nationals, I thank the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition for their statements. Seizing this opportunity to build a more respectful, more equal and more safe professional culture inside
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
            Parliament House

           , and across all parliamentary workplaces, is a priority that unites us all. Every Australian should belong in a workplace where they feel protected, where they feel supported, and where their contributions are valued.
          </p>
          <p>
           With the tabling of the second annual report by the Parliamentary Leadership Taskforce, I want to reaffirm to all members of this chamber the Nationals' ongoing commitment to work with a constructive, meaningful and bipartisan spirit to help address the challenges that were laid out by former

           report. In fact, the title of this report demonstrates its importance, because having this opportunity to serve and work in Parliament House, to actually make a positive contribution to the communities that we are elected to represent and to set the direction of our nation, is an immense honour. It's a workplace which is the heart of Australia's democracy where we should be setting the standard of how we interact and treat one another. This should be a building where promoting equality, welcoming diversity and encouraging mutual respect is absolutely paramount, which is why Kate Jenkins's review was so confronting.
          </p>
          <p>
           Over a period of seven months in 2021, the commissioner and her team interviewed 490 people, received 302 written submissions and heard from more than 1,700 women and men. The report covered and identified reports of sexual assault and harassment, challenges around gender inequality and diversity, and issues around mental health. It highlighted that, as political leaders, we needed to do better, to lead the way and to help secure real and positive change in this workplace.
          </p>
          <p>
           In total, 28 recommendations from the

           report were put forward, and these have led to the creation of a 24-hour support service for staff, training and education programs, and leadership initiatives. Recommendation 2 was establishing the Parliamentary Leadership Taskforce, led by an independent chair and consisting of broad parliamentary membership. This taskforce has made a real difference in addressing the review's recommendations and, as it hands down its second annual report, I want to acknowledge the taskforce for its successful advocacy and ongoing efforts to make this parliament a better place to work.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Nationals" rel="nofollow">
            The Nationals
           </a>
           take these matters extremely seriously, and our party is grateful to have a strong voice in the taskforce, through my deputy leader, Senator Perin Davey, who has made a tremendous contribution.
          </p>
          <p>
           Efforts to empower and support gender equality and to strengthen diversity were the heart of the Jenkins review, and it's on that note that I'm pleased to share with the House some of the achievements that the National Party has achieved when it comes to these priorities. We are firmly committed to fostering a bright political atmosphere that encourages more women to participate in our movement across every level, and I'm thrilled to say that we are making progress. Right now in our federal parliamentary team I'm proud to recognise that four of our seven Nationals shadow cabinet ministers are women. Importantly, Senator Perin Davey and Senator Bridget McKenzie continue to drive our party forward as members of the federal leadership team. In the other chamber, four of our six senators are women. Today the federal management committee of the Nationals has seven women in the 16 voting positions, which include the positions of federal president, treasurer and secretary. Also, since last year's task force report was handed down, I can advise that nearly 60 per cent of our party's international professional development opportunities have been completed by women. All of these are strong benchmarks that will set our party up for the future.
          </p>
          <p>
           As the dedicated voice of the nine million Australians who live in regional, rural and remote Australia, the Nationals are determined to do everything we can to ensure that our parliamentary and grassroots memberships effectually encapsulate the social and geographical diversity of our nation. With backgrounds spanning from agriculture to manufacturing, from journalism to small business, from education to accountancy and from law enforcement to health, I'm proud of the different perspectives and experiences that our federal parliamentary team bring to the parliament, but of course there's still more to do. Our federal management committee is continuing to work in partnership with the state divisions to develop a more systemic and comprehensive approach to candidate identification and development. One of the key goals and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KPI" rel="nofollow">
            KPI
           </a>
           s underpinning this is to ensure that our party reflects the incredible diversity of the communities that the Nationals represent.
          </p>
          <p>
           I want to conclude my remarks by once again thanking the parliamentary leadership task force for their second annual report on the progress of the
           <i>
            Set the standard
           </i>
           recommendations. I acknowledge all of the members of the task force for their commitment, professionalism and hard work. It's important work that is already making a huge difference in promoting and securing genuine change—change that will make our parliamentary workplace more safe, more tolerant and more respectful.

            An independent trauma informed Parliamentary Workplace Support Service to support staff and MPs dealing with harassment and abuse has been established, and it's a huge step forward. I thank the government for their ongoing support of the PWSS, but without enforcement powers it's unable to solve the problems that it's been set up to tackle. According to recommendation 22 of the

            report, 'both of the houses of parliament should establish, within 12 months, an Independent Parliamentary Standards Commission' to enforce codes of conduct. It was expected in October 2023; it's now blown out to October 2024, and this is the second extension. Without this body, bad behaviour can continue to go unchecked. Without real prospects that an MP will be sanctioned, staff may continue to be reluctant to come forward, because consequences matter. We appreciate that the work to set up the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPSC" rel="nofollow">
             IPSC
            </a>
            is complex, but it's also very important, and it's been too slow. Members of parliament have significant powers to shape the lives of our communities, and, given that responsibility, we need a mechanism which holds them to account.

            recommended that the IPSC should have the power to operate a fair, independent, confidential and transparent system to receive disclosures as well as handle complaints about misconduct; to make findings about misconduct; to make recommendations on sanctions; and to apply sanctions for a breach of the code of conduct. Without genuine consequences, there's little to deter the bad behaviour that we see time and time again. We'll continue to push for real accountability and transparency so that the IPSC can effectively hold people to account.
           </p>
           <p>
            While the work to establish the IPSC is being undertaken, it's a responsibility of every MP to act consistently with the commitments they made when endorsing the codes and for all parties to act quickly in response to any complaints. We know that for

            people, people of colour and people with disability the harassment and disrespect experienced in this place or online when working in parliamentary roles is even worse. Sexism, racism, ableism and discrimination on the basis of sexuality, identity or preference persist and are even more damaging and dangerous when they intersect. Increasing diversity in this place is critical, but that cannot happen without measures to make this a safe workplace for a more diverse range of people. When female MPs are still being subject to sexist, intimidatory behaviour, you can only imagine how much worse it is for staff. Indeed, the

            report showed that more than half of those surveyed had experienced at least one incident of bullying, sexual harassment or actual or attempted sexual assault.

           <p>
            We have to be better: every single one of us, every single day. Staff, current and former, and affected survivors must be involved in these reforms in a meaningful way, and must feel supported to tell us when we're not doing enough. For those who have suffered and those who are still suffering, we intend to support you—to ensure that you are considered and your rights upheld. A robust, independent and confidential complaints process must be established, and it must be one which people can trust. It's time for parliament to set the standard.

             I would like to thank the chair, Vivienne Thom, and members of the taskforce for the work that we have been undertaking. The annual statement into the progress towards the implementation of

             is important, because I think it's too often in this place that we might lose track of that progress. We also need to be reminded of the need and urgency in implementing all of those recommendations of the
             <i>
              Set the standard
             </i>
             report.
            </p>
            <p>
             As I said last year in speaking to the annual statement, it's an important milestone and one that we cannot be complacent about. Progress is being made, as others have mentioned, but we are behind in key areas. Of the 28 recommendations, 13 have now been implemented, six have been partially implemented, eight are in progress and one is pending. We need to make greater progress in diversity, equality and inclusion among those elected as parliamentarians and
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOP" rel="nofollow">
              MOP
             </a>
             (S) Act employees. Our measurement and public reporting also need further work. Research consistently shows that greater diversity in the workplace means increased productivity, creativity and innovation, alongside enhanced problem-solving skills. We work at the heart of Australian democracy and it's essential that our workforce represents the diverse country we serve as parliamentarians.
            </p>
            <p>
             Professionalising management practice and professional development for MOP(S) Act employees continues to be implemented, and is welcome. It's essential that those employed under the (MOP)S Act are managed appropriately by MPs, senators and their officers, and have access to proper professional development programs to ensure that they can upskill and develop their craft, whether it be chief of staff, policy advisers, in electorate offices and the many, many others. All of these roles are vital in supporting parliamentarians to do their jobs.
            </p>
            <p>
             Separately, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Commission remains a work in progress and will be established this calendar year, I hope, with the goodwill of the taskforce. It's incredibly important because, as has been mentioned, that independent complaints mechanism and the enforcement of consequences really are important steps. The commission will be charged with enforcing the behaviour standards and the codes of conduct that all here have agreed to comply with, and it will complement the Parliamentary Workplace Support Service, which is responsible to support our safe and respectful Commonwealth parliamentary workplaces. I would like to thank the hardworking staff within the PWSS for the work they're doing in assisting (MOP)S Act employees. But I do note they are still quite frequently understaffed; there is a small team to deal with a lot of parliamentarians and a lot of staff, so ensuring there are proper ratios and proper staff capability is an important part of it.
            </p>
            <p>
             Finally, we can't talk about implementing the
             <i>
              Set the
             </i>
             <i>
              standard
             </i>
             report and complying with it without noticing and pointing out that fundamental change to make this a more respectful, safe and inclusive work environment requires leadership from the top, from our most visible leaders on both sides and from all of us as members of parliament. It's especially true in how we conduct ourselves as parliamentarians and, in particular, how we conduct ourselves in this place. One of the most visible times for this place is during question time, and I don't think a single member in this place would not be contacted by members of their communities who are quite horrified at the conduct that occurs here. Too often political pointscoring or seeking political advantage takes precedence over respectful conduct. That is important in the context of
             <i>
              Set the
             </i>
             <i>
              standard
             </i>
             , because our staff and employees take note and take the lead from us—from leaders in this place. If we indicate that aggressive conduct or bullying conduct is acceptable, that is taken to be acceptable by staff and that goes on down the chain. People in positions of power can end up in situations where conduct can be unacceptable.
            </p>
            <p>
             I often hear from constituents and other Australians who are disappointed and ashamed by some of the conduct of this place. I think if we are going to improve the standard for our staff, it must start with us. A good example, I would say, ironically, is the schedule we have for today: the government has extended the sitting till 10 pm. This is to honour that this is a place of debate, which is a good thing. But be mindful of what this means for staff, who may well have come into this place at six or seven this morning: that's a 15- to 16-hour day if they're staying here till 10 pm. Every decision in terms of the sitting of this place has an impact on staff, so if we're going to talk about setting standards and a more respectful workplace it must be in this way as well.
            </p>
            <p>
             I commend my fellow members of the parliamentary taskforce. I know we have more work to do, and I thank them. We are behind schedule, but we will get there. I thank the members in this place for staying committed to implementing the recommendations in full.
