       <p>
        I am deeply saddened by the passing of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Baker" rel="nofollow">
         Chris Baker
        </a>
        , a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Ward" rel="nofollow">
         North Ward
        </a>
        councillor of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Wanneroo" rel="nofollow">
         City of Wanneroo
        </a>
        in the federal seat of Pearce. Chris had a profound commitment to community welfare and sustainable development. He championed projects aimed at enhancing local infrastructure, promoting green space and encouraging civic engagement. His unwavering dedication and tireless efforts in his role as an elected member have left an indelible mark on the community he served.
       </p>
       <p>
        Chris was committed to improving the lives of the community, and his legacy will continue to inspire generations to come. He approached his responsibilities with a fierce determination, never hesitating to stand up for what he believed in. His tenacity in addressing critical issues was a testament to his strong sense of duty. This was recently very evident when he cut short his family holiday so he could attend a special meeting of council last week to speak passionately in support of the Quinns Mindarie Surf Life Saving Club and the surrounding residents fighting to preserve the beach foreshore for future generations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether he was advocating for better infrastructure, promoting local initiatives or championing the voice of the community, Chris's impact was profound and lasting. He represented his community as a Joondalup
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLA" rel="nofollow">
         MLA
        </a>
        from 1996 to 2001, a Joondalup councillor from 2001 to 2004 and a City of Wanneroo councillor from 2019 to 2023. Chris was a devoted husband, father and grandfather, and I extend my heartfelt sympathies to his wife, Sarah, his children and his grandchildren.
