       <p>
        Last week I visited many small businesses in Taree and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Macquarie" rel="nofollow">
         Port Macquarie
        </a>
        to talk about our recently released 2015 budget and the jobs, small business and family packages. These changes were very happily received. I had the opportunity of visiting Fineline Motorcycles in Taree. Not only did I visit a humming little business but I got to meet Alex Cudlin, five-times world endurance champion, brother of Damian, also another world endurance bike riding champion, and his parents, Shane and Annette who, like many people in the Manning, moved up from Sydney many years agoâ€”they turned in their police motorbike job and started their own small business. They put their heart and soul into it, and they and their customers will benefit from the accelerated depreciation arrangements for small business.
       </p>
       <p>
        Also, Danny and Allison Lambert at D&amp;A Benchtops in Wauchope have put their heart and soul and their family's mortgage into their benchtop business, and now, having started from scratch 11 years ago, they have 11 people working for them. They have done very well. I also got to meet Will J Frost, who saw a niche position in the market to supply small parts for the trailers of Australia. Now he has a large infantry up there in Taree, and if you need any trailer parts for your trailer, Menn-in Trailers is the place to get them from. Congratulations to all those people. They are going to benefit from our small business package.
