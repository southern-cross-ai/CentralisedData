        A number of local sporting projects in my electorate are worthy of funding support in the upcoming federal budget. A federal contribution towards constructing a patio and kitchen extension at

        Triathlon, Joondalup Netball Association, Joondalup Lakers Hockey Club and other community groups. I am pleased to work closely with representatives of the local clubs, including Liam Smyth, Garth Davis, Phil Bossert, Cameron Britt and Kylie Kershaw in securing funding to improve these sporting facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is precedent for federal funding of surf clubs, with many surf clubs in the eastern states receiving federal grants. The clubhouse extensions at Sorrento Surf Lifesaving Club are worthy of funding. The club celebrated its 60th anniversary last year. In order to meet the needs of a current and forecasted membership base a redevelopment concept plan has been proposed by the committee to increase the floor area of the clubhouse to just over 2,100 square metres.
       </p>
       <p>
        A federal grant of $500,000 would enable the construction of a fitness hub and staircase at Whitfords Nodes Park, providing panoramic views from a lookout platform at the top of the dunes, which can be climbed for exercise. Federal sports minister Senator Bridget McKenzie visited the Moore electorate in December last year, and I am advocating very strongly for this landmark local project.
       </p>

        I recently provided a letter of support for $500,000 of federal funding to the

        reserve in Padbury. This will enable more female participation in sport, particularly with the growing participation of women in Australia football.
       </p>
       <p>
        A federal contribution towards the construction of a sheltered bowling green at Sorrento Bowling Club, at Percy Doyle reserve in Duncraig, will permit play in all weather conditions.
       </p>
       <p>
        These are just some of the local sporting projects that I am strongly advocating for in my electorate.
