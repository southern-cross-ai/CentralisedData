        One of the inspiring parts of our jobs as members of parliament is the opportunity to work with individuals and organisations in our electorates who are helping others in need, be it the thousands of people who volunteer their time or the dedicated professionals working in the community sector. For many years I served on the board of the Crows Nest Community Centre and I saw their incredible work firsthand. I also know that my part of Sydney has been something of a trailblazer in the development of great community initiatives. For example, the early development of the Men's Shed movement occurred in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lane_Cove" rel="nofollow">

        . More recently, the Waverton Hub has provided a new model for engaging communities in a way that is attracting attention across the country.

        Back in 1961, what is now called Lane Cove and Northside Community Services was a pioneer in the development of volunteer based organisations serving the welfare of local communities. Today the Lane Cove and Northside Community Services provides vital support for those living on the lower Northshore, particularly the elderly and those with a disability. Recently I had the opportunity to participate in the opening of the service's new premises in Lane Cove. I was delighted that we were able to secure a federal grant to assist the move. The new premises will allow the service to better meet the needs of the local community, and I congratulate all those involved in bringing these new facilities to fruition. More importantly, I want to record in this parliament the gratitude of so many in our community for the dedication of its staff and volunteers, led by the chair of the board,

        , and its general manager, Gillian Batt. Our community is stronger for all they do.
