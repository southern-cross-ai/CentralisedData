        Mr Speaker, on indulgence: I wish to make some brief comments about the retirement, announced today, of Mr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Taylor" rel="nofollow">
         Mike Taylor
        </a>

        . For more than nine years, Mike Taylor has served the Australian government and, through it, the Australian community with professionalism and passion. To his great credit, Mike Taylor embodies the finest traditions of the Public Service. He has faithfully served the minister and the government of the day. He served the Howard government well and he has served the Rudd government well.
       </p>
       <p>
        During my tenure as minister, Mike Taylor has been integral in overseeing the establishment of the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, the establishment of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Infrastructure Australia

        . He has also ensured the smooth rollout of our nation-building program and the development of Australia’s first ever long-term plan for aviation. I wish Mike well in his new career and I am certain that I speak on behalf of all members of the House in suggesting that there is no doubt that he will continue to make an outstanding contribution to our nation. As political representatives, we must always remember that we rely upon the Public Service to deliver the programs for which governments are elected to a majority position in this chamber. Mike Taylor represents the finest traditions of the

         Madam Deputy Speaker, on indulgence, can I join the Leader of the House in paying tribute to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Taylor" rel="nofollow">
          Mike Taylor
         </a>
         on the announcement of his retirement. I thank the minister for making reference to Mr Taylor’s long service. Mr Taylor was actually secretary of my department for most of the time I was a minister. He came in initially as secretary to the department of agriculture. He moved to the department of transport and, about six months after that, I became the minister for transport. So we became very good friends. We are only a few days apart in age—which I perhaps should not confess to on this occasion!—and we travelled quite a bit around the world together. He is an extraordinary person to travel with. He is hyperactive in every sense and there are always things happening when Mike is around.
        </p>
        <p>
         I thought that his appointment added a great deal to the Commonwealth Public Service. He came from the Victorian Public Service, so he had a good background in administration of government departments. He had been working in rural industry organisations in Victoria before he went into the Public Service in Victoria, so he had a good background there too. As a Commonwealth public servant, he had the trust of the states, which was very important in many of the negotiations that were underway at the time. I was pleased when the new federal government offered him another term, which he accepted, although that term is now only going to be quite a short one.
        </p>
        <p>
         Mike Taylor commuted from Melbourne for most of his time in the position, and that was an extra burden. He is a good friend. He has made a very worthwhile contribution to the Public Service in Canberra. His public life has been recognised with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Service_Medal" rel="nofollow">
          Public Service Medal
         </a>
         and quite a number of other honours. I think that the whole House and indeed the processes of government, both at the Com-monwealth level and in Victoria, are indebted to him for his contribution.
        </p>
        <p>
         My very best wishes go to Mike and his wife, Eve, and his family on his retirement. I am sure that Mike will not stand still—he is not the sort of guy who is capable of standing still—and that he will continue to make a significant contribution to public policy in the years ahead. We wish him good health and every happiness for whatever the future may hold.

           Madam Deputy Speaker, on indulgence, just very briefly—because I am conscious of the hour—could I just support the comments made so far. Mike has been a friend of mine for over 30 years. I worked with him as an agricultural economist in the Victorian departure of agriculture. From day one, he was obviously going to be a leader in the Public Service. He is an outstanding Australian. He is actually a constituent of mine now, which makes this even more special. He is a great personal friend. Throughout his career he has made an enormous contribution to Australia and Australian public service. I congratulate him on that and wish him all the best.
