        I would like to acknowledge the wonderful life of Norma Wooldridge, from Lismore, who, sadly, passed away recently. Norma was a well-known Lismore caterer and volunteer for many community organisations. Indeed, my mother-in-law, Patricia Webber, along with many others, worked for Norma for a time. Notably, Norma was acknowledged as a North Coast National show society life member after catering there for over 40 years. The main dining hall at the showground is called Norma's Kitchen, after Norma. I extend my thoughts and prayers to her husband of 68 years, Max, and to her children and their families, Desley and Darryl, Sheryl and Graeme, Neale and Leanne, Peter and Trish, and Glenn and Donna. Norma also had 16 grandchildren and 20 great-grandchildren. May she rest in peace.

        I would like to recognise the recent success of people in my community who competed at the recent Australian Surf Life Saving Championships on the

        , from Woolgoolga Surf Life Saving who came first in the 120-years female surf boatâ€”that means the total age group had to be over 120 years. Belinda Schofield from Woolgoolga competed in the 50 to 54s beach flags, where she placed first in her heat and ninth in grand final, and the Woolgoolga Long Strokers placed sixth in 220-years male surf boat. The team was made up of Wayne Bailey, John Portsmouth, Ian Thorncroft, Denis Crossley and Tim White. And young Damon-Leigh Striegher from Woolgoolga competed in the under-17s male beach sprint and placed fourth in his heat. Peter Rheinberger from Yamba competed in the 55- to 59-years male surf race and placed first in his heat and ninth in the grand final. And Kalani Ives from Yamba competed in a range of events and made it to the grand final of the under-17s female iron person event, where she placed 12th. Congratulations to you all. You did us all proud.

        I'd like to acknowledge the young woman in our community who recently competed in the under-18s Hockey State Championships. The final ended up being a rival between local neighbouring hockey associations, with
