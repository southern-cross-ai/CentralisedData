        As we look to the future, Australians can have a great deal of hope and optimism. As we face the challenge of caring for our country and the globe, the track record of this government and members on this side of the House speaks for itself. From early pioneers who prepared fields with a wooden plough and a horse to farmers using modern digitally controlled harvesters, adaptation, hard work and a belief in ourselves have been our foundation. Our approach to emissions reductions must be pragmatic but based on science. The decisions we make now will affect our ability to put food on the table and whether we can afford the electricity to run a small business. The need for prudence is evidence. The need for a considered approach is obvious. Farmers in my electorate of Mallee are still feeling the bite of Kyoto. This drives me to ensure that we as the government make decisions that are right for now and for our future, but specifically do not risk the livelihoods of regional Australians. Australia has an incredible track record. We are already meeting and beating our current Paris commitments and are a leader in the world precisely because this government considered what the cost would be and how it would impact mums and dads, farmers, business owners and industry. Our children and grandchildren can trust that we will mitigate the risk and set up their future for growth and prosperity.

         'Shakedown politics' are the Prime Minister's own words for states and territories desperately fighting off a health crisis. How does the Prime Minister described the Nationals, the junior coalition partner, dictating the terms for climate policy? What slick marketing term does the Prime Minister use to describe eight years of his government's inaction on this most critical issue? Perhaps the

         thought he could pass the buck because he's got a history of shirking responsibility. Now the Nationals are claiming that this deal can't be sorted out after only a four-hour party room meeting. They say it may take weeks or months. How about a decade? How about eight years of government inaction, three prime ministers and 21 energy policies? Is that long enough? Australia is now in the embarrassing situation where the Prime Minister is going to Glasgow, but he has no policy. 'Code red for humanity' is how the

          IPCC

         , the most authoritative body of climate scientists, has described the situation we are in, yet members of this government are talking about how we should all be willing to take a hit on our mortgages to supports fossil fuels and government funding of those industries. This is beyond a disgrace, absolutely beyond a disgrace. Australia should be a renewable energy superpower. The world is moving on, the market is moving on, but Australia is being left behind and Australian jobs will be left behind. Only a Labor government will take action, only a Labor government will end the climateâ€”
