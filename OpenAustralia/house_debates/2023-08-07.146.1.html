       <p>
        It's been a really busy time in my electorate of Chisholm in recent weeks, and I want to provide the House with a few exciting updates regarding some of the activities. It's really wonderful to be part of a government that is actually investing in and delivering for the eastern and south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was a fantastic day for both the Waverley Blues Football Netball Club and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Waverley" rel="nofollow">
         Mount Waverley
        </a>
        Cricket club when we recently had the opportunity to host Minister Catherine King to reconfirm the government's funding commitment to the redevelopment of Mount Waverley Reserve and view the new plans for the pavilion. This funding, along with the support from the Victorian state government and Monash Council, will deliver a brand-new and expanded two-level sports pavilion, a complete renovation of the playing ground, new and expanded training facilities, and upgraded spectator and community amenities for the reserve. This visit was a great opportunity to view the Mount Waverley Reserve Masterplan, which will also include replacing the current clubrooms, a sports lighting upgrade, reshaping the oval—including improved fencing, drainage and irrigation, an oval circuit path and associated tree planting—cricket net relocation and new public toilets.
       </p>
       <p>
        One aspect of the redevelopment that I know was so welcomed by the tenant clubs, players and the community is the new female change rooms which will be a part of the upgrade. We know how important having a female change room can be when it comes to growing participation in sport. I make this comment, of course, just after the Australian Diamonds have won the Netball World Cup, and we're all looking forward to watching the Matildas tonight, so it is a really fine time for women's sport in this country. I had the pleasure when I was at Mount Waverley reserve of meeting the many girls and women who stand to benefit from this aspect of the redevelopment, who were obviously just as excited as I was about these changes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another really important visit over the last few weeks was to Guardian Childcare and Education in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackburn_South" rel="nofollow">
         Blackburn South
        </a>
        , where, along with the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_Childhood_Education" rel="nofollow">
         Early Childhood Education
        </a>
        and Minister for Youth, the wonderful Dr Anne Aly, I had the chance to meet with centre manager Ashleigh Curnow and talk about all things early childhood education and meet with some very special young constituents in Chisholm. Thank you to Ashleigh and the team for hosting the minister and me and for taking the time to chat and share stories with us and the children. It was wonderful to hear about the important work they're doing in the space of early childhood education. I know that it's really important to my community, with more than 7,200 families in Chisholm standing to benefit from these changes.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also had the privilege, at the invitation of president Greg Male, of visiting the Monash Men's Shed in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Waverley" rel="nofollow">
         Glen Waverley
        </a>
        , and I just want to note the important work they do in the space of men's health and providing opportunities for men to connect with one another in the community. It's always a pleasure to update the House.
