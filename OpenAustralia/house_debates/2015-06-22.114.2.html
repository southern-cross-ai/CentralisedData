        </a>
        Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Multi-User Barge Ramp Facilityâ€”East Arm Darwin,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        As I advised the House when referring this project to the Public Works Committee, it is proposed that the Department of Defence and the Northern Territory government's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Development_Corporation" rel="nofollow">
         Land Development Corporation
        </a>
        construct a hardened barge ramp, a marshalling area located adjacent to the ramp and a roadway to link the barge ramp to the existing staging area at East Arm Port, Darwin, in the Northern Territory. The Land Development Corporation will provide existing land and road access infrastructure. The multi-user barge ramp facility will be owned by the Land Development Corporation and situated on its property.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Defence" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        contribution is capped at $18.3 million, which is inclusive of $2.2 million for the development phase of the project and $16.1 million for the construction phase. The project will meet an important defence capability requirement for our amphibious landing craft, particularly in providing the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">

        with logistic support capability of the new landing helicopter docks while providing the Northern Territory government with a new logistics asset which will enhance Darwin's expanding commercial logistics infrastructure.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Land Development Corporation and Defence have reached an in-principle agreement which will form a deed of licence to address access rights for Defence, Defence's funding contribution, and appropriate governance and maintenance arrangements. The committee has conducted an inquiry and is of the view that the project signifies value for money for the Commonwealth and constitutes a project that is fit for purpose and expedient to carry out.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of the government I thank the committee for once again undertaking a timely inquiry. Subject to parliamentary approval, Defence will finalise the deed of licence agreement. Construction is expected to begin in late 2015 and should be completed by mid-2016. I commend the motion to the House.

This referral was made at the very end of the autumn sittings of parliament, and I would like to acknowledge the committee's efforts to conduct an expeditious and sensitive inquiry into the project. The proposed works that were the subject of the committee's report will, subject to parliamentary approval, commence later this year. I commend the motion to the House.

        Remediation Project.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I advised the House when referring this project to the Public Works Committee, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Finance" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Finance
        </a>
        proposes to undertake remediation of contamination on sections 32, 34 and 41 on the Cox Peninsula, Northern Territory.
       </p>
       <p>
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
         The Commonwealth
        </a>
        currently controls and manages contaminated landholdings on the Cox Peninsula, which is the subject of the long-standing Kenbi land claim under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. The Commonwealth has undertaken to relinquish sites covered by the claim and has an obligation to remediate the land under the polluter-pays principle, to ensure that those who access the site do so without risk to their health.
       </p>
       <p>
        The remediation works will be conducted over four years and, due to the complex nature of the works and distinct Northern Territory weather patterns, will include the installation of an underground containment cell on section 34, specifically designed to house non-leachable materials. Non-contaminated material will be recycled as appropriate at existing facilities in the Northern Territory.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project will create opportunities for Indigenous participation and employment. The department will ensure that a range of employment and training positions are available to local Indigenous residents, where possible. Our commitment to undertaking these remediation works is evidence of the Commonwealth's commitment to seeing this long-running land claim resolved. Once remediation is completed the land is to be transferred progressively to the traditional owners.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Public Works Committee has conducted an inquiry into the project and concluded that it is expedient that the remediation works be carried out. On behalf of the government I would like to thank the committee for once again undertaking a rigorous inquiry. I am delighted that the committee had the opportunity to visit the Cox Peninsula to see firsthand the need for the works. The committee has asked that the Department of Finance provide annual reports on the progress of the remediation works, and the department will certainly do so.
       </p>
       <p>
        Often, when moving these motions, I am usually concerned with projects to be delivered by other portfolios and so I am pleased on this occasion to be the minister responsible for the project as well as for this motion. In its report, the committee commended officials from the Department of Finance and the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet for the excellent work they have done in getting the project to this point and for the close collaboration between the two departments. I wholeheartedly endorse those comments and I add my own thanks to the officials involved for their efforts. I particularly want to acknowledge the work done by Tooey Elliott and Adrian Kirk in getting the project to this point.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subject to the successful passage of this motion, the remediation project is expected to commence later this year and to be completed by 2018. With that, I commend the motion to the House.
