        The other day, the member for Petrie referred to the Parliamentary Friends of Palestine in a speech he gave in the Federation Chamber. He called for the disbanding of the Parliamentary Friends of Palestine. In fact, today I received a letter from the member for Petrie putting his request to me in writing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now, I get that colleagues in this place have differing views about a whole range of things. Some views we agree with; others we don't. But in Australia's house of democracy we practice democracy. The Parliamentary Friends of Palestine has a proud history of advocacy for peace and justice and was formed by notable members of this House. I have some history with which to enlighten the member for Petrie. The member for Grayndler, now the Prime Minister of Australia, was a founding member, along with the former member for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         North Sydney
        </a>
        and Australia's former Treasurer Joe Hockey. It has always enjoyed tripartisan leadership and support. In fact, for many years I co-chaired the group with the member for Farrer, now the Deputy Leader of the Opposition.
       </p>
       <p>
        Let me make this very clear to the member for Petrie: the Parliamentary Friends of Palestine will not be disbanded, members of parliament will not be gagged, this parliament will not be prohibited from its work, and Australia and Australians will not be silenced.
