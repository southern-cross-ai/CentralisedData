       <p>
        I am very happy to support my colleague on this issue. Last Friday in Wodonga, 150 people and 40-plus exhibitors made the Albury-Wodonga Australian Manufacturing Farming Program Position Perfect a great success. This was an expo about manufacturing. I have to say to my colleague opposite that, when we had the young people talking about careers, the manufacturers said that what we really need is English and maths to year 12. They are foundation subjects for all manufacturing.
       </p>

        We had four panels of politicians, local manufacturers, school children and foodies. They talked about 'the secret ingredient' to making a living and making a really good business in regional manufacturing. It was particularly good to speak with food producers and manufacturers who have a positive outlook for their regions and communities. I would particularly like to acknowledge and thank Senator Janet Rice, the member for Kennedy,

        on Friday in the sixth of these forums. I have to say it was a really wonderful event. We talked about food labelling; we talked about the importance of infrastructure; and we talked about the importance of a vision for regional Australia, particularly for regional manufacturing. I am looking forward to bringing a more detailed report to the House. Thanks to all who came along.
