Why has it taken six months and, potentially, billions of dollars of unnecessary waste for the government to pay lip-service to the concept of value for money?

               Mr Speaker, on the point of order and your ruling: what you have indicated in the past is that a point of order must be raised at the time at which a question is asked. If it is out of order, I would ask you to ask the shadow minister to rephrase the question or to rule it out of order.

                  <p>
                   Factor No. 1 was that at the time that this program was costed it was impossible for the government to have the actual 2009 enrolment statistics because it was before the commencement of the school year. The enrolment statistics matter because this is a program correlated to school size. So, as school sizes change and the number of schools changes, obviously financing in the program changes. Then, the second and overwhelmingly largest factor in terms of the costings was that when this program was announced the program costings were done on the basis that uptake was likely to be 90 per cent.

                      I hear the opposition jeer at that, and the opposition is obviously thinking to itself: ‘Why would you model a percentage uptake of a universal entitlement program in schools? Why would you do that?’ It really strikes me as passing strange that any member of the opposition would jeer about that, because when the opposition was in government it had the Investing in Our Schools Program and—you guessed it—it was modelled at an 80 per cent take-up rate. It was badged as a universal entitlement to schools and it was modelled at an 80 per cent take-up rate.

                       <p>
                        The shadow minister says—he is priceless; I am very fond of him—‘And there wasn’t a blow-out.’ Yes, there was a blow-out. There was a blow-out when your deputy leader was Minister for Education, Science and Training.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Let me explain to you the nature of the blow-out. Having costed the program at 80 per cent, more schools wanted the money than the costing allowed. So what happened was that the then minister for education, currently Deputy Leader of the Opposition, went back for an additional $181 million. That is the ‘blow-out’, if this terminology is going to be used, in the cost of Investing in Our Schools—18 per cent. It was a blow-out of 18 per cent, presided over by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition whilst the current Leader of the Opposition was a member of cabinet. I cannot recall whether the current shadow minister was in the ministry or trying to get into the ministry, but it was a blow-out of 18 per cent.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Of course, percentage wise, this is a far greater cost variation than anything that has happened with
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_the_Education_Revolution" rel="nofollow">
                         Building the Education Revolution
                        </a>
                        . The then minister for education, now the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, had to go back to the budget and come back out with $181 million, whereas this is a reallocation within an envelope that we promised the Australian people—$42 billion. So it just amazes me that any member of the opposition would have been out criticising a costing assumption of a 90 per cent take-up for
                        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primary_Schools" rel="nofollow">
                         Primary Schools
                        </a>
                        for the 21st Century when they sat on the government benches and put out a program with an 80 per cent take-up and a blow-out of 18 per cent and then had to fix it.
                       </p>
                       <p>
                        Then, of course, on the question of fixing that blow-out, what did they do? They changed the guidelines to cut the entitlement to—you guessed it—government schools. Schools had been able to apply, government and non-government, for $150,000 and then, to manage the consequences of the 80 per cent take-up rate assumption, the former government changed the guidelines so government schools could only get $50,000 less as a maximum.

                           What they then did was cut the entitlement to government schools. In stark contrast, this is a government that said it would deliver $42 billion of stimulus to support jobs today whilst building the infrastructure for tomorrow. Within that $42 billion stimulus we have made an extra allocation to

                           for the 21st Century because it is going gangbusters and more primary schools want to be involved in it than were originally costed for. We costed with a greater uptake assumption than that used by the previous government in its Investing in Our Schools Program and, unlike the previous government, we do not discriminate against government schools. We are supporting schools right around the nation so we can support jobs right around the nation. This is about jobs. It is about infrastructure for the future. It is a real pity that the current opposition, caught in this mire of hypocrisy, cannot see its way clear to just supporting the program.
