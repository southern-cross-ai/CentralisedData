       <p>
        One hundred years ago, my great-uncle left Tasmania to serve in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_War" rel="nofollow">
         Great War
        </a>
        . He never returned. But when he left Tasmania he did it in a spirit of service—to serve the community so that he could protect the way of life and prosperity of all Tasmanians. One hundred years later, our party is standing in the Tasmanian state election, because Palmer United has the same strong commitment to protect Tasmania, to recapture its prosperity, so that all Tasmanians can have a good and prosperous future.
       </p>
       <p>
        My family has had a long-term commitment to Tasmania. My mother was born in Penguin and my father established Radio 7UV at Ulverstone. Today Tasmania endures hardship. Tasmania has been cast on a sea of despair. Labor and the Greens have locked up 51 per cent of the state, destroying opportunities, creating uncertainty and turning away investment. Leadership, not complacency, is our need today. The ability to lead and lead vigorously is the only way we can bring Tasmania back to a proper and prosperous economy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Only Palmer United is fearless. We can do what has to be done to restore Tasmania to prosperity. Labor and the Greens have had a go—a go at destroying the state and a go at destroying the livelihoods of Tasmanians—taking from all Tasmanians their children's future. Urgent action is needed to change all that. Tasmania needs investment and it needs growth. Tasmania needs enterprise. Tasmania needs jobs, jobs and more jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tasmanians need a future for their children—not in Victoria,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        or Queensland but in Tasmania. Tasmanians can do it with the support of all Australians, with encouragement and with initiative. Tasmanians should realise that they are not alone but are part of the Commonwealth. The more we can interact with other states the more the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Commonwealth of Australia
        </a>
        can be shared for the prosperity of all Tasmanians. Section 92 of the Constitution says that trade between the states shall be free. How can it be when access across
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bass_Strait" rel="nofollow">
         Bass Strait
        </a>
        is done in a costly manner that destroys Tasmania's ability to interact with the rest of the states in Australia?
       </p>
       <p>
        Many people say they care about the people of Tasmania and about the state. So many politicians say they care but do not act decisively to produce results. For 16 years the Leader of the Opposition in Tasmania has been the bridesmaid and not the bride. His time has gone. He proposed more no-confidence motions that did not pass than any other opposition leader in the Western world.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australians need to act now and make Tasmanians' lives better. That is why Palmer United is standing in every seat in the Tasmanian election. Palmer United seeks no reward except its role in history of providing a better and secure future for people who have been long neglected in a part of Australia which was once very vital and very important to the nation. Tasmanians know that this election is important to make a difference for their future. They can stay with it provided the course is set. They can stay the course and persevere. They need to conquer and prevail for a better future.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tasmania needs to claim a spot in the nation's history and reclaim the wealth that it once had. Australians and all Tasmanians must put a stronger emphasis on what Tasmania has achieved over its long history. Once Tasmania produced in the 1980s $1 billion more than it consumed. Tasmania's problems have been made by Tasmanians and can be solved by Tasmanians—and I am sure they will at the next election. I thank the House.
