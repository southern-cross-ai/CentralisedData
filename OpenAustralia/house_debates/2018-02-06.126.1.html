       <p>
        Employment is an enduring challenge in Canning, especially for young people. People need work for self-worth, dignity and purpose. Recently, though, we've had good news. Just before Christmas, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Employment" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Employment
        </a>
        reported a decrease in unemployment over the past 12 months in the Peel region. In the City of Mandurah, unemployment has fallen from 11.6 per cent to 6.8 per cent. In the Shire of Murray, unemployment is down from 10.7 per cent to 6.5 per cent. This is really good news and cause for optimism.
       </p>
       <p>
        But employment isn't just about numbers; it's about peopleâ€”flesh and blood Australians. Over recent months, I've spoken with people whose lives have been changed by job creation across the Peel region. One example stands out to me. It is the story of Harley, Tony and Dan. Tony and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Turner" rel="nofollow">
         Dan Turner
        </a>
        are the owners of a Mandurah small business, Madora Bay Glass. Last year Tony and Dan wanted to hire more staff. They were interested in taking on an apprentice but wanted to make sure they were hiring someone who was keen, reliable and teachable. So Tony came along to an employment breakfast put on my Mandurah's employment facilitator, Maryanne Baker. Maryanne's role is to connect businesses, workers and jobactive providers. Our government has driven this initiative and it is working, for the breakfast is where Tony and Dan heard about the PaTH program. Under PaTH, Tony and Dan had the opportunity to trial a new worker as a paid intern. It was the equivalent of a paid job interview. It's an opportunity for businesses to see someone up close and get a sense of their personal skills, their work ethic and their commitment.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is where Harley comes into the story. Harley is a young bloke from Dawesville looking for work. Through the local offices of Bridging the Gap and Employment Plus, Harley completed the prepare stage of the PaTH program. Over six weeks he learnt skills essential for securing work: goal setting, intensive job searching, cold calling, resume preparation and interview skills. During his job interview, Harley stood out from the other candidates. He had researched Madora Bay Glass and glazing. He showed an interest in the business, which is something very important to business owners like Tony and Dan.
       </p>
       <p>
        The preparation worked. Tony took on Harley as their PaTH intern. This all happened in October and I was pleased to meet everyone at the growing business. Some weeks ago I visited with Tony and Harley, at Madora Bay Glass, to see how they were going. Harley had impressed Tony, Dan and the team. He was on time every day and took hold of the opportunity before him. He impressed Tony and Dan so much that they've taken on Harley as a full-time apprentice. He is now out and about with the team, learning his trade and contributing to our local economy. I noticed too that he's grown in confidence over that short time. Harley is another example of how work gives us dignity, self-worth and purpose, and I commend the PaTH program for the opportunity it gives to young Australians.
