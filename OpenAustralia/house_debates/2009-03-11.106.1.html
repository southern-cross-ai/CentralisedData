       <p>
        I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Gawler sub-branch of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        is this year celebrating its 90th anniversary. Anzac Day is always an occasion for reflection and contemplation of the sacrifices made by so many men and women over so many conflicts in this country, but this year Anzac Day is a particularly important occasion for the Gawler RSL. The RSL was established on 16 July 1919 on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Street" rel="nofollow">
         Murray Street
        </a>
        in Gawler. It then moved to a location in Cowan Street and then to its current location on Gosford Street, Gawler. During this time the RSL has become a focus for many in the community and a vital part of the character of Gawler. Over the years it has worked with locals to preserve and keep alive the memory of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_War" rel="nofollow">
         Great War
        </a>
        and the many conflicts since.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 16 July this year the RSL will officially celebrate this milestone with a special anniversary presidents dinner. The new president of the RSL is Mr George Sibenaler, and he is going to be in charge of the commemorations. It will also include the participation of the town of Gawler, the local state MP,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Piccolo" rel="nofollow">
         Tony Piccolo
        </a>
        , local business owners and the RSL, which from April will commemorate the occasion with historic displays in local shops and public buildings, particularly around Murray Street, which is the main street of Gawler. The commemorations will have their high point with the traditional Sunday street march on 19 April and then, later, the dawn service on the 25th and the 90th anniversary breakfast in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pioneer_Park" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Gawler.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Rann state government has just announced a $19,000 contribution to upgrading Pioneer Park, a very important park. I can remember going there in my youth as an air cadet, so it has particular poignancy for me. It is a great milestone for the RSL to reach. I think it is a great part of the local community in Gawler and will continue, I hope, for the next 90 years.
