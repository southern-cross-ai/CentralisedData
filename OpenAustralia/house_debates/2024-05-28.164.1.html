       <p>
        For too long, Australia has been caught in climate wars, hampered by a decade of negligence, political infighting and lack of genuine climate action. Over the last decade, the Liberals and Nationals repealed the carbon pricing scheme, cut funding to climate science and research, dismantled climate institutions, set weaker emissions reduction targets and, in short, didn't take this climate crisis seriously. The Liberals' climate wars stalled progress and left us vulnerable to the escalating threats of a warming planet and vulnerable to more severe and more regular weather events. Instead of decisive action, we witnessed years of unnecessary debate and division that hindered our ability to respond effectively to the urgent environmental challenges our country faces.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australians were sick of the opposition's climate denial and climate inaction, and they voted them out. They voted in a government to take action and work to end the climate wars and get on with the job of taking meaningful climate action. In two years, the Albanese Labor government has already passed the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Change
        </a>
        Act 2022, enshrining our emissions reduction targets into law. We've updated our contributions under the Paris Agreement. We've invested billions in the electricity grid, community batteries, solar banks, renewable energy manufacturing and low-emissions technologies. That's just the beginning. This government is deeply committed to protecting our environment, to reducing emissions and to transitioning towards a sustainable renewable energy future. Our most recent budget builds on previous announcements to show that we see our transition away from fossil fuels as a necessity whilst also being an extraordinary economic opportunity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our recent legislation and the 2024-25 budget have allocated $40 billion dedicated to achieving these goals. The government has introduced new vehicle emission standards to reduce pollution from one of the largest sources of emissions: transport. These standards, which are now law, will mean cleaner, more efficient vehicles for Aussie motorists. They will help reduce greenhouse gases and also improve air quality and public health and save motorists up to $1,000 a year in fuel costs. Our climate strategies include the Rewiring the Nation program, with a $20 billion investment to modernise our electricity grid and infrastructure, laying the groundwork for an energy system anchored in renewable energy. By upgrading our grid, we can better integrate renewable energy sources like wind and solar, ensuring reliable, sustainable and affordable power for all Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Powering the Regions Fund, with a $1.9 billion investment, supports the decarbonisation of existing industries and the creation of new clean energy industries in regional areas. By focusing on the regions, we ensure widespread benefits of the clean energy transition, supporting jobs and economic growth in the regions as well—not just the cities. Recognising the strategic importance of critical minerals in our clean energy future, the government has also committed $6 billion to our Critical Minerals Facility. This initiative aims to grow our critical minerals production centre, ensuring stable supply of essential materials for technologies like batteries, electric vehicles and renewable energy systems.
       </p>
       <p>
        The $2 billion Hydrogen Headstart program supports large-scale renewable hydrogen projects, offering a versatile and clean energy source that can decarbonise emissions-heavy sectors like transport industry and power generation. Then we have the National Reconstruction Fund, with a $15 billion investment aiming to diversify and transform Australian industries for a net zero economy. It will drive innovation, support new industries and ensure our economy remains competitive in a rapidly changing global landscape. Our government's investment in reducing emissions and becoming a renewable energy superpower is not just about meeting targets; it's about ensuring a sustainable and prosperous future for all Australians, just like those in my community of Bennelong.

        In Bennelong our community wanted a member and government who care about meaningful and urgent climate action. We recognise that national laws and policy are one way to help but that we also need to empower local communities to lead the way towards a sustainable future. Two weeks ago in Bennelong, we celebrated a significant milestone in our renewable energy journey with the launch of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Epping" rel="nofollow">
         North Epping
        </a>
        community battery—one of 400 funded by the Albanese government. Funded by the government, the launch of this AusGrid and Hornsby council facility was attended by Minister Bowen, Marc England and the AusGrid team, Mayor Philip Ruddock

        and

        </a>
        councillors. Importantly, over 100 locals came to join us to learn how their new sustainable infrastructure would work and to ask questions. The launch of the North Epping community battery was a nice occasion for me personally. It's nice as a politician to be able to promise something and then deliver it. It was nice to deliver it alongside the people of North Epping who, I know, take climate change very seriously. Before I was elected in 2022, I promised to deliver this battery in North Epping, and it was at times a bumpy road to get there. Seeing the results and turning on the battery was a good achievement. I made a promise, I consulted with the community and I delivered a community battery for Bennelong.
       </p>
       <p>
        This battery has a capacity of 535 kilowatt hours and is one of the early successes of the federal government's Community Batteries for Household Solar program, and only the third delivered by AusGrid. It will enhance power quality and voltage in our area, making it easier for residents to install and utilise solar panels and feed excess solar energy back into that battery. Functioning as a shock absorber for our local grid, this battery stores surplus solar energy generated by homes during the day and releases it at night. This will help residents in North Epping reduce their dependence on energy transported from the grid and help ensure a steady power supply even when the sun isn't shining. Moreover the benefits of these batteries extend beyond their immediate community. By supporting intermittent renewable energy generation with storage this battery will contribute to a more resilient and flexible energy system nationwide, making the grid more stable and more efficient.
       </p>
       <p>
        The significance of this piece of infrastructure goes beyond its technical capabilities. It symbolises our community's dedication to collective action against climate change. Investing in renewable energy helps reduce carbon emissions and builds a more resilient and self-sustaining community. By storing excess solar power, we reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, we lower our energy costs and we better prepare our community for the future. I know that this battery will not only be highly utilised but will also benefit the Bennelong community, especially those in North Epping.
       </p>
       <p>
        When I say our community cares about the stuff, I'm not exaggerating. A week after we launched this battery the local community group Sustainable North Epping hosted their own electric vehicle showcase and sustainability fair. The festival featured an impressive display of 12 affordable and luxury electric vehicles from a range of renowned brands, highlighting the latest advancements in low-emissions transportation. Attendees had the opportunity to explore these vehicles up close, learn about their benefits, speak to the owners of these vehicles and chat about how they could make the switch to low-emissions vehicles themselves. The presence of the Australian Electric Vehicle Association and our good friends at Solar Citizens provided valuable insights and information, supporting the community to make more educated and sustainable living choices. One of the highlights of the day was the introduction of ZapCat, which is a new Parramatta based start-up with a mission to help Australians transition their homes to clean energy by electrifying everything.
       </p>
       <p>
        This festival was not just about education. It was also about community engagement and a bit of fun as well. Sustainable North Epping put on prizes, including a three-month e-bike subscription. There were free compost bins. Native plants were given away. And they encouraged residents to adopt more sustainable living practices in their daily lives. A second-hand toy store was there, and it enabled families to de-clutter and exchange toys. Adding to the atmosphere was the local start-up Pedal Powered Smoothies, offering delicious smoothies made using bicycle power.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian public have made it clear that they're sick of divisive politics on taking climate action. They're sick of arguing over scientific facts. They want a government that commits to taking action and following through. That's exactly why I'm in this parliament, and that's exactly what the Albanese Labor government is doing.
