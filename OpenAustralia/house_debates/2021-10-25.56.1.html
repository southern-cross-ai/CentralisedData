        Victoria is roaring back to life! Cafes and restaurants were bustling, hairdressers had queues around the block and the streets of Melbourne were full of atmosphere and optimism.

        Not yet, member for Paterson! Families were reunited and friends got back together. Victorians have been through so much over the past two years. We have made agonising sacrifices to our lives, our businesses and even our wellbeing. We endured not only the lockdowns but the relentless partisanship from the Morrison government, which played politics throughout this entire pandemic. We heard a lot from those who are from Victoria, but not for Victoria.

        Victorians knew it was always a race. Those opposite gave priority vaccines to

         New South Wales
        </a>
        and then complained when Victoria wasn't vaccinating as quickly as New South Wales! But, regardless, today more than 90 per cent of Victorians have had at least one dose and, thanks to them, we're going to see our great state open up even more. I want to say a big thank to each and every Victorian who has helped us get through this very, very difficult period. And I say a special thank you to the doctors, the nurses and the healthcare workers who have done so much for our community and our state throughout this pandemic. We have a lot to look forward to. The great state of Victoria is roaring back to life and we're all so proud of everyone for getting vaccinated and getting us back open.
