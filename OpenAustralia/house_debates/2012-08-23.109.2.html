        Regrettably this House is made famous for those things that divide us rather than those things that unite us. The evening news is filled with stories of bitter conflict and fierce rivalry in our parliament rather than a commentary on those matters that have been concluded in the national interest without fuss or fanfare. I rise in the House to commend the Attorney-General for her appointment of Stephen Gageler

        </a>
        . I note that this appointment has been welcomed by the shadow Attorney-General,

        </a>
        , and the opposition. It is an appointment which I also welcome personally, having known Stephen for almost half a century.
       </p>
       <p>
        Stephen Gageler has had a stellar legal career and is the first Commonwealth Solicitor-General to be appointed to the High Court since former High Court Justice
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Anthony_Mason" rel="nofollow">
         Sir Anthony Mason
        </a>
        . It is coincidental that Stephen served as an associate of Justice Mason. This appointment exemplifies what makes Australia great, that a man of humble beginnings can rise to the highest office not as a birthright but on the basis of hard work, talent and commitment. Stephen grew up in the small village of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hollow" rel="nofollow">
         Sandy Hollow
        </a>
        in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Hunter Valley
        </a>
        in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        . He came from a hardworking family—his mother, Pat, a hairdresser and his father, John, a sawmiller. I can recall Stephen's father returning to the family home after a hard day's work in the heat—dusty, hands blackened with hardwood stains.
       </p>
       <p>
        Stephen attended the one-teacher Giants Creek school and was the first student from that school to attend university. I understand from media reports that the school is no longer open. For such a small village to have been the childhood home of a High Court justice does seem quite remarkable. As a small boy, Stephen played cricket for Sandy Hollow. It is my recollection that he had to. The selection process was a little less than rigorous; if Stephen did not play, the Sandy Hollow team could only muster 10 men. He did say he was not an overly talented batsman and that his bowling left a little to be desired. He modestly claimed to fulfil the role of 'specialist fieldsman', whatever that might mean.
       </p>
       <p>
        He completed his high school education at Muswellbrook High School, where he was school captain. He was an outstanding student who excelled at his studies and was a great school leader. He completed a first-class honours degree in economics and law at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_National_University" rel="nofollow">
         Australian National University
        </a>
        and obtained a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Laws" rel="nofollow">
         Master of Laws
        </a>
        from Harvard. He entered commercial practice in 1992, becoming an SC in 2000 before taking up the role of Commonwealth Solicitor-General in 2008. It would seem that Stephen needed all his skills as a black belt in taekwondo to meet the challenges of the role of Solicitor-General in recent years.
       </p>
       <p>
        Former Chief Justice Sir Anthony Mason said of his young associate:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I thought he was outstanding and I thought he would rise to the top of the profession.
       </p>
       <p>
        The predictions of Sir Anthony Mason have proven correct and Stephen has indeed risen to the very top of the profession. The Attorney-General noted that Stephen is a person of enormous integrity and went on to say:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Mr Gageler's name was on the top of many, many lists from the profession … from those across the political spectrum.
       </p>
       <p>
        It would come as no surprise to anyone who knows Stephen that he would be a man at the top of so many lists—a hardworking and decent man, a great Australian. Stephen has modestly said: 'My perception is that at any time in Australia there would be 50 people quite capable of performing the role of High Court Justice.' I could think of no better candidate for such a position than Stephen Gageler. I wish Stephen well in his demanding role on the High Court. I know the judiciary will be enhanced by the presence of Justice Gageler on the bench. It is an honour to be able to call Stephen Gageler a friend, and those with a matter before the highest court in the land will be in good hands with the boy from Sandy Hollow presiding.
