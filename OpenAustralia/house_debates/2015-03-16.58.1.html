        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, representing the Attorney-General. Will the foreign minister update the House on action the government is taking to crack down on illegal firearms?

         I thank the member for Macquarie for her question. I know she is deeply concerned about this issue, as are the Australian people. The Australian government is determined to ensure the safety of our community. As part of our priority on safety and security we are doing everything we reasonably can to crack down on illegal firearms. There were very significant cuts to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Customs" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Customs
         </a>
         and Border Protection Service between 2008 and 2013. I have to point to that because it led to a 25 per cent reduction in the screening of sea cargo and a 75 per cent reduction in the screening of air cargo. And, of course, that has had an adverse impact on efforts to prevent the importation of illegal firearms.
        </p>
        <p>
         The coalition government has now put $88 million back into the customs service so that we can increase screening levels of both sea and air cargo. Notwithstanding there are still an estimated one quarter of a million illegal firearms in Australia, it is essential for our crime-fighting efforts and for our management of security risks that we increase our efforts to combat trafficking in illegal firearms. The coalition has been working with foreign law enforcement partners to conduct investigations into the illegal importation of firearms. Since 1 January this year, the national anti-gang squad that we established has been involved in 160 state and territory police gang related investigations, which has led to the arrest of over 400 people and the seizure of more than 300 firearms. I can assure the House and the people of Australia that the Australian government will give the police and our security agencies the tools that they need to do their job; one of those tools is adequate penalties on people who are trafficking in illegal firearms.
        </p>
        <p>
         Prior to the 2013 election the coalition committed to introducing mandatory minimum sentences of five years' imprisonment for trafficking in illegal firearms. While this measure did pass the House of Representatives earlier this year, the legislation was blocked by the Labor Party in the Senate. This week the Minister for Justice will re-introduce legislation to give effect to our commitment as part of a broader package of further national security reform.

            I note that when in government, as the Minister for
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
             Social Services
            </a>
            just pointed out, the Labor Party introduced mandatory minimum sentences for people smuggling and so I now call upon the Labor Party to similarly support a minimum sentence for trafficking in illegal firearms. The government is determined to keep our community safe through strengthened legislation to combat this trafficking of illegal firearms, and I call upon the Labor Party to support this vital legislation.
