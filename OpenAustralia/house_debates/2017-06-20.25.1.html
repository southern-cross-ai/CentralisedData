        ! The project is a joint initiative between the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housing_Authority" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        and the

        </a>
        and will provide 1,500 new dwellings, as well as revitalised multipurpose civic and community facilities. Located centrally within the Bentley Regeneration Project is Brownlie Towers, which was built between 1969 and 1970 and consists of twin 10-storey towers. Initially labelled as a triumph of community building initiatives because of its proximity to schools, shops and a swimming pool, Brownlie Towers quickly became an environment which was riddled with antisocial behaviour. In my time as the federal member for Swan, my constituents have voiced concerns over the high crime rates, the presence of drug activity and the high vacancy rates in the main towers, which have seen squatters come and go.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have continued to advocate for the regeneration project. The electrical, plumbing and safety issues are significant, and I am sure all members would agree that the safety of our constituents is paramount. The car park of the towers is set to be demolished later this month, which is set to deter antisocial behaviour. City of Canning councillor Jesse Jacobs and other councillors have been in touch with me to discuss the future of Brownlie Towers, noting that their demolition would be beneficial to the project and would be good for residents. There are approximately 100 people living there, and these people deserve better, and it is a very worthy project. I look forward to working with the Housing Authority and the City of Canning to ensure the best outcomes for the residents of Swan.
