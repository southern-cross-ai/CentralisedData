       <p>
        Today I rise on a very sad noteâ€”to talk about the passing of Dean Rossiter on 7 August. He is the former chairman of the great

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rossi_Boots" rel="nofollow">
         Rossi Boots
        </a>
        , which is situated in my electorate of Hindmarsh. Dean Rossiter was a highly respected businessman. He was a very proud Australian and a very proud
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        . He contributed to the success of Rossi Boots with over 46 years at the helm, one of the last bootmakers in the state that produces a great Australian boot.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rossi Boots was founded by Mr Rossiter's grandfather, Arthur Edward Rossiter, in 1910. Dean was very proud. He had given me tours of the factory many times: when I was a candidate in 1998, again in 2001 and continuously all those years while he was the director and manager of the place. He was always so proud to talk about being a bootmaker and someone that employed locally and made and produced a local, good product. Many times he had said to me how important it was that he had remained in South Australia, choosing to continue manufacturing these great boots locally when many other companies like his in and around the area had moved their operations offshore. Many times he had said to me that it would be more viable, but he was so proud.
       </p>
       <p>
        My thoughts and condolences go out to his family and friends. I thank him for his great contribution to South Australia. Our thoughts today are with all of his employees and all of the people at the Rossi Boots factory at Hilton.
