       <p>
        It is hard to accept or believe that in a democratic country as wealthy as Australia many people with a disability in their families are still left to struggle each and every day. Most Australians assume that if people are born with a disability or acquire one later in life some system, somewhere, will take care of them. Sadly, this is not always the case. People with a disability, their families and their carers know only too well the daily struggle for services and support—how often the system fails to deliver essential services. They know how often desperate families are left to fill the gaps.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is also huge inequity. People receive different levels of support depending on how, when and where their disability was acquired. This situation will only grow worse in the future. As the population ages and as medical intervention at birth increases, the number of people with a disability will surely rise. At the same time, the number of unpaid carers, family members and friends who are willing and able to provide support will decrease. It is therefore time to take stock and plan properly for the future. We need a vision for equity, for fairness and for justice for those with a disability and the wonderful people who look after them.

        A national disability insurance scheme represents a fundamental reform to the way services are funded and delivered. It is a social reform of the scale of the introduction of Medicare and compulsory superannuation—two safety nets that are now taken for granted by every Australian. In a budget of $350 billion, surely we can find in our hearts, if not our finances, the additional dollars. The

        certainly thinks we can find the money. We just need the political will.

        We are fortunate enough in my electorate of Riverina to have wonderful organisations such as Valmar at Tumut and Kurrajong Waratah based in

        </a>
        , which dedicate their care, expertise and services to provide support for people with disabilities as well as independence and reassurance to their families. On August 15 I was proud to open the Tumut waste and recycling centre, which is staffed by people from Valmar as well as people from the local

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        On 27 July 2011 I toured many of the establishments fostered by the people of Kurrajong Waratah, which has a fantastic administration. The

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communications_Manager" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , Cathie Smith, were justifiably proud to take me around and remind me of the opportunities for people who might otherwise struggle to find meaningful employment in everyday life. Kurrajong Waratah offers services to all ages and is not restricted to just helping people with disabilities but also helps their families, carers and friends.
       </p>
       <p>
        People with a disability, their families and their carers want to participate in the social, economic and cultural life of the nation, but there are many barriers to their full inclusion, and this is something Kurrajong Waratah breaks down. Starting from a young age with Kurrajong Early Childhood Intervention Service, Kurrajong provides an early childhood intervention service for many families who have a child aged from birth to school entry age with a disability or developmental delay in two or more areas. The services it offers can often lead to the child never needing assistance from Kurrajong Waratah again, which is the main aim of the centre. For children who go on to need assistance, a lot is offered in later life to keep disabled people in everyday society at their own pace.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lack of support and services means families are primarily responsible for meeting the needs of their family member who has a disability. Many families struggle with high rates of physical, emotional and financial stress. That is why Kurrajong provides the optimum quality of service, from a children's and adolescent's accommodation support service that provides group home accommodation in Wagga Wagga for school-age children who have a disability to RetireLink in Leeton, which provides a flexible service that responds to the changing needs of people with disabilities who are ageing. It offers its clients opportunities to develop new interests, maintain skills and enjoy community participation.
       </p>
       <p>
        Kurrajong Waratah, which commenced operations in 1957, with the aim of meeting the needs of people with a disability and their families, has done so for the people of the Riverina-Murray areas ever since and has done wonderful job. Its aim continues today, with more than 700 babies, children and adults receiving their services and support daily. It focuses on the ability and the potential of the individual. Kurrajong continues to ensure that its programs are designed to create awareness in the community of the needs and abilities of people with disabilities and their families. The community education program helps draw public attention to the needs and aspirations of babies, children and adults with disabilities and their families. It creates greater awareness of their capabilities and of the significant contribution they can make to the life of their community. Unfortunately, not all areas are as lucky as mine. However, in saying this Kurrajong Waratah covers only a portion of southern

        . We need more services and help for society's most vulnerable. I am proud to say my predecessor
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kay_Hull" rel="nofollow">
         Kay Hull

        , who is a wonderful and true humanitarian, is now a director of Kurrajong Waratah and is continuing her dedication and work for the people of the Riverina in that capacity.
       </p>
       <p>
        The economic case for reform for the national disability insurance scheme has been described in terms of the number of people with a disability increasing significantly in the next 20 years, while at the same time the number of people willing and able to provide unpaid care will fall. Government is responsible for funding the difference between the two. The resulting increase in costs has the potential to overwhelm state treasuries. If current growth continues, the amount spent on specialist disability services alone will double in 14 years. A national disability insurance scheme will ensure governments have the ability to meet current and future needs, whatever the economic climate. It will also provide other important economic benefits. As I say, I see it as an investment. By focusing on early intervention and identifying those support services that are most effective and efficient, the scheme will maximise the potential and facilitate greater independence for those who most need it. By providing people with what they need, when they need it the scheme will ensure people with a disability, their families and carers every opportunity to reach their full potential. Providing people with a disability with what they need and when they need it should also reduce the pressure currently experienced by families and able them to more fully participate in work, life and the community. It will also allow them much-needed respite.
       </p>
       <p>
        The scheme could be funded by all taxpayers through general revenue or through Medicare type levy. That will have to be worked out. The modelling needs to be worked out, but as I say the Productivity Commission has said that we can do it. If the commission says we can do it, then surely we can find hopefully through bipartisan support the political will to do it. Funding for essential care, support services, therapy, aids and equipment could then be drawn from this consistent pool of funds. The principal beneficiaries would be those people whose disability has a significant impact on their daily life. Most importantly the scheme would provide support no matter how that disability was acquired. People born with a disability or who acquire a disability through accident, injury or as a result of a medical condition or with a mental illness would all be eligible for assistance. Eligibility for the scheme would be transparent based on careful assessment. A system would be person centred and individualised, based on the choices of the person with a disability and their family. It would focus on early intervention and provide those supports which produce the best long-term outcomes. It would maximise opportunities for participation and productivity. The system would be fair, efficient and equitable.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are difficult issues which must be confronted before the scheme can be introduced, such as eligibility criteria and levels of benefit. The interface between the disability, aged and health care sectors must also be assessed. That is why the productivity commission has been given the responsibility for conducting an inquiry into a national disability long-term care and support scheme, an inquiry which they have found can be managed, can be funded and should be funded by government. The commission was aided in its work by a commissioner with specialist expertise in disability, as well is an independent expert panel. The commission conducted public consultations as part of the inquiry and accepted written submissions. At this point I have to praise the efforts of councillor Anne Napoli at Griffith, who recently held a morning tea to raise awareness of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        . No one in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murrumbidgee_Irrigation_Area" rel="nofollow">
         Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area
        </a>
        has done more to raise the awareness and push the case for an NDIS than Anne Napoli; I commend her everything she has done.
       </p>
       <p>
        A disability could happen to anyone at any time. All Australians deserve the peace of mind which would come with knowing that support will be there if they need it. We all benefit from a more inclusive, more diverse community, and this is why the NDIS scheme is favourable, necessary and an investment in our nation and why organisations such as Kurrajong Waratah need more than ever our ongoing help and funding.
