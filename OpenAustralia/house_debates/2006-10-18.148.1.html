        Carindale Brook and Carindale Court innovative care centres are two aged care facilities within Bonner that constitute Queensland Rehabilitation Services. The centres provide an outstanding level of care to residents, and director Mr Mario Casagrande is committed to offering a wide range of services that cultivate the wellbeing of residents. Mr Casagrande works tirelessly to ensure that a superior standard of care and administration is consistently provided within each centre, and his passion for developing the aged care industry has proved a great asset to Queensland. I commend Mr Casagrande. Furthermore, I believe that both state and federal governments can learn much from the experience and innovation he brings to this industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is commonly known that our ageing population is on the increase, and one of the many implications is the ever-increasing demand for aged care services and facilities. It is important, therefore, that smaller operators, such as Carindale Brook and Carindale Court, be encouraged and assisted to grow so that this increasing demand can be met with quality service. Mr Casagrande is committed to this future growth and planning. Furthermore, he is committed to finding innovative ways for the Australian aged care industry to grow and improve.
       </p>

        In recent months, Carindale Brook has engaged in discussions and visitations with key health professionals within Japan, namely Dr Jitsuhiro Yamada, who is not only Director of Kizawa Memorial Hospital in Minokamo City but also owner of aged care facilities within the Jikeikai Nursing Group. These Japanese facilities are impressively modern, and the level of service offered to residents is second to none. In all aspects of their care, residents are offered and afforded opportunities to live and live well in their older age. Physiotherapists and diversionary therapists, as well as activities-style officers, operate daily and consistently, utilising equipment aimed at keeping residents active, mobile and entertained. Facilities within the Jikeikai Group also offer a day service to elderly and disabled members of the community who are still competent enough to live at home. A mini shuttle bus, owned by the facility, operates to transport these people from their homes to the facilities and is utilised for residents’ day trips and outings. Management are committed to both the ongoing education of staff and the utilisation of the most advanced and efficient equipment and techniques. These are but a few of the examples of the quality of service that Carindale Brook has identified as clearly distinguishing Japanese facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Casagrande has worked closely with an experienced colleague, Mr Russell Darby, in liaising with Dr Yamada and a number of the Japanese health professionals. As a result of these meetings and discussions, an exciting proposal has emerged that could ultimately be of significant benefit to Queensland and, in fact, the Australian aged care industry. This proposal outlines the establishment of an exchange relationship between nurses and management staff within Japan and Australia. Furthermore, it is proposed that Dr Yamada visit Australia in November or December this year with the intention of signing a friendly agreement with Carindale Brook in Bonner. It is hoped that, whilst in Australia, Dr Yamada will be given the opportunity to visit both facilities within the Queensland Rehabilitation Services and personally meet with director Mario Casagrande and the care managers from each facility. Through this personal interaction and assessment it is hoped that Dr Yamada will subsequently enter into a friendly relationship agreement with Carindale Brook. It will be through these friendly relationships and exchange of staff, experience, and industry knowledge that Carindale Brook and Carindale Court centres will further develop innovative ways of caring for our elderly. It is through this transfer of ideas and practical skill that Mr Casagrande believes small operators can grow and offer the quality of service that Australian aged-care residents deserve.
       </p>
       <p>
        This proposal and upcoming agreement has my full support, and I congratulate Mr Casagrande on his vision and commitment to finding ways in which our ageing population can be better cared for. It is my hope that Carindale Brook’s relationship and exchange with Japan will inspire other aged-care facilities to promote similar relations. I believe this is a proposal that should be embraced by government and recognised for the innovation it will most certainly bring to our aged care providers.
