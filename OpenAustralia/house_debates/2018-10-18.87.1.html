        My question is to the Prime Minister. Can the Prime Minister confirm that this week his government has: voted for a white supremacist slogan; damaged relations with Indonesia; leaked secret

        advice; insulted every country in the Pacific; an environment minister who has misled the parliament twice; and open warfare breaking out in the National Party, which has undermined the Deputy Prime Minister? If this is what a Morrison government really looks like, why isn't

         This is what I've been doing for the last eight weeks. I started off with concluding negotiations on the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement in Jakarta. I gave $10 million funding for stage 2 of the Cairns Innovation Centre at
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Cook_University" rel="nofollow">
          James Cook University
         </a>
         . I initiated the

          Royal Commission
         </a>
         into Aged Care Quality and Safety. I announced a coordinated response to drought, which includes hosting the national drought summit at the end of the next week. I went up to Quilpie, in my first visit outside of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         , to hear firsthand about, and to focus on, the drought.

         We have been legislating tougher penalties for fruit contamination; announcing the reduction of red tape for truckies carting hay, so they can get it from one side of the country to the other; announcing a resolution of the non-government school sector, so parents can have choice when it comes to where their children get into education. We started construction of the Western Sydney Airport. We announced further support for strawberry farmers, with $350,000 of assistance. We announced our plan to legislate and, in a more fair and sustainable way, to distribute the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">

         the GST fair share that we always promised to deliver them and are delivering.
        </p>
        <p>
         We provided an additional $5 million package to support our friends and neighbours in Indonesia in response to the Sulawesi tragedy. We announced $75 million to ensure that up in the Townsville they had a fair dinkum port to open up the economic opportunities for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
          North Queensland
         </a>
         . We put $16 million of funding into the Location Incentive Program, putting films on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
          Gold Coast

         , creating jobs for small and medium-sized businesses and family businesses. We fast-tracked tax relief for small and medium-sized and family businesses, which the Labor Party were shamed into supporting. We got that legislated in one weekâ€”in just one week.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have a plan to tackle the farm labour shortages, as I outlined on the weekend and reported to the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Farmers'_Federation" rel="nofollow">
          National Farmers' Federation
         </a>
         , which they have backed today. More than $50 million has been announced to support headspace and its expansion all around the country. That's what I've been up to. I've got no idea what this bubble-obsessed Leader of the Opposition is interested in.
