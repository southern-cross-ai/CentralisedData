        My electorate of Hume is full of bright young sparks. Last year, I presented my second annual
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM" rel="nofollow">
         STEM
        </a>
        awards to recognise the amazing work of local students studying science, technology, engineering and maths. This is a personal way for me to encourage young people to engage with STEM and to expand their critical thinking and problem-solving skills—skills that will be absolutely essential for Australia's future success.
       </p>
       <p>
        The 13 winners were of various ages and studied a range of disciplines. Some wanted to pursue careers in computer science, others in engineering and another was keen to become an app developer. What is especially pleasing is that they were all outstanding STEM mentors to their peers, a point made at the presentations by their teachers. Congratulations to: Ethan Wupper of

        These clever young people are a credit to themselves, their families and their schools. Their outstanding contributions to STEM also speak of the commitment and encouragement of their educators. Several Hume high-school students also recently attended an advanced technology boot camp in Sydney. They included Tiffany Ezzy from Goulburn High and

         If I

        may, I would like to address the base political pointscoring by the member for Chifley in this chamber yesterday. Unlike the member, I do understand how to drive organisational change because, unlike him—he has been a union official and a government relations hack for the duration of his career—I have spent my career building organisations and reforming organisations. My agency is delivering real changes that I know will help my constituents and the people of Australia.

        al Marketplace and important real changes will allow Australians from anywhere to sell their ideas to government. We continue to deliver important reform to key government services like myGov. The streamlining of the login process has delivered excellent results, including a 50 per cent uplift in usage in a month. On STEM support and on digital transformation more broadly, this government is delivering.
