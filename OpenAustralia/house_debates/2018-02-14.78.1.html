        My question's to the Deputy Prime Minister. I refer to the Deputy Prime Minister's answer just now and his February statement advising first home buyers to find a cheaper house in Armidale. Is he aware of a video advertising an Armidale property which says, 'There's a tipping point in your professional life where you reach a level of success, and you go from making ends meet to enjoying the spoils of all your hard work'? Given that it's a matter of public record that the Deputy Prime Minister lives at this exact property rent-free, does the Deputy Prime Minister stand by his February statement? And can he advise—

               The member for McMahon can resume his seat. I heard the last part of the question from there on, and there was a question at the end that he continued to ask once he'd run out of time. He's right: he's asking the Deputy Prime Minister whether he's aware of a video. It's his right to try to ask that question with respect to housing. I'm going to hear from the Leader of the House on the matter.

                  the cost of housing in rural and regional areas. And, while I think your ruling on the previous question is correct, I think on this question the Labor Party is pressing a friendship, as they say, in relation to whether that question is in order. It is not only that the question of whether he's aware of a video is hardly within his responsibilities, but nor was there a question asked about his responsibilities.

                   The difficulty—and the member for Cunningham can resume her seat; we're not going to have a separate conference on the matter. I'm prepared to hear from the Manager of Opposition Business, and I'm prepared to hear from the Leader of the House. We're not going to go into committee on this, for heaven's sake.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                   The Leader of the House makes the point that it's not within the Deputy Prime Minister's responsibilities, and he's completely right. The problem, though, is that the previous question referred to a statement that had been made. And, on reflection, after having ruled that out of order, I thought I should allow it. This is a follow-up question relating to that statement, where the question's asked. It's not up to me to judge a view of the question but just whether it's in order. And I think that part of the question is in order, and of course it's completely within the standing orders in the

                   for the Deputy Prime Minister to answer it in whatever way he sees fit.

                    I thank the honourable member for McMahon for his question. The first attempt at the question was a complete and utter failure, because he forgot to ask a question. The second part wasn't funny and sort of failed towards the end. And the premise of the question is whether I am aware of a video. Well, I think that just about shows you the substantial nature of the shadow Treasurer. That's about where he's got to. That's about where he has landed. That's about where they are with the Australian people. He comes to the despatch box to ask if we're aware of a video.

                   <p>
                    I'll tell you what I am aware of. I am aware of the fact that, under your government, the agricultural portfolio at that time went backwards. I'm aware of the fact that Albo—the member for Grayndler—wants to be the Leader of the Opposition. I am aware of the fact that the member for Maribyrnong, the Leader of the Opposition, is holding on to his job by the skin of his teeth. Talking about guests, I am aware of the fact that the member for Watson stayed with the person who's now staying at Her Majesty's pleasure,

                    , and waited three years to declare it. I'm aware of lots of facts. I'm aware of the fact that you promised—how many surpluses did they promise?

                    Four surpluses, and I'm aware of the fact they delivered none. I'm aware of so many facts when it comes to the Labor Party. The Australian people are aware of so many facts. We're aware of the fact that they have no money on the table for the inland rail. We're aware of the fact that they're going to take money away from the dams program. We're aware of the fact that they're beholden to the

                     The Deputy Prime Minister will resume his seat. When I said the Deputy Prime Minister could answer the question in the way he saw fit, I was a bit loose with my language. I meant with reference to the question on housing.
