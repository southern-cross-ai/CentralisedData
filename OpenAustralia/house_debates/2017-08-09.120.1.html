        </a>
        of the Southern Aboriginal Corporation in Albany, on being selected to participate in the prestigious Global Ambassadors Program in Chicago next month. This program brings together 11 women leaders from all over the world to work with a cohort of established

         US
        </a>
        women executives from a range of sectors and organisations for a week of mentorship. This program aims to address the needs and challenges facing women leaders engaged in the private sector, social enterprise and not-for-profits. It underscores the critical function that women play in moving local economies forward and highlights their role as the drivers of innovation and socioeconomic growth.

       <p>
        Asha is a successful new Australian who continues to make a real contribution to the Indigenous community in the great southern region of my electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O'Connor" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . She's been a role model as a migrant, woman and leader of a major regional

        . Asha came to Australia from India as a skilled mathematics teacher determined to make her mark in her new home. She holds a master's degree and a bachelor's degree in mathematics, business and accounting. She's currently working towards her

        through a Kaplan Business School MBA scholarship. Asha became a permanent resident in 2004 and an Australian citizen in 2006. She moved to Albany with her husband and son in 2008.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since my election in 2013, I have been privileged to be involved in Asha's efforts to achieve better outcomes for the Noongar community in the great southern. As CEO of the Southern Aboriginal Corporation, Asha leads the provision of programs in Indigenous training and employment, family violence prevention, and advocacy and legal support.

        also runs health promotions and an affordable housing program which services over 500 Aboriginal people in the south-west of my electorate. Last month Asha spearheaded a highly successful Aboriginal students careers expo and late last year convened an Aboriginal drugs forum that was opened by the Minister for Indigenous Health, the Hon.

        , at my invitation. Under Asha's leadership, Southern Aboriginal Corporation has received accolades such as the prestigious Albany Chamber of Commerce and Industry Community Business of the Year Award in 2016.
       </p>
       <p>
        Asha's contribution extends way beyond her work for the Southern Aboriginal Corporation. She also sits on many local not-for-profit boards and committees. Currently she is the treasurer of Albany Worklink, vice-president of the Albany Chamber of Commerce and Industry, a board member of WA No Interest Loans and she sits on the regional committee of the Community Housing Industry Association. Her dedication to her community earned her the City of Albany Citizen of the Year award in 2017. Asha could not be more deserving of this opportunity to travel to the US to engage with and learn from other women leaders around the world. She is the sole representative chosen from Australia for this next Global Ambassadors Program. I could not be more proud of her achievements thus far. I look forward to the enhanced skillset that she will be bringing back to O'Connor to continue her valuable contribution to our community. Congratulations, Asha.
