        /Monash into the future comes alive in spring when thousands of people travel to and within the electorate to enjoy the dozens of events that bring jobs, money and employment to our local towns and communities. Many thousands of voluntary hours are given by local people in the planning and preparation in the months leading up to these events. The strength of our regional community shines through during these times. There are events like the Moe Cup, the Pakenham Picnic, Gardivalia in

         We haven't been very successful ever since, I can tell you! Very expensive family operation. Thank you, Bronwyn! The Moe Racing Club was first established in 1890 and held the first race meeting the same year. Moe loves its cup day, and the community supports it by attending the races or shopping locally during the sales events that they have in conjunction. People travel from across Gippsland to enjoy the atmosphere and the hospitality of the Moe township. The Blackshaw family is one of the many names associated with racing in Moe.

         since 1997. The streets of our country towns are often lined with motorcycles taking a break from their long journeys or local residents out watching the parade of many bikes as they head to Phillip Island. 2018 will see the world's best riders return to Phillip Island on 26 and 28 October.

         The Burra Brewing Company is a microbrewery located in the beautiful rolling hills of Korumburra, the gateway to
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Gippsland" rel="nofollow">
          South Gippsland
         </a>
         . The brewery was established in 2017 after years of planning by the owners. Currently Burra Brewing Company owners Narelle Jones and Phill Dempster brought Munich to South Gippsland on a recent Saturday along with pretzel-eating contests when they held the inaugural Oktoberfest in the south Gippsland town of Korumburra. Korumburra is becoming the place to stop on your way to South Gippsland and the Prom Coast, with new businesses like the Burra Brewing Company helping bring visitors and stimulate the local economy.

         The Pakenham Picnic is a three-day event held around food, wine, entertainment and, of course, horseracing at the brand new Pakenham Racing Club in Tynong.
        </p>
        <p>
         Every one of these events brings great activity and enjoyment to our communities and draws people together. I came to this place to bring people together and I will continue to do that.
