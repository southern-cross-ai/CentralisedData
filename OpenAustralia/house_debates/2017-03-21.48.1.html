        My question is to the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment. Will the minister update the House on why affordable and reliable energy is important for successful Australian manufacturing and farm exports? How would alternative approaches jeopardise the prosperity of hardworking Australian exporters and the jobs they create?

         It is interesting. The Leader of the Opposition is critical of us, saying we are focused on 18C, yet every question has been about 18C. But on this side there was another solid question about our national economic plan, about this government's plan to keep boosting economic growth, to keep driving jobs. He asked what it is that we are doing to focus on new export markets. I am very pleased to answer the member for Forde because, unlike that side of the House, he does not have an ideological preoccupation with 18C. He is focused on real-world concerns that we on this side know resonate with Australians—concerns about jobs, about economic growth, about wages and about opening export opportunities. This government's opening of export markets is part of the reason—

           that we continue to see strong growth in exports. We have seen, for example, Australia's largest ever trade surplus, of some $4.7 billion. And our economic plan is translating into more jobs for Australians. The Exporter Sentiment Index revealed that half of Australian exporters are now in a better financial position than 12 months ago. In fact, nearly 50 per cent of exporters are expecting to create more Australian jobs as a result of this government's positive plans with respect to opening export markets. So the contrast is very clear.
          </p>
          <p>
           But the key that underpins the opportunities for our exports is reliable and affordable access to energy. That is what is under threat from Labor Party policies. It is only going to be a coalition government that continues to provide affordable and reliable energy. We have seen some genuine concerns in the business community. For example, the ABC recently reported that the head of the Food and Grocery Council said that 'manufacturers will quit Australia if affordable, reliable energy cannot be guaranteed.' He also said:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           To stop production through a lack of energy is just a disaster.
          </p>
          <p>
           So we know that Labor's policies when it comes to energy are going to be a complete disaster. That is why we have the vision, under this Prime Minister, for nation-building projects like the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowy_Hydro" rel="nofollow">
            Snowy Hydro
           </a>
           2.0. That is because we are about growing opportunities for Australian manufacturers, not closing them off.
          </p>
          <p>
           The fact is that the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Labor_Party" rel="nofollow">
            Australian Labor Party
           </a>
           will say and do anything. On 14 November last year, this guy opposite turned around and said:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           I am not a rampant greenie who thinks there is no place for fossil fuel in our energy mix in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
           But then, two weeks later, on 29 November, he had a Labor-Green stacked committee that says that we should close down all fossil fuel power plants. That is the kind of tossing and turning we see from the Labor Party. As Australians know, this Leader of the Opposition will stand in a ute in his hi-vis vest pretending to celebrate the future of Australian manufacturing, but on Friday he will be sitting on some almond milk crate in the inner city somewhere claiming that he is going to be so proud to see the demise of Australian fossil fuels.
