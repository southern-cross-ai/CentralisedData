       <p>
        Over the last few weeks it has been my absolute privilege to support a number of great local projects which have received support through the government's Stronger Communities Program. This program is delivering great capital support for a number of sporting clubs and other associations in my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Members, players and supporters of the Glenelg Lacrosse Club will greatly benefit from upgrades to lighting at Barratt Reserve at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         West Beach
        </a>
        . I was pleased to be able to provide support under the Stronger Communities Program to help with the lighting upgrade. I would like to thank player and committee member Stephen Mortimer and his team for recently supporting a 'politics in the pub' event with the Prime Minister. Stephen is a regular in the Australian Sharks lacrosse team and has been a pleasure to deal with.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two other clubs I was pleased to support with funding through the Stronger Communities Program are the Edwardstown Bowling Club and the Fulham United Football Club. Both clubs will be upgrading their lighting, which in turn will increase visibility during competition and training. I was very pleased to visit the members from the Edwardstown Bowling Club last week, to drop in and say hello. I was also pleased to donate a disability access ramp to the club, to make access to the bowling greens easier for those who have a disability and elderly competitors.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have also been able to announce or progress funding for a range of other local sporting clubs, including the Plympton sports club and the Seaton cricket and football club. All of these clubs rely on the hard work of volunteers who put in their time to make our communities a far better place. I am very proud to be supporting them with projects which will assist those who participate in the clubs. I will continue to provide that support long into the future and look forward to making more Stronger Communities Program announcements in the future.
