          I thank the member for his question. Let me be clear: every place I have been and everything I have done have been in pursuit of my duties as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence on behalf of this country, and I stand absolutely by every flight I have ever taken on the special-purpose aircraft or, for that matter, any flight I have taken commercially. This issue is being kicked along because of a dodgy spreadsheet which was peddled and developed in the Leader of the Opposition's office.

              The question goes to the use of the special-purpose aircraft, and this is being kicked along because of a spreadsheet which was produced by the Leader of the Opposition's office and which is riddled with errors. The fact is that this is in the public domain because this government released information about the use of the special-purpose aircraft. During the period of time that the now Leader of the Opposition was then Minister for Defence, absolutely no information was released about the use of the special-purpose aircraft during the time that he was the Minister for Defenceâ€”not one piece of information at all. It begs the question as to what the Leader of the Opposition has to hide. But we have something of an inkling in relation to that by virtue of his behaviour since he has been the Leader of the Opposition because, as the now Minister for Defence, my office has logged numerous requests from the Leader of the Opposition about him going on special-purpose aircraftâ€”including, in the last six weeks, two times at least, in writing, to go to a game of the Matildas.

                 <p>
                  It is just a little revealing of what hurts them the most about the fact that they are now in opposition. As sincere public servants we might think they regret the fact that they don't have the opportunity to serve the Australian people, but we know in their darkened rooms the only conversation they're having is about how they get back on the planes. If the requests from the Leader of the Opposition to my office are any indication, it has been their singular focus. The special-purpose aircraft are an important capability which facilitate government travel. We use it appropriately. Those opposite know it. Their attempt to politicise it is pathetic, but worse it reeks of hypocrisy.
