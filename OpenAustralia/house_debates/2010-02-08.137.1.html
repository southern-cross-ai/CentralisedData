         Australia Day
        </a>
        this year I had the pleasure of attending several Australia Day ceremonies in my electorate of Lowe hosted by the local councils. Sydney turned on a beautiful sunny day to welcome hundreds of new Australian citizens as they took the pledge. Surrounded by family and friends, the spirit of community was reflected in the large crowds that gathered in the local parks. On Australia Day we welcome new citizens and recognise citizens who give back to our community through their extraordinary talents, volunteer efforts and participation in local life.

Mr Williams has been the chairman of the appeal for 25 years and is a proud sponsor of local charity, Communities for Communities, which recently reached its $1 million fundraising target this year.

        I take this opportunity to congratulate all of the Australia Day 2010 award recipients and offer a warm welcome to our new Australian citizens. I know that in my electorate of Lowe we are fortunate to have so many wonderful community members who contribute their talents and resources to make our electorate the fantastic place it is to live in, and I encourage all of my constituents to participate in 2010.
