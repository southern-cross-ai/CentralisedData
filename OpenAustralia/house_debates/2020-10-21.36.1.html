       <p>
        Today I want to honour the work of Gary Mangan who is retiring as the manager of the Galston and district branch of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bendigo_Bank" rel="nofollow">
         Bendigo Bank
        </a>
        . Gary Mangan joined the Galston branch having had a successful career in banking and also being self-employed in the finance industry. Gary believes in the model of the community bank, community banks being governed by a board of local people so that 50 per cent of their profits are returned to the community. Gary's warmth and enthusiasm is infectious and it was immediately evident how much he cared for the Galston community. He is known for his realistic advice, whether it's to school levers or retirees.

        During his tenure, he saw over a million dollars returned to the community through projects and sponsorship. He was awarded the

        fellowship by the

        </a>
        of Dural and the pride of workmanship award for Galston Rotary for his efforts and contribution to the community. Gary has been instrumental in getting community groups to work together, organising free community events, such as women in business and aged-care seminars. He has also driven the

        program, with the former Australian Socceroo captain, delivering life skills programs to local schools and carols for the community where he played the popular role of Santa. Gary's retirement is a very sad loss for the Galston community and the Bendigo Bank. However, Gary should be proud of the enormous contribution he has made to our community and the great deal of affection that so many people in the community hold him in. I wish Gary, his wife and his family all the best for a long, healthy and happy retirement.
