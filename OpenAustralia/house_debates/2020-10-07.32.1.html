        I rise today to pay tribute to two outstanding Western Australians who passed away this year, Mr Terry

        AO. The contributions and service of both men to their professions and to our society more broadly mean that their impact extends far beyond the time and place in which they lived. I was fortunate to know both men through the

         University of Notre Dame Australia
        </a>
        , a university which both men were instrumental in creating and developing. Both men served for years on the governing boards, including at times as chancellor, and both gave so much to the institution without ever asking for anything in return.

        Mr O'Connor, who died in April, was a barrister by profession, a fearless fighter for the things he believed in and a supporter of many causes and organisations. He left behind his wife, Annabel; his children, Dimity and Simon, and their partners; and his five grandchildren. Dr Michael Quinlan, who passed away last weekend, was a physician who healed and saved many lives throughout his professional career. He was a giant of the medical profession who also gave service to numerous organisations in WA. Michael leaves behind his wife, Carole; his children, Tim, Peter, Anthony, Annabelle and Gaby, and their partners; and his 14 grandchildren. They were both exceptional men of integrity, love, faith and compassion. They loved and served God, their families and their neighbours, and they were much loved in return. May they rest in peace.
