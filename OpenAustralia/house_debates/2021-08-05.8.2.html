       <p>
        The Department of Defence is proposing a project to deliver essential upgrades to facilities and infrastructure at four existing Defence training areas in the Northern Territory to ensure that the

         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        has reliable access to suitable military training areas and weapons ranges to meet military capability. This investment supports implementation of the 2020 Force Structure Plan initiative for enhancements to Defence training areas and facilities. The proposed works will also enhance the level of interoperability between the Australian Defence Force and our allies, including with the United States military force through expanded cooperation and increased opportunities for combined training and exercises. The total estimated capital delivery cost of the project is $474 million, excluding
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . The project was referred to the Public Works Committee on 12 May 2021. The committee has now recommended that the House of Representatives resolve, pursuant to section 18 (7) of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, that it is expedient to carry out the project. Subject to parliamentary approval, the construction works are expected to be commence in late 2021 and be completed by mid-2026. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for undertaking a timely inquiry, and I commend the motion to the House.
