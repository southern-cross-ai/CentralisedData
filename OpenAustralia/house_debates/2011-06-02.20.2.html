       <p>
        There are two reasons for my amendment. The first is that we need a broad inquiry into the state of detention in Australia, and that needs to be an inquiry that focuses on the causes, not just the symptoms. To focus only on the riots would be to focus on the symptoms, where people who have been locked up indefinitely for a long period of time are expressing their frustration. What we need to examine is why it is that mandatory detention has failed. Secondly, it ought to be a joint committee. The terms of the amendment I have moved allow for participation of senators as well. It is my strong hope that a real inquiry into mandatory detention in Australia, participated in by members of both houses of parliament, might start to put Australia on the path to a more humane immigration future.

            We support this amendment. This is a government which is more than happy to have transparency when it comes to our immigration policy. That is why we have answered 800 questions on notice from the Senate estimates processâ€”more than any other portfolio. That is why we have instigated inquiries into disturbances in our detention centres.

                 We seek this further amendment to the motion to ensure that it includes the full breadth of all the matters that need to be addressed as part of this very important inquiry, an inquiry that just a week or so ago the minister liked to call a stunt but I understand today will now support. I appreciate the support of the crossbenchers and I appreciate the support of the Greens in the productive discussions we have had, because this is a detention system in which there is an average of more than three critical incidents occurring in a detention network every single day. I think it is important that this House has not sought to muzzle those who want to ask questions about this matter. I know the crossbenchers want to ask questions, I know the Greens want to ask serious questions and the opposition certainly wants to ask serious questions. I look forward to this motion also being supported in the other place, which will enable these matters to be addressed by both houses of this parliament in what has become a rolling crisis in our detention network under this government.
