        This government loves picking winners in the aviation sector. It's showered generous untied grants on some airlines but given no support at all to Virgin Australia. It's shown indifference to thousands of aviation sector workers in firms like dnata who have been totally excluded from JobKeeper. These are workers who provide crucial ground-handling, cargo and catering services and keep Australia flying. They live here, they pay tax here and they raise their families here. But the government is denying them help when they need it most. With its mammoth $60 billion budget mistake and the revelation that JobKeeper will be provided to three million fewer workers than it had claimed, the government cannot continue to deny the 5,500 employees of dnata these benefits. These workers not only have been denied JobKeeper benefits but are now being subjected to mutual obligation requirements that are being phased in from 9 June. They are being forced to apply for jobs when their industry is on its knees.

        I was proud to stand with aviation workers from across my electorate of Fraser at

        members from right across Australia who have travelled to Canberra today to make their voice heard while maintaining safe social distancing. Our entire aviation sector will be critical in supporting the broader economy as it recovers from COVID. The Treasurer has the power to listen and act. He must support JobKeeper and extend it to aviation workers.
