        proposes the development of a 19.6 hectare site at Fairview Rise in Ipswich, Queensland to provide some 162 serviced residential allotments for construction of Defence housing at an estimated cost of $50.7 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Fairview Rise site is eight kilometres east of

        The proposed development would involve the construction of at least 162 new residences over the next three years, primarily intended for use by

       <p>
        In its report, the Public Works Committee recommended that these works proceed subject to the recommendations of the committee.

       <p>
        The Defence Housing Authority accepts and will implement those recommendations.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subject to parliamentary approval, the project will be undertaken in a number of stages.
       </p>
       <p>
        Phase 1 civil works will be undertaken over a period from August 2006 to April 2007 with phase 2 civil works being undertaken over a period from March 2007 to November 2007. Construction of houses will commence in April 2007 with completion scheduled for June 2009.

        , Melbourne, Vic.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) proposes to undertake a refit of new leased premises at 120 Collins Street, Melbourne, Victoria at a cost of $9.85 million, which includes $6.9 million for fit-out and $2.95 million for infrastructure and security.
       </p>
       <p>
        The proposed fit-out of 8,000 square metres over seven floors, together with a ground floor service centre facility, will create an efficient, flexible and contemporary working environment that will meet the requirements of ASIC now and in the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that the proposed works should proceed. The committee has noted that the $6.5 million lease incentive will be used to offset the cost of the fit-out.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subject to parliamentary approval, the fit-out procurement process could begin this month.
