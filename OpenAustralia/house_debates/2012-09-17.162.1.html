        When Neil Armstrong took that one small step onto the moon, a flame of wonder was set alight for a generation.

        missions ignited a curiosity for science amongst kids that lasted through the seventies and well into my early childhood. It is a curiosity which, for me, underpinned my own education in science.

        I still get a thrill seeing the way science directs our human potential to places that are both surprising and magnificent. And so it will be a great pleasure later today, with my colleague

        , to launch the Parliamentary Friends of Science. Our aim is to strengthen links between the scientific community and parliamentarians and increase engagement between the two. And we are certain other parliamentarians will discover their own fascination for science, when Australia's Nobel Laureate for physics, Professor Brian Schmidt, explains some of the mysteries of the stars to us on the roof of this building tonight.

       <p>
        I think we all understand the importance of science—in theory—but many people continue to see science as something separate to everyday life and that is a worry, especially when children have this attitude. We need kids to see science as relevant to them and their futures. Australia needs more people studying engineering, agricultural science, physics, maths and chemistry.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Geelong, where science and research are growing industries, we need these skills for our workforce of the future. That is why it was fantastic last week to visit Geelong's specialist science and maths centre, BioLAB. This centre is leading the way in science and maths education, bringing subjects to life in a way that will hopefully encourage kids to see a career path ahead in science. From late primary through to secondary school, students attending BioLAB are using analytical chemistry to better understand how their body works, and learning how research in materials technology is improving performance on the sports field. They are using maths skills to calculate their own milestones on the running track, or while playing footy or netball.
       </p>
       <p>
        With a big focus on relationships with industry, BioLAB is taking teaching beyond what is possible in the classroom. An exciting initiative is the developing partnership with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geelong_Football_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Geelong Football Club
        </a>
        , which will see students experiencing their favourite football club in a completely unique way, by learning the science and maths behind each footballer's performance and success. Since its launch nearly a year ago, 5,000 students from across Victoria have experienced BioLAB, including many from disadvantaged and rural schools.

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deakin_University" rel="nofollow">

        is BioLAB's lead partner, and science undergraduates are helping mentor students in the lab and out in the field. There are few places in Australia that can match BioLAB in the scope of its teaching, especially its outreach programs to rural and regional areas. And that for me is what science is all about—making the improbable possible. It is a great lesson to learn.
