        Hind Rajab was six years old when she had to make an unimaginable call for help. She was trapped in a car with her dead relatives in Gaza city. 'I'm so scared,' she said on the phone. 'Please come.' The Red Crescent Society stayed on the phone with her for three hours as they implored Israeli authorities to grant them safe passage to rescue her. An ambulance raced to rescue Hind, but, when the paramedics arrived, they reported being targeted with laser lights from Israeli forces. Then there was gunfire, then silence. Twelve days later, Hind and the paramedics who'd tried to save her were found dead. How can this go on?
