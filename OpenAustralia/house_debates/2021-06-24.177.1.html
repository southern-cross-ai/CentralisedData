        There comes a time when you have to say goodbye to friends and you lose them, and some of these times are harder than others. Ivy Roberson was one of those people. I remember getting a text message saying that she had passed and slapping the table when I heard that news, because we had had no concept or inkling that she was suffering from cancer as much as she was, because she was stoic and kept those things to herself. Today in the House, I want to commend and thank her for her dedication to our community. She was well known and respected in Chifley. She had 25 years of dedication in areas such as the Community Work Field Office and as an officer with juvenile justice in

        , working with at-risk youth. She volunteered with

        police and as a consumer representative at

        . She was a founding member and president of the Whalan Community Action Group, which organised so much to help people, particularly older people, in our community and lobbied so hard to get a courthouse in Mount Druitt. She was the lead coordinator of the Whalan May fair and a volunteer in the Mount Druitt community solutions program. For her volunteer work in the Whalan community, she was named the 2009

        Citizen of the Year. I knew her for many years, and I know she will be sorely missed. I think her daughter Lianne Sheriden described her mum perfectly when she said, 'She was strong-willed, opinionated and persistent,' and described her as having great enthusiasm for her volunteer work. She leaves behind five children, nine grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren, and her legacy will not be forgotten. Vale Ivy.

        I also want to speak on Glendenning local Brett
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McMillan" rel="nofollow">
         McMillan
        </a>
        , who, sadly, passed away on 4 June. He was a passionate member of the Plumpton-Glendenning Cricket Club for over 20 years, having joined when his daughter started playing for them, which partly began his love of cricket. He went on to become secretary and a life member for 15 years, and he was a member of the Blacktown City and District Cricket Association. He was also an umpire for the New South Wales Cricket Umpires and Scorers Association for 30 years, and oversaw nearly 300 matches. His contribution will also be sorely missed. He's survived by his wife, Carol; his daughter, Wendy; his son, Nathan; and his father, Ron. My condolences go to his entire family. I pay my respects to Brett McMillan.

        In the remaining time, I want to acknowledge
