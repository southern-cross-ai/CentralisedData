         I thank the member for Chifley for his question and I know he is deeply interested in literacy and numeracy in his local schools. As I had the opportunity to advise the House last week, this week is National Literacy and Numeracy Week. It was with great pleasure last week that the Prime Minister and I announced an additional more than $40 million investment in literacy and numeracy pilot programs around the country so we can make sure that we understand what the best of evidence is for the teaching to children of literacy and numeracy.
        </p>
        <p>
         This $40 million worth of pilots in 29 schools is a down payment on a $577 million program for all schools to assist with literacy and numeracy development.

          I hear the opposition calling out about past government programs, but this is an investment of more than half a billion dollars in literacy and numeracy. Of course, Literacy and Numeracy Week is not just for children in schools. It is for all Australians, and Australian adults can win prizes by answering the question: what are you reading today? I am very happy to answer the question: what am I reading today? Because today I had the great pleasure of going to
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chapman_Primary_School" rel="nofollow">
           Chapman Primary School

           ACT
          </a>
          to read to the grade 4 students a children’s book called
          <i>
           Little Beauty
          </i>
          , which is the tale of a gorilla and cat that, despite their differences, learn to live together and to strike up a friendship that endures during troubled times. It is a lesson in life, and I am more than happy to make copies of it available to members of the Liberal Party if they think that they would learn something from it.
         </p>
         <p>
          But of course it is a little bit disappointing that we have not had answers from those opposite about what they are reading today. I am particularly distressed that the member for Higgins, who has such interest in literacy and numeracy, is not here to answer the question: what is he reading today?

           Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The government seems to make a habit of these disparaging comments about people who have leave. The member for Higgins has leave quite appropriately, and I think it is quite inappropriate for the government to keep taking cheap shots.

             Thank you, Mr Speaker. I am sure the loyalty of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to the member for Higgins will be noted. But it would be nice if the member for Higgins were here to answer the question: is he reading today ‘The complete idiot’s guide to getting the job you want’? That is one possibility.

                    Mr Speaker, on a further point of order. I ask that that comment be withdrawn. I can tell you that I would not take the risk of visiting her house.

                     If the Deputy Prime Minister said something that was offensive to the member for O’Connor it should be withdrawn and the Deputy Prime Minister should then go to the conclusion of her answer.
