        by leave—On 12 June 2009 in a joint media release with the foreign minister, the Hon. Stephen Smith MP, I announced that Australia has strengthened its commitment to international efforts to combat piracy off the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horn_of_Africa" rel="nofollow">
         Horn of Africa
        </a>
        . Australia will provide $500,000, as well as skills and expertise, to the joint

         European Commission

        ) Counter Piracy Program to assist Kenyan authorities in receiving and processing apprehended piracy suspects.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia will provide an official through the Office of the Inspector of Transport Security and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Federal Police
        </a>
        to work with the UNODC in the Nairobi office in Kenya on dealing with piracy in the region. The international community, and particularly the UNODC, recognises that, if an effective deterrent is to be created in the prosecution of suspected pirates, there needs to be a capacity for the legal processing to occur within the north-east African region. The official will work with local authorities in Kenya in dealing with apprehended piracy suspects.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is one of a range of measures undertaken by the Australian government to combat the growing international problem of piracy.

        figures show that more than 100 ships were attacked and 42 hijacked in the

         Gulf of Aden
        </a>
        and the Somalia region in 2008. There have been around 60 attacks and 25 successful hijackings this year. Piracy is an issue that impacts on the entire international community, as the attack on the Italian cruise ship

        in April demonstrated. With over 1,500 passengers and crew, including 74 Australians, the
        <i>
         Melody
        </i>
        was attacked by pirates in a speedboat at least 600 miles from the Somali coast—a practical demonstration that this issue is a global one that affects every country.
       </p>
       <p>
        The threat of piracy needs to be taken seriously, especially by countries such as Australia, which relies almost exclusively on international shipping for our exports and imports. With 99 percent of our exports by volume being transported by sea, a safe and secure maritime industry is paramount—to our economy, to our maritime industry and to the safety of many Australians who travel through international waters each year.
       </p>
       <p>
        In May this year, the government announced that Australia would contribute
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        resources to international anti-piracy efforts off the Horn of Africa. Our contribution includes the tasking of our Navy Anzac-class frigate and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAAF" rel="nofollow">
         RAAF

         AP
        </a>
        -3C Orion patrol aircraft, which are already contributing to counterterrorism activities in the region. Flexible employment of our assets across several coalition task forces allows the ADF to contribute in an agile way to the highest priority activity. It is broadly recognised that the best long-term solution to the problem of piracy is to restore peace and stability in the Horn of Africa.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the international conference on Somalia in Brussels on 22-23 April this year, the government committed $2 million in security and humanitarian assistance to support international efforts to restore peace to Somalia.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         The United Nations
        </a>
        estimates that over half the population of Somalia is in need of humanitarian assistance and that one in six Somali children under five is acutely malnourished.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia will contribute $1.5 million to the United Nations Humanitarian Appeal, which will go towards security protection for humanitarian workers in Somalia to support vital health services for women and children, and $500,000 to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_Union_Mission_in_Somalia" rel="nofollow">
         African Union Mission in Somalia
        </a>
        which is aiming to help Somalia’s transitional government stabilise the country through strengthening financial systems and further medical assistance. Since 2005-06, the Australian government has contributed $9 million of humanitarian assistance to Somalia and assistance has also been provided to neighbouring countries dealing with Somalian refugees.
       </p>
       <p>
        In December 2008, the Office of Transport Security issued Maritime Security Notice (2/08) on ‘Security Regulated Australian Ships: Protective security arrangements for transiting through high risk shipping lanes’ to Australian shipowners in response to the increase in acts of piracy and armed robbery in shipping lanes and waters surrounding the Gulf of Aden and the Somali coast. The notice emphasised the importance for regulated Australian ships to apply robust and layered protective security measures when transiting through shipping lanes in high-risk locations.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian Maritime Safety Authority Marine Notice (10/2009) on ‘Piracy and armed robbery against ships in the Somali Basin and the Western
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean" rel="nofollow">
         Indian Ocean
        </a>
        ’ of June 2009 advises the Australian shipping industry to implement
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Maritime_Organisation" rel="nofollow">
         International Maritime Organisation
        </a>
        preventative measures to deter and suppress acts of piracy and armed robbery against ships.
       </p>
       <p>
        In February 2009, I asked the Inspector of Transport Security, Mr Mick Palmer, a former head of the Australian Federal Police, to undertake a comprehensive inquiry into maritime piracy and armed robbery at sea as it affects Australia. Mr Palmer is investigating the impact of piracy and armed robbery at sea on Australian registered and international trading ships and on Australian maritime trade more generally. The Australian government want to make sure that we have an appropriate security framework to deal with these threats.
       </p>
       <p>
        As part of the inquiry process, the inspector and key members of his team have liaised with a range of senior stakeholders, including the UNODC, Interpol, International Maritime Organisation, International Maritime Bureau as well as military, industry and diplomatic stakeholders to ensure that his inquiry complements wider international efforts.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was a result of the conduct of his inquiry that the opportunity for Australia to make a contribution to the UNODC Counter Piracy Program came to light. The inquiry will assist the Australian government in determining whether any changes are required to our domestic security framework. Mr Palmer is due to report in the second half of 2009.
       </p>

        Within our own region, the Malacca straits has for many years been a focus for pirate and criminal activities. This narrow strait contains thousands of islets, and is an outlet for many rivers, making it an ideal location for pirates to hide and evade capture. It is an important passageway between China and India and is on the route between Europe, the

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persian_Gulf" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hong_Kong" rel="nofollow">
         Hong Kong
        </a>
        , Taiwan, Pusan and Tokyo. Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand have formed the Malacca Straits Security Joint Working Group in response to the problem. This issue was discussed at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APEC" rel="nofollow">
         APEC
        </a>
        meeting of transport ministers that I attended in Manila, the Philippines, two months ago. Under the initiative, the maritime forces of the four countries coordinate sea patrols of the area. Overall, there has been a significant reduction in attacks in this important maritime area.
       </p>
       <p>
        In conclusion, the Palmer inquiry, the ADF commitment to anti-piracy efforts and the contribution of financial support and skills and expertise to the UNODC demonstrate Australia’s commitment to work with effective international forums such as the International Maritime Organisation and the United Nations to deal with the threat of international piracy off the Horn of Africa.
       </p>
       <p>
        I met with the head of the International Maritime Organisation, Admiral Mitropoulos, at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMO" rel="nofollow">
         IMO
        </a>
        headquarters in London on 1 April this year. At that meeting, he made a request for Australia’s direct participation in these activities. I am pleased that the government have been able to deliver in these small but important measures to make sure that, once again, we are taking our place as good international citizens when it comes to international maritime issues.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to acknowledge the presence in the parliament today of the Minister for Foreign Affairs for Kenya, Moses Wetang’ula, and the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Co-operation of the

        , Mrs Rosemary Museminali. Both of these ministers have expressed their support and gratitude for Australia making this commitment.
       </p>
       <p>
        This threat of piracy directly affects the lives of Australians travelling through this region and our economic interests that are reliant on the safety and security of international shipping.

        <p>
         This ministerial statement from the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
          Local Government
         </a>
         is fundamentally just a repeat of a press release made on 12 June. The minister’s leaving the chamber demonstrates that he is also not too interested in any kind of response to his statement and is, therefore, taking a further step in devaluing the importance of ministerial statements to the chamber. This is statement is about a grant of $500,000. Many important things happen in the parliament and many important things happen in our country, and it is appropriate that there be ministerial statements to deal with these issues; but, when the minister does not even think it is necessary to remain in the chamber to listen to the reply to his statement, it is quite clear that he does not give this matter very high priority.
        </p>
        <p>
         That is disappointing because the issue of piracy on the high seas is an important issue. Whether this government’s contribution will make a significant difference to the level of piracy around the world remains to be seen, but the issue of piracy itself is an important one and deserving of parliamentary debating time. It is a dangerous threat to global maritime security. It threatens the livelihood of ship-born commerce, which is the backbone of world trade. The overwhelming majority, by volume, of Australia’s trade is carried by ships and, therefore, it is important to us as a nation that shipping trade be safe and secure. The risk of piracy means that ships are sometimes forced to take longer routes around dangerous zones and certainly slows down the delivery and reliability of delivery of sea carried goods.
        </p>
        <p>
         The activities of pirates in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_of_Aden" rel="nofollow">
          Gulf of Aden
         </a>
         are of considerable concern threatening, as they do, Australia’s merchant trade and threatening Australian sailors and tourists passing through the gulf and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Canal" rel="nofollow">
          Suez Canal
         </a>
         . The Suez Canal is, of course, an important funnel for international trade. A very large proportion of maritime traffic moves through that canal and therefore ships moving up the Gulf of Aden are particularly vulnerable to attack from pirates. It is perhaps a commentary on the audacity of some of the piracy activity that is occurring at the present time that it is happening under the nose of a considerable naval presence and despite the fact that the presence of these pirates from Somalia is well known to the maritime community. The very presence of these pirates, particularly those coming from some of the countries in Africa where there is an acute shortage of food and other supplies, is a particular irony because the pirate activities threaten the delivery of food and aid to some of the poorest countries in Africa. This was illustrated with the seizure of the
         <i>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maersk_Alabama" rel="nofollow">
           Maersk Alabama
          </a>
         </i>
         in April this year. That ship was carrying 5,000 metric tonnes of relief supplies for Somalia, Kenya and Uganda. Those who felt that intercepting this trade was in some way acceptable behaviour were not thinking of the impact on their fellow citizens in Somalia and other impoverished people in Kenya and Uganda.
        </p>
        <p>
         I understand that Somali pirates received over
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/US" rel="nofollow">
          US
         </a>
         $150 million in ransom in the 12 months prior to November 2008. Pirates operating from Somalia have attacked more than 100 vessels in waters off the African coast in the past year, including cruise liners, a fully laden supertanker and a ship laden with Russian tanks. As the minister pointed out, much is already being done by the international community to address this scourge. According to public reports, the European Union has a task force of six warships and three surveillance aircraft from eight countries patrolling one million square kilometres of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Ocean" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         -3C Orion maritime aircraft is a welcome contribution to this international effort. This effort will have to continue, as the success of the international task force is driving the activities of the pirates further south, increasing the threat to sea lanes and expanding the area of ocean that will need to be patrolled.
        </p>
        <p>
         A policy of effective interdiction provided by a substantial and robust international naval presence in the waters east of Africa is an essential part of the strategy to deal with the threat of Somali based piracy. This is a plus. It will require a concerted effort to rebuild the shattered national institutions of Somalia if there is to be a long-term solution. Unfortunately, this hastily cobbled together effort from the government in dealing with this complex problem raises more questions than it answers. The ministerial statement provides very little additional information on what this money is going to be spent on, where it is coming from and what the objectives of this assistance actually are. We are told it is going to provide $500,000, as well as skills and expertise, to the joint
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission" rel="nofollow">

         in the Nairobi office in Kenya dealing with piracy in the region. We are not provided with any information as to how this money is going to be spent beyond that it is going to provide some kind of judicial support for Kenyan authorities. The minister has not explained how this money will reduce the threat of piracy. Likewise, we do not know what the Australian government official will do. The government has not even made it clear where the official will come from, whether from the Office of the Inspector of Transport Security or from the Australian Federal Police. The details are not there.
        </p>
        <p>
         Frankly, this statement has all the hallmarks of another piece of spin supporting the Prime Minister’s ego driven bid for a temporary seat on the

         and distracting the government from its requirement to advance and protect the interest of Australians overseas. It is not even clear from the minister’s statement whether the funding for this announcement is going to come from his own department, the

         I would be concerned, in light of all the cutbacks that have occurred in the department of regional development under the auspices of the current minister, if in fact grants were now going to be provided to Kenya to deal with Somali pirates, rather than to provide assistance to Australian regional communities for which this minister and this department should take primary responsibility. It would be a disappointment, at this time when he is cutting back road funding and other expenditure for the regions, if in fact funding were going to be provided towards an antipiracy program in Somalia. That does not mean that we should not be involved in seeking to combat piracy in Somalia. But, clearly, the funding provided should come from the foreign aid budget or under the activities of Defence, who can play a useful role in helping to protect shipping, Australian and international, in that area. Also, the minister made some reference to the working group on piracy in the Malacca straits, a very worthwhile initiative initiated and undertaken during the term of the previous government. I am pleased that the current minister is continuing to ensure that Australia devotes resources to and takes a keen interest in its activities. That area is a particularly important waterway for Australian shipping. A very large proportion of our trade passes through the straits and in dealing with piracy issues we should be concentrating, as a priority, on ensuring that they remain safe.
