        I rise to acknowledge Hannah Venn-Brown of Springfield for her 21 years of service at Services Australia supporting all employees, particularly those of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTQ" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HR" rel="nofollow">
         HR
        </a>
        professional in the department and manages its HR strategy team. Hannah is also the co-chair of the agency's Rainbow Roundtable and is a proud ally, helping foster inclusive work environments that are supportive of everyone. Hannah is a passionate leader who recently spoke at the 2024 Public Sector LGBTQIA+ Leadership and Allyship Summit and has also featured in the 2023

        . More recently, Hannah was nominated as a finalist in the 2024 Australian LGBTQ+ Inclusion Awards where she was in the running for the Sally Webster Ally Award. This award recognises the outstanding contribution of an individual who has made significant contributions to workplace inclusion as an active ally and supporter of LGBTQIA+ people and employees.

        LGBTQIA+ Australians continue to navigate discrimination in the workplace and in the community. Data from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Human_Rights_Commission" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Human Rights Commission
        </a>
        records that six in 10 LGBTQIA+ Australians experience verbal homophobic abuse and two in 10 experience physical homophobic abuse. In the workplace, 42 per cent do not feel like they can be transparent about who they are. These factors culminate in the community being at three times greater risk of depression. As a medical professional, I see firsthand the effects of discrimination and the impacts that they have on individuals. Allies like Hannah help create welcoming environments and a more inclusive society, which reduces the prevalence of discrimination and fosters a harmonious environment. I commend Hannah on her allyship and dedication to supporting the LGBTQIA+ community, the members at Service Australia and people right across the

        .

        Hannah, it was an absolute pleasure meeting you and learning about the work that you do at Services Australia and throughout our community on the Central Coast. Thank you for enriching our community and for always showing love for everyone no matter their background and no matter their circumstances. As the federal member for Robertson, I will always call out discrimination and hate in our community. I want my community to know that my office is a safe space for anyone and everyone. We welcome anyone and everyone, and my team will happily assist with matters. Again, to Hannah Venn-Brown, thank you for all the work that you continue to do as part of Services Australia and for all the amazing and inclusive support you provide to the LGBTQIA+ community members right across the Central Coast.
