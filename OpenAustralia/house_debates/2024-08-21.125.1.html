        Volunteers are the backbone of all the communities represented here in this place. They keep our community organisations running, our sporting clubs functional, our museums and attractions open and our most vulnerable cared for. One of the most inspiring parts of my time as a member of this place has been to see the enormous and impactful work that is done across my electorate of Bean by volunteers from all walks of life. Nearly every year, I have the privilege to represent the people of Bean in this place. There has been a round of grants targeted at community volunteers. The volunteer grants, offered through the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Social Services
        </a>
        , offer assistance of up to $5,000 to eligible groups for practical assistance to further enable their good work. I've been able to assist many groups across the electorate to access these grants.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to take a moment to acknowledge some recent recipients and celebrate the great work they do for our community: the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        Careers Association, who promote career development opportunities across the ACT; the Australia Nepal Friendship Society, who just recently had their 30th birthday and who aim to celebrate Nepali heritage in Australia and the friendship between the two nations; the

         Australian Breastfeeding Association
        </a>
        of Canberra, who will use the grant to fund education, including through offering Certificate

        </a>
        in Breastfeeding Education to their volunteers; Bosom Buddies ACT, who provide services to Canberrans dealing with breast cancer; Gilmore Church, a Pentecostal community who serve the Tuggeranong area, working closely with our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         First Nations
        </a>
        communities; Good Shepherd Community Church, who act out their faith through community service, maintaining foodbanks and running a weekly dinner service that combines fellowship focused worship with a warm meal; Menslink, who provide and deliver mentoring and peer support for young men in Bean and across Canberra; the Multicultural Association of Canberra, who promote understanding and appreciation of diverse cultures across the ACT community; the Namadgi School P&amp;C, who facilitate, like so many P&amp;Cs, parent participation at the school and promote engagement throughout the school community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge: Parentline ACT, who support parents across Canberra and provide free and confidential counselling services to parents and carers, along with parenting courses and many other resources; the Perinatal Wellbeing Centre, who provide holistic and mental health support to over 300 local families at vital times in their lives; the Tidbinbilla Pioneers Association, who do an extraordinary job preserving and sharing the stories of the settlers of the beautiful Tidbinbilla valley, in my electorate; the

         Weston Creek
        </a>
        Men's Shed, who support the mental and physical wellbeing of men in Weston Creek, highlighting the importance of community and mateship here in Canberra, and who particularly supported sheds that were recovering on the

         South Coast
        </a>
        after the bushfires; and the Yeddung Mura Aboriginal Corporation, who do important work supporting people recently released from prison as they reintegrate into their communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to acknowledge our great southside sports clubs who also received grant funding: the ACT Eagles Baseball Club, the Torrens Tennis Club, the Tuggeranong Valley Australian Football Netball Club, the Tuggeranong Bushrangers Rugby League Football Club, the Weston Creek Molonglo Cricket Club, Pickleball ACT—who are doing great work promoting one of the fastest growing sports in the Canberra region, which I'm almost capable of playing effectively—and the Xtreme Stars dance troupe.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to close by recognising the dedication and ongoing hard work of the Minister for Social Services, the member for Kingston. I know how committed she is to supporting the work of volunteers, and I would like to thank her for that support.
       </p>
       <p>
        Briefly, before I sit, I'd like to take some time to recognise Maeve Jack, who started in my office 12 months ago and had her final day today. Maeve's dream wasn't to work in my office, even though that's hard to believe! Her dream was to work in curatorial services. She is going to a much better place and commences work with
