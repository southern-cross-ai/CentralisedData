        On Sunday, 10 August I was honoured to attend the centenary of the blessing and first mass at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Brigid's" rel="nofollow">
         Saint Brigid's
        </a>

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Red Hill
        </a>
        in my electorate of Brisbane. The service was conducted by Archbishop the Most Reverend Mark Coleridge. It was attended by the Queensland Governor, His Excellency the Hon. Paul de Jersey

        ; parish priests Father Peter Brannelly, Father Stanley Orji and Father James O'Donoghue; Deacon Peter Devenish-Meares; Mr Norm Shrubsole, chair of the parish pastoral council; Ms Kerrianne Meulman, chair of the parish finance council; and a huge number of community members.

         Saint Brigid's Church
        </a>
        was completed in 1914 with the help of fundraising from parishioners. At one point Saint Brigid's had grown to be one of the largest parishes in Brisbane and was able to hold a congregation of up to 1,000 people. In reporting on the opening of Saint Brigid's 100 years ago, the Brisbane
        <i>
         Courier
        </i>
        said the blessing and dedication of the new Saint Brigid's Catholic Church at Red Hill was 'the most important ceremony that had taken place in Catholic circles in Brisbane since the opening of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Stephen's_Cathedral" rel="nofollow">
         Saint Stephen's Cathedral
        </a>
        about 40 years ago'. And, ever since, people from all over the world have been astonished by its awe-inspiring architecture.

        It would be remiss of me not to mention the incredible support given by the community over 100 years and congratulate La Fosh patisserie on its wonderful gingerbread replica of Saint Brigid's which was made to be enjoyed by parishioners on the day. Congratulations to Saint Brigid's on its 100 years.
