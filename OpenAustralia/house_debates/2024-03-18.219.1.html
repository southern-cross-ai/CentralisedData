       <p>
        My heartfelt congratulations go to Father Nicolaos Zervas, whose lifelong service is being recognised with the Freedom of the City Award by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Newcastle" rel="nofollow">
         City of Newcastle
        </a>
        . Father Nicolaos has served the Greek community of Newcastle with distinction through his work at St Demetrios Greek Orthodox Church since 1973. Born in Greece in 1934, Father Nicolaos had wanted to be a priest from a very young age, but, as he recalls, they were 'not many' churches when he first arrived in Australia, at age 19.Eventually an opportunity arose to be ordained for the City of Newcastle, and after getting his wife, Nina's, permission and visiting Newcastle to meet with the Greek community, Father Nicolaos and his family moved from Sydney four weeks later.
       </p>
       <p>
        Now in his 90th year, and having retired as a local priest in 2021, Father Nicolaos continues to lead the chant every Sunday in church, proudly supported by his four grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren. He has dedicated his life to the service of others, not only through the church but also as a long-term volunteer for local organisations including Meals on Wheels, the Northern Settlement Services, the Ethnic Communities Council and Lifeline. Thank you, Father Nicolaos, for making Newcastle your home for more than 50 years and for your lifetime of service to our community. We are deeply indebted.
