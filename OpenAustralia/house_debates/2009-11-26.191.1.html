        Three weeks ago I proudly attended the launch of the Macarthur Building Skills Centre project in the suburb of Ingleburn in my electorate, a project which I have been very excited about ever since first learning of the concept a few years ago. The Macarthur Building Skills Centre, which is due to open next June, not only will become a centre of excellence and the focal point for building and construction training in the south-west of Sydney but will play a significant role nationally. Earlier this year the Rudd Labor government awarded

        ’s South Western Sydney Institute a $9.9 million grant through the Education Investment Fund, which is investing in tertiary education and innovative infrastructure, to buy and refurbish an existing Ingleburn building for the centre.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Ingleburn centre, which is located in the industrial precinct, will specialise in construction and building trades, offering programs in rigging, scaffolding, preapprenticeship carpentry and joinery, and also construction of full-size transportable buildings. It will feature multipurpose workshop spaces, classrooms and computer and conference facilities, and it will allow students to obtain university admissions through their studies. It will also be able to be accessed through pathways with high schools, which will be fantastic for young people in my area.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given the expanding residential and industrial areas, the forecast of population growth in the south-west of Sydney and, more significantly, a very high youth unemployment rate in this community, this centre will not only be a great boost in targeting the growing needs of the community; it is also an opportunity for the young people in the area. It is logically placed to go about and pursue careers in the building and construction industry, one of Australia’s biggest industries, which employs around one million people, including my two sons, Nicholas and Jonathan. The Macarthur Building Industry Skills Centre is one such initiative towards achieving vocational education training in areas of great need, including areas of growth such as south-western Sydney.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I would like to take the opportunity to thank Barry Peddle, Institute Director of

        South Western Sydney Institute, for his continued dedication to this project and for helping many young people who hope one day to achieve their dreams with a career in the building and construction industry.
