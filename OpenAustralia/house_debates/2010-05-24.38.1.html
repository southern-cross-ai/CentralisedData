        Mr Speaker, I seek to make a statement on indulgence concerning the sinking of the Republic of Korea naval vessel the
        <i>
         Cheonan
        </i>
        . Members would be aware that the stability of North-East Asia has been threatened recently by the actions of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea" rel="nofollow">
         North Korea
        </a>
        ns. On 26 March the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korea" rel="nofollow">
         South Korea
        </a>
        n naval corvette the
        <i>
         Cheonan
        </i>
        was sunk, with the loss of 46 lives. In response to that tragic event the government of South Korea launched an international investigation into the circumstances of the sinking. This was a prudent and considered response. Australia, along with the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden and Canada, participated in the Republic of Korea led investigation into the causes of the sinking. Five
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Defence Force
        </a>
        personnel assisted with the investigation. Australia’s agreement to provide this assistance reflects the importance of security in North-East Asia to our own interests.
       </p>
       <p>
        The results of the joint international investigation were announced on 20 May. The evidence points overwhelmingly to the conclusion that the
        <i>
         Cheonan
        </i>
        was sunk by a torpedo fired by a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korean" rel="nofollow">
         North Korean
        </a>
        submarine. The conclusions drawn by the international investigation team represent an objective and scientific analysis of the evidence. This evidence is compelling. It includes the fact that the damage to the hull of the
        <i>
         Cheonan
        </i>
        was caused by a large external underwater explosion beneath the vessel consistent with damage from a heavy torpedo. Further, remnants of the torpedo were found on the sea floor in the vicinity. Third, the torpedo was identified as belonging to North Korea, as it matched a North Korean torpedo previously obtained by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korean" rel="nofollow">
         South Korean
        </a>
        s as well as blueprints of a torpedo design North Korea had previously tried to export. Also, Korean script was found on one of the torpedo parts.
       </p>
       <p>
        I spoke to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Lee" rel="nofollow">
         President Lee
        </a>
        Myung-bak of South Korea on 20 May to reiterate Australia’s condolences for this tragic event and to underline Australia’s solidarity with South Korea. I emphasised Australia’s condemnation of North Korea’s deplorable act and assured him that Australia would confer with South Korea and others, including the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        Security Council, on appropriate responses.
       </p>
       <p>
        North Korea’s hostile and unprovoked attack in sinking the
        <i>
         Cheonan
        </i>
        represents a flagrant violation by North Korea of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Charter" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations Charter
        </a>
        and the 1953
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War" rel="nofollow">
         Korean War
        </a>
        Armistice Agreement that halted hostilities on the Korean peninsula. It is a challenge to peace and security on the Korean peninsula. Such conduct is completely unacceptable. The international community cannot let this act pass without an appropriate response.
       </p>
       <p>
        President Lee, today, has announced the RoK response to the sinking. South Korea has shown admirable restraint. The measures he has announced are responsible ones that send a strong message to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DPRK" rel="nofollow">
         DPRK
        </a>
        . He has banned DPRK vessels from using the Cheju Straits, he has suspended inter-Korean trade and exchanges and he has said that the government will pursue a resolution in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN_Security_Council" rel="nofollow">
         UN Security Council
        </a>
        . He has also reiterated South Korea’s principle of proactive deterrence. At the same time, he has demonstrated South Korea’s ongoing concern for the people of the North. He has said that his government will maintain humanitarian aid for infants and children in the DPRK and will consider ongoing cooperation in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaesong_Industrial_Complex" rel="nofollow">
         Kaesong Industrial Complex
        </a>
        in North Korea.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian government stands by the government of the Republic of Korea at this testing time. We offer our condolences to the families of all those who have lost their lives in this terrible incident. The relationship between Australia and the RoK has a long history. Members of this place will be familiar with the sacrifice made by many Australian soldiers during the Korean War, some 340 of whom now lie buried at the United Nations War Cemetery in Korea.
       </p>
       <p>
        We share a commitment with the Korean people to peace and stability in the Asian region. The actions of North Korea are deeply disturbing and deeply destabilising. What the region needs is dialogue and cooperation, not rash acts of aggression of the type that we have seen. In the days ahead, Australia will be conferring with South Korea, United States, Japan and other like-minded countries to determine the best way to take forward the international response to this incident.

         Mr Speaker, on indulgence: I join with the Prime Minister in condemning the actions of
