        My question is to the Minister for Agriculture. Will the minister update the House on the forecast value of Australia's gross farm production? How is this government's economic plan and our commitment to agriculture helping to boost the agriculture sector, particularly in my home state of

          I thank the honourable member for her question. I was only recently over in
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Western Australia
          </a>
          with the honourable member. We went to the Elgin hall for breakfast and it was packed out with farmers, because farmers have a real excitement about where this government have gone and where it is going, the places it is taking them and the plan it has. It was also incredibly important to talk those farmers about their state, which exports 80 per cent of their product, and what we have in mind and how we are going to make sure a better return comes back through the farm gate for them. The state was well represented formerly by
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Randall" rel="nofollow">
           Don Randall
          </a>
          in the seat of Canning. Don Randall was always in our office standing up for the people, such as the Hills Orchard Improvement Group, and making sure that they had a great future. I am sure they will have a great future again upon the election of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Hastie" rel="nofollow">
           Andrew Hastie
          </a>
          , because we have to make sure that we are a government that support such fundamental improvements for agriculture as the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement.
         </p>
         <p>
          The gross value of Australia's agricultural production is predicted to go up by eight per cent in the coming year to $57.1 billion. Over the last two years, it has gone up by more than 12 per cent. This just goes to show that areas are still there where you actually can employ people, where you can provide jobs and where you can provide a future. As a nation, we must be doing everything we can to stand behind the beef producers, the dairy producers and the horticultural producers of Forrest and of Canning. It is there for all to see in the free trade agreement as to what is actually available.
         </p>
         <p>
          If you believe that the people of Canning who export beef to China should get a reduction in the tariffs they currently face—up to 25 per cent—you have to vote for the Liberal Party on the weekend. If you believe that the dairy industry should get the tariff of up to 10 per cent on whole milk powder reduced, you have to vote for the Liberal Party on the weekend. If you believe that the tariffs of up to 30 per cent faced by exporters in our citrus industry should be removed, you have to vote for the Liberal Party on the weekend. If you want to stand behind a government that has a vision and a plan, that brought forward the white paper on agriculture, that is bringing forward water infrastructure, that has a vision for three free trade agreements, that has opened up seven new live animal export destinations, that is currently building dams, that has laid out a clear path to prosperity in regional areas—especially for Canning and especially for Forrest—there is only one solution on the weekend: you must vote for Andrew Hastie.
