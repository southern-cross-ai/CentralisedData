        . He was a rarity in professional football in that he kept up his apprenticeship in the building game. He is a very good man. He is now in the fight of his life against a very aggressive cancer. This cancer refuses to submit. There is a chance, if we can get him to Germany, that an experimental treatment can finally put this disease on hold.

        The North Queensland community, including the Cowboys and the Men of League, have swung in behind this family. There is a lunch coming up to assist with fundraising to get Sam to Germany. I am not able to attend but I have paid for a seat. I urge all North Queenslanders to see what they can do to help out. The lunch, on 25 May at A Touch of Salt, will be a great event. I am asking all North Queenslanders to see if they can free up some time to attend or to help out.

        'Faust' is a famous family name in North Queensland. The family are proud people. They are humble people. They do not show too much emotion. Sam's wife, Kya, and his daughters, Kaiulani, Meika and Lola, all know how brave dad is. Sam, we are right behind you, mate. Stay strong.
