        My question is to the Prime Minister. Treasury has told Senate estimates today that no climate impact modelling has been done in the entire seven years of this government. Now the Prime Minister has had 10 days to consider, does he have the confidence in his position to agree to a debate at the

         Unlike the Labor Party, unlike those opposite, we've have got a plan and we've got a target for 2030 which we are going to meet and we're going beat—just as we have already met and will beat the target for 2020. Ten years ago we were in opposition and we set out a plan to hit the 2020 target. We will hit that target, and we will beat the target, with the plan we put in place 10 years ago. And we have a plan to meet the 2030 target, and we set that out before for the last election.

          just remind the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition that anyone watching on television isn't hearing a word they are saying. But, when we are ready to resume, we can, because neither has the call. The Leader of the Opposition, on a point of order?

           Yes, Mr Speaker. The question went to modelling, and the Prime Minister has not mentioned any of it.

            The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. I'll take that as a point of order on relevance. The question was about that but it was also about the prospect of debate. I am listening to the Prime Minister, and he has been relevant to the policy topic so far in his answer.

            <p>
             What I've been outlining is what the government is doing to meet the targets we've set when it comes to taking action on climate change, which is exactly what the subject of the
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COP" rel="nofollow">
              COP
             </a>
             processes will be later this year.
            </p>
            <p>
             Our government has a track record of meeting and beating the targets we set when it comes to meeting our emissions reductions targets. Those opposite can't even tell us what they think the 2030 target should be. Is it 45 per cent, like the member for Maribyrnong thought it should be? Should it be 26 per cent, like the member for Hunter thinks it should be? Should it be a target of 35, as I think the member for Sydney thinks it should be? She was very happy with a 45 per cent target. Those opposite can't even work out what should be done by 2030, but yet they want to parade around the place and talk about a target for 2050. A 2050 target without a plan means one thing: it means a tax on Australians. That is what a target without a plan means; it means a tax on Australians—because they have no plan to make it happen otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
             We're putting together the technology plan and the technology roadmap—which may well exceed a zero net carbon outcome in 2050. It may well exceed that. Those opposite came up with a target but they had no clue what it would cost and no clue how they would get there. The interview that the Leader of the Opposition did with
             <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Speers" rel="nofollow">
              David Speers
             </a>
             needed encryption analysts to work out what he was actually saying—and they still haven't worked it out! Labor have no plan, no clue, no targets and no idea.
