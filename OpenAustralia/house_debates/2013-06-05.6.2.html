       <p>
        Just before I call the member for Scullin, I want to report back on two matters of privilege. Yesterday two matters of privilege were raised. The Minister for Trade and Competitiveness raised a matter concerning the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. The basis of his complaint was that the Deputy Leader had made a personal explanation on 3 June which was, the minister said, contrary to statements that she had made in an interview that she had given to
        <i>
         The
        </i>
        <i>
         Guardian Australia
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The Leader of the House's complaint arose from a report in
        <i>
         The Australian
        </i>
        of 31 May that the Manager of Opposition Business had written to Independent members in connection with a possible motion of no confidence. The Leader of the House said that at the time the letters in question had not, in fact, gone to any of the members involved, and that there was an issue in respect of the veracity of the reported statements and the responsibilities of the crossbench members.
       </p>
       <p>
        These matters, like the matter raised last Thursday by the leader of the Nationals, reflect the concerns that members have about statements and actions of other members. The deliberate misleading of the House is a recognised category of contempt, as is any improper interference with the free performance by members of their duties as members.
       </p>
       <p>
        I understand the concerns of the ministers, and of the leader of the Nationals last Thursday, but I think also that members accept that Speakers have required prima facie evidence of a contempt in order to justify giving precedence to motions for the referral of such matters to the Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my view it is in the interests of the House that this position be maintained and that members use other processes to pursue matters that I accept are important to them.
       </p>
