        My question is to the Prime Minister.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_April" rel="nofollow">
         In April
        </a>
        last year, the Prime Minister announced 10 industry training hubs in areas of high youth unemployment. But, 18 months later, only two of the 10 industry training hubs are up and running. Why does the delivery of this Prime Minister never match the announcement?

         I welcome the acknowledgement of the delivery of the programs, as the member opposite has just remarked. This is an important program and those hubs will continue to be delivered around the country. But not only that. What we'll be delivering is the $1 billion JobTrainer Fund—some 340,000 job training places. All states have now have signed on. The industry minister yesterday noted that we were still waiting for the Victorian government to sign on, and the Treasurer advised me last night that Victoria has signed up to the JobTrainer Fund. I think it's a great initiative, and we thank the Victorian government for their support. That's 340,000 places, because, as Australians are gathering together and they move towards the end of this year and they look forward to next year, the fact that we are creating almost 30,000 places in higher education and 340,000 places for job training, all of these programs working together with the states and territories—

          government is working together with the states and territories to deliver this program of JobTrainer, which was a first, in that it was brought together in about two weeks. That's how effective the national cabinet was in getting moving on the things that Australians needed in response to COVID-19.

          Those opposite will come in here and they'll seek to slag off against JobKeeper, they'll seek to slag off against JobTrainer, they'll seek to slag off against the support for the aviation sector—all measures that they came in here and pretended to support. What the Australian people know is that this year, in crisis—

            the Australian government has stood by them, while those opposite have sneered and they've jeered with snarly performances, seeking to undercut the work of the government to stand by Australians this year. I would encourage the opposition to leave the snarls at home and get on with the job of supporting the recovery of Australians from the COVID-19 recession.
