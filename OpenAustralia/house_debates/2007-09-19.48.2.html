        My question is again to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Minister_of_State" rel="nofollow">
         Special Minister of State
        </a>
        . I refer the Special Minister of State to the fact that the tape of what occurred at the meeting in his electorate was played on ABC Radio and, when transcribed, read as follows:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        MIKE KELLY: ... I was a soldier, and I did what I was ordered to do.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        PETER PHELPS—
       </p>
       <p>
        the minister’s chief of staff—
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Oh, like the guards at Belsen perhaps? Are you using the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg_Defence" rel="nofollow">

        ?
       </p>
       <p>
        If the minister now acknowledges that this statement is unacceptable to have been made by anyone in any circumstance, what does he now intend to do in relation to this conduct by his chief of staff?

         Mr Speaker, I rise on two points of order. The first relates to standing order 98(c), because this is not connected with the minister’s official business. The second relates to the standing order which says that, once a question has been fully answered, it may not be answered again. The minister has fully answered the question, with all its implications.

          The question relates to an answer the minister has already given and it does raise a new point. The question is in order. I call the

          <p>
           I think I have fully answered that question. I did not hear the ABC report. I was busy representing the people of my electorate when that report was run. I was working closely with my community about the things that are important to them. I can only take the comments made by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and discuss these matters with my chief of staff.
