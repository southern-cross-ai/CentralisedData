        I rise to congratulate our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        athletes who were recognised at the Surf Life Saving New South Wales Awards of Excellence. In the electorate of Robertson, we are privileged to be surrounded by beautiful beaches, and our hardworking lifesavers really do an incredible job keeping our beaches safe. This was recognised at the recent awards of excellence, with Umina Surf Life Saving Club receiving the New South Wales Club of the Year award for the second year in a row. This is really a fantastic achievement, and it's a testament to the passionate and hardworking volunteers of the club. Umina also received the award for New South Wales Patrol of the Year, and club member Kai Darwin was named New South Wales Youth Surf Lifesaver of the Year for the second year in a row. Congratulations, Kai. The president of the club, Stephen Scahill, said that the award was the culmination of many years of effort and the collective contribution of all of the members. He said Umina Surf Life Saving Club prides itself on being inclusive and showing members of our community that there is a role for everyone, be it in lifesaving, first aid, sports, coaching, training and education, or becoming an official.
