        I rise today to acknowledge the 40th birthday of the Children's Leukaemia &amp;

        in the electorate of Curtin. The idea was inspired by nine-year-old Jennifer Harper, who was diagnosed with leukaemia in 1977. Sadly, Jennifer passed away the year after her diagnosis. This was the tragic reality for the majority of children with cancer at that particular point in time. Fifty years ago, only two per cent of children with cancer survived. While Jennifer did not survive, her diagnosis and the devastating experience inspired her father,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Harper" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , to take action. Having discovered that there was no research into children's leukaemia being done in WA, he set out to raise funds for that purpose. Over the years, the foundation has raised a significant amount of funds for research into childhood cancers. The foundation also established its own research lab in 1983. Since that time it's worked collaboratively with leading worldwide research bodies to continue the fight against childhood cancers.

       <p>
        Forty-two years after Jennifer's passing, the overall survival rate of children with cancer has changed from two per cent to 80 per cent. This turnaround is phenomenal. It is the incredible research efforts across the world and the funding and attention raised by Peter and others like him that have led to this outcome. But 80 per cent is still not good enough. Childhood cancer remains the single greatest cause of death from disease in Australian children today. It is for this reason that the foundation, the researchers and the volunteers have no intention of stopping now. I'm delighted that the foundation is one of the successful recipients of the government's 2019-20 volunteer grants. The foundation will receive $5,000 to support their volunteers, with funds going towards the purchase of computers and video equipment so that the volunteers, who make up 65 per cent of those who work with the foundation, can better engage with the childhood cancer community.

        I'd also note that providing support for the foundation is even more significant this year because, in recognition of the huge impact the COVID-19 pandemic is having on many of their traditional supporters, the foundation made the decision earlier this year to cancel their planned 40-year fundraising campaign, called 40K in 40 Days. However, with the same spirit shown by Peter Harper back in 1977, the foundation just didn't cancel the event. They decided to do something for their supporters and they turned their 40K in 40 Days campaign into a campaign called The Circle of Kindness. Over 40 days the foundation is showcasing and supporting 40 different businesses who have supported them over the last 40 years. I would like to congratulate the foundation for the vital role they play in raising funds and awareness for childhood cancer research and for the positive contribution they make to our community.
