        This year's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        Awards pay tribute to some outstanding citizens in our local community. I want to take this opportunity to congratulate some of these incredible people in my electorate of Mallee. In the Robinvale community,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Lister" rel="nofollow">
         Tom Lister
        </a>
        was the recipient of the Australia Day special achiever of the year award. Tom has been an outstanding advocate of community sport, particularly for young kids. His passion for cricket and his desire to serve his local community went hand in hand when he resurrected the Robinvale Euston cricket team. The cricket team are having great success and are currently sitting equal-first on the ladder. Young citizen of the year went to Isla Taylor, who is serving as school captain this year at Euston Public School and has proudly represented her school at important occasions such as Anzac Day and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Remembrance Day
        </a>
        . She has excelled at her studies, receiving multiple awards, and she is also known as an exceptional sportswoman in swimming, athletics and netball. The young sportsperson of the year is Matthew. In 2021 Matthew competed well in the Euston Public School swimming carnival, claiming first place in four events. He now works to improve on his personal best times. In athletics and football, Matthew continues to excel. I warmly congratulate all these outstanding recipients in Robinvale.
