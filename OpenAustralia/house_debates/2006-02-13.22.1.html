       <p>
        I rise to speak on the proposed development at Sydney airport by the Sydney Airport Corporation Ltd, which proposes to develop 60,000 square metres for an aviation and retail business park or for a retail precinct. This is a completely unacceptable proposal to the people of Sydney, to the people of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        and most particularly to the people of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingsford_Smith" rel="nofollow">
         Kingsford Smith
        </a>
        . This proposed super mall, a giant $200 million complex, is the worst kind of development, in the wrong place and, with heightened security risks at airports, at the worst possible time. It is barely 10 minutes from the existing Eastgardens and Southpoint shopping complexes; it is located at the junction of Foreshore Road, Botany, and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M5_Motorway" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        ; and it is near the end of the third runwayâ€”and adjacent to another airport runway, under which runs a tunnel. It is in entirely the wrong place.
       </p>
       <p>
        I visited the site, which, incidentally, adjoins the location point for emergency vehicles and the public in the case of an evacuation of Sydney airport. I can assure the House and Minister Truss that it is entirely unsuitable for any development of any kind. This proposal is completely at odds with local and state planning laws. It makes a mockery of them, as there is no requirement on the part of the airport corporation to meet state planning requirements. The proposal has been overwhelmingly opposed by the New South Wales government, by the people of New South Wales, by the

        , by local councils and, I can assure the House, by the majority of residents in Kingsford Smith.
