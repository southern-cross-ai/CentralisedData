       <p>
        I wish to take this opportunity to give the chamber an update on my electorate of Capricornia. It has been very busy since the federal election, and there are many positive announcements to report on. This year, I announced $5 million in funding for the Signature Onfarm beef-processing facility, along with $25 million in additional NAIF funding; over $140,000 in funding for local community groups under the Volunteer Grants 2018 program; nearly half a million dollars in domestic and international scholarships in Capricornia as part of the federal government's Destination Australia Program; $21.6 million for the construction of Stanage Bay Road; $20 million for the construction of the 1,000-seat convention centre in Yeppoon; over $175 million in additional funding for blackspots, rest areas and safety upgrades; $20 million for improved road train access in the Rockhampton road network; and $10 million to be brought forward for the construction of the Rockhampton Ring Road, which is a $1 billion project with $800 million of contributions from the federal government.

        A couple of months ago we organised a rally on the banks of the

        There have been challenging moments for people in the electorate. The bushfires have devastated the community, where we lost 15 homes, 56 structures and 8,500 hectares of grazing land. But, when the community in Yeppoon experiences times of hardship, we often see the best in people. It was a monumental effort on the part of the volunteer firefighters to combat the flames, and I thank them for their tireless service.

        As my fellow federal members of parliament would know, elections aren't won by the efforts of only one person, and I wish to thank all of the committed volunteers, friends, family, parliamentary colleagues and staff for their hard work, determination and support during the May federal election. I also wish to express my gratitude and appreciation to the quiet Australians who voted for me: the retirees, mum-and-dad business owners and minersâ€”people who were genuinely worried about a future under Labor. They put their faith in me, and I promise to continue to deliver for Capricornia in 2020 and beyond.
       </p>

        I'd also like to thank the staff in
