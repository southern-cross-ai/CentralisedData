       <p>
        I welcome the opportunity to speak today on an issue that I am sure you are very keen on as well, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott. We are rapidly approaching the 100th anniversary of the declaration of war for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I" rel="nofollow">
         World War I
        </a>
        . In the early months of the war, in 1914, a very important battle took place, which we should keep in our minds, particularly those of us from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        , although it took place a fair distance off our shores. I refer to the engagement between the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAS" rel="nofollow">
         HMAS
        </a>
        <i>
         Sydney
        </i>
        , a light cruiser, and the German cruiser the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS" rel="nofollow">
         SMS
        </a>
        <i>
         Emden
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        At the start of the war, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_East_Asia_Squadron" rel="nofollow">
         German East Asia Squadron
        </a>
        were ordered back to Germany to act in Europe. They left behind the
        <i>
         Emden
        </i>
        <i>
         ,
        </i>
        which was going to act as a commerce raider. In the first two months of the
        <i>
         Emden
        </i>
        operating independently, some 25 ships were sunk in the region, and others were damaged. At one point, on 8 November 1914, the captain of the
        <i>
         Emden
        </i>
        , Karl von Mueller, decided that they would disable the Australian transmission station on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direction_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Direction Island
        </a>
        in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands group. Just before a landing party of about 50 troops were able to achieve that, a distress signal was sent out. It was very fortunate that the convoy of the first Australian troops on their way to Egypt, accompanied by the HMAS
        <i>
         Sydney
        </i>
        , was nearby, and
        <i>
         Sydney
        </i>
        was able to be dispatched to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands.
       </p>
       <p>
        At 9.15 on the morning of 9 November 1914,
        <i>
         Emden
        </i>
        was engaged by the
        <i>
         Sydney
        </i>
        <i>
         .
        </i>
        It was disabled by the
        <i>
         Sydney
        </i>
        and later in the morning surrendered. It was a great win for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Navy" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Navy
        </a>
        . Whilst 160-odd Germans were killed, four Australians were killed and 16 were injured on the
        <i>
         Sydney
        </i>
        . It was the first real win of the Australian armed forces in World War I. On 8 and 9 November this year, on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, there will be a great commemoration of this most important event in Australian military history.
