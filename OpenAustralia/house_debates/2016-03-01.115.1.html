        Tonight I want to throw my support behind a campaign by communities in my electorate to create safer streets in the Macleay Valley. The Macleay Valley is a wonderful place. In fact, I would say it is one of the hidden gems of regional Australia. The beaches are spectacular, the national parks are stunning and the people are friendly and welcoming. I am very privileged to represent communities throughout the valley, including Bellbrook, Willawarrin, Kempsey, Smithtown, Gladstone,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_West_Rocks" rel="nofollow">
         South West Rocks
        </a>
        and Crescent Head.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kempsey_Shire_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Kempsey Shire Council
        </a>
        has been proactive in developing the commercial precincts in the valley, including through significant investments to improve the Kempsey CBD now that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific Highway
        </a>
        does not run flow through town. They have created a space for people along the alignment of the old Pacific Highway. You can feel the positive vibe in Kempsey. The CBD is busy and the upgraded streetscape is most appealing. The council has also recently secured federal funding under the National Stronger Regions Fund to support the development of a new cinema in the Kempsey CBD. The new cinema will bring people to the Kempsey CBD and provide new social opportunities for the entire community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, Kempsey like many regional communities also has its share of crime and antisocial behaviour. In recent months, the respected local newspaper,
        <i>
         The Macleay Argus
        </i>
        , has run several reports about worrying crime trends in Kempsey, including high rates of break and enter and antisocial behaviour. The community, including the local chambers of commerce and the Kempsey Shire Council, are leading a determined effort to make the streets of the Macleay Valley safer.
       </p>
       <p>
        The council has already launched a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCTV" rel="nofollow">
         CCTV
        </a>
        pilot program in the CBD area, which is helping to inform the longer term strategy throughout the valley. The pilot program includes 10 CCTV cameras and the related transmission and monitoring equipment. It is worth noting that the pilot program was delivered on time and on budget. Council has applied for funding through the government's Safer Streets Program and I am fully supportive of their application. As part of the project, council plans to install 50 CCTV cameras in key locations in the Macleay Valley, including the Kempsey CBD, west Kempsey, South West Rocks and Crescent Head. The CCTV cameras will reduce street crime and incidents of antisocial behaviour, and assist the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales_Police" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales Police
        </a>
        in the prosecution of offenders and also increase the feeling of safety in the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I spoke to Mayor Liz Campbell about the Safer Street Program and she said: 'This is something the community has been calling for for a long time. The grant applied for will supplement the work that council has started in trying to make the streets of the Kempsey CBD safer and more family-friendly.' The Kempsey community is right behind this proposal. Local business owners are concerned about the security and safety of their businesses. They see better lighting and CCTV cameras as being very important elements of the strategy to make the streets safer for everyone. I should also add that the New South Wales Police are very happy to see this proceed as well because CCTV footage provides them with a key source of information to help apprehend and prosecute offenders.
       </p>
       <p>
        Elsewhere in the Macleay Valley, South West Rocks and Crescent Head business owners are also making an effort to make their streets safer. The Safer Streets application by Kempsey Shire Council includes a plan to install cameras in the Crescent Head commercial precinct. In South West Rocks, there will also be 10 cameras installed. The Safer Streets plan also includes a proposal for three mobile CCTV cameras, which will be used at festivals, markets and other events.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tourism is a significant part of the Macleay Valley economy, so anything that provides a safer, more secure experience for visitors is valuable. The Macleay Valley is a great place to live and visit. The proposed initiative by Kempsey Shire Council will serve to make a great place even better.
