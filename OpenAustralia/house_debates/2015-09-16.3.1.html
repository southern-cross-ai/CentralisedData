        ROLLOUT: Resumption of debate (from 14 September 2015) on the motion of Mrs Wicks—That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) places on the record that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) under the previous Government, at the time of the last election just 2 per cent of premises across Australia could access the

         National Broadband Network
        </a>
        (NBN);
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) since the election the NBN rollout has ramped up significantly and today around one in ten premises can access the NBN and under the NBN's new Corporate Plan, by June 2018, three in four premises will have access to the NBN; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the NBN's 2016-2018 Corporate Plan reveals that a full fibre to the premises (

         FTTP

       <p class="italic">
        (b) the NBN 2016-2018 Corporate Plan reveals that a full FTTP NBN would cost between $20 and $30 billion dollars more than the current Government's plan; and

       <p class="italic">
        (3) recognises that it is essential to deliver fast broadband to Australians sooner—not force Australians with no or poor broadband to wait more than a decade for the NBN.
