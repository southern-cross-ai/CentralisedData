        My question is addressed to the Minister for Ageing. It is now over a month since you ordered an investigation into the attack by vermin on an 89-year-old war veteran at a nursing home in rural Queensland. When will the findings of this report into a very serious failure of care be revealed?

         I thank the honourable member for her question. This is indeed a very serious and very important matter. I will outline to the House the matters in relation to this incident. Early in May, I asked the accreditation agency to undertake a major investigation of the home’s handling of the incident and to report to me within 30 days in relation to that. The agency commenced its investigation on 6 May and has just about completed its investigation. So far, they have visited the home, interviewed a range of people and sought expert advice in relation to the incident.
        </p>
        <p>
         The agency’s investigation was to consider but was not limited to: the home’s management of the plague, including the actions taken and the timeliness of actions taken; how the home responded to incidents in which the residents were affected; and actions taken to protect the residents generally. The investigation is to consider the actions of the home as well as the actions of the approved provider, Darling Downs West Moreton Health Service, part of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Health" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         . The report should also include recommendations to improve the procedures and processes for the protection of those residents. The independent accreditation agency has also visited the home, which is, as I said, run by Queensland Health. The

         is in regular contact with the home. As I said, that report will be coming to me very shortly.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is a very serious matter. My main concern is for the safety, health and welfare of our residents in our nursing homes right across this nation. We have 2,830 nursing homes, which are home to nearly 200,000 older Australians. Our main priority is our commitment to them. I will have that major investigation report very shortly.
