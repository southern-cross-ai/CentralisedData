        Last week I was pleased to host a special
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBQ" rel="nofollow">
         BBQ
        </a>
        to congratulate Bonner's Local Legends: the people in our community who were nominated for their selfless acts of kindness during a difficult 2020. While this year has been a trying one for us all, it has brought out the best in our community. To recognise this, earlier this year I put the call out for the community to nominate those who went above and beyond to support others for a local Bonner legend award.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a result of the call-out we received some heartwarming nominations, and last Monday we celebrated these incredible people and learnt more about what motivated them to be so kind, caring and compassionate to others. Amongst them were neighbours, volunteers and members of our everyday community who just didn't know how their actions had made such a difference to the lives of others. This included Brisbane coastguards who keep our boaties safe on

        and Darling Point Special School's Coral Brenner who runs the before-and-after-school program.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd like to recognise all of our local legends who make Bonner great, including a friendly caring neighbour Rebekah Barelet, the Mt Gravatt Hawks Football Club president, Mark Brittan; disability support worker Keoni Driscol; Belmont State School Principal, Lisa Morrison; Care Kits for Kids president, Christine Rafter; dance studio instructor Michelle Thompson; and Wildlife Australia volunteer and carer Nicole Blums. These are the people in our community nominated by our community for the amazing work that they do.
