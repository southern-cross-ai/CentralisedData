       <p>
        This morning nearly a thousand Canberrans filled St Paul's Manuka to bid farewell to Jayson Hinder, a much loved and significant contributor to our community, who tragically died in a motorbike accident. He is an enormous loss to our community—to Canberra—and touched so many lives, which was evident at the funeral today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Jayson had a keen sense of social justice, forged as a young child when his mother was forced to sell the family home after his father died. He had an acute understanding of the challenges faced by people left behind, those who do not have access to opportunities. He had a strong moral compass and was guided by the common good. He was a mechanic, a banker, a lawyer, a politician, a Rugby tragic and a bikie. He was a loving husband, a loving father and a loving son. He was a brutally, mercilessly honest but fiercely loyal friend and he was a tireless advocate for individual and community empowerment through access to finance, through education, through lives free from domestic violence and through decent public policy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today's farewell reminded us about what can be achieved when a life is lived to the full, in the company of those you love, for the benefit of others. Jayson's life was too short, but he leaves behind a remarkable legacy and a life of service to the community—a legacy that will live on and for which we give thanks. My deepest sympathies are with Jayson's wife, Lisa, his children, Nigel, Oliver and Madeleine, and his mother, Colleen. Vale Jayson Hinder. Rest in peace.
