        This evening I rise to farewell William Thomas Judd, who left us on 11 February of this year. 'Bill', as he was known to all, was a loving father to his children, Kerry and Maurie, and a committed husband to Merle. A hardworking and innovative farmer whose endeavour provided for the family he cared so deeply about and whose gentlemanly example set a standard almost impossible to emulate. Bill was deeply respected. It was a respect that was earnt and not demanded. He was a kind man who has left a lasting legacy on many, including me.
       </p>
       <p>
        Born on 23 December 1935 in Warrnambool, Bill's story encompasses so much that is quintessentially Australian. Born into a Catholic family, alongside his five siblings he studied at the local Garvoc Catholic primary school. Bill's father managed the Garvoc cheese factory. From an early age, Bill was responsible for getting his older sister and his four younger siblings to school via the horse and gig. His early-learned work ethic would hold him in good stead throughout his life, and it was a trait he successfully passed on to Kerry and Maurie. I would like to think that I also learnt a thing or two on this front from Bill. Indeed, while working for Bill during one particular summer I lost 15 kilograms between milking in the morning, carting hay in the afternoon and milking in the evening.
       </p>
       <p>
        In his adolescence, Bill studied at Terang High School. When his father, Gordon, was appointed manager of the

        cheese factory the family moved to Mil-Lel, where Bill attended Mount Gambier High School. It was at Mount Gambier High School, while on the school bus, that Bill met his future best friend and wife of 65 years, Merle. Bill left school at 17 and started to work on the dairy farm of Mrs and Mrs Johns. After being drafted into national service at 18 and noticing that shearers had a few more pennies than the other nashos, Bill quickly realised he could buy his own farm by becoming a shearer. After he put down his uniform, he took up the handpiece and he and Merle moved into a house on 30 acres at Moorak in December 1958. Merle milked the herd of a dozen or so cows, and Bill supported their efforts by shearing.

        1963, Bill and Merle seized the opportunity to purchase a farm at Tarpeena, a farm which Bill would work for the rest of his life. The Judd family name would become synonymous with Tarpeena. Bill was proud of his town; so proud that later in life, as a successful greyhound breeder, he won the

        Saint Leger with Tarpeena Tip and again with Tarpeena Blue. Indeed, all of the dogs were named Tarpeena something.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Tarpeena farm was initially 192 acres with a herd of 100 cows. The added workload meant that Bill was forced to give up shearing and focus on the farm. Through their hard work and commitment, Bill, Merle and the family grew their farm and increased its productivity. Not even the devastation of

        could dent Bill and Merle's commitment to provide for those they loved. Not only did Bill and Merle build an enduring and successful agricultural enterprise, but they also built a strong and happy family. Bill was a loving father, uncle and grandfather. He passed on his skills and knowledge to his children and to their children, and this stands as an example of a thoroughly decent man that I, quite frankly, am better for having known.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our teenage years are formative. At 17, I think my parents thought I was in need of some formation and so they sent me to Bill and Merle. But, in truth, it was my great pleasure to get my first job working for Bill, Merle and Maurie. It was not the $176 per week I earned that sustained me or had me returning during my scholastic holidays from law school, but their friendship, their guidance and their example. In truth, Bill sparked my interest in agripolitics. It was Bill who would read the
        <i>
         Stock Journal
        </i>
        and
        <i>
         The Weekly Times
        </i>
        ; I would begin doing that too, and we would have conversations, which, as I said, sparked my interest in agripolitics.
       </p>
       <p>
        William Thomas Judd stands as an example of the best of Australian values. He was a hardworking and humble farmer with a quick turn of phrase and a deep understanding that the strength of the family unit is central to all that we do. Humility was inherent in everything that Bill did, so I was not surprised when Maurie ended his father's eulogy by saying, 'Dad was just a good bloke'. I anticipate that Maurie knew this was the type of high praise reserved by Bill for only the best of men. So I say, 'Vale, William Thomas Juddâ€”a good bloke.'
