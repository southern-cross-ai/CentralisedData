       <p>
        by leaveâ€”I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the order of the day for the resumption of debate on the motion relating to the murder of Mrs Jo Cox be referred to the Federation Chamber for further debate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Members would be well aware of the tragic and awful death of Mrs Jo Cox, a member of the House of Commons in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Britain" rel="nofollow">
         Great Britain
        </a>
        . A motion was moved by a member of the House in Private Members' Business, but the Manager of Opposition Business and I wanted to be able to relate to the House of Commons that we had passed a motion through the parliament unanimously noting this terrible tragedy and enclosing the speeches given on the motion.
       </p>
       <p>
        Because of the procedures of the House, it was not possible to have a vote on the Private Members' Business motion easily, so I undertook, with the Manager of Opposition Business, to move the motion as the Leader of the House, which means that the processes are much simpler. As a consequence, this motion will now be referred to the Federation Chamber and as many members as wish to will be able to speak on the motion. We will then be able to pass it through the House on the voices and that will allow it to be translated to the House of Commons to indicate our deep regret and sadness at the hideous death of Mrs Jo Cox, a death that could occur at any moment to any person who represents their constituency in public life as a random act, as it was in this case. I am very glad to have been able to cooperate with the Manager of Business in the House to bring this about.

         On behalf of the House, I thank the Leader of the House and the Manager of Opposition Business for facilitating this as a sensible course of action to allow as many members as possible to participate.

         Question agreed to.
