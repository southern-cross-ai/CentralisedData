       <p>
        Brisbane and South-East Queensland are getting the infrastructure funding they need on the back of this government's strong economic management, which is necessary to build it. This morning our government announced its strong support for a South-East Queensland city deal, which will aim to lock in the infrastructure projects needed in our fast-growing area for the decades ahead.

       <p>
        Two weeks ago, the Prime Minister was in Brisbane and announced an additional almost quarter of a billion dollars towards local congestion-busting road and rail projects. This included funding for a very important local project in the heart of Brisbane, an upgrade to the intersection of Doggett Street and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Commercial Road
        </a>
        in Newstead. It's one of the worst intersections in Brisbane. It's increasingly busy, with all the nearby development and new apartments around Newstead, and it's increasingly dangerous for cyclists, motorists and pedestrians. So this is great news for local residents in Newstead.
       </p>
       <p>
        Locally, we've also seen the widening of the

        </a>
        and the upgrade of the Gateway, both recently completed. We're seeing the upgrade of

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_Airport" rel="nofollow">

        is getting its second runway. And this government is funding massive investments and works in the

        heading north of the city and the M1 heading south. Of the $75 billion our government is investing in infrastructure and transport projects nationwide, I'm incredibly proud to be part of a team in Queensland that has $15Â½ billion going towards the projects needed in our wonderful state.
