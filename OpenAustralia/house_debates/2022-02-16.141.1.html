        The Connells Point Netball Club is one of the strongest netball clubs anywhere in southern Sydney, established more than 60 years ago. Already for the upcoming season more than 250 players have signed up, which is great news. There has been a very successful summer series of training as well, with more than 120 participants just over summer. In particular, I want to congratulate Evie Economou, of Connells Point Netball Club. She has been selected to participate in the Sydney Netball Academy run by Netball

        . It's a very prestigious program. Hundreds of people applied, and just 44 were selected, so congratulations, Evie, on that great effort. Thank you to Julian Finch, the president; Maureen Finch, the secretary; and everyone who does so much to make Connells Point Netball Club such a bedrock of our local community.

        government has provided some $6 million of support to the St George &amp; Sutherland Medical Research Foundation, and the work that's going on at the Microbiome Research Centre, led by Professor Emad El-Omar, is literally world-leading. In addition to the Microbiome Research Centre, there are a series of different projects going on. There are 127 projects underway at the foundation at the moment, including 28 international projects. It's a really good thing for southern Sydney to have such a high-quality research centre based in our own community. It helps to attract the very best and brightest to St George Hospital. Thank you to Professor El-Omar and everyone who is doing such great work.

        and Jill Archer, the president and the vice president, are a dynamic duo. They run that club with great pride, and they have grown it into one of the strongest anywhere in Sydney. This weekend coming, we'll be opening the new lighting down there at Kelso Park, contributed to through the federal government grant of $250,000. I want to thank everyone at East Hills Baseball for their efforts. In particular, congratulations to Chelsea Wicks and Ryleigh Delacour Batch on their selection for the
