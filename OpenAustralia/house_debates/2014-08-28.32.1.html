        , as a musical giant of Australia—a composer who changed our musical landscape forever. Peter Sculthorpe's death on 8 August was widely mourned—and not just in Australia, where he found the inspiration for his influential orchestral compositions. He took Australian classical music to the world and, in the process, built an international reputation. Peter Sculthorpe was born in Launceston, in my electorate of Bass, and was educated at

        , where his musical talent was nurtured—although he liked to tell the story of one of his music teachers who forbade him from composing because 'all the composers are dead' and told him to concentrate on his playing. Thankfully, he ignored that advice.

        brought the drama and rugged beauty of the Australian landscape to musical life. He was also a mentor and a teacher to generations of Australian composers. Despite his stellar international career, he regularly visited his old school and celebrated his 80th birthday with students and staff at Launceston Church Grammar School. Peter Sculthorpe was a wonderful Launcestonian and an inspiration for many Tasmanians. He leaves a magnificent musical legacy and will be greatly missed by music lovers around the world.
