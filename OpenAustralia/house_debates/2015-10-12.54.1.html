        I would like to endorse the comments of the member for Watson. I think it is incredibly important that at this challenging time, as we attempt to deal with terrorism, we work to bring the community together. It is not by creating 'us and them' that we are going to deal with this problem that arises from alienation; it is by bringing the community together.

        On Sunday I was very proud to be involved in the Eid al-Adha festival that was held in my electorate, in the Northbridge Piazza. Fifteen different Islamic groups had come together across Perth to bring to the community their celebration. It was fantastic to see the food, the singing and the general festivities that were being shared by the broader community. This is the way that we take this forward. This is the way that we deal with these real problems within our community. I want to compliment all of those who were involved in the Eid festival. I intend to work very closely with the Islamic groups in Perth to make sure that we have a community that celebrates that diversity.
