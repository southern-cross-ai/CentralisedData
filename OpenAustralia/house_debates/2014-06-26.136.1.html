       <p>
        I rise to talk about the fuel excise amendment, or petrol tax, which will increase the cost of living of people in my electorate of Charlton, who are going to feel it well and truly in their hip pockets. It is one of a suite of measures in this budget that will be hurting ordinary people. I am forced to use this forum to raise my response to this petrol tax because the government gagged debate on the fuel indexation legislation. The government were so ashamed of their inequitable actions in the legislation that they gagged debate after a very few speakers. They gagged the debate because they were ashamed of the impact of this on low- and middle-income Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have been contacted by many people in my community who wanted me to raise this issue. I have been contacted by Phil, of Cardiff, who is a person with a disability. Phil contacted me to say that the fuel tax will hurt him because he has no other option but to use his car. He says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Most disabled people need door-to-door transport in their own cars or vans. Were the price of petrol to increase I fear that many of us would cut down on the use of our vehicles, leading to reduced social interaction and participation in our communities.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If the government proceeds with its plan, I feel it will be necessary to call for a rebate of the full cost of the fuel levy for all holders of an accessible parking permit.
       </p>
       <p>
        Phil is one example of the impact that this petrol tax will have on low- and middle-income Australians, and in particular on those with disabilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The petrol tax will also add a burden to the social service providers who do so much for our community. Southlakes Carers is one of these community organisations meeting a vital health need in my electorate. It provides medical transport, social support services and a day program for elderly people and people with a disability. It has three buses, each of which has a wheelchair and disabled access, which are used to transport clients to medical appointments, social activities such as visiting loved ones and shopping for groceries and to take people to and from the day centre in Morisset. However, the majority of the medical transport services are provided by volunteers who use their own vehicle.
       </p>
       <p>
        Vivienne Bruce, the manager of Southlakes Carers, tells me she fears the increase in petrol prices will have a devastating impact on her organisation. She says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Our volunteers are wonderful people who only want to give back to the community.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We subsidise their costs, but if petrol costs go up we may not be able to cover it and I'm really worried they may not be able to keep doing it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Vivienne says the group already struggles to cover costs, and many services are provided at a cost to the organisation. They charge a fee for their services, which Vivienne says is already relatively high, and they are often forced to reduce it for patients who cannot afford the fee. They receive no government support for transport costs and regularly undertake fundraising activities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The South Lake Macquarie area is located between two health districts, and two major hospitals,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hunter" rel="nofollow">
         John Hunter
        </a>
        and Wyong. It is a geographically large area, with few transport options for the elderly or people with a disability. There has been no wheelchair-accessible taxi service in the local area for a decade. The Southlakes Carers buses are the only community transport option for people with a disability in the area, the closest other being the Mercy service at Wallsend.
       </p>
       <p>
        Vivienne is also a member of the South Lake Macquarie Public Transport Action Group, which is calling for a public bus route between Morisset and Wyong. She describes the need for this:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Currently there is a route between Morisset and Wyong hospital that involves a train trip and between 1-2 bus trips. Many elderly people, however, can't cope with the train system because of the gaps in the platforms, and there is no lift at Wyee station.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This isn't a viable option for patients who need to get to Wyong Hospital. We would like to see a direct route and a subsidised fare that offers easier and more affordable transport options.
       </p>
       <p>
        She tells me that the biggest problem with the petrol tax is that it is not a cost-of-living increase in isolation. She says:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        If the petrol price increases, we may have to pass this on through higher fees.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        When you look at the cuts to pensions, and the extra $7 to see the doctor, and then if transport costs are on top of that, it seems obvious—something's got to give.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …   …   …
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I'm really worried that people who can't afford to pay any more will simply not go to the doctor.
       </p>
       <p>
        Across the board, families, businesses, the elderly and people with a disability will be hurt by this government and the measures contained within this budget. When combined, they drive up the cost of living, putting financial pressure and stresses on ordinary people. This is a choice of the government. At the same time that they are gagging debate on budget measures that attack low- and middle-income Australians, they are putting through this place their rolled gold paid parental leave scheme that will pay millionaire's $50,000 to have a baby, whereas the people in Charlton will receive less than $20,000 to have a baby. Why are the babies of Charlton worth $30,000 less than those of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         North Sydney
        </a>
        or Warringa? It yet again demonstrates the skewed priorities of this government that is intent on attacking the people who can least afford it.
