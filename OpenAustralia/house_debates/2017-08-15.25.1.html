        I rise today to commemorate and acknowledge the recent passing of Mick Morland, an icon from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Trobe" rel="nofollow">
         La Trobe
        </a>
        electorate who died in a tragic road accident last month. Mick served six terms as a councillor in our local government, including two separate years as the Mayor of the City of Casey. Last year, Mick was honoured with an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        for his service to local government and his community, truly exemplifying the work and dedication that Mick gave over the last 25 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        He was a staunch Rotarian who put in hundreds of hours volunteering with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        of

        </a>
        as well as being a passionate member of and volunteer with the local football club. Mick had great pride in his local area. He worked hard to deliver countless positive outcomes for our community, and whatever he took on was done to the best of his ability. He was involved in every major project in the local area.

        also say, on a personal note, that Mick was a great friend and supporter of mine. He was a Liberal branch member for so many years and a great supporter. I actually went up against him at a preselection and was successful, yet he was the first person to congratulate me and then worked on my campaign ever since. My thoughts are with his familyâ€”his wife, Kay, children and grandchildren. Above all, his legacy will live on in everything he achieved. Rest in peace, Mick Morland.
