       <p>
        There is something very special about the communities in Mallee. It is the spirit of camaraderie and belonging that makes me incredibly proud to be their representative.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week I visited Nhill, a town of nearly 2,500 people situated halfway between Adelaide and Melbourne. I was there to open the Nhill Lawn Tennis Club's new clubrooms, which I was delighted to be able to deliver funding for under the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program in the previous government. The event and the town epitomise a true sense of communityâ€”a sense of belonging which was on full display. The club lost their old clubrooms in a windstorm in 2019, but they have built back better, and last week was a celebration of that.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was great to hear from the club president, Simon Dufty, about how the new clubhouse is evidence of the health and spirit of the community. Evidence of that spirit is in the story of the late Len Mulhallen. His legacy will be part of the club's story in perpetuity, as he bequeathed funds to the club which meant so much to him and to his community. Speaking to his daughter, Jenny, and son-in-law, Alex, at the opening, I found it easy to share their pride, a reflection of the pride Len had in his club. Congratulations to the Nhill Lawn Tennis Club.
