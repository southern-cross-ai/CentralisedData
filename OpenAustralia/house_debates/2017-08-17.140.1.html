        Gibson, senator for the state of Tasmania from 1993 to 2002, and to convey my condolences to his wife and family. Brian was born in Melbourne. He was educated at

        , Ballarat, and then completed studies at the University of Melbourne. Prior to coming here in 1993, Brian had led a long and distinguished career, notably in Tasmania. That included being chairman of the Hydro-Electric Commission and being involved with the board of the

        Brian was elected to the Senate in 1993. He came here two years after I did. His vast experience and, indeed, his range of talents were almost immediately recognised when he was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, an office he held from 1994 to 1996, when the Howard government won power. He was Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer in 1996, before falling foul to what I think is generally regarded these days as a far-too-narrow ministerial code—one of a number of ministers in that early year of the Howard government that suffered under the breadth of a ministerial code subsequently changed and not gone back to at that level by any government ever since. Despite that loss of office, Brian remained optimistic. He remained a great contributor to this parliament during the remaining years, which he served in the Senate for the people of Tasmania until 2002.
       </p>
       <p>
        After leaving parliament and the Senate, Brian subsequently served on many business and charitable boards and made a continuing outstanding contribution not just to people in Tasmania but more broadly to the people of Australia. I always found Brian to be an impressive person: very thoughtful, a friendly and considerate person who was interested in the good of others and, indeed, the welfare and the future of the people of Australia. I extend my condolences to his wife, Pauline, and to his family. He was a great Australian. May he rest in peace.

         I understand it is the wish of honourable members to signify at this stage their respect and sympathy by rising in their places. I ask all present to do so.
