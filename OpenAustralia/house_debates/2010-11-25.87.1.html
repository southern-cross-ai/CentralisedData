         I thank the member for Fowler for his question and his ongoing campaigning on this very important public issue. Today, as many know, is White Ribbon Day. It is a day that was created in 1991 by a handful of Canadian men who met on the second anniversary of one man’s massacre of 14 women in Montreal, Canada. From that day this event has grown to the point where the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly" rel="nofollow">
          United Nations General Assembly
         </a>
         has recognised 25 November as a day when we have an opportunity to stop, to reflect and to act against violence against women and girls. Indeed, we do have some work to do. The facts are that there are nearly one in three Australian women who have experienced physical violence and almost one in five women who have been victims of sexual assault. These are damning statistics, they are appalling figures, because they effectively mean that in any one year almost half-a-million women in this country suffer physical or sexual violence. It is an intolerable situation and I am therefore very pleased that the White Ribbon Foundation in Australia is working very hard to create a national awareness of this problem. The foundation is working very hard with community groups and organisations to reduce this problem with a view to hopefully stamping it out.
        </p>
        <p>
         As a part of White Ribbon Day, Australian men are making a public oath to support the campaign and ensure that Australia becomes a safer place for women and girls. Today, in the Senate courtyard, this day was signified by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition and members and senators of all political persuasions meeting to make an oath and in some cases reaffirming their commitment ‘to not commit, excuse or remain silent about violence against women’ and to wear a white ribbon as a visual indication of this solemn commitment.
        </p>
        <p>
         The campaign goes from strength to strength. Today we have 1,200 white ribbon ambassadors, many of whom are in this place, but there is a lot more that needs to be done. I also note the efforts of a number of ministers, including the Minister for the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_of_Women" rel="nofollow">
          Status of Women
         </a>
         , who announced today a $1.1 million White Ribbon Workplace program to deliver ambassadors’ accreditation and awards in workplaces, where we know violence against women does occur all too prevalently. This government, indeed this parliament, has a zero tolerance approach to all forms of violence. We are working in partnership with women’s organisations, state and territory governments, other community groups and law enforcement agencies to reduce violence against women and girls. We are proud to be working alongside the outstanding community organisations that are committed to stamping out violence against women.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government today is calling on Australian men to show leadership in combating violence against women and girls. It is by not speaking out, it is by condoning violent behaviour and it is by turning a blind eye that men let themselves down. They let their communities down. Most importantly, they let down women and girls in this country. In particular, I call upon men in this place to make an oath, if they have not made an oath, and indeed urge all men in their constituencies to do the same.
