        My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. How will the passage of the Albanese Labor government's closing loopholes legislation provide job security and minimum standards for people who need it? How is the government making sure Australians earn more and keep more of what they earn?

        <p>
         I thank the member for Chisholm for the question. There are just over 80,000 taxpayers in Chisholm. They've already been getting pay rises, and, thanks to the government's tax plan, they're going to be getting tax cuts as well. Today is a good day for casuals, a good day for gig workers, a good day for truck drivers and people in road transport, and a good day for those workers who want to be able to know that, when they're on their weekend and not being paid, they can enjoy their weekend.
        </p>
        <p>
         I'm pleased to report to the House—and this will make many members happy and make those opposite cranky, but it's probably a bit late to make them cranky; that happened sometime earlier, like on waking up or something like that—that a majority of senators have declared support to pass the closing loopholes bill No. 2 today.
        </p>
        <p>
         I want to thank the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Greens" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Greens
         </a>
         for the negotiations that happened there. I want to thank Senator Lidia Thorpe, who's been strong in backing working people. I want to thank Senator David Pocock for the work that he's done in working through amendments. And while, Senator Lambie, we didn't end up reaching agreement on the bill as a whole, there will be some amendments—not all of Senator Lambie's amendments—that were negotiated and agreed amongst all of those who were part of the negotiations that we'll be supporting in good faith.
        </p>
        <p>
         It makes a palpable difference for workers who have had no minimum standards to now have some. When you say, 'What's the minimum wage for a gig worker?' There is none—until this bill goes through. It will go through, and gig workers in Australia will know that Australia is truly a country where you don't have to rely on tips to make ends meet, where you don't have all your rights fall off a cliff because you don't make a technical definition of employment.
        </p>
        <p>
         In road transport, we've heard too many stories, including in parliamentary inquiries, of drivers under intense pressure. One driver, Robert Ireland, reported 13 days straight on the road, where he would have to ply himself with 19 stubbies just to dissipate the effects of the methamphetamines that he was taking to meet the demands of work. Minimum standards for the road transport industry will now be possible. Ask the National Road Freighters Association, ask NatRoad, ask the Australian Trucking Association, ask all the organisations that those opposite previously lined up with that have now been supporting this reform.
        </p>
        <p>
         For casuals, your rent isn't casual; your mortgage isn't casual; your bills aren't casual. And, if your hours are completely reliable, casuals will now have a pathway to permanent work. Secure jobs and better pay might anger those opposite, but it makes a palpable difference to workers.
