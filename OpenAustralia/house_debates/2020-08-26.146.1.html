       <p>
        Whilst it has been some time since we have met physically in this place, I'm pleased to report that the Morrison government has continued delivering full steam ahead for the people of Stirling. Last week I joined my friend and colleague the member for Curtin for the turning of the sod of the Stephenson Avenue stage one extension. This important project will reduce congestion and help to unlock Stirling's potential as a second CBD. I am also working with the member for Curtin to champion a trackless tram in Stirling. This is a unique transport solution which will facilitate fast, efficient and green transport from the

        </a>
        right through to our beautiful coastline in Scarborough. The trackless tram will benefit tourists and residents alike, with additional development along

        , Doubleview, Innaloo and Scarborough. Where the rubber meets the road, quite literally in this case, the federal government has proven to be a big supporter. The minister for Population, Cities and Urban Infrastructure has been engaging closely with the

        , myself and the member for Curtin to analyse what federal government support can be made available to this national first project.

        Another project I'm extremely passionate about is the

        upgrade in Yokine. During 2019, I visited this centre along with our hardworking federal Treasurer. The Morrison government had already committed $300,000 for an upgrade to the centre, but we became very aware that, due to how run down it was, this was not going to be sufficient. So we fought hard to secure a $6 million commitment for an upgrade to transform the centre into a jewel in the crown for the Perth Jewish precinct and a home to a world-class Holocaust museum and

        memorial. I'm pleased to announce that, since then, the state government has also matched this funding and this, along with some community fundraising which is already underway, will see a rebuild to the tune of $15 million rather than just a renovation. This will also support jobs at this important time.
       </p>
       <p>
        On a smaller scale, I'm pleased to be able to visit community groups, schools and sporting organisations that have benefited from Morrison government grants. I recently spent a morning planting trees with some kids from the Glendale Primary School, who are benefitting from upgrades at the Hamersley Habitat Community Garden which were made possible under the Communities Environment Program. In summary, despite the disruptions of COVID, the Morrison government has been getting on with the job that it was elected to do: continuing to improve the lives and the livelihoods of everyone across the wonderful electorate of Stirling.
