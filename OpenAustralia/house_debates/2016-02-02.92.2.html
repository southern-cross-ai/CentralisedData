              <p>
               Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for Grayndler should know that, if he wishes to take advantage of what is usually a routine matter, he will need to spend the entire period of his 10 minutes explaining why this question should be put to the parliament about making these reports parliamentary papers as opposed to any other kind of paper. If he had perhaps given me notice of this I might have made an arrangement for him to be able to talk on this matter with his shadow counterpart, but he has not. He does need to make it very clear why, technically, these reports should be parliamentary papers under the standing orders and what that means, as opposed to dealing with the substance of the reports.

                 Absolutely. For the benefit of the Leader of the House, it helps if a report is made a parliamentary paper so that people can read what is in it. That is the point. Why they want to hide this report is that it says, for example, 'Consistent with this situation, departmental advice—

                  Mr Speaker, I am really loath to take a point of order on the former Leader of the House, because I know how experienced he is in these matters, but there are of course many ways of obtaining a report. One of them of course is to make it a parliamentary paper, which connotes certain privileges to that paper. What the member for Grayndler needs to debate is why this should be made a parliamentary and what that means, rather than other methods of making reports part of the
                  <i>
                   Hansard
                  </i>
                  , for example, in terms of tabling them. He is not doing that. He is in fact talking to the substance of the motion and now trying to pretend that the government is hiding the report, when in fact we are making it a parliamentary paper so that it will not be hidden from anybody. Even the member for Grayndler would be able to find it.

                    It is absolutely within my rights to speak to a motion about why it should be made a parliamentary paper so that it can be available to members of parliament. This has been an issue, Mr Speaker—and you would know full well—of some controversy. The reason that it is significant is that we are talking about transparency. That is why it is important that it be made a parliamentary paper. It is important that the taxpayers of Australia know—as they do through this report—that the department recommended against the funding of the

                                 The reason it should be made a parliamentary paper and available for discussion, including debate right now, is that we are talking about $1½ billion of taxpayers' money, on which the report found that the Victorian government—the then coalition government, which received this money—received interest of $49 million. That is $49 million that was given to the Victorian government that could have been paid off the deficit which they have created. The report shows very clearly that that is the case. That is why this whole debate is about transparency—and this is why it is an ongoing issue, Mr Speaker, because, as a result of the punishment of the people of Victoria for electing a Labor government, Victoria is now receiving some nine per cent of national infrastructure spending and investment, even though it is 25 per cent—

That is because they are missing out on infrastructure investment—nine per cent, in spite of the fact they are 25 per cent of the population. In addition to that, the fact is that this report shows what a shambles the federal government's infrastructure program is.
