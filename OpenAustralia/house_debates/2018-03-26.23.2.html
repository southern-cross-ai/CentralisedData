           I second the motion. I believe he will be a very good candidate. The democracy of Australia must be upheld by someone who has dignity and who has integrity. The member for Page has both of those things. I think he will uphold fairness in this chamber, which is very important so that people can have confidence in the robust discussion that takes place in this House of Representatives.

He's brought all his knowledge from education and finance to good effect in this House. He is an excellent character and I wish him well in his future role as the Deputy Speaker.

              ( The opposition congratulates the member for Page on being elected to the position of Deputy Speaker. We had great respect for the member for Parkes in the role and there is no doubt we look forward to the way in which the member will conduct the role, in particular that most important event of the day being the MPI, which is when the Deputy Speaker traditionally takes the chair. Like other members, I've known the member for Page for some time. We tend to spend most Easters together at Bluesfest. The music festival will have a new aura about it with the Deputy Speaker in attendance. We wish him well in his role and send our congratulations to him.

He's been a magnificent Deputy Speaker. He's now joined the ministry and that's a fitting tribute to his talents as well. From a selfish point of view, obviously, I will miss him, but welcome you, Member for Page. He's a template Deputy Speaker, can I say, and I'm looking forward to working with him very much indeed.
