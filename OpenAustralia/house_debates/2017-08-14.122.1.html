        In late July I had the chance to visit my old school,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safety_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Safety Bay
        </a>
        Senior High School. The grounds have changed a little. There are a few new buildings, and the uniform has changed for the better. It was fantastic to speak to over 60 students from the Pathfinders academic excellence program, explaining a little bit of what goes on in this place and answering questions they had about important policy and global issues. Every time I go to these things I am amazed at the enthusiastic nature and positive, open attitudes of the students and their teachers. Congratulations must go to the program coordinator, Ms Kirstie Young-Evans, and all of the students at the Safety Bay Senior High School.
       </p>
       <p>
        The questions from students are pointed. At every high school, including Safety Bay, I am asked where I stand on marriage equality. I am asked because these smart, savvy young people cannot believe that we in this place are still talking about this and not getting on with the job of allowing everyone to marry. I always encourage every Australian to participate in the democratic process and enrol to vote, but now it is more important than ever for young people to get active, get involved and get enrolled. Now that the government has delivered us a non-compulsory postal survey on the issue of marriage equality, it is the time for young people everywhere to enrol to vote and ensure that their voice for the future is heard so that equality can be made real.
       </p>
       <p>
        I say to the strong, smart, dynamic young people of Rockingham, Kwinana and across
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        : 'This is your time. This is your opportunity to make a very real difference to the Australia that you want to live in and that you want your friends and family to live in. Don't be resting on the sidelines for this moment. When you're a bit older and people ask you how you helped achieve marriage equality, make sure that you can say that you got involved, that you stood up for equality and that you voted.' I will be voting yes for marriage equality and I hope that young Australians will be too.
       </p>
       <p>
        This won't be the last time young Australians will be asked to move this country forward. It really is an exciting time to be a young Australian. Once we have turfed out this listless, leaderless, lacklustre Liberal government we will be able to progress important national issues about the future of Australia, issues that young Australians care deeply aboutâ€”reconciliation and agreement making with our Indigenous brothers and sisters, who have lived in this country for over 60,000 years, and ensuring that a person born here is no longer barred from being the Australian head of state. The young people I spoke with at my old school at Safety Bay will live to see Australia become a republic and to see our Indigenous peoples take their rightful place in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Constitution of Australia
        </a>
        . First, young Australians must enrol to vote now so that they can vote yes for marriage equality in this country and make marriage equality a reality.
