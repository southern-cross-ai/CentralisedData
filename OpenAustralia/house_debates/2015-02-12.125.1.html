        I rise today to outline an initiate I have commenced in my electorate of Lyne. In establishing this initiative my goal was to recognise and promote the involvement of youth in the community service activities of the community and reward ongoing contributions by students of high school age. The Federal Member's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_Service" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        s Award is a perpetual shield I have set up that has been given to each high school in the Lyne electorate, with the schools being free to elect a candidate they deem suitable. The successful recipient of this award is someone who has made a significant contribution to school life, as well as having participated in other volunteer activities and services within the community. I am extremely pleased with the reception this award has received amongst our local schools. I am equally impressed with the calibre of the 2014 award recipients. I had the pleasure of presenting a number of these awards to the students who are making an outstanding contribution, not only within their school communities but to the local community at large.

        I would like to particularly mention the 2014 Wingham High School award recipient, Kyra Yea, who was instrumental in organising school fundraising activities and initiatives that resulted in a donation in excess of $7,000 to the children's ward at Manning Base Hospital. Additionally, this recipient has a long list of voluntary community work, a small sample of which includes the coordination of anti-bullying campaigns and organising blood donation drives. When asked how she felt on receiving the award, she said she felt like all her hard work had paid off. I can say with confidence that all the recipients of the 2014 Federal Member's Community Services Award will continue to make outstanding contributions to their communities.
       </p>

        It is a privilege to be able to assist the local schools of Lyne and to recognise the future cornerstones of our local community. I look forward to hearing of their future endeavours as many students move forward to the next stages of their lives.
