       <p>
        I rise to speak on the notion of selective multiculturalism as the way forward in modern Australian society. Historically, the policy in Australia on the issue of multiculturalism has been assimilation with the prevailing Western culture on which Australian society was founded. Generations of migrants were expected to conform to Western culture. In subsequent years, there was a change in policy, with a more enlightened politically correct movement which promoted a blanket approach to multiculturalism, without due consideration of the potential for incompatibility of cultures or what course of action should be taken in the event of cultural conflicts.
       </p>
       <p>
        Consider the proposition that multiculturalism can take three forms: synergistic, complementary and conflicting. Synergistic multiculturalism occurs when two or more cultures combine to form a hybrid culture that yields spectacular results. For example, the fusion of Western capitalism with the Chinese Confucian philosophy has resulted in hugely successful emerging Asian economies by combining Western methods of efficient production and eastern discipline. The bleak factory landscapes of several emerging Asian economies are not dissimilar to the scenes from a Dickens novel which portrayed Britain during the industrial revolution, which turned

        into a dominant power in the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        Complementary multiculturalism occurs when two or more cultures interact in a positive way and provide greater diversity and choice. For instance, migrants have brought a rich selection of foods and cuisines to Australia, offering diners a greater selection, variety and choice. Even the great Aussie barbecue benefits from having satays, kebabs and koftas added to steaks, chops and sausages, providing an international smorgasbord that can be shared with neighbours from all over the world. Likewise, arts, music and cultural performances are all complementary.
       </p>
       <p>
        Conflicting multiculturalism is an awkward topic which politically correct society seeks to avoid. What happens when cultures collide? Which culture or legal system prevails? Will one be criticised for intervening on the basis of being prejudiced? There are many cultural conflicts in a multicultural society which are often left unresolved. For instance, different cultures have different views on issues such as the equality of women, attitudes to work and what is acceptable social conduct.
       </p>
       <p>
        What happens when new cultures conflict with long held Australian social norms? As a nation, we have struggled with this dilemma and have been reluctant to publically debate and resolve cultural conflicts. It is a reality that we cannot be all things to all people, yet we can select from the best in the world and adapt. The recent issue of radicalisation of youths leaving the country to take up arms, against Australia, has its origins deeper and over a longer period of time than simply over the internet and social media. There has been a clash of cultures in existence for some time in certain communities across Australia. These matters have not adequately been resolved, due to the politically-correct regime being reluctant to offend.
       </p>
       <p>
        Years ago, I was surprised when a 15-year-old new immigrant from a

        war-torn country, whom I attempted to befriend, asked if he could borrow my shotgun to use against members of a different ethnic group. Old hatreds, dating back centuries, have no place being transplanted in Australia. Selective multiculturalism is the notion that Australian society should be selective and only adopt those aspects of multiculturalism that are synergistic or complementary and that Australian culture should prevail where foreign cultures are inconsistent with long established social norms. I subscribe, wholeheartedly, to embracing the synergistic and complementary aspects of multiculturalism. However, where there is a clash of cultures, a conflict of ideals, then I advocate adherence to the prevailing Western system of Australian culture, in terms of conforming to social norms, maintaining the protestant work ethic, being diligent, embracing scientific principles and methods and being respectfulâ€”which are the things that make our society strong.
