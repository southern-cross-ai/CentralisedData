        After Logan Hospital,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redland_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Redland Hospital
        </a>
        has the worst ramping in Queensland. Back in 2019 37 per cent of all admissions were being ramped, 500 hours of ambulance time was being spent just sitting in an ambulance and at any time we had 20 ambulances basically doing nothing. So on a weekend when there was a head injury at Capalaba Warriors and then there was a broken leg that led to compartment syndrome there was no ambulance for an hour because they were are stuck at the hospital. The latest data has not 37 per cent but 51 per cent—that is if you are taken by ambulance to Redland Hospital you are more likely than not to be ramped.
       </p>
       <p>
        I've done all I can as a federal MP: put $16 million into a multistorey car park—which you're going to fill with ambulances with patients that you can't admit—and a $30 million commitment to a clinical upgrade they won't even start building three years on. We need people with ticker to get things moving. Paul Lincoln was an innocent patient walking past a row of stretchers and a woman, lying in an ambulance stretcher, waiting to be admitted at 9 am was still waiting at 9 pm. We have got a state MP so worried about hurtful work-related Facebook posts that she never answers a single public question. She doesn't have the ticker to even answer these work-related questions. Stop being so indifferent. Get out there and fix and fund this hospital. Redland Hospital, let's fight for fair funding. The community will do it. The federal government's doing it. We need a state Labor government that can run a hospital.
