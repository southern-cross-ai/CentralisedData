       <p>
        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to the Prime Minister’s press conference of 23 February this year and his statement that the cabinet had not received reports of safety concerns under the Home Insulation Program. Will the Prime Minister now concede that the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts warned him of safety issues on 12 distinct occasions across three letters dated 27 August, 28 October and 30 October? Is it not a fact that the Prime Minister knew about safety concerns all along and why is he still hiding the 14 August letter received from Minister Garrett?

         I thank the honourable member for his question. First of all, could I turn to the correspondence that he refers to: Minister Garrett’s letters to me dated 27 August, 28 October and 30 October. These have been provided to the Senate in their entirety, although not requested by the Senate orders, complete with my letters to Mr Garrett dated 4 September, 29 October and 2 November. These have been provided voluntarily to the Senate. Furthermore, as I outlined in the House on 11 March, there are a number of actions and changes to the program that the responsible minister proposed during 2009 to address a range of safety issues. These have all been reviewed by Dr Hawke in the context of his review.
        </p>
        <p>
         The member for Flinders asks about cabinet deliberations. I refer him to the updates which were provided to the cabinet through the Nation Building and Jobs Plan implementation reports. I have reported on those earlier in this parliament. Furthermore, could I say to the honourable member for Flinders that, from 1 July 2009, subsequent to the introduction of the program, there were a number of changes to it. The

         , Water, Heritage and the Arts issued 26 installer notices under their Home Insulation Program that went to every registered installer. These notices often dealt with safety issues, including reminders around electrical safety and any updates to the program guidelines. Furthermore, can I say to the member for Flinders that, from 1 July 2009—

                      On 14 August, I received a letter from the minister proposing increased compliance requirements for the Home Insulation Program. On 17 August, the relevant cabinet committee considered the compliance issues raised by the minister in his 14 August letter. The committee approved changes to the program guidelines, including requiring physical site inspections and a range of other measures. On 27 August 2009, I received a letter from the minister proposing changes to the program to require installers to provide physical evidence of qualifications and/or competencies before they are registered.
                     </p>
                     <p>
                      On 28 August the changes to the program guidelines were released. Furthermore, these guidelines required from 1 September 2009 the following: the requirement for installers to undertake a physical site inspection before providing a written quote to improve the quality of quotations; the requirement of installers, including those currently in the process of registering, to provide evidence of qualifications and/or competencies at the time of registration; and the provision of a price guide advisory for different types of insulation products and other variables to educate householders and installers. Furthermore installers charging above the maximum recommended price would be required to explain why—

                         on the quote provided to the householders. On 28 October the minister wrote to me to indicate the actions he intended to take in response. These included requiring householders to get two quotes and to publish a public list of deregistered installers. On 29 October, I responded to this letter agreeing to the minister’s proposal to tighten the guidelines.

                         On 30 October Minister Garrett wrote to me in relation to safety issues in the Home Insulation Program. The letter proposed to roll out an electrical safety testing program for homes that had had foil insulation and proposed a ban on metal fasteners and proposed to mandate the use of covers over down lights and other ceiling appliances.

                         On 2 November 2009, I replied to the minister noting the package of safety measures he had proposed and from 2 November 2009, under the Home Insulation Program, metal fasteners for foil insulation were banned. Installation of covers over down lights and other ceiling appliances were mandated. The government announced it was implementing a target electrical safety program.

To remind the honourable member what I said about it at that time:

                          On 17 August, the relevant cabinet committee considered the compliance issues raised by the minister in his 14 August letter. The committee approved changes to the program guidelines which included requiring the following: physical site inspections prior to giving quotes, increased inspections and scrutiny of trainer qualifications, increased compliance communications and processes for suspending and deregistering non-compliant installers.
