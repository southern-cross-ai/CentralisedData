        It's football fever at the moment in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. It has been fantastic to be able to visit a number of games in the football and netball leagues. This weekend we had mixed results from a Deakin electorate perspective. A very good win for Mitcham over
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Belgrave" rel="nofollow">
         South Belgrave
        </a>
        . Commiserations to my good friend the member for Casey. Mitcham got over the line by five points in the division 1 grand final.

        In another premiership, congratulations to Matt McCubbin and all the team at the Mitcham Football Club for building a phenomenal club. To have won a division 1 premiership is fantastic. Commiserations to the Heathmont footy club, who went down yesterday to Boronia. It was a very valiant performance to even make it to the grand final, given some of the trials and tribulations during the season. It's so wonderful that they got there. It was also good for me to get along to the Vermont preliminary final, where they beat
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doncaster_East" rel="nofollow">
         Doncaster East
        </a>
        . Vermont will be flying the flag for the Deakin electorate in the grand final this Saturday. The powerhouse that Vermont is, we are all hoping that they can get over the line.

        A shout out to all of the volunteers at the home grounds that make it happen in our area. The Mitcham footy club hosted the finals at Walker Park. It's a huge effort for our volunteers. A few weeks ago I was on the barbecue with the Ringwood Football Club, who were hosting the finals at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jubilee_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Jubilee Park
        </a>
        . There are literally dozens of volunteers who make these things happen for our community.
