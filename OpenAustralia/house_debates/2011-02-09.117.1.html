       <p>
        I would like to talk today about an issue in my electorate which benefits not just Geelong but the entire Barwon region. It is a celebration of family and friends and of the ties that bind us as a community. At its heart it is a celebration of boys and men as fathers, sons, grandfathers, work mates, team mates and neighbours—in fact, all men of all ages and all backgrounds who make up our community. The initiative is called Blokes Day Out. It is a Geelong initiative and it is on again next month. Blokes Day Out was run for the first time last year, but this year it promises to be bigger and even better. One of the reasons I think it is so fantastic is that it is so completely supported by many of our community groups, services, businesses and organisations that have put up their hands and become involved.
       </p>
       <p>
        Blokes Day Out kicks off with a blokes breakfast on 25 March. It seems fitting to me that this will be held at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ_Church" rel="nofollow">
         Christ Church
        </a>
        , as this Geelong institution for years made sure that people facing hard times in our city did not have to start the day on an empty stomach. So breakfast at Christ Church is a wonderful way to celebrate a nourishing of our community and our relationships. Then there will be a week of activities, from art classes, dads’ playgroups, fitness classes, cooking classes, forums, health screenings and workshops—the list goes on. The final event will be on Sunday, 3 April. It will be a festival in Johnson Park. The focus here is on boys’ and men’s health and wellbeing. There will be entertainment, activities and health checks for blokes and their families.
       </p>
       <p>
        Men often do not give much thought to their health and the pressures they face caring for their families. They often are not good at sharing their emotions, talking of their stresses and seeking help. This is a concern to me because many chronic illnesses and conditions can be prevented with information, support and lifestyle changes. Really that is what Blokes Day Out is all about. It is a great opportunity to look at how blokes, their families and their friends can live their lives in a healthier and more fulfilling way. It is also about encouraging blokes to take up their critical role in raising their children and enjoying their family.
       </p>
       <p>
        The support from the Geelong community has been overwhelming. Already more than 40 organisations are committed to making the festival a great day. The Care Leavers Australia Network will be there. That is an organisation that I am very proud to be associated with. Also community organisations like

        and the Men’s Shed will be involved on the day. I congratulate the City of Greater Geelong and Barwon Health for their contributions. In recent weeks across many parts of Australia, particularly Queensland, Victoria and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , we have seen how communities that support each other are communities that survive and thrive. The willingness to support each other is clearly in evidence here in Geelong with the Blokes Day Out. It is something I am very proud to see.
