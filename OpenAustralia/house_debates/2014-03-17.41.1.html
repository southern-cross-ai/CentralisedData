        ) ( ): I rise today to acknowledge an exceptional Canberra businesswoman, Christine Macauley. Last month Kris was inducted into the Australian Businesswomen's Network Hall of Fame. This hall of fame recognises women who have been exemplary in their industries, are trailblazers and demonstrate inspiring and aspiring business journeys.
       </p>
       <p>
        Kris and her husband Colin own Robbo's Motorcycles, a well-known local business located in Fyshwick. Robbo's has a rich history dealing in Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Not only does Robbo's service and sell new and used motorcycles; it is also hub for the Harley enthusiasts of the Canberra region.
       </p>
       <p>
        Kris wanted to be more involved in the family business and she wanted a formal education so that she could better support the running of Robbo's. She enrolled at the University of Canberra, where she undertook a

         Bachelor of Communications
        </a>
        . She went on to complete her master's and is currently working on her PhD on 'Wives in Business'.
       </p>
       <p>
        She has been actively involved in the Canberra small business community and continues to advocate for the needs of all Canberra's small businessesâ€”particularly women in business. She was a finalist for the 2011 University of Canberra Distinguished Alumni Award for Professional Achievement and received an Order of Australia in the 2013 Queen's Birthday Awards.
       </p>
       <p>
        Canberra is very proud of Kris, who has been rightfully recognised for her wonderful achievements.
       </p>

        I also acknowledge that my 90-second statement today was researched and written by Ruby Whalan, a 16-year-old student from Canberra College who did work experience in my office two weeks ago. We loved having you with us, Ruby. Thanks so much.
