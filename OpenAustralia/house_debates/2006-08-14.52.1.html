        My question is to the Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. Did the minister or a member of his office assist Mr Gregory Andrews to prepare for his anonymous interview on the ABC Lateline program in June this year? Did this assistance include coaching on the form and content of Mr Andrews’s presentation?

         I thank the member for his question. We had a similar question last week, which I answered in full. I say again: Mr Andrews did appear on that show. He did so with his face blacked out because he was concerned for his own safety. He did so because he had been threatened previously when giving evidence. In preparation for that interview, Mr Andrews sought and received assistance from the department on liability issues so that he would not either contravene the Public Service Code of Conduct or in fact make libellous comments. Those were the reasons.
        </p>
        <p>
         He also provided the information of his notes to my office. My office did not coach him in any way. What he was referring to was not as a public servant of the Commonwealth; it was to his time as an officer working on behalf of the

           The fact is that there were a number of very concerned Australian citizens, concerned about what has been going on at Mutitjulu, who reported in the
