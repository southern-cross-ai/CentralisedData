        <p>
         I thank the member for the question and congratulate you, Speaker, on your election last week. Labour mobility is central to the government's agenda for engaging with the Pacific. It is also central to engaging with the government's agenda to tackle the skills shortage in regional Australia. The Pacific Australia Labour Mobility scheme, or
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PALM" rel="nofollow">
          PALM
         </a>
         , allows workers from the Pacific countries to come to Australia to work in sectors like horticulture, tourism and hospitality. It helps Australian employers facing skills shortages, it supports Australia's regional economies, it gives Pacific countries a source of remittance income and, vitally, it gives
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Islanders" rel="nofollow">
          Pacific Islanders
         </a>
         the chance to learn new skills. It truly is a win-win for economic development in the Pacific and it deepens Australia's engagement with the region.
        </p>
        <p>
         PALM grew out of the Pacific Seasonal Worker Program established in 2012 by the former Labor government. Now in 2022, the Albanese Labor government is expanding PALM as part of our Pacific policy to repair the damage done by the last government under their Pacific stuff-up. We will make PALM more attractive for employers and workers by reducing the burden of travel costs for employers, allowing Pacific workers to bring in family members and, critically, improving protections against worker exploitation. Importantly, we will also broaden the scheme so it tackles skills shortages not only in traditional areas like agriculture but also in new sectors like aged care, which are suffering due to the disgraceful neglect of the previous government.
        </p>
        <p>
         During the recent very successful
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Islands_Forum" rel="nofollow">
          Pacific Islands Forum
         </a>
         meeting in Fiji, I visited the Australia Pacific Training Coalition facility in Suva with Prime Minister Albanese. We met around 40 enthusiastic women who were training to work in aged-care centres in regional Queensland, from Mackay to Toowoomba. They were studying the theory and carrying out the practical training for certificate III qualifications. They were absolutely thrilled to be coming to Australia to look after aged-care residents.
        </p>
        <p>
         As the Prime Minister said, it was a great day because it highlighted the importance of the PALM scheme and it demonstrated the government's commitment to improved aged care is already translating into outcomes in the labour market. The Australia Pacific Training Coalition told us that the government's election commitments were a key driver of why they had stepped up training in aged care. Labor started the Pacific Labor Mobility Program and now the new Labor government is expanding it. This will deliver economic benefits for regional Australia and it will support economic and social development in the Pacific, repairing a damaged relationship that occurred under the last government, where you had a

           Mr Speaker, even on the ruling that you've given, there was nothing in this question inviting the minister to comment on what happened under the previous government, so you should draw him back to the terms of the question.
