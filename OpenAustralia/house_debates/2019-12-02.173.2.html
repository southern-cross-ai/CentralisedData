        News is finally starting to come out of Iran about the atrocities that have been committed. Recently, protests broke out over petrol prices and the Iranian government responded disproportionately and with appalling human rights abuses.

        is reporting that at least 180 people have been killed, and possibly hundreds more. Many unarmed protesters were reportedly shot in the head and chest. At least 2,000 have been wounded and 7,000 detained. All of this has been obscured from international scrutiny by the regime's decision to cut off the internet for two weeks. This internet blackout has also meant that deeply worried Australian Iranians have been unable to contact their family and friends back in Iran. Iran's economy may be crippled by heavy

        Thus far, it seems that the Morrison government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs,

        , have been silent on the deaths and violence in Iran. It's time to add Australia's voice to the international concern. I urge the Australian government to make a public statement about this issue and to call in the Iranian Ambassador to Australia. The protests are not isolated to Iran. Similar protests are happening across the

        , including in Iraq and Lebanon, and we must show our support. As an Iranian friend of mine said last week, the youth are standing up 'right now in the streets with empty hands, with their lives'. We must make it clear that Australia will not tolerate the deaths of protesters and will not stand for the mistreatment of those who have been arrested.
