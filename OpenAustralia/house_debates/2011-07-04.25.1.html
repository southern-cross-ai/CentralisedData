      <p class="italic">
       Thank you for your letter dated 30 March 2011, concerning a petition submitted for the consideration of the Standing Committee on Petitions regarding the sale of the Warrnambool Post Office and the closure of its business centre.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Under the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 Australia Post is responsible for the day-to-day running of the organisation, including all decisions relating to the postal network. As far as practicable it is required to perform its functions in a manner consistent with sound commercial practice.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Australia Post has noted that it understands that there is a strong demand for postal services in Warrnambool and in response to recent community feedback has decided to offer a range of postal services at both Koroit Street and Timor Street post offices. The new arrangements address the concerns of the community about the ongoing provision of services to business customers, the number of service counters at Timor Street and access to free parking in close proximity to the Koroit Street Post Office.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       At Timor Street, a counter will be retained for the collection of carded articles and to service business account customers. This will also minimise wait times at the Koroit Street Post Office. Business account customers will be able to lodge mail and pre-order stamps and other postal products for collection the following day. Post office boxes for Koroit Street and Timor Street will be consolidated in a single location at Timor Street in a new walk-in lobby with full weather protection.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       At Koroit Street, there will be eight counters to service customers, including a dedicated counter for identity services transactions such as processing Passport applications and Working With Children Checks. This newly refurbished Post Office is set to be fully operational from 23 May 2011 with retail counter services, including cash transactions, bill payments and identity services, being transferred from Timor Street to the Koroit Street location on Friday 20 May 2011.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       Australia Post acknowledges the importance of car parking for its customers and has negotiated with the Warrnambool City Council to provide a small number of free, 15-minute parking spaces in the Ozone car park, along with a disabled parking space at the front of the outlet.
      </p>
      <p class="italic">
       I trust this information will be of assistance.
      </p>
      <p>
       from the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, Senator Conroy
