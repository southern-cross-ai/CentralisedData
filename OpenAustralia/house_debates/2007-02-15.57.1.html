        I want to raise a similar matter to that raised by the Manager of Opposition Business. I will not repeat all of the points he made, which I agree with, but I am concerned about the implications and I ask you to consider this when you are in those further considerations. What we had today was a defence that this was a statement in public circulation in Queensland and it was eventually realised that it had to be withdrawn only if the Leader of the Opposition objected. The equivalent of that, Mr Speaker, is that if we in this parliament were to call the Prime Minister a ‘lying rodent’, which was in public circulation in Queensland, you would say that it only had to be withdrawn if the Prime Minister himself objected. That is a very dangerous road down which you have started us, Mr Speaker.

          Order! I would point out that to use such an expression would be considered to be unparliamentary. But I remind the member for Fraser that if he looks at page 499 of the
          <i>
           Practice
          </i>
          that it states quite clearly that it is not only the words that are used but the context in which they are used.

          <p>
           Further to your comments concerning disorderly conduct in the House and the requirement for members to conduct themselves with some decorum, you have drawn to our attention page 499 of
           <i>
            Practice
           </i>
           . I also draw to your attention page 500 of
           <i>
            Practice
           </i>
           , which I think is at the core of the difficulties in the House today. It says:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           In the Chamber and the Main Committee Members may not be referred to by name, but by the name of their electoral division, or by the title of their parliamentary or ministerial office.
          </p>
          <p>
           Importantly,
           <i>
            Practice
           </i>
           then goes on to say:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           The purpose of this rule is to make debate less personal and avoid the direct confrontation of Members addressing one another as ‘you’.
          </p>
          <p>
           Further, it goes on to say:
          </p>
          <p class="italic">
           A degree of formality helps the House remain more dignified and tolerant when political views clash and passions may be inflamed.
          </p>
          <p>
           In the light of today’s proceedings and your comments a minute ago, I request that you reflect over the break on page 500 of
           <i>
            Practice
           </i>
           and your requirements under the standing orders to intervene when you think it is appropriate, not just when a member thinks a comment has been made which is disorderly, so as to maintain decorum and proper conduct in this House, having regard to page 500 of
           <i>
            Practice
           </i>
           .

            <p>
             Mr Speaker, with all due respect, the whole point of my question to you, the question from the member for Fraser and the question from the member for Batman is that this is about your role as Speaker and upholding the standing orders. It is inappropriate now for you to ask the Leader of the Opposition in such a fashion. I would ask that you reflect on the ruling and report back to the House next Monday.
