        On 18 December 2009, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_General_Assembly" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations General Assembly
        </a>
        proclaimed 2011 the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Year" rel="nofollow">
         International Year
        </a>
        for People of African Descent. It declared that 2011 is aimed at:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … strengthening national actions and regional and international cooperation for the benefit of people of

         African descent
        </a>
        in relation to their full enjoyment of economic, cultural, social, civil and political rights, their participation and integration in all political, economic, social and cultural aspects of society, and the promotion of a greater knowledge of and respect for their diverse heritage and culture.
       </p>
       <p>
        For most Australians the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
         UN
        </a>
        resolution has probably gone unnoticed. The links between Australia and Africa have, however, been growing in recent years as more people of African descent resettle in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Africa is a continent with a fascinating history. It is rich in resources and rich in culture. Sadly, it has also been a continent of much poverty, turmoil, conflict, brutality and oppression.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_African" rel="nofollow">
         The African
        </a>
        people are still some of the most disadvantaged in the world, and the UN resolution is clearly aimed at reducing that disadvantage. Australia has a role and a responsibility in doing that, both for Africans here and for those living in Africa.
       </p>
       <p>
        African families, like all new settlers to Australia, have had to adjust to a new homeland, and that has not always been easy. Similar to other new arrivals, they have often been received with caution by the communities in which they settle. Today the African people are contributing to Australia’s productivity, adjusting to Australian life and building a better future for their families. They work hard and they often do the jobs that others reject. I have African families in my own neighbourhood. I see them at citizenship ceremonies, where they are always the best dressed and have the biggest smiles, and I see them at community events. I worked with them during my time as a board member of the South Australian Migrant Resource Centre, which for most of that time was chaired by the charismatic African Ben Yengi,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Today the South Australian African community is led by a great ambassador for the African people, Dr Joseph Masika. Dr Masika, whom I feel proud to call a friend, is keen to ensure that the International Year for People of African Descent does not simply become a year of rhetoric in which little is achieved.
       </p>
       <p>
        To that end, I am indeed encouraged by initiatives I see throughout my own electorate, where Australia’s links with Africa are being strengthened and disadvantage is being overcome. Principal

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyndale_Christian_School" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and his wife Danni have adopted African children and, since 2002, the school has been supporting two orphanages and a babies home in Kenya. Every second year a contingent of parents, students and staff go to Kenya where they provide practical and financial assistance to the orphanages. Their work has been directly associated with the building of Tyndale Cottage, a home for 30 children aged up to 16 years, as well as the building of a medical clinic, a soccer field, two basketball courts, swings and a bathroom for children with disabilities. Tyndale has also financially assisted with school fees, uniforms, educational materials and medical and food bills.
       </p>
       <p>
        In a similar initiative, since 2005,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Grove" rel="nofollow">
         Golden Grove
        </a>
        Primary School has been sponsoring a young African student, Lee Mavuka, in the Chivi district in Zimbabwe. The support, which has now been extended to Lee’s community, includes school books, stationery, clothing, food and basic necessities. All the money is raised within the Golden Grove school community through the donations and fundraising activities. To quote Karen Crabtree from the Golden Grove Primary School:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It has been an amazing journey and a wonderful learning experience for the students to see how we can make a difference.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another example is the work of the Modbury Uniting Church, where an international women’s group has been established. The group, which has a strong focus on African women, provides a safe place for new arrivals to meet. It also provides
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , dressmaking, English language, cooking, healthy eating and driving test tuition. The initiative, led by Wendy Sinnott and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Thomas" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , assists women in adjusting to their new homeland and building their self-confidence so that they can take control of their lives.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also commend the work of Pastors Ralph and Wilma Legge of the City International Christian Church, who run a very similar program. Their church has a particularly strong following of African people from Liberia,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Leone" rel="nofollow">

        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        of Congo and Burundi.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lastly, I mention Pastor Mark Baker and the Harvest Christian team at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingle_Farm" rel="nofollow">
         Ingle Farm
        </a>
        . Each year the centre hosts the Watoto Children’s Choir from Uganda, in order to raise awareness of the needs in Uganda and also to raise funds to assist the people there. The Watoto Children’s Choir only recently visited again, on 27 February this year. Although I was unable to attend their performance, because I was on my way to Canberra, I have attended previous performances and have heard for myself their beautiful singing and their incredible stories.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hopefully, these examples will inspire others in this, the Year for People of African Descent, to make a difference to the lives of African people, wherever they live.
