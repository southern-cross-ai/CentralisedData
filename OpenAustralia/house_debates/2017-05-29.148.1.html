       <p>
        At a time when communities across Australia and indeed across the world need spirits lifted, I would like to reflect on the great success of a regular event in my electorate which is fast becoming a local phenomenon, the Eats &amp; Beats food truck festival. This event, organised by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logan_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Logan City Council
        </a>
        , is held each month in the city of Logan, with local food truck vendors and musicians working together to put on a terrific night of festivity and entertainment. Thousands of people attend this event each time it is held, and, every time, those thousands come away with a true sense of wonder about the community they live in. It has truly become a must-do event for our families, and it is something that young and old alike can enjoy.
       </p>
       <p>
        On Friday night, the festival arrived in the Beenleigh Town Square, and yet again it was a time to remember. For many of my constituents in the area it was an important chance to unwind and relax following the massive flood clean-up efforts, which are still dominating our local agenda. Events like this are so crucial where community spirits are concerned. I want to give a heartfelt thankyou today to everyone who makes them possible. Eats &amp; Beats first launched in Logan in 2015, and, if its recent success is any indication, it will continue for a long time to come.
       </p>

        I would also like to reflect today on the huge success of the Beenleigh Town Square itself, which made it possible to host events like Eats &amp; Beats in our community. The project, completed in 2015, transformed Beenleigh's town centre from a headache-inducing six-way roundabout into a pedestrian-friendly plaza for the local community. It was officially opened by the Prime Minister,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malcolm_Turnbull" rel="nofollow">
         Malcolm Turnbull
        </a>
        , in 2015 and since then has reinvigorated Beenleigh by providing an attractive community hub right in the heart of town. The project was a collaboration between three levels of government, including the federal government contributing $3 million as our part of the Community Development Grants Program. It gives me great pleasure to report in this chamber today just how positive it has been for the social and economic infrastructure of the community of Beenleigh and surrounds. The venue was full from 5 pm until 9 pm on Friday night, with many new memories made and people catching up with old friends and making new friends. The food was fabulous. It is obvious that the square will continue to be a source of positivity for the area for many years to come.
