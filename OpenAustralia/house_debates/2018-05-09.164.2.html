        I'm delighted to announce and acknowledge 10 local recipients of grants under the federal government's Stronger Communities Program. I want to pay tribute to the very important work that community groups in my electorate do in building, developing and fostering stronger communities. I'd like to begin with the Sydenham Park Soccer Club, which received $20,000 to install new lights and to open up an additional ground for junior training. Junior soccer is one of the most popular forms of sport for young people in my electorate. The Brimbank Bicycle Education Centre received $6,000 to improve playground facilities. They do a great job of facilitating bicycle education for young people. Another great soccer club in my electorate, the Upfield Soccer Club, received $17,352 for new fencing around the grounds to enhance player safety and ground maintenance. The Tullamarine Community House received $19,000 to fit out and furnish a new men's shed, which we're all very excited about. The

        received $3,586 for goalpost covers, again to increase player safety. The Jacana Junior Football Club received $20,000 for upgrading lights to cater for increased ground use and to save on energy costs. My favourite organisation, Brite Services, received $15,190 to help refurbish the entrance to the building in order to make it more accessible and welcoming. Chaldean Welfare of Victoria received $19,870 to purchase a new sound system to ensure greater inclusion for those using the centre, which they are building and are very proud of. The Australian Assyrian Arts and Literature Foundation received $9,000 to install shade sails for more outdoor communal activities.

        Finally, Banksia Gardens Community Services received $20,000 to fit out and furnish a new portable building, called Youthspace 3047, for the Broadmeadows Youth Justice Alliance. As part of the Stronger Communities grants, I was able to officially open Banksia Gardens Community Services' new building, Youthspace 3047, together with the state member for Broadmeadows, the Hon.

        Mediation and Counselling, and Jesuit Social Services. The new range of onsite services is part of an exciting partnership where young people can come to a safe and friendly place in order to seek assistance.
