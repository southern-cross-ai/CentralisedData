        Today I rise to speak about the Young family, who reside in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Rocks" rel="nofollow">
         Two Rocks
        </a>
        , the northernmost suburb of my Pearce electorate in metropolitan Perth.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Young" rel="nofollow">
         Chris Young
        </a>
        and his family purchased a local supermarket in Two Rocks 15 years ago and have since become the heart of the community. Starting with just four employees, Chris has expanded the IGA's staff to 30, providing much-needed local jobs in the area. Alongside his father, John, Chris has played a vital role in establishing and maintaining Cellarbrations liquor store, the Pickled Herring restaurant and the licensed post office and newsagency. The success of these businesses reflect the Young family's commitment to and understanding of serving the needs of the local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Chris, John and their staff are often the first to be called upon for support, whether for advice, fundraising donations, home deliveries due to illness or even security checks after a break-in. Chris is a reliable, well-respected member of the Two Rocks community. His support for local clubs, groups and the community is outstanding. From donating meat pies to local sports clubs and sponsoring his beloved Yanchep Red Hawks Football Club to hosting pop-up bake sales for fundraising and storing groceries for residents during power outages, Chris has done it all. There is not a single community or sporting group that hasn't benefited from Chris's generosity.
       </p>
       <p>
        They say the local corner store is the lifeblood of the community, and in Chris Young's case this is absolutely true. We all say a very heartfelt collective thankyou to Chris Young.
