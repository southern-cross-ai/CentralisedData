       <p>
        I would like to acknowledge and pay tribute to the life of Mr Alby Burgin. He was a Freeman of the City of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Macquarie" rel="nofollow">
         Lake Macquarie
        </a>
        and he died last week. He was a committed sailor. Days before he died, he was sailing on Lake Macquarie. He was 93 years of age. He was a regular attendee at every citizenship ceremony at Lake Macquarie. He was a truly great and committed Lake Macquarie resident and a person who cared about and worked to serve Lake Macquarie at all times.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to bring to the attention of the House an issue I have raised on many occasions, which is a post office at Jewells. I have referred many petitions to the Petitions Committee. I have with me today a folder of letters of support for the post office at Jewells. I seek leave to table that folder and ask that that folder be given to the Petitions Committee because it contains a lot of information that would be very helpful to them in their deliberations. It supports those petitions that they have already received and also the fact that we need a post office at Jewells.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
