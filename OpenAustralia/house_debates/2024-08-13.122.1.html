       <p>
        Volunteers are the backbone of our communities. Without volunteers, meals would not be delivered to those in need, kids would not have sports coaches, and young parents would not get the opportunity to connect at their local playgroups. Volunteers touch every part of our community. The Albanese government understands this and the exceptional work they do. That's why each year we give out volunteer grants to worthy organisations. In the latest round, there were 25 successful grant recipients, receiving $66,000, across my electorate of Corangamite. To honour the work of these volunteers, I made a commitment to meet every one of them and personally say thank you. I've just completed my mission and visited all 25 in the past five weeks.
       </p>
       <p>
        This recognition is important because—you may not be aware of this—since COVID there has been a significant decrease in volunteering across the nation, and, as a consequence, community groups are struggling to fill the roles needed to keep local clubs and groups flourishing. These groups go some way to help addressing that gap. The funding can support a wide range of critical needs, from purchasing small portable equipment to covering the cost of training volunteers, reimbursing fuel expenses and conducting background checks for those working with vulnerable people.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity now to acknowledge some of the amazing volunteer groups. Queenscliffe Neighbourhood House is a much-loved part of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borough_of_Queenscliffe" rel="nofollow">
         Borough of Queenscliffe
        </a>
        . I visited their centre to thank them for their contribution to our community and congratulate them on receiving a volunteer grant of $2,000 to help this dedicated group to purchase essential equipment and training.
       </p>
       <p>
        Then there's the 3216 Connect Op Shop in Grovedale, which is not just an op shop but an awesome place where people in a community hub care about our most vulnerable. I'm so proud to have helped them secure $1,000 through the Corangamite volunteer grant to train their volunteers, who work hard to help ease the financial burden for those most in need. The op shop offers fresh fruit and vegetables for those who cannot afford to put food on the table, and it provides warm blankets and clothes for our region's most vulnerable.
       </p>
       <p>
        Then there's the Geelong Ostomy group, who I visited last week to congratulate them on being awarded a Corangamite volunteer grant to purchase first-aid equipment. Their dedication and tireless efforts make such a difference, and it is truly inspiring.
       </p>
       <p>
        Anam Cara is a beautiful place in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waurn_Ponds" rel="nofollow">
         Waurn Ponds
        </a>
        that provides local families with palliative care choices and end-of-life care. I thank them for their contribution to our community, and I thank the volunteers, who recently received a volunteer grant of $1,500 for training. Their dedication brings comfort and dignity to those in their most vulnerable moments, and their selfless service is deeply appreciated.
       </p>
       <p>
        These are all examples of essential work, and it's often carried out by volunteers who go unrecognised. Yet I'm continually inspired by their unwavering drive and dedication to our community. They ask for no recognition and quietly go about their roles with no fanfare, making a significant impact behind the scenes. They ensure that our sports are played, those in need are cared for, and our communities are safe and protected. A volunteer grant represents more than just financial support. It is a token of our appreciation, a recognition of the countless hours volunteers have invested, and a symbol of our shared commitment to the causes they champion. These grants are a way to say thank you—thank you for your passion, for your dedication and for the positive impact you make every single day.
