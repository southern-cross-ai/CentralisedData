        </a>
        2015 Small Business Awards, showcasing the achievements of local entrepreneurs at a gala dinner held at the Joondalup Resort Hotel on 20 November. Our region can be described as an emerging economic powerhouse. In the June 2015 quarter, the unemployment rate in the city of Joondalup was 2.9 per cent, less than half of that of the national average of six per cent. Our gross regional product grew 6.2 per cent in the past year to $5.88 billion. Total tourism and hospitality sales amounted to $850.7 million. Retail trade is the largest employer in our region, generating 9,270 local jobs, whilst the local construction industry generated $3.19 billion last year.
