        One of the privileges of a member of parliament is to participate in so many events in their electorate. Last week I was delighted to be welcomed by Brahmachari Gautam to the Chinmaya Mission Melbourne in Templestowe. Also there was Deputy Mayor Dot Haynes. I had the privilege of addressing over 200 faithful at the ashram, relaying a message of peace and harmony and reflecting on what a wonderful country Australia is. The mission began in 1981, and, from humble beginnings, the centre has now grown into a vibrant activity area. Several classes for young and old are held there on a weekly basis, covering such topics as Hindu culture, yoga, meditation, Sanskrit and Vedanta.

        I was also honoured, that evening, to attend the annual dinner and receive life membership of the Malaysia Singapore Association of Australia for helping to foster warm relations with the Malaysian and Singaporean communities in Australia. This year marks the 10th anniversary of the association, and it was amazing to see all the active members present.
       </p>

        The next day, a Sunday, I joined some 2,000 people for the 19th annual celebration of the Festa di San Gabriele at Templestowe. It was a beautiful day at the Holy Cross Centre for this important celebration for people from the Abruzzo region of Italy who have made Australia home.
       </p>

        Each in their own way, these events reflected the great achievement of Australia, and that is the balance of diversity from so many countries around the world with integration into one community for the peace, welfare and happiness of the people of this nation.
