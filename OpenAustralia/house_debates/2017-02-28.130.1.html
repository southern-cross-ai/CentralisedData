        I wish to inform the House of the passing of a Bundjalung elder over the weekend. Aunty Bertha Kapeen, a great community leader and advocate, was a remarkable woman. She was a mother of eight, grandmother to 30 and great-grandmother to 23. Aunty Bertha was the matriarch to an enormous network of family and friends. She was born and raised on Cabbage Tree Island to Robert and Florence Bolt in 1935, and she was the ninth of 13 children. In 1955, she married David Kapeen and they had eight children—Denis, Julie, David, Thelma, Kerry—who has unfortunately passed away, Monica, Ernist and George. She became the first Aboriginal postmistress on Cabbage Tree Island. She wrote two books that are still popular today and co-authored a history on Aboriginal women's heritage and was awarded the Ballina Electorate Woman of the Year in 2008. She was intricately involved in the Aboriginal child and family centre at Porter Park. She was also a life member of the Aboriginal Education Consultative Group and the chair of the Bundjalung Elders Council for over 20 years. She also belonged to the Salt Water Women Art Group. Aunty Bertha leaves behind a legacy that showed a great love for her community. Rest in peace, Aunty Bertha.

        Today I would like to acknowledge a truly inspiring a young man from my electorate, Riley Saban. Riley lives in Mullaway, on the northern beaches of the Coffs Coast, and is typical 14-year old boy who attends

        . He took up the sport called boccia when he was 12. It is an inclusive sport, similar to lawn bowls. Using space provided by Marine Rescue Woolgoolga, he has been training hard at perfecting his skills and is now competing at senior level. He was selected for the national team in December and will this year take part in the

        . Riley has cerebral palsy. He has a great attitude towards life and is inspiring to those around him. I congratulate Riley on his outstanding achievements and wish him all the very best for his future endeavours.

        Many people in Lismore have been on the receiving end of Mary Bryant's generosity. She is a local Lismore cafe owner, always ready with a laugh and a smile. She was recently congratulated for her dedication to upskilling local students at her cafe, Coffee Shots. Mary and Coffee Shots have hosted 54 students in the past four years through Connect Northern Rivers. The students are all from around Lismore and attended

        or high school.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mary requested students that suffered from what she says are 'shyness issues' and encouraged many of the students to overcome their shyness and build up confidence. Many of these have gone on to thrive in the workplace, something that Connect employment attributes to Mary's gentle and caring temperament. I would like to congratulate her and all the staff at Coffee Shots for what they do.
