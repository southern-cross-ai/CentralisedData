        Today I rise to acknowledge some very important people from my electorate of Spence who just so happen to have been in this building yesterday and are here again today. In my seat of Spence we are lucky to have many good schools, many of which I have had the pleasure to visit during my short time as both the candidate and now the member for Spence. Today I acknowledge those students from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_College" rel="nofollow">
         Trinity College
        </a>
        who made the trip from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        on the same flight as I did, on Sunday, to come and visit
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Parliament House
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Yesterday I was lucky enough to speak to students from the Blakeview campus and answer some of their thoughtful questions prior to giving them a wave from the chamber shortly thereafter. Later today, students from the Gawler-Evanston campus will be in the gallery. Unfortunately, I'm on duty and unable to meet with you today, but I'll be sure to give you a big wave. I can't wait to meet with you soon back in our electorate to speak about all things Canberra and Parliament House.

        Civics education is a vitally important process to ensure the ongoing integrity of our democratic framework in this country. For that, I acknowledge the great work being undertaken by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speaker_of_the_House" rel="nofollow">
         Speaker of the House
        </a>
        and the great team from the Parliamentary Education Office. I look forward to many more visits from students within my electorate of Spence to this place over the coming years.
