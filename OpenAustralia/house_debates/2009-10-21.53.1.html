        My question is to the Minister for Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs. What has the Commonwealth government done to help those affected by the devastating Victorian bushfires in February this year?

         I thank the member for Bendigo for his question, but also for his work on behalf of the many families in Bendigo who were so affected by the fires earlier this year. It is now eight months since the tragedy of the Victorian bushfires and it is the case that the government is still working with communities, families, the Victorian government and, of course, the

         appeal fund to help people rebuild their lives and their businesses after what was nothing short of devastation.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would like to acknowledge the work that has been done by other local members and in particular I would like to thank

         , the parliamentary secretary who has done so much and been out there week after week, meeting with communities, listening to their issues and dealing with individual problems. I think all of this shows that a lot of people have worked with the locals to do what they can in the face of such devastation.

         Last Friday, at the Flowerdale Primary School, the Prime Minister was there with the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Victorian_Premier" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         ; the Chair of the Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction and Recovery Authority,

         ; and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_McNamara" rel="nofollow">
          Pat McNamara
         </a>
         from the Red Cross Victorian Bushfire Appeal Fund. Together they released the state-wide plan for bushfire reconstruction and recovery in Victoria, entitled very appropriately, I think,
         <i>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebuilding_Together" rel="nofollow">
           Rebuilding Together
          </a>
         </i>
         . The plan provides a further $193 million to continue rebuilding schools, police stations, sportsgrounds and community centres—all essential for recovery. It is also funding some very important environmental recovery—restoring waterways in catchments, repairing national park facilities and restocking local streams. All of these are critical issues that need to be addressed in those parts of Victoria that were affected by the bushfires.
        </p>

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Commonwealth" rel="nofollow">
          The Commonwealth
         </a>
         government is contributing $52 million to this plan, and that money is on top of the $400 million which has already been committed by the Commonwealth as part of our response to the rebuilding effort. This includes money that went to individuals, money that was available for infrastructure, money that was available for the very important case management services and health services—particularly, right now, mental health services—and, on top of that, there was money for business support, whether it was for small businesses, farmers or tourism operators.
        </p>
        <p>
         As the Prime Minister said at the time:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We knew that we would have to be there with communities for the long haul, rebuilding brick by brick, school by school, as we saw devastated communities getting back on track.
        </p>
        <p>
         When we were there on Friday, we met a fellow, Michael, on our way up to Flowerdale. He had just moved back into his newly rebuilt house. Obviously, it had been a very difficult time and, although he was very happy to be moving back into his home, of course, he reflected on just how difficult it still was for so many people. We know that there is still for many a lot of frustration and a lot of difficulties as they confront rebuilding their lives. We will stay the course with the people of Victoria as they confront the very difficult task of recovery. Once again, I thank all of the members who have been so dedicated to this task.
