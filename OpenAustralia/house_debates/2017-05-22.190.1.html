        I rise in this place today to speak about the importance of palliative care in the healthcare continuum. This week is National Palliative Care Week, and the theme is: 'You matter, your care matters. Palliative care can make a difference.' This year, Palliative Care Week is of great significance to me, my husband and our family, as my mother-in-law is in the palliative care unit at the Townsville Health and Hospital Service as I speak.

        This can be an incredibly stressful time for both the person and the family, especially if the family find it challenging to have the conversation about the person's end-of-life wishes. End of life in our culture seems to be very difficult and often ignored, as many people find it very hard to talk about dying. Having the experience of a good death is so very important for the person and the family. Health services today have created a focus on patient-centred care throughout the continuum of care, but we must also remember to include family and natural supports in this conversation, especially if the person wishes to be cared for at home.

        There is a huge need for palliative care to be provided in aged-care facilities. My experience recently with my father demonstrated that, unless the family is strong and has a good

        </a>
        , the person, most likely, will be sent to hospital. Our experience was exceptional, as my father's GP and the aged-care facility were amazing when my mother insisted that my father was not to be sent to the hospital. My experience tells me that we must invest in quality palliative-care services both in our communities and in aged-care facilities.
