       <p>
        Two weeks ago the Morrison government brought forward funding for key infrastructure projects in my electorate of Moncrieff on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        . We are still celebrating the additional funding that was injected into Gold Coast Light Rail Stage 3A, which will go from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Fair" rel="nofollow">
         Pacific Fair
        </a>
        in Broadbeach all the way to iconic
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burleigh_Heads" rel="nofollow">
         Burleigh Heads
        </a>
        â€”6.7 kilometres of transport infrastructure that residents and visitors alike will be able to enjoy as they board and ride all the way from Burleigh to Helensvale and then interchange to heavy rail to Brisbane.
       </p>
       <p>
        The new infrastructure funding announced by the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister includes $157 million for stage 3A of the Gold Coast light rail project. I think you'll all agree that's a fantastic Christmas present for the people of the Gold Coast and, indeed, for the people of Moncrieff. The total cost of the project is $709 million. It will create more than 760 jobs in my electorate, which I'm so thrilled about. It will boost the local economy. I thanked the Prime Minister personally during his visit for the green light on this very important project. In addition, $45 million was brought forward for the M1 Pacific Motorway upgrades, which affects everybody in my electorate going to and from Brisbane and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tweed_Heads" rel="nofollow">
         Tweed Heads
        </a>
        . Funding for this upgrade will flow from next year to deliver on our promise to the people of the Gold Coast of getting home sooner and safer instead of looking at brake lights on the motorway.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's a fantastic present to everyone in Moncrieff for Christmas, and I wish everybody in my electorate a very happy and safe holiday season, Christmas and new year.
