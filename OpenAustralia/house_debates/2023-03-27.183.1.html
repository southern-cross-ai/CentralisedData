       <p>
        I want to draw the attention of the House to some local activities that I attended in my electorate of Chisholm, squeezing in some visits between trips up here to Canberra. I'm so fortunate to be able to attend community events as a local member and really value the opportunity.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have new school leaders across the electorate, and it was my absolute pleasure to issue certificates acknowledging leaders to schools right around Chisholm. I even had the honour of attending assemblies to present badges and speak to school leaders in person, most recently at Wattle Park Primary School, Waverley Meadows Primary School and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Monash_Science_School" rel="nofollow">
         John Monash Science School
        </a>
        . I met some really inspiring leaders with really inspiring teachers at those schools, and I look forward to future visits to schools in my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also attended the Roberts McCubbin Primary School fundraiser. It's really innovative; it's an art show. Every year local artists donate works to be sold to support the school. Of course, as an avid art fan, I had to make a contribution and purchase some beautiful paintings and prints to decorate the walls of my electorate office. Well done to everyone involved on such a spectacular event.
       </p>
       <p>
        On the theme of art, I also attended the Mount Street Neighbourhood House arts and crafts extravaganza, a fundraiser and a showcase for the very talented groups that meet at the Neighbourhood House. It was a fabulous event. I congratulate the organisers and I look forward to attending more events when I get back down to Melbourne very soon.
