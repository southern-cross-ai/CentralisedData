        I rise today to congratulate six residents from my electorate of Macarthur who have been honoured in the

         Queen's Birthday Honours List
        </a>
        . In many ways, we are all beneficiaries of the Australian honours system because formally recognising meritorious service to the community reminds us and reaffirms how compassionate and considerate we are as a nation and as a people.
       </p>
       <p>
        The recipients of these awards are more often than not ordinary people who achieve extraordinary things that touch and improve the lives of others. They come from all walks of life but they have all made a significant contribution to the community and today I would like to pay tribute to these exceptional people from Macarthur.

        I would like to congratulate these remarkable people who have been named in the Queen's Birthday Honours List. They are a testament to the great virtue and compassion that is part of the fabric of our community and makes each and every one of us proud to call Macarthur home. They are truly wonderful people who are cherished by the Macarthur community.
