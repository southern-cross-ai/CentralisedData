        Maggie Richardson, a senior from Lathlain in my electorate of Swan, has been given the prestigious WA Senior of the Year award for her outstanding contribution to the community. Maggie, who is 78 years old, has a fantastic enthusiasm for life which is reflected in her scope of volunteering. Maggie is a founding member of the Positive Ageing Foundation and presently works four days a week as an unpaid volunteer. Over the past 13 years Maggie has volunteered as a tour guide at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perth_Zoo" rel="nofollow">
         Perth Zoo
        </a>
        and also at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rottnest_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Rottnest Island
        </a>
        , where Maggie supervised 10-kilometre walks. Maggie is a member of the Community Peer Education Council, which represents the interests of seniors, and is also a member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthritis_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Arthritis Foundation
        </a>
        of WA. Somehow Maggie even finds time to give talks to seniors on a range of health issues such as depression.
       </p>
       <p>
        Maggie’s accomplishments send a positive message to seniors everywhere about how to keep active and enjoying life after 65. Maggie’s approach to life is ‘use it or lose it’—keep happy and healthy by remaining independent and active for as long as possible. I have met Maggie’s son Martin who owns a security business, and I am sure he and the rest of Maggie’s family are impressed by their mother’s achievements. My office spoke to Maggie last week to wish her luck ahead of the Burswood awards ceremony, and today I send my congratulations and those, I am sure, of federal parliament to Maggie. This year is Maggie’s year. The recognition by the community of Maggie’s efforts should encourage all seniors and all community members to participate in life and the community. Well done, Maggie Richardson.
