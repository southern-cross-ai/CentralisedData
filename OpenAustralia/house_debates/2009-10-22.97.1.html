        Partnerships that last a decade deserve recognition and such was the case on 25 September when the Chittering Landcare Group celebrated its 10-year partnership with Tiwest, the world’s largest integrated titanium minerals production and manufacturing company. The Chittering Landcare Centre is a community based organisation supporting land conservation and rehabilitation efforts within the Ellenbrook and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brockman_River" rel="nofollow">
         Brockman River
        </a>
        catchments. Tiwest provides housing and financial assistance for the landcare centre. It houses a regional herbarium and acts as a resource centre for the community. Without assistance from Tiwest, however, none of the restoration work or community support would happen.
       </p>
       <p>
        Water monitoring done by officers from the centre is included in the state database to enable a clear picture to be formed of the water quality within the area. Among its achievements is the development of an innovative land management decision-making CD called
        <i>
         Landsmart
        </i>
        , which is available to any landholders who wish to take advantage of it. Constant requests from government agencies for this product demonstrate its enormous value.
       </p>
       <p>
        The centre also produces weed management brochures informing landowners about weed control and management. The Chittering Landcare Centre, like all other environmental organisations, applies for grants to run the centre. Unfortunately, due to federal government cuts, it will have to downgrade services to the communities of Wannamal, Chittering, Gingin and North Swan. This will increase pressure on the local governments of the region to supply information on dieback, weeds and feral animals and will bring to a halt revegetation of the Ellenbrook and surrounds. While not going down without a fight, the centre staff are frankly struggling to find an alternative.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts, Mr Garrett, has expressed an opinion that there is no value for money in supporting community driven natural resource management as it ‘does not achieve the outcomes required’. This partnership and the exceptional work done by the Chittering Landcare Centre for a decade proves, I think, the value of this organisation within the community. I would ask the minister to consider their request for funding so that the Chittering Landcare Centre can continue to operate in this important area. This is a very important water catchment area.
       </p>
       <p>
        Before my time expires, I also want to recognise the work of all those at the centre, who are mostly volunteers—the community members and those one or two who are there on a daily basis—for their services to the area and also to recognise Tiwest for their good corporate citizenship in supporting better environmental management within the region.
