        I join with the member for Maranoa in notifying the chamber of the fire that has gutted Swickers Kingaroy Bacon Factory in Kingaroy and the broader effects it may have on the economy in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Burnett" rel="nofollow">
         South Burnett
        </a>
        , which partly lies in Flynn. The Swickers abattoir and factory has been in operation for more than 50 years. It is the largest in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Hemisphere" rel="nofollow">
         Southern Hemisphere
        </a>
        and currently processes 22,000 pigs per week, and that is about 96 per cent of all pigs processed in Queensland. It is the South Burnett's largest employer, with around 600 staff.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is believed at this stage that it is only the boning rooms have been destroyed; however, the majority of the abattoir still remains intact. Queensland government representatives will visit the site today to investigate the damage. The company intends to get back to work as soon as possible, with plans already afoot to outsource some operations, including coldrooms, allowing the plant to re-enter production hopefully some time in the next week. I am told Swickers has assured all staff of their positions, which is a welcome call given that Christmas is so close. South Burnett communities like Wondai and Proston are today at the front of my mind as their pig producers consider their reaction to the fire. I will be working closely with the member for Maranoa to identify what the federal government needs to do in support.
