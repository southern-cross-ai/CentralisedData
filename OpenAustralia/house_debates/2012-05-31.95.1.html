        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to a letter from Angelo Gaudiano, a blue-collar worker at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_Brix" rel="nofollow">
         Energy Brix
        </a>
        in my electorate who writes:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Once the carbon tax comes into effect … the business will be unviable. It will have to shut. Over 200 workers will lose their jobs and the community will be greatly affected with families leaving the area.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        …    …   …

        All I want is a job to go to so I can support my family.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prime Minister, what is the point of sending people like Angelo Gaudiano a cash cheque when what he really wants is to keep his job?

         To the member who asked the question, jobs will grow under carbon pricing. I refer him to the Treasury modelling. Jobs will grow under carbon pricing. He may have listened to the Leader of the Opposition's fear campaigning. He may have swallowed the line that whole towns will be wiped off the map, that there will not be coal mined anymore, that everybody will apparently be living in a cave with no electricity, unable to afford food—and the ridiculous stuff just goes on and on and on and on. The member may have swallowed the Leader of the Opposition's fear campaign, he may have done that, but it does not equal the facts.
        </p>
        <p>
         To the member who raises this question, I do understand that there is concern in his region about carbon pricing. I genuinely understand that. He would also understand that, as a government, we are working with his region, working through the implications and we are very determined that, unlike the time when the state Liberal government forced his region into a transition with no assistance and no support, we will be there working with the community because we want to see people having the benefit of jobs. If you look at the whole of the carbon pricing package you see jobs continuing to grow and you also see us working with specific industries and with specific regions.
        </p>
        <p>
         As we leave this parliamentary session we are moving towards a time where the truth about putting a price on carbon will become increasingly clearly, where people will see—

                 for its political impact, the opportunity given to Members to raise topical or urgent issues is invaluable.

                  The member for Mackellar will resume her seat. As numerous occupiers of this chair have noted from time to time, eliciting the answers and the questions that either side wants is not the role of the chair. The role of the chair is to uphold the standing orders. The Prime Minister has the call.

                         Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. To the member who asked this question: it was clear from his point of order that in fact he is making some assumptions about what may or may not flow from a tender process that is underway. I would say to the member that he cannot make assumptions about what might flow from that tender process. But what he can safely assume, what he can always assume, is that this government will support jobs, this government will work with his region to support jobs, this government will work to keep growing the economy so that there are more jobs and, at the same time, we will be there providing households with assistance, because we understand that they are under cost-of-living pressure.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         We will leave to the opposition the fear campaigning, all of the game playing, the running around, the stunts—all the other kinds of trite and silly performances that we have seen in parliament over the last week—and we will get on with the job of running the economy in the interests of working people, something that the Leader of the Opposition and his team will never understand.
