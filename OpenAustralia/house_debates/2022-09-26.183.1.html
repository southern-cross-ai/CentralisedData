       <p>
        I want to pay tribute to the inspirational Barbara Siddall. Thirty years ago, Barbara did something truly amazing: she founded Cornerstone, which is a much-loved community institution in Dandenong. It's a drop-in centre to welcome and care for people in crisis. I've visited it many times, and it provides much more than just a meal.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was honoured to attend Cornerstone's 30-year gala celebrating the contribution of so many people: the volunteers, the partners, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Clubs" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Clubs
        </a>
        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Clubs" rel="nofollow">
         Lions Clubs
        </a>
        , the Australian tax office in the centre of Dandenong—which has a breakfast club which for decades has supported Cornerstone—the laundry providers and the shower providers. Barb Siddall was there with her family. The highlight was the unveiling of a plaque renaming the iconic Dandenong Centre—and I know that, as someone who went to school in Dandenong, my friend the member for Holt knows this place well. It's been renamed the Barb Siddall Drop-in Centre.
       </p>
       <p>
        Typically, Barb was completely horrified by the attention. She confessed to me that she didn't actually want to come, because she didn't want to be the centre of attention. But then she got up and spoke absolutely beautifully to the gathering. She spoke of her Christian faith that moved her after she retired. She said she knew nothing about youth work and homeless people, but she felt moved to do something. She has tenacity and has built something really special. She'll probably hate the fact that I've got up now and mentioned this in the national parliament, but given the significance of Cornerstone to our community—it is loved and known right across the community—it's appropriate that I record our thanks and gratitude to Barb Siddall.
