        I rise to pay tribute to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Rotary Club
        </a>
        of West Torrens. It is a club consisting of ordinary members of the Hindmarsh community who do extraordinary work in support of very good causes. The type of work that the Rotary Club of West Torrens does is best described as humanitarian, and I will give you a few examples. The club provides support to a teacher at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Jude's" rel="nofollow">
         St Jude's
        </a>
        school in Tanzania, eastern Africa, and to the Australia Bringing Hope organisation, which was created by a man who sold his house and possessions in Australia to finance his own mission in Uganda to promote local employment outcomes and businesses. The club also holds quarterly fundraiser barbecues in support of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_McDonald_House" rel="nofollow">
         Ronald McDonald House
        </a>
        for the seriously ill children who find some peace and comfort in that charity's work. These are just a couple of examples of the work that the Rotary Club of West Torrens engages in and of the drive it has as a community organisation to alleviate suffering, to provide assistance and encouragement to those who may be most in need, and to promote good fellowship amongst the club members.

        I am sure that all of us have seen evidence and heard reports of the decline in volunteering in all of our neighbourhood clubs, and even Rotary has found that sustaining clubs can be difficult. Hence, when the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Flinders Park
        </a>
        Rotary club ceased to exist recently due to the loss of a critical mass I was glad that many, if not all, of the former Flinders Park members found a place for their humanitarian volunteerism in the Rotary Club of West Torrens. I would like to mention the executive of the past year and those elected to take their place at the meeting on Wednesday, 29 June, which I will be attending. President Wally Young has made way for incoming president
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greg_Williams" rel="nofollow">
         Greg Williams
        </a>
        and Vice-President Bruce Harrison has done the same for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_McIlwaine" rel="nofollow">
         John McIlwaine
        </a>
        . President-elect Greg Williams has vacated his position for Max McSorley and Secretary Maurie Howard has moved aside for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Jones" rel="nofollow">
         David Jones
        </a>
        . Treasurer Terry Saunderson, who is also my florist and whom we buy lots of flowers from—if anyone in my electorate is after flowers, Saunderson Florist is one of the best in Adelaide—has relinquished his position for Jeff Lanyon. Terry continues to serve in the capacity of assistant treasurer. Board members focus on particular areas of club activity. The international focus held by Arthur Greenhalgh will be held this year by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Murray" rel="nofollow">
         John Murray
        </a>
        , the community focus held by Jeff Lanyon will be held by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Duncan" rel="nofollow">
         John Duncan
        </a>
        , Max McSorley will continue to hold the vacation focus and club services addressed by John McIllwaine will be assumed by Wally Young. To all the executive and board members of the last 12 months, congratulations on the tremendous work and the great support you have provided to your chosen organisation and personnel. To the new executive and incoming board, may I wish you every success through this coming year.
