        My question is to the Prime Minister and relates to the mining companies
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BHP" rel="nofollow">
         BHP
        </a>
        and Shenhua Coal, and their coal exploration licences on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liverpool_Plains" rel="nofollow">
         Liverpool Plains
        </a>
        in the electorate of New England. The Prime Minister would be aware of the widespread concerns of these potential projects on the enormous groundwater reserves and the alluvial floodplains of the region and the Murray-Darling system. Given recent statements in China that Shenhua Coal would eventually mine under the floodplain and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mooki_River" rel="nofollow">
         Mooki River
        </a>
        , and given that Shenhua Coal is refusing to await the results of an independent water study, which is partly funded by the Commonwealth government, would you, Prime Minister, visit this area and see for yourself the unique geographical and hydrogeological features of this area and the associated risks to the Murray-Darling system?

         I thank the member for New England for his question. I am familiar with the company, Shenhua, and I have known of its operations for many, many years. The particular project that the honourable member refers to in his part of Australia I am not familiar with. But I have listened very carefully to his question and he goes to the core point of environmental approvals. I do not know what stage those approvals are at and the extent to which they currently involve both the state and federal governments, given that it involves not just the water system but I presume other environmental dimensions as well. On the question of statements made by Shenhua from Beijing on this, that it is their predisposition to proceed with this project prior to approvals being granted, prima facie I would find that unacceptable in terms of the provisions of Australian law. However, as the member has raised it, I will go into the detail of the matter and report back to him separately on it. As for visiting the area, given he has raised it in this place, either I or another minister of the government, as appropriate, will seek to visit the area with the honourable member to ascertain what the best way forward is.
