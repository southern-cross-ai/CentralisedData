       <p>
        During the last term of parliament, as a member of the coalition government, I was able to secure nearly $1.5 million worth of funding for a program to support disengaged youth and keep them off the streets. It was a part of our Safer Communities program, providing community safety infrastructure to grassroots groups as well as investing in early intervention programs to address the underlying social issues which can lead young people to crime.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last month, I was extremely happy to be able to go out and see where the funding is going to, with Community Gro's Garbutt Youth Hub now up and running. It was fantastic to hang out with Easter, Christopher, Dalton, Braiden and Mikayla, who are enjoying their time in Youth Hub after a long day of school and taking part in activities and having a good, nutritious meal cooked by the staff on site. They learn how to connect with culture, respect one another and their youth leaders, and have a good time in a positive environment. I have to admit that their Pictionary skills are better than mine and put me to shame.
       </p>
       <p>
        The funding that I was successful in fighting for will allow Community Gro to deliver the Youth Hub program for at least the next two years, operating five nights a week between 3 pm and 10 pm. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">

        , Kathrin, has said dozens of local youths have been coming in, having a meal, engaging in educational programs and learning to respect themselves and the local community before they get a lift home. The funding has also enabled a case worker to work with some of the older youth during the day to work on their goals, whether it be education or employment. I've got to say I saw myself in a lot of them, to be honest. I saw people who had been growing up tough, who were doing it tough. But programs like this help kids who are on the cusp of potentially going into a life of crime or a life of positivity, and we've had some fantastic feedback from locals around the area and also from family members. It was great to see this funding make a real difference in the lives of these young people, and I look forward to continuing to work with the Community Gro team as they continue their excellent work.
       </p>
       <p>
        As much as investing in early intervention programs is important—which we can do at the federal level—we still need the state Labor government to do more. We're still waiting on them to make breach of bail an offence and end the holiday-like conditions at Cleveland Youth Detention Centre. The people of Townsville deserve to feel safe in their homes, not like prisoners, and we need the state Labor government to step up.
