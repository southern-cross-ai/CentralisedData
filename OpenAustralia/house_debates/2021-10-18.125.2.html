        On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Works" rel="nofollow">
         Public Works
        </a>
        , I present report No. 8 of 2021,
        <i>
         Referrals made June 2021

        Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).
       </p>
       <p>
        by leaveâ€”The committee's eighth report of 2021 considers two proposals referred to the committee in June 2021. The total value of the proposed works for the two projects is $87.29 million, with the two projects being undertaken in Townsville and Sydney.
       </p>
       <p>
        The first is the expansion of the National Sea Simulator at the Australian Institute of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Science" rel="nofollow">
         Marine Science
        </a>
        in Townsville, with an estimated cost of $27.49 million. The National Sea Simulator is a unique, world-class aquarium facility for tropical marine research, which, since its establishment in 2014, has facilitated a significant volume of large-scale, multigenerational studies. The expansion of the National Sea Simulator aims to increase the research capabilities of the Sea Simulator, directly supporting significant research into the long-term sustainability and restoration of the

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The second project is the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation's intermediate-level solid waste storage facility at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucas_Heights" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . The project has an estimated cost of $59.8 million.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSTO" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        's existing intermediate-level solid radioactive waste storage facility at Lucas Heights is forecast to reach capacity at 2027. This project will allow ANSTO to expand its storage capacity by at least 10 years, up to 2037, and enable ANSTO to continue its nuclear medicine production without disruption.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee would like to extend its thanks to all who gave written and oral evidence to the inquiry. The passion of many Australians who gave evidence was clear. The committee acknowledges their contribution to the ongoing debate surrounding the storage of radioactive waste in Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to thank both the Australian Institute of Marine Science and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation for their comprehensive presentations. Although the committee was unable to travel to either site to inspect the proposed works, both entities provided sufficient detail in their presentation and briefing to ensure that the committee was able to appreciate the importance and nature of the work. In both cases the committee recommended that it is expedient that the works be carried out.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since I last spoke in this House on the work of the committee one of our longest-serving members has passed away. Senator
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Gallacher" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , as you are aware, passed away on Sunday 29 August after a long battle with lung cancer. The Public Works Committee would like to extend its deep regret at the death of Senator Gallacher, who remained a valuable member of this committee until the very day of his passing. The committee would like to place on the record its appreciation of his service to the work of the committee and to offer its heartfelt sympathy to his family, his wife, Paola, and their four children and grandchildren in their bereavement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I'd also like to mention the fantastic work of Ms Pauline Cullen, who has served the Public Works Committee for almost five years. She is not leaving us. She is moving on to a position as a director in the Clerk's office. I wish her all the best for the future and all success going forward.
