        My opponent in the House of Representatives for the last 14 years, the honourable member for Corio, leaves this place for pastures greener. The parliament will miss the good-humoured interjections and ongoing political combat between Corangamite and Corio. The easy flow of language from the grey-haired but very fit veteran footballer from Corio will not be easily replaced. Corangamite and Corio go back a long way, to when Gavan O’Connor first stood for the seat of Corangamite in the February 1984 by-election that saw me enter the parliament. He then recontested the seat in December 1984. At that time he was a well-known Colac boy with a bit of a chance for the big time in politics.

        Gavan O’Connor worked for the highly respected Senator John Button. During that time, he came to understand market economics and lower tariff regimes. Unfortunately, he was never quite capable of reaching the intellectually correct position of his hero,

        Gavan O’Connor is the only Labor member in the parliament who has dirt under his fingernails and understands rural issues. In his role as shadow minister for this portfolio, he brought to bear a genuine understanding of rural people’s attitudes, their trials and tribulations and what might be good for them in the longer term. He even had a sympathetic view of dairy deregulation, which was somewhat contrary to his more socialist attitudes towards statutory marketing. He argued these rural issues responsibly from the opposition benches.
       </p>
       <p>
        Gavan O’Connor comes from an old
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLP" rel="nofollow">
         DLP
        </a>
        family in the Alvie district near Colac. Since a young age he has been debating political and philosophical issues around the dinner table. His cousin, Allan Woods, of Camperdown, was probably Australia’s most famous buckjump rider. Allan Woods rode Curio in 1949 and that epic feat is recorded in the Stockman’s Hall of Fame at Longreach as well as there being a statue at Warwick, Queensland, where this historic ride took place. Allan Woods’ father worked at my family’s property, Meningoort, Camperdown.
       </p>

        Gavan’s exploits as a veteran rising 59-year-old footballer are well known to all members of the House. Hamstring injuries and other combat woes have often restrained him from reaching his full potential as one of Australia’s outstanding veteran

       <p>
        Gavan’s contribution to the parliament was cut short by a branch-stacking operation never before seen in the Geelong region. Politics is a ruthless business, but Gavan O’Connor and the genuine, long-serving Labor Party members of Geelong who supported him, have been badly let down. Gavan O’Connor’s commitment to the Labor cause has never been in doubt. His articulate and genuine passion for the cause on the floor of the House of Representatives has been first class. His cheerful disposition and genuine consideration of others has earned him a reputation on both sides of the parliament as a straight shooter and a person without rancour or bitterness.
       </p>
       <p>
        He leaves the parliament with the good wishes of all members, in particular the member for Corangamite, who will feel lonely during the debates without the good humour but sharp heckling to ensure that the member for Corangamite will be kept in line. We wish Gavan and his partner, Toni, every success in this next stage of their career together.
