        is Australia's game, but tomorrow we launch the parliamentary friends of football world game. We look forward to a new season of the world game coming up shortly with the A-league.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tonight I would like to touch on some of the achievements of some of the wonderful schools in my electorate of Forde. In particular, I would like to touch on some of the terrific achievements of Beenleigh State High School, Loganlea State High School and Windaroo Valley State High School, who share an alliance under the Futures with Food Trade Training Centre. The teachers at these three schools decided, rather than working individually trying to develop their students' skills and capabilities, they would launch a united program called Futures with Food in the restaurant and hospitality area. Each time I visit these schools, the students are courteous, attentive and well dressed, and their food preparation is second to none. They certainly can compete with many of the local restaurants in our area. They are a tremendous credit to not only themselves but to their teachers and their parents.
       </p>
       <p>
        Through Futures with Food, students are gaining hands-on experience as well as lifelong skills at events and functions where they participate across various catering roles. The schools have their own individual events. For example, Beenleigh State High School has a weekly 'bean-me-up' coffee morning for staff and also a 'shake shop' for students. Recently I had the pleasure of attending a Beenleigh Yatala Junior Chamber of Commerce breakfast at Beenleigh State High School.
       </p>
       <p>
        Loganlea State High School has the Camp Fire Dreaming restaurant, which compliments the school's strong links with our Indigenous and business community. At Camp Fire Dreaming students demonstrate their skills in front of their teachers, parents, peers and members of the local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Windaroo Valley State High's appropriately named
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valley_View" rel="nofollow">
         Valley View
        </a>
        restaurant is often opened for functions outside school hours, where students participate in roles similar to that in commercial restaurants, thereby gaining valuable experience.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether it is a formal occasion, a five-course degustation, an informal lunch, a cultural banquet or a high tea, students from Beenleigh, Loganlea and Windaroo Valley take it in their stride, producing industry-standard service and cuisine. When I am invited to attend one of the school functions, I, along with many of the other guests, really enjoy meeting the teachers and students involved and partaking of the wonderful food and service. The program gives students a sense of purpose and accomplishment. They show pride in their work and, as a result, have very bright futures ahead of them in the hospitality industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        I commend the collaboration between all the schools involved in this initiative. The staff at each school work together developing community partnerships and industry links to support structured work placement like school based traineeships. It truly gives our local students who are interested in a career in hospitality a head start. It gives them a tremendous sense of confidence and purpose, knowing that they have the skills, talents and abilities to be part of the workforce in the future.
