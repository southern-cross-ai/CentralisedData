       <p>
        I rise tonight to speak about a very important issue in the chamber—one that affects not only many thousands of the residents in the electorate of Hindmarsh but a great many
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        ns. I have been very concerned to read reports recently in the local media that ABC television may cease the broadcast of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        National Football League games in South Australia. These reports are of great concern to me as they are to many of my constituents, who stand to lose a vital connection to the community as well as the enjoyment of participating in, watching and following sport if this does go ahead.
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SANFL" rel="nofollow">
         SANFL
        </a>
        broadcasts on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_Television" rel="nofollow">
         ABC Television
        </a>
        provide great enjoyment to thousands of my constituents and many South Australians, especially those who cannot attend the local games due to age, infirmity, disability, financial status, distance, or family or caring responsibilities. Many of my constituents in these situations rely on the ABC telecasts of the SANFL games to allow them to continue to participate in the excitement and enjoyment of following their favourite team in their local state competition. For many, paid television subscriptions are not an option. ABC television has been broadcasting SANFL games for more than 25 years in South Australia and, in recent weeks, many SANFL chief executive officers, including those from clubs in my local area, have made comment on the nature of the stellar 25-year partnership that the SANFL and the ABC have had to date. I would like to share some of those comments from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEO" rel="nofollow">
         CEO
        </a>
        s with you. I have been a fan of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Adelaide_Football_Club" rel="nofollow">
         West Adelaide Football Club
        </a>
        for many years and am the club's No. 1 ticket holder. The CEO of West Adelaide Football Club, Kym Russell, has said ABC coverage has been fantastic for the game. He said in an interview:
       </p>
       <p>
        I think they provide a very good service for the state and it would be a shame for someone in Sydney to make a decision to cut a local product.
       </p>
       <p>
        I couldn't agree more with Kym. The CEO of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenelg_Football_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Glenelg Football Club
        </a>
        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rob_Nelson" rel="nofollow">
         Rob Nelson
        </a>
        , has said:
       </p>
       <p>
        I can say, without knowing all the details, SANFL coverage by the ABC as a long time broadcaster is highly important and critical to our presence in the market place.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Woodville-West Torrens chief executive,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Davies" rel="nofollow">
         Chris Davies
        </a>
        , said:
       </p>
       <p>
        From our perspective the ABC coverage to the SANFL competition is critical.
       </p>
       <p>
        And Port Adelaide general manager, Neil Rawlings, said:
       </p>
       <p>
        I think from the clubs point of view it would be devastating … I think it will suffer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most importantly, it is clear that the community does not want to lose this wonderful part of our history, our culture and our identity. An afternoon watching the local footy at home with your partner, your kids, your pets or your friends is one of life's simple pleasures in South Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a Facebook group called Save the SANFL on the ABC which has over 2,600 members as of today and which I encourage South Australians to join. Today, I have personally written to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Managing_Director" rel="nofollow">
         Managing Director
        </a>
        of the ABC, Mr Mark Scott, to ask for his assurance that SANFL broadcasting will not be axed. I look forward to reporting back a successful outcome to the people of Hindmarsh and to all South Australians, but in the meantime I encourage everyone to do whatever they can, whether it be writing, emailing, faxing, phoning or using social media, to join the campaign to Save the SANFL on the ABC.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the SANFL competition as the best-supported football league outside of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFL" rel="nofollow">
         AFL
        </a>
        , this speculation is cause for concern.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_ABC" rel="nofollow">
         The ABC
        </a>
        telecast is a key component of the SANFL's commitment to growing and promoting the nation's strongest state based football competition. Research shows that nearly every South Australian follows both an AFL club and a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian_National_Football_League" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian National Football League
        </a>
        club. The SANFL continues to go from strength to strength in South Australia, with attendances up on 2010 figures by two per cent after a season in which minor-round crowds exceeded 276,000 and the grand final attracted 35,000 spectators.
       </p>
       <p>
        The opportunity for South Australians to watch the progress of their SANFL club on the ABC is something that is very, very important to a significant portion of the South Australian community. News of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC's" rel="nofollow">
         ABC's
        </a>
        intention to axe this telecast is of great concern. The SANFL has invested more than $200,000 in the last three years and is totally committed to this investment into the future. The ABC telecast will play a major role in this expansion.
