        It is always interesting: these three-minute statements are usually about what our community has been doing—and today I would like to rise to share some cheer during this torrid time in Australia's history—but when the Climate 200 candidates come into this chamber they always seem to end up talking about themselves.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my electorate of Mackellar, however, there is a jewel of a woman—the Northern Beaches' own version of the charming and charismatic

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faye_Byrne" rel="nofollow">
         Faye Byrne
        </a>
        is 80 years young. She has won our hearts with her warmth, generosity, insights, positivity, good cheer and sparkle. If we could bottle her energy, we could solve numerous global challenges right now. Faye has lived life fully and created so many memories and anecdotes that I could wax lyrical for far longer than the allotted time. This dynamo of a woman believes a good life is one of kindness, sharing and giving.
       </p>
       <p>
        Faye has always helped those who are less fortunate. In 1980, the Byrne family set up the Leo &amp; Jenny Leukemia and Cancer Foundation to honour Jenny and Leo, loved ones they had lost to leukaemia. Faye was instrumental in raising millions of dollars, which morphed into Sail for Cancer and Ride for Cancer, and, in 2002, the foundation was officially renamed Cure Cancer. For 25 years, Faye was relentless, raising funds while simultaneously bringing up her four children and working in her husband Bob's business. Whilst heavily pregnant, Faye was the licensee of Bronte Charles Hotel and also worked at the Artarmon inn in Sydney with Bob. She also, some 54 years ago, held a real estate licence, which at the time was extremely difficult to obtain.
       </p>
       <p>
        Faye has supported the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variety_Club" rel="nofollow">

        over the years and undertook two bashes with her brother Ron in 1997 and 1998 and had enormous fun in the process. Since that time, she's been offering her ongoing support by attending Variety Club fundraisers.
       </p>
       <p>
        Her relentless energy and spirit have served her beloved Liberal Party well for the past 35 years. Faye has been a loyal member of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beacon_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Beacon Hill
        </a>
        and Newport branches and has brought a steely determination to assist the party in any way possible—not because she wanted to help the Liberal Party but because she wanted her community to be even better. Her commitment and loyalty to her community and the values which she believes the Liberal Party stands for are beyond reproach. Faye's love of life—her joie de vivre—has been evident from the outset. Faye believes that life should be embraced, that travel and learning should be pursued and certainly that one should laugh often and much. Her family sustains Faye and she sustains them. Faye deserves accolades from afar, not only because of her passion for life but for her caring and kindness. We should all, I believe, take a leaf from Faye's book. I'm proud to call Faye and
