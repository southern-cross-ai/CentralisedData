        My question is to the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister claimed he began work on an anticorruption commission four years ago. The Prime Minister pledged to legislate one three years ago. Why has the Prime Minister betrayed the Australian people and his own colleagues by breaking his anticorruption pledge?

        <p>
         I'm not going to take lectures from the Labor Party about anticorruption. They'd be very well aware of the matters in Victoria at the moment and the matters in Queensland at the moment. I would've thought that the Labor Party would not be coming in here today when integrity issues, and the lack of integrity being displayed by their colleagues in seeking to sweep things under the carpet in those places, are well on display in Victoria and Queensland.
        </p>
        <p>
         But the gold standard when it comes to corruption was the Labor Party in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         . They have so many ex-Labor ministers in prison that they could start a branch of the Labor Party in Silverwater prison. When they go to meet them, they're at the Silverwater prison.

          I think I heard only about half of that answer of the Prime Minister because of the wall of noise on both sides of the House. I ask honourable members to limit their interjections. The Prime Minister has the call.

           The Treasurer just reminded me that perhaps what I was saying then was a bit too close to home for the Labor Party. It's certainly a bit too close to home for the Leader of the Labor Party. His good mate is Ian Macdonald. He saved his preselection and he went off to prison.

               The question goes to the government's lack of action in terms of putting in place an anticorruption commission at the federal level, despite undertakings that they had made. Not a single word that the Prime Minister has spoken in his answer to this question, which has been going for a minute and 18 seconds, goes to thatâ€”not one word.

                      The Leader of the Opposition will resume his seat. I say to all members in the House that references to corrupt conduct, corruption or the commission of an offence like fraud, which I picked someone up on yesterday, are unparliamentary if directed towards a member of this House, a group of members of this House or a party that belongs in this Houseâ€”and this goes on both sides. I will pull members up on them. I don't care what side they're from. They are unparliamentary remarks and they should not be used in the House. The Prime Minister has the call.

                           The Leader of the House will resume his seat. There is conduct that is creeping into practice in this place where the use of points of order is being abused. I will be pulling members up for points of order which are not valid, and if it keeps happening then don't be surprised if you don't get the call. I'm trying my best to err on the side of caution and always give members that do rise, at the dispatch box or otherwise, the point of order, because I think that's a reasonable thing to do. But, if that process is being abused, then there may be opportunities where you just simply don't get the call. I'm happy to hear from the Manager of Opposition Business.

                           <p>
                            Thank you, Mr Speaker, just briefly, because the context here does matter. Ministersâ€”and it's within your rights as Speakerâ€”are now being allowed to travel much more widely than they have travelled for some years in their answers. If that happens, there will be a response. People will respond spontaneously. It will happen, and points of order will then be raised, because they will go to the order of the House when the House falls into disorderâ€”points which don't have to be on relevance. But the change in behaviour has happened directly at the same time that ministers have been given a much wider berth than has happened here for some years.

                             It is terribly sad! But I don't think there's been a significant change in the way I'm approaching it compared with previous Speakers. The Prime Minister has the call.

All I've seen is a two-page document. So what I have to rely on for the Labor Party policy is what I'm seeing in the circus that we're seeing unfold in Queensland and in Victoria, and what we've seen in
