        My question is to the Minister for Education. Will the minister please update the House on how the Indonesia-Australia Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement will benefit Australia's education sector?

         I thank the member for Wentworth for his question. I know his diplomatic background means he understands that trade means jobs, and that's what the comprehensive economic partnership is all about, especially when it comes to international education. This is an export industry that delivers $37.6 billion worth of revenue to the Australian economy and creates 250,000 jobs. We want to see that continue to grow. Now, there's been a challenge with the coronavirus, so that's why today they would be so pleased with the announcement by the Prime Minister about the comprehensive economic partnership and, in particular, the fact that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monash_University" rel="nofollow">

         has been granted approval by the Indonesian government to establish the first foreign university campus in Indonesia.
        </p>
        <p>
         This is an historical occasion. And why? Look at the opportunities in the Indonesia market for our universities. There are 44 million Indonesians aged between 15 and 24. We want to help. We want to assist Indonesia to educate their students. Because of this comprehensive economic partnership, we will have the ability to do that. It's not only in the higher education sector but also in the vocational education sector that we will be able to do it. I know many people all across this parliament and on this side will be very pleased that we've also opened the vocational education market.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australian providers will benefit from more transparent and predictable conditions in Indonesia, including clarity on qualifications they can offer and no restrictions on where they can operate. This benefits Indonesian students as it will increase their access to world-class skills training across Indonesia without the need to travel. When we came into office, our trade was covered by free-trade agreements to the extent of 26 per cent. It's now 70 per cent, and we want that to grow to 90 per cent, because that will deliver certainty for our export industriesâ€”certainty for them to be able to invest in international markets. That will help grow the value of our export industries and, most importantly, grow jobs in our economy.
