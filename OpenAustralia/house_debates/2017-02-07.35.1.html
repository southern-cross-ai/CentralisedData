        , communities in my electorate gather to celebrate all that makes us such a wonderful nation. At the centre of those celebrations are the citizenship ceremonies arranged by our local councils. It is a reminder of how successful we are as a multicultural nation to see people of every nationality, race and religion come together and take the pledge of loyalty to Australia and all that we as Australians stand for. Australia Day is also an opportunity for our local councils to recognise those residents who have made an outstanding contribution to their community. I want to congratulate those who were honoured this year.
