       <p>
        I rise today to speak about an exciting and innovative expo that I am hosting for the first time in my seat of Higgins, on 17 April: the Climate Solutions Technical Expo. I am delighted that the federal ,

        , and the federal ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karen_Andrews" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , will be launching the event. As a country with clever scientists, smart businesses and a willing citizenry we are already identifying new economic opportunities for Australia, particularly for energy and emissions reduction technologies, providing storage and backup in the electricity industry and transport sectors.
       </p>
       <p>
        Through this inaugural Climate Solutions Tech Expo I want to help unleash the potential for Australia by bringing the emerging commercialised output of the technology and innovation world in energy and recycling together with my local community. As the slogan goes: think global, act local. This will be an opportunity for businesses in and around Higgins to demonstrate how their products fit into the global response to climate action and how each of us can take steps to respond to the global climate crisis.
       </p>
       <p>
        The expo will showcase businesses like edge energy that has developed voltage capping technology that prevents oversupply of energy to properties, resulting in a reduction in both emissions and energy costs for households and businesses. Another is SmartSwitch, a start-up company just up the road from my electoral office. SmartSwitch has developed a smart power socket which automatically removes power for unused appliances and devices. Another is SecondBite in Higgins. Over the last 10 years SecondBite has rescued surplus food from across the retail network and distributed it free of charge to more than 1,300 local charities around the country, providing food relief to people who need itâ€”a clever way to help significantly reduce food waste that contributes to 30 per cent of landfill. This is just one small contribution to the overarching work the Morrison government is doing on climate action.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Morrison government knows that the way to meaningful reductions in global emissions will be driven by science and technology and Australia is ready. Even as we speak, the government's technology investment road map is being developed. A draft will be open for input very soon and I encourage all of you to engage in this process. The technology investment road map will complement the Morrison government's $3.5 billion Climate Solutions Package.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Climate Solutions Tech Expo is a free event at the

        on Friday 17 April. I encourage all to come along to find out how they can contribute to emissions reduction each and every day.
