        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer the Prime Minister to the governmentâ€™s denials before the last election of any plan to expand the immigration detention facilities at Broadmeadows. Now that the government has announced that the Melbourne immigration transit accommodation at Broadmeadows is to be expanded, how can anybody believe any promise made by this government?

         I thank the member for her question. I know I was actually discussing with her that questions of redistribution in Victoria are pressing on her mind, but I did not understand she had her sights on Broadmeadows. It is a long way from her current electorate.

           In any event, can I say to the member opposite: obviously, the government has made a set of decisions about asylum seeker facilities. They were announced by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship. As I said yesterday, as the minister for immigration has said today and as I am happy to reiterate, obviously the department of immigration, from time to time working with the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Defence" rel="nofollow">
            Department of Defence
           </a>
           , considers contingencies and options for asylum seeker accommodation. There is nothing new in this. Similar processes used to happen under the previous government, the Howard government. I would remind the member, for example, that the Howard government actually dealt with the facility at
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
            Christmas Island
           </a>
           as a contingency. So this sort of planning goes on, work goes on, and that work has been happening in the department of immigration with, from time to time as it impacts on defence facilities, the Department of Defence. The minister for immigration made an announcement on 17 September about immigration facilities. There are some implications for the facility the member refers to and they are now on the public record.
