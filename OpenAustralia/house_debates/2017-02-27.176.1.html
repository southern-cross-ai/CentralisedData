        Today I am excited to update the House of the inaugural Oxley Electorate Spirit of Anzac Award. This is a competition open to students in year 11 across the Oxley electorate. They have been invited to submit a short essay, poem or piece of art work on what the spirit of Anzac means to them. The recipient judged to be awarded first prize will receive flights and accommodation, with a parent, to visit the

        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        later this year. Anzac Day holds a special place in the hearts of many Australians, as we pay our respects to those who gave the ultimate sacrifice for our country. I am looking forward to receiving entries from students across the electorate as to what this special commemoration means to them.

        A selection committee consisting of representatives from my local
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        subbranch has been convened to judge the most worthy recipient. Last Wednesday, I had the pleasure of joining year 11 students at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_Lake_State_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Forest Lake State High School
        </a>
        to officially launch the competition, alongside Mr Bob Richards, the newly elected president of the Forest Lake RSL Sub-Branch; Mr Steve Ford, the secretary and chairman of the Commemorative Committee; and Mr Brian Roche, the treasurer. I would particularly like to thank Mrs Denise Kostowski, the new principle at Forest Lake State High School, for joining me at the launch. We have some of the most dedicated and hardworking RSL subbranches in Oxley, who do a tremendous job of representing veterans. I am proud to work side by side with them, and I am looking forward to partnering with the branches as part of the Oxley Electorate Spirit of Anzac Award.
