        My question is for the Prime Minister. The date for the referendum for Aboriginal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islander
        </a>
        recognition through a voice has now been set. What is the significance of this referendum for our country?

         I thank the member for Spence for his question and for, indeed, hosting the event last Wednesday where we set 14 October as the day when every Australian will have a once-in-a generation chance to bring our country together and change it for the better, to vote for recognition and listening so that we can get better results and to say yes to an idea that has come from Aboriginal and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islander" rel="nofollow">
          Torres Strait Islander
         </a>
         people themselves. With the support of over 80 per cent of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
          Indigenous Australians
         </a>
         , people from all sides of politics, all faiths and all walks of life have come out in support of the 'yes' vote. Last night, we saw a true Australian hero,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Farnham" rel="nofollow">
          John Farnham
         </a>
         , lend his voice and his iconic song to the 'yes' campaign and an inspirational ad showing the moments that have united our country and taken it forward. As he sang:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We're not gonna sit in silence
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We're not gonna live with fear
        </p>
        <p>
         Those opposite have now committed to a second referendum. They say that, if Australians vote 'no' on 14 October, they will be subject to another referendum during the next term if they're successful in winning the next election. They're already planning the sequel while doing everything they can to sabotage the original. The second referendum, though, won't be on what Indigenous people have asked for. It'll be just on recognition, not a voice. But then they say they're going to legislate for a voice as well. So let's get this right. Beneath all of this fear campaign, both sides are saying that they support recognition and both sides are saying they will legislate for the Voice. The difference is, though, that they don't want it enshrined in the Constitution, as Indigenous people have asked for. They know better. The Leader of the Opposition says he will acknowledge that Indigenous people are here and that our history goes back and that it should be acknowledged, but he won't talk with them or listen to them. That is what this is about. It shows that it's all about politics, not about the substance that is before this referendum.
        </p>
        <p>
         Australians will have the opportunity to vote for recognition through the form that has been asked for, a voice, so that we can listen and so that we can get better results. When you listen to people who are directly affected by an issue, you will, of course, get better outcomes.
