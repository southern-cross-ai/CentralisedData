        My question is also to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. Can the minister confirm that, of the $1.5 billion of manufacturing funds announced in the recent budget, only $43 million, or less than three per cent, will be spent this financial year? Why is the government always focused on the announcement and not the delivery?

         I thank the member opposite for his question. In the three minutes that I have to answer that question, I'm going to do my best to explain to those opposite how manufacturing actually works and how we're going to be running out the funding.

           I'm happy to start with a memory jog for the Leader of the Opposition, who's talked about the car manufacturing industry. He forgets, in fact, that both Ford and Mitsubishi signalled their intention to close when Labor was last in government. But that's a little piece of history that they like to airbrush out because they don't like to admit when they've got things wrong.

           Let me get back to the issue of manufacturing. As I said in my earlier answer today, we have already started getting ready to roll out the money for the second round of the Manufacturing—

            The minister can just pause for a second. The level of interjections is far too high. I refer members to my statements last week. I'll have no hesitation in ejecting members who are

             I announced on Friday, in the member for Groom's electorate, the opening of the second round of the Manufacturing Modernisation Fund. That is about $52.8 million, and we are requiring employers, businesses, to be able to put in at a ratio of about three to one, so we are supporting those businesses that are prepared to invest in themselves. That money is already starting to go out. That is part of the $1.5 billion. There are additional streams for which we are going through the road-mapping process so that we can ensure that the money is going to go to the right area so that it builds competitiveness, it builds resilience and it builds scale. The fund runs over a period of four years. The largest part, the collaboration stream, is where we're looking to bring businesses together so that we can actually build the scale that is needed. Understandably I have no intention of squandering taxpayer money and trying to rush dollars out the door. So we have set in place a proper process to make sure that industry are engaged right at the beginning and that we are working with them to develop what the priorities are within the six manufacturing areas. That money is going to roll out over a number of years. The first round of funding, for two streams—that that deals with export and that that deals with commercialising good ideas—will open in April.

              The member for Sydney probably didn't hear that, because she continues to interject. For those new members who don't know what a general warning means, it means I will eject without warning. Do you want me to say it again, because, when this happens, people are confused, as if I'm speaking in a foreign language? Okay.
