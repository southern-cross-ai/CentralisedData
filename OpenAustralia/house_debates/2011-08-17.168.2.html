        I rise today to draw attention to what I consider to be an indication of the declining standards in this place by someone who should know better but who is obviously totally frustrated by his own deficiencies. In last Saturday's

        , the Deputy Prime Minister, the member for Lilley and Treasurer, referred to me as the hopeless

        member for Flynn because I refused to support the failed rollout of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        in Gladstone, Australia's industrial powerhouse. I would like to inform him that I fully support the coalition's fast broadband plan, which could be provided sooner and at much less cost to Gladstone and rural and regional centres throughout Australia, as detailed recently by coalition communications spokesman, Mr Malcolm Turnbull.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am wondering how the Deputy Prime Minister defines hopelessness. Does hopelessness mean his inability to deliver on a Labor promise, one of a series to the people of Gladstone? Does hopelessness mean a person who has to petition his own government and Prime Minister to deliver something he promised a year ago? Or does hopelessness mean failure by the Treasurer to understand basic economics like how to calculate a company's cost of capital, let alone the nation's spiralling debt? Or maybe hopelessness is the same as cluelessness when it comes to understanding that a carbon tax costs people in my electorate and many others their jobs and their livelihoods.

        When I joined this place I hoped that I would be able to work with both sides of politics to get things done for my electorate and I have developed a good working relationship with many on the other side. I have great respect for the members for Hotham and Batman, and I thank them for their help across a number of issues that affect my electorate. Senator

        scheme.
       </p>
       <p>
        It would be helpful if the Deputy Prime Minister set some time aside next time he comes to my electorate, and I can show him what really is happening on the ground. In the past he has chosen to fly in, jump on a helicopter to fly over the harbour and then attend a sausage sizzle with his union delegates and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ALP" rel="nofollow">
         ALP
        </a>
        members. Next time the Deputy Prime Minister comes to town, give me a chance to take him to talk to small business who are doing it tough in my area. Let him talk to the families that Labor policies are hurting. Let me show him what the majority of workers in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">

        think of the carbon tax. Take the politics out of it, Mr Deputy Prime Minister, and put the people of Central Queensland first.
