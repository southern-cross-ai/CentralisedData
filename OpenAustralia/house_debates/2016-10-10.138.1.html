       <p>
        In the electorate of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Trobe" rel="nofollow">
         La Trobe
        </a>
        , when you are driving your car along and you are on the mobile phone, there is nothing worse than realising that the person you were talking to is no longer there. Why? Because you have hit a mobile black spot. But, in actual fact, it can be a lot worse—through the upcoming fire season local residents need to ensure they have connection when it comes to mobile coverage.
       </p>
       <p>
        The coalition government understands the importance of mobile phone coverage and has identified inadequate coverage in remote and regional areas, and outer metropolitan areas, across Australia. My electorate of La Trobe has grown rapidly in population, making the current infrastructure, which was limited, now non-existent for a large number of my constituents. Mobile phone coverage is one of the biggest issues in my electorate of La Trobe. I receive emails from my constituents on a weekly basis in relation to this issue. Mobile phone coverage is essential in today's modern life. Unreliable or no mobile phone reception is also a major safety risk, as I previously mentioned, particularly for those who may require support or assistance from emergency service operators.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite being in government for six years, Labor did not spend one dollar on fixing mobile black spots, leaving the community at risk. I have relayed the calls from my constituents for help back to the Turnbull Liberal team, which, I am proud to say, has taken action. To date the coalition has made a total investment of $220 million towards the rollout of 499 new or upgraded mobile stations, which is fantastic. This is an important investment in infrastructure for the future. Four suburbs in my electorate—Officer, Beaconsfield, Gembrook and Guys Hill—have been included in this rollout. There are also a number of mobile phone towers going up in the seat of Casey, where the Speaker sits.
       </p>
       <p>
        These suburbs have been specifically selected as they have been overlooked by mobile network operators due to commercial factors. Having travelled through all of these areas, I understand the community's need for better coverage and services—and their frustration, which I previously mentioned. The Mobile Black Spot Program will improve both phone coverage and competition for customers, which will only be a good thing. The beneficiaries of this program will be residents and businesses, who will be enabled to communicate with the outside world. This program is a win for the community. Thank you to all of my constituents who took the time to contact my office regarding this issue.
