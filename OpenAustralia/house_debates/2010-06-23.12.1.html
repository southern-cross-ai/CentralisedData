        Mr Deputy Speaker, I hope you will allow me a brief indulgence to say that moving the second reading of the

         Australian Civilian Corps Bill 2010
        </a>
        gives me an opportunity that is not exactly unique but very rare. I do not think that anybody since
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gorton" rel="nofollow">
         John Gorton
        </a>
        has had the chance to have introduced, on behalf of the government, a bill in each House of the parliament. It is a very small privilege, for which I am grateful.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia is putting in place a new capability to assist countries in crisis.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian Civilian Corps will deploy Australian expertise into countries experiencing or emerging from disaster or conflict to assist with stabilisation and recovery efforts.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian Civilian Corps will complement Australia’s existing humanitarian support by helping governments and communities to achieve durable and sustainable growth and prosperity.
       </p>
       <p>
        Through the corps, Australian expertise will be deployed overseas to help restore essential services and infrastructure and to help rebuild government institutions to establish economic and social stability.
       </p>
       <p>
        The concept of an Australian Civilian Corps formally emerged from the Australia 2020 Summit in April 2008.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government responded to the idea of ‘a deployable public service’ by agreeing to develop an Australian Civilian Corps.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill provides for the establishment and management of the Australian Civilian Corps.
       </p>
       <p>
        To serve with the corps, civilian specialists will be engaged as a new category of Commonwealth employee.
       </p>
       <p>
        They will be known as Australian Civilian Corps employees.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australian Civilian Corps employees will be a unique category of Commonwealth employee, engaged for specified periods of work in crisis environments overseas before returning to their regular employment.
       </p>
       <p>
        These employees will be drawn from a register of civilian specialists selected for their technical skills and ability to work in challenging environments overseas.
       </p>
       <p>
        They will have expertise in areas such as public administration and finance, law and justice, engineering, health administration and community development.
       </p>
       <p>
        They will be sought from all levels of government and the broader Australian community.
       </p>
       <p>
        As Commonwealth employees, these individuals will be clearly identifiable as Australian government representatives overseas.
       </p>
       <p>
        They will have the rights and protections afforded to Commonwealth employees, as well as the associated obligations.
       </p>
       <p>
        The central purpose of the bill is to create an effective and fair employment and management framework for Australian Civilian Corps employees.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill provides for terms and conditions and other employment arrangements specifically designed for this kind of employment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian Civilian Corps will be administered by AusAID, in cooperation with other Australian government agencies.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill provides that the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Director_General" rel="nofollow">
         Director General
        </a>
        of AusAID will be responsible for managing the Australian Civilian Corps.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill gives the director general, on behalf of the Commonwealth, the power to engage individuals as Australian Civilian Corps employees.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill also gives the director general the power to determine the remuneration and other terms and conditions of Civilian Corps employees.
       </p>
       <p>
        These terms and conditions will be tailored to the particular requirements of the Australian Civilian Corps.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australian Civilian Corps employees will be covered by the applicable minimum standards of employment under the Fair Work Act.
       </p>
       <p>
        A set of values and a code of conduct for the Australian Civilian Corps will be prescribed by regulation.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian Civilian Corps Values will set out the principles, standards and ethics to be embodied by the corps.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Director General of AusAID will be required to uphold and promote the values.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian Civilian Corps Code of Conduct will set out the standards of behaviour and conduct expected of Australian Civilian Corps employees.
       </p>
       <p>
        Breaches of the code of conduct will be subject to disciplinary action.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important that civilian specialists can transition easily between Australian Civilian Corps employment and their regular employment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill contains provisions to facilitate this transition, including a provision to enable employers to grant leave without pay to their employees so that they can serve with the Australian Civilian Corps.
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill also enables the Prime Minister to issue directions to Commonwealth employers about the participation of their employees in the corps.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian Civilian Corps will take part in assistance missions led by Australia and those in which Australia plays a major role as part of a regional or international community effort.
       </p>
       <p>
        It will also be able to contribute to bilateral or multilateral efforts, including through the secondment of Australian Civilian Corps employees to bodies such as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations" rel="nofollow">
         United Nations
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The bill contains a provision to enable the Director General of AusAID to arrange such secondments.
       </p>
       <p>
        Other employment arrangements also dealt with by the bill include assignment of duties, suspension and termination from employment.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian Civilian Corps builds on Australia’s proud history of providing assistance in times of crisis, such as that provided in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor" rel="nofollow">
         East Timor
        </a>
        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon_Islands" rel="nofollow">
         Solomon Islands
        </a>
        and Indonesia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The corps will enable Australia to make further contributions to stability in our region and beyond.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia will be better positioned to help vulnerable populations in times of great need and play its part as a good international citizen.
       </p>
       <p>
        By creating an appropriate employment and management framework for the Australian Civilian Corps, this bill will help ensure the success of this important Australian initiative.
