       <p>
        I'd like to take this opportunity to reflect on the life and legacy of Gorur Krishna Harinath
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        , who passed away on 18 November. Dr Hari, as he was affectionately known, arrived in Australia in 1971 from Hyderabad. After training as a doctor, he had a remarkable career of community service, especially in the world of cricket.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2009 he was recognised in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Birthday_Honours_List" rel="nofollow">
         Queen's Birthday Honours List
        </a>
        and received an Order of Australia medal for his service to the sport and to his community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Throughout his life, Dr Hari championed multiculturalism. He was a passionate supporter of the Australia India Business Council and advocated for stronger bilateral relations. Dr Hari also served as chairperson of the Multicultural

        â€”the highest honour conferred to an Indian living overseas. Through much of his time, Dr Hari ran a thriving local medical practice. His Eastgardens clinic was frequented by cricket greats along with community and business leaders.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our thoughts today are with his family and his friends. Dr Hari is remembered as a kind-hearted, thoughtful and passionate community leader who touched the lives of many. May he rest in peace.
