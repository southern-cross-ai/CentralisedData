        I pay tribute to former member for Wide Bay Clarrie Millar, who served the Australian parliament between 1974 and 1990 and passed away on 28 November at the age of 92. Mr Millar served as Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees. He was an effective, talented and diligent member of parliament. From humble beginnings, he worked as a postal officer in the

        and as a farmer. He was also an accomplished private pilot.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr Millar had a genuine interest in people with a natural empathy to represent his constituents. He was renowned for his eloquent, elaborate expressions, his great sense of humour and his quick wit. My staffer, Mary-Anne Boldery, who worked for Clarrie and then

        , tells me that in the 1980s a constituent who believed they were being spied on by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KGB" rel="nofollow">
         KGB
        </a>
        would often seek Clarrie out. After numerous meetings, Clarrie quipped: '
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_KGB" rel="nofollow">
         The KGB
        </a>
        are onto us. We can't be seen together anymore!'
       </p>
       <p>
        Respected by both sides of parliament for his competence and impartiality in the chair, his contribution to debate was wise and well regarded. Mr Millar is sadly missed by his wife, Dorothy, their children, Bob, David, Wendy, Lisa and Trudi, their families and also his former colleagues and friends.
