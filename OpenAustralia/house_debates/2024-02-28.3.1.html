         Age Verification

        , as a way of protecting children from online harm;

        (c) the Government's decision has been widely criticised by leading child and women's safety advocates across Australia;

       <p class="italic">
        (2) further notes the evidence of the eSafety Commissioner during Senate Estimates on 13 February 2024, in which she confirmed there were already a range of age assurance technologies that can be used to protect children from online harm, and that such 'technologies are getting better all the time';
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) condemns the Government for:

        (1) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) expensive and unreliable fossil fuel energy has driven up power bills by over 20 per cent in eastern states;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) households can reduce their bills:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) by an average between $1,134 and $1,822 a year with rooftop solar;

        (2) acknowledges that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the Government has taken significant positive steps in this area, including the Household Energy Upgrades Fund, Solar Banks Scheme, and funding for social housing;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) despite these positive steps, no funding has yet been disbursed from the Household Energy Upgrades Fund, and the 110,000 households that will be supported through the scheme are just a small fraction of the millions which need help; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) calls on the Government to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) accelerate disbursement of existing support via the Household Energy Upgrades Fund;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) fund a 'people power plan' to lower energy bills in the May budget, with significant additional support for renters, apartment dwellers, and those with lower incomes and savings, as well as new measures to help landlords, homebuilders, and people in regional and rural communities hosting large-scale renewable projects and transmission lines; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

       <p class="italic">
        (a) 11.5 million taxpayers will receive a bigger tax cut than under the former Government's plan;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) Australians who earn up to $40,000 a year will receive a tax cut when they would not have under the former Government's plan; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) these tax cuts come on top of the billions of dollars in targeted and responsible cost-of-living relief, much of which was opposed by the Opposition, including:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) energy bill relief;

        (v) higher income support payments; and

       <p class="italic">
        (vi) the biggest boost to rent assistance in 30 years; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) acknowledges the stark contrast in policies between the Government wanting Australians to earn more and keep more of what they earn, while the Opposition wants Australians to work longer and for less.

        (1) notes:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the growing illicit tobacco industry is costing the country $4.2 billion in revenue each year this government fails to strengthen penalties and enforcement measures; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) that the continued failure to seriously address the illicit tobacco trade:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) has enabled organised crime groups to fund serious criminal activity including large scale drug importation and human trafficking;

        (ii) has seen an increase in violence and attacks on lawful retail tobacco businesses;

        (iii) has had a detrimental effect to the health of individuals and community safety;

        (v) continues to severely impact the ordinary trade of lawful retail tobacconists;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) recognises the leadership of the previous Government on enforcement on the illicit tobacco trade by:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) establishing the Illicit Tobacco Taskforce in 2018, a multi-agency taskforce to protect Australian revenue and detect and disrupt organised crime syndicates that deal in illicit tobacco; and

       <p class="italic">

        (b) almost one in three first home buyers in 2022-23 were supported by the scheme, a significant increase from the previous year under the former Government;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) the Government delivered on its commitment to introduce the new Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee three months ahead of schedule in October 2022, and it has assisted more than 15,000 people across regional Australia into home ownership; and

        (2) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the Government wants to provide even more support for people to own their home through the Help to Buy scheme, which is due to start later this year following the passage of state legislation; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) Help to Buy will support eligible home buyers with an equity contribution of up to 40 per cent for new homes and 30 per cent for existing homes, with eligible buyers needing as little as a 2 per cent deposit to buy a home; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) further notes that the Home Guarantee Scheme and Help to Buy are just two parts of the Government's broad and ambitious housing agenda, with the Government committing funding of $25 billion in new housing investments over the next decade including committed funding to support thousands of new social and affordable rentals, with many already under construction.

        (5) acknowledges that without government intervention to support growers to adapt in this critical period, the wine grape growing sector will experience forced exits and widespread vineyard abandonment which can lead to significant biosecurity risks, attrition of younger generations in the affected areas, and adverse mental health consequences across regional communities; and
