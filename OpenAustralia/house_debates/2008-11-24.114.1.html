       <p>
        Last week this place hosted a historic and, it needs to be said, long overdue event. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Council
        </a>
        of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Local Government
        </a>
        began what I hope and what this government hopes is a constructive tradition of engaging with the level of government which, it could be argued, has the most influence on the lives of many Australians. Let me be upfront about this: I bring a bias to the issue of local government. In my previous life I was the deputy mayor of Launceston
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         City Council
        </a>
        and my view of local government is coloured and informed by this. I believe that council and municipal bodies have an incredible impact on people’s lives. As a member of the federal government I am pleased to say that this has been acknowledged. The Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government has been vocal in his support for the role of local government. Minister Albanese has consistently pointed out that much of the infrastructure we use daily and often take for granted is the responsibility of local government.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are some 650,000 kilometres of roads which are the responsibility of local government, more than 14,000 kilometres of which are in my home state of Tasmania. I mentioned that I attended the Australian Council of Local Government meeting, and so too did many of my mayors from my electorate of Bass. In fact, Launceston’s mayor, Alderman Albert van Zetten, addressed one of the morning plenary sessions. I advocated for this to happen because I believe Northern Tasmania and, in particular, councils in Northern Tasmania have much to contribute to the national agenda. I also feel it is absolutely vital that as a federal government we continue to listen to the views and needs of local governments across the country.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is why, when community cabinet met in Launceston earlier this month, I facilitated a meeting between the mayors and general managers of councils in my electorate as well as chambers of commerce and Northern Tasmanian Development and Ministers Anthony Albanese and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindsay_Tanner" rel="nofollow">
         Lindsay Tanner
        </a>
        . This was an opportunity for councils in particular to put their case directly to the senior ministers for funding for a variety of projects and infrastructure needs. From
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Flinders Island
        </a>
        to Georgetown to Dorset and Launceston councils, the input reflected the diverse needs of Bass and indeed Northern Tasmania. I am grateful for the time given by Ministers Tanner and Albanese and also the local government representatives.
       </p>
       <p>
        When our country’s mayors gathered in Canberra last week, the government took the opportunity to announce $300 million in funding. The Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program is designed to boost local economies and help councils and shires to build and refresh community infrastructure. In my electorate of Bass, councils will share in around $2 million.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launceston_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Launceston City Council
        </a>
        will receive $578,000.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorset_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Dorset Council
        </a>
        will receive $288,000. Flinders Island will benefit from $100,000, Georgetown Council will receive $237,000, while
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meander_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Meander Valley
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Tamar" rel="nofollow">
         West Tamar
        </a>
        councils will $347,000 and $359,000 respectively.
       </p>
       <p>
        The significance of this funding to these councils cannot be overstated. They also have the opportunity to apply for funding for strategic projects from a $50 million fund. This could be used for social and cultural infrastructure, recreational facilities, tourism infrastructure, children, youth and senior facilities, access facilities and environmental initiatives. The timetable for both the $250 million proportionally allocated funds and the second strategic fund will encourage councils to identify projects as soon as possible in order to get the funding released.
       </p>
       <p>
        Like the government’s Economic Security Strategy and its assistance for pensioners, seniors, carers and families, this money combines the dual priorities of stimulating our economy at a time of financial upheaval and directing assistance where it is absolutely needed.
       </p>
       <p>
        I spoke earlier of the role and impact of councils on communities and on individuals. I know from my discussions with councils, not only in Bass, that there are many areas of need for this funding in the immediate term—as well as the opportunity to apply for more. It could not have come at a better time. Like governments at all levels across the country and like businesses, charities, organisations, workers, families and individuals, councils are feeling the impact of the global financial crisis. This government understands that and this government has acted.
