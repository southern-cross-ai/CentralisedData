        My question is to the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. How does the government intend to use new powers under environmental law to protect our oceans and fish stocks? What has been the response to this and what additional scientific work will now be done as a result of these changes?

         I want to thank the member for Wills for the question. The member for Wills is one of the first members of the parliament to express particular high levels of concern about wanting to make sure that our fishing remains sustainable.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, he was reflecting views that have been described by those opposite as only coming from environment groups. Nothing could be further from the truth. There has been no group making more noise in respect of this issue than recreational fishers. Recreational fishers have been responding loudly and strongly with two messages. Firstly, they want to make sure that in the years to come we have not overfished the stock. They want to make sure that they and their kids and grandkids can continue to catch fish in the same numbers that they can now. The second message that has come in response to the government's action is a genuine level of shock that an opposition which campaigned as through it were the friend of recreational fishing has gone missing on this issue and has actually become the chief opponent of a recreational fishing campaign. Recreational fishers have discovered, without any doubt, that those opposite stand against them when it comes to what happens 5Â½ kilometres from shore. They might be friends if there is a zone 400 kilometres away, but if it is as soon as you reach Commonwealth waters, those opposite and recreational fishers stand opposite each other, opposing each other, every step of the way in this debate.
        </p>
        <p>
         This legislation is now being dealt with in the Senate. It was delayed for an hour while opposition speakers debated for an hour whether or not they had time to debate it in the Senate, but then, having done that, the debate commenced. After question time the debate in the other place will continue. I certainly hope that they reach a conclusion in that debate today, because we want to be in a situation where the law is proclaimed and we want to be in a situation where the government is able to action the new laws and the new legal powers which it makes available.
        </p>
        <p>
         On proclamation of this legislation I will be using the legal authority made available to me and to the fisheries minister to be able to conduct the scientific research, which I wanted to be able to conduct, before conditions were put in place. In any other area of environmental law you can do it. In any other area of environmental law, if the information is not there, you can make sure that the studies are done before the decision has to be made. Until this law is through, you cannot do that and you do not have those same powers with respect to fisheries. This government makes no apologies for wanting to have a highly precautionary level of care when it comes to our oceans. Those opposite might be able to turn a blind eye to these issues, but we will not.

          Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask a supplementary question. I thank the minister for his answer and ask: why is it important when it comes to fisheries that we get the science right?

           I thank the member for Wills for the supplementary because it is so important to be able to get the scientific information right on this and to fill those knowledge gaps. It is not only the government and this parliament that have this view. When this issue was put before the Tasmanian parliament as to whether or not there was enough scientific information, every member of the Tasmanian parliament voted unanimously that the work had not yet been done for this trawler to commence operations. On the weekend the Victorian National Party minister,
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Walsh" rel="nofollow">
            Peter Walsh
           </a>
           , said that they would put a 12-month ban in place, the draft notice would ban large mid-water trawlers from operating in waters within three nautical miles of the Victorian coastline which fall under Victorian jurisdiction.

            The Liberals
           </a>
           in Tasmania know, the Liberals in Victoria know, but those opposite, when it comes to a choice between staying with recreational fishing or perhaps being on the conservation side of an issue, would rather desert every recreational angler in the country, desert them completely, because they could not bear to be on the side of conservation, even on an issue as important as this.
