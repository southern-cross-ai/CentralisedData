        Wednesday, 13 September 2006 was an exciting day for Australia’s vegetable industry. The release of a new strategic plan, Vegvision 2020, was officially launched by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Hon. Peter
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McGauran" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , and the Chairman of the Australian Vegetable Industry Development Group, Mr Richard Bovill. Vegvision 2020 provides a clear way forward for all parties to collaborate and invest in initiatives with the potential to shape and drive future industry growth. Its goal is to double the current value of fresh, processed and packaged Australian vegetables by 2020. This is an ambitious goal, but it is one that can be achieved, given the full support of the vegetable industry supply chain.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last year the Fair Dinkum Food campaign tractor rally, which was ably led by Richard Bovill, and which I was extremely proud to have been involved with, brought the concerns of vegetable growers from all over the country to the nation’s capital. On a journey that started in Devonport in my electorate, and made its way through the countryside of Victoria, to Sydney and down to Canberra, the campaign succeeded in raising national awareness of the difficulties facing the Australian vegetable industry. As a result, there has been a strong Australian government commitment, with $3 million being allocated to implement the outcomes of the Taking Stock and Setting Directions project, completed in November last year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Developing a strategic plan for the industry was the first of seven projects identified under Taking Stock and Setting Directions. Work is soon to begin on the remaining six projects identified through Taking Stock and Setting Directions. I have the utmost confidence in Richard and the Australian Vegetable Industry Development Group as they continue to work with others in the vegetable industry to roll out these projects. The Australian Vegetable Industry Development Group will use Vegvision 2020 when formulating and investing in projects to get the greatest gain for the whole of the industry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Vegvision 2020 is the first time a whole-of-industry approach has been developed for the vegetable industry in this country. We have been able to develop an industry action plan that we know will enhance and strengthen the vegetable industry’s chances of success, because we have worked to bring together all the major players. Through the hard work of many, and with the assistance of the Australian government, the industry has the potential for sustained growth and a prosperous future.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are some, particularly on the other side of this House, who continually seek to criticise this government over the challenges facing our vegetable growers. But unfortunately that is all they do—criticise. No plans of action are developed, no strategies agreed, no vision for the future of the industry is articulated. I would like to thank the minister, Mr McGauran, for his hard work and commitment to the vegetable industry. It is a commitment I share, because I understand the importance of a strong and viable vegetable industry to Australia, particularly to my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tasmania is bounteous in its supply of fresh, high-quality food products. It is a major producer of potatoes, carrots, beans, peas and fruit. It packages more than 80 per cent of Australia’s frozen vegetables. North-west Tasmania has some of Australia’s richest soils and a well-deserved reputation for growing some of the highest quality produce you will find anywhere in the world. I am sure that those who ventured over to the

        this evening will acknowledge that that rings true. Mr Speaker, that follows the produce from your electorate only two weeks ago. I congratulate you on organising such an event.
       </p>
       <p>
        Agriculture remains the backbone of north-west Tasmania’s economy. I am determined, with the Australian government, to do everything I can to support the local vegetable growers to help them achieve a successful and sustainable industry. I am pleased to say that Vegvision 2020 outlines a strategy that will ultimately mean more jobs for Tasmanians and deliver a stronger future for the industry, not only in Tasmania but throughout Australia.
