        On Friday night I was delighted to attend the opening dinner of a very popular and unique event in my electorate of Flynn—the Old Station Fly-in and Heritage Show, held at Old Station in Raglan. The show was started back in 1989 by the late Mr George Creed. His wife, Leonie, was there on Friday night and she runs a wonderful show. There were around 500 people at the dinner on Friday night and the guest speaker was

        champion of the world. It was great to hear him speak. After that, the crowd broke up for a two-day event on Saturday and Sunday. Not only did we have all sorts of aerobatics with the aeroplanes, but we also had: heritage machinery on display, aircraft on display, truck shows, vintage tractor pulls, joy-flights for kids and adults, live bands on Saturday night, fashion parades, and a licensed bar—everything you wanted was there. It is all thanks to Leonie Creed and her band of hardworking committee members, who have been there doing this since 1989. It has become a very popular event in my electorate, and they deserve the utmost praise. It has become a very, very popular event in my electorate. They deserve the utmost praise.
