        I wanted to inform the House this morning of a number of important community groups in my electorate and visits that I have recently undertaken. Last Friday, I attended the Mortdale
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        sub-branch's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembrance_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Remembrance Day
        </a>
        luncheon. I would like to thank the president,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Delaney" rel="nofollow">
         John Delaney
        </a>
        , and all members of the sub-branch who each year put on a very well-organised event in commemoration of Remembrance Day.
       </p>
       <p>
        The sub-branch is also the host of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
         Southern Sydney
        </a>
        service, which was held at Mortdale last Sunday, where sub-branches from right around the southern region of Sydney come to pay their respects to the fallen on Remembrance Day. I do thank Mr Delaney and everyone involved in the Mortdale RSL sub-branch for everything they do for our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to acknowledge the efforts of the Picnic Point Bowling and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Social Club
        </a>
        , an important part of the community in the Bankstown area. Recently, I met with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_McNamara" rel="nofollow">
         Steve McNamara
        </a>
        , the treasurer, and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Atkinson" rel="nofollow">
         John Atkinson
        </a>
        , the president, and discussed a range of issues of importance to this local club. One of the issues that the club is looking at is providing greater wheelchair access to the facility, and that is certainly something that I would be keen to assist the club with.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is an extensive layout, with a number of Greens, and it is a really well-attended and well-patronised club over there in Panania. To John Atkinson and Steve McNamara: thank you for taking the time for our discussion and I do look forward to further discussions in the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also visited the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probus_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Probus Club
        </a>
        of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_River" rel="nofollow">
         Georges River
        </a>
        -Riverwood recently, where I met with the members who were present and addressed the group. The group meets at Club Rivers, of course, which is ably led by its president, Michael Free. The president of the Georges River-Riverwood Probus branch is Joy Dixon, and at the meeting we learned about a range of activities happening within the Probus club. There is a very well-patronised walking group which a number of the members spoke about fondly. Indeed, the friendship and fellowship that is provided through membership of the club was something that numerous members spoke about very warmly. I very much enjoyed the visit. Probus clubs are a critical part of our community, and I thank the Georges River-Riverwood branch for all of their efforts.
