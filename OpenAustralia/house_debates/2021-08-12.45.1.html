       <p>
        Earlier today I spoke to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalil_Ibrahim" rel="nofollow">
         Khalil Ibrahim
        </a>
        , a friend of 30 years; someone who, in the Arabic way, calls me 'brother'. He lost his mother, Kaoukab, and father, Hachemâ€”his mother last Tuesday; his father on Friday. They lived in Marrickville around the corner from my home, and they've been known to me for a very long period of time. This wonderful family had eight children and 53 grandchildren. His mother survived a four-year battle with cancer but couldn't beat COVID. He said: 'Mum told us she couldn't breathe. Her bones were aching. She couldn't walk. She was suffering. Same thing with dad.'
       </p>
       <p>
        Unfortunately, only a few of their large family had the opportunity to say goodbye to these wonderful Australians. Khalil said, tragically, they had appointments to get vaccinated this week. Three others in the family have it in the home in Marrickville. Khalil has a message: 'Listen to our doctors. If you love your aunt, your uncle, your mother, your grandfather and your children, wouldn't you want to do anything you can to protect them?' He says to Australians to get the jab if you can. He has a wonderful business, Ibrahim Pastry, so he's well known throughout the community. I pay tribute to him and his family and express my sincere condolences on this tragedy.
