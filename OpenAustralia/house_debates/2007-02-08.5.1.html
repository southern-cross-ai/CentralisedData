        I move:

       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is with great pleasure that I introduce
        <a href="http://parlinfoweb.aph.gov.au/piweb/view_document.aspx?TABLE=oldbills&amp;ID=2180" rel="nofollow">
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appropriation_Bill" rel="nofollow">
          Appropriation Bill
         </a>
         (No. 3) 2006-2007
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        There are two additional estimates bills this year: Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and Appropriation Bill (No. 4). I shall introduce the latter bill shortly.
       </p>
       <p>
        The additional estimates bills follow on from the appropriation bills that were introduced into the House on the occasion of the 2006-07 budget. They seek appropriation authority from parliament for the additional expenditure of money from the consolidated revenue fund in order to meet requirements that have arisen since the last budget.
       </p>
       <p>
        The total appropriation being sought through the additional estimates bills this year is in excess of $1.8 billion. That amount is partially offset by expected savings in appropriations of around $464.2 million. Taking savings into account, the expected net increase in expenditure arising from additional estimates bills is approximately $1.37 billion, or about 2.1 per cent of total annual appropriations. These savings are described in the document accompanying the bills, titled the ‘Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations’, which I will table shortly.
       </p>
       <p>
        The total appropriation being sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) this year is almost $1.2 billion. This proposed appropriation arises from changes in the estimates of program expenditure, due to variations in the timing of payments and forecast increases in costs, reclassifications and from policy decisions taken by the government since the last budget, most of which were described in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook document published in December last year.
       </p>
       <p>
        I now outline the major items provided for in the bill.
       </p>
       <p>
        An increase of $74.2 million will be made available to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Agriculture" rel="nofollow">
         Department of Agriculture
        </a>
        , Fisheries and Forestry to provide:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         an additional $12 million to support primary producers in regions that have been declared eligible for exceptional circumstances assistance; and an additional $14 million to support primary producers in regions that have been declared eligible for interim income support;
        </li>
        <li>
         $17.3 million as taxable grants of up to $5,500 for eligible farmers, in areas that have been exceptional circumstances declared for more than three years, to obtain professional business and planning advice; and
        </li>
        <li>
         $30.9 million to assist former and current tobacco growers to move into other business activities.
        </li>
       </ul>
       <p>
        I know that many members will be very pleased with those additional appropriations. So many of us have large parts, if not all, of our electorates eligible for exceptional circumstances, which is the case in my electorate of Eden-Monaro.
       </p>
       <p>
        An additional $30.2 million will be provided to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">

        from December 2006. A further $11.6 million is proposed to increase the capacity of the Australian Federal Police to respond to peacekeeping, peace restoration and capacity-building overseas.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Communications,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Technology" rel="nofollow">
         Information Technology

Funding will comprise $23.4 million for a National Filter Scheme providing a free internet filter, or filtered internet service, for all Australian families and public libraries, and $11.4 million for a community education campaign.
       </p>
       <p>
        Additional funding is proposed for the

         Department of Defence
        </a>

        <li>
         $120.8 million will be provided for Operation ASTUTE to restore peace and stability in East Timor;
        </li>
        <li>
         $49.6 million for the first stage of a program to help improve the retention and recruitment of

          Australian Defence Force
         </a>
         personnel; and
        </li>
        <li>
         $32 million to deliver stage 1 of the Enhanced Land Force initiative, to increase the size of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Army" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         by one light infantry battalion.
        </li>
        <li>
         These funding increases for the Department of Defence are partially offset by savings in other programs.
        </li>

The program will provide grants of up to $20,000 a year directly to eligible schools to contribute to the cost of engaging a chaplain.
       </p>
       <p>
        An additional $17.1 million will be provided to the Office of Workplace Services to support an increase in its compliance and enforcement activities in regional areas so that adequate employment protection is provided to employees and to raise public awareness of the Office of Workplace Services and the Office of the Employment Advocate.
       </p>
