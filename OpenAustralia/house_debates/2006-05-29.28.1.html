       <p>
        I appreciate getting the call, because I have been urged strongly by members of the Turkish-Australian community living in Gellibrand to speak today. Unfortunately, I was not able to speak on Mr Cadman’s earlier motion on religious minorities. The terms of his motion before it was amended today were raised with me and were of great concern to the community. I think it was very wise that the House debated an amended motion, which was far more respectful of the differing views within the community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Obviously, it is important that the House is able to debate any issue that concerns members of the House about the broader international community, but I would like to place on the record my great support of and encouragement to Australians of Turkish origin, particularly those who live in my community. They have been such strong contributors to and a very peaceful and moderate force within the community and have integrated well in our schools and workplaces. They have set up soccer clubs and community groups—in particular, Mr Speaker, you might be amused to know that the old Tottenham pub has now been reclaimed, seriously renovated and turned into both a community centre and a place of worship for the Turkish Muslim community.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is an example of the positive influence that a community can have in turning facilities into places that can be used by a vast range of people who practise different religions to the mainstream Christian groups within our community.
