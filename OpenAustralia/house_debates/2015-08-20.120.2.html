       <p>
        Today is the Hunter region final of the Australian Technologies Competition. There are four finalists that are going to be judged today. One of those finalists comes from Shortland electorate. They operate their business in Belmont. The decision that will be reached today will pay tribute to one of the four businesses that have been nominated. Ai Group, in association with their sponsors and supporters—Hedweld, Forgacs, Dantia, the University of Newcastle and the New South Wales Department of Industry—are responsible for the heats in the Hunter today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Out of the four finalists, there will be one winner. They will then move to the national semifinals. The winner from the Hunter region will come from either Melvelle Equipment Corporation at Maryland, for a portable machine for the safe removal of corroded rail track flexiclips; Corky's Sustainable Energy, in Mayfield, for the safe abatement of methane from coalmine ventilation air; FluidIntel, Rutherford, for fuel and lubricant management systems facilitating fuel reduction of two to five per cent in the mining sector; or Lumo Solutions, Belmont, for a glow-in-the-dark visual awareness product for pedestrian traffic and also for boating equipment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lumo Solutions is a new and dynamic Australian company. It focuses on providing quality, unique glow-in-the-dark safety guidance components and systems. It is not limited to pedestrian crossings but used to mark out wharfs on the lake.

        , who came to see me when he was starting his company and who has kept in touch with us throughout the process of growing his company and his innovative product, is a really good example of an entrepreneur. He has an eye for innovation. I wish all the finalists good luck today. I understand the final takes place around 12 noon today. I congratulate Lumo Solutions and Andrew Brown for reaching the finals.
