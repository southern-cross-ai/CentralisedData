        My question is to the Prime Minister. Today outside parliament the Care Leavers Australasia Network protested against the Turnbull government's failure to establish a national redress scheme for survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. Why is the Prime Minister refusing to establish a national redress scheme for survivors of child sexual abuse, as recommended a year ago by the

         I thank the honourable member for her question. I and the member for Swan met with Leonie Sheedy, the head of CLAN, the Care Leavers Australasia Network, and I have worked with her, and her group, over many years—in fact, since the apology in 2009. I consulted with them before I made that apology on behalf of the opposition and have worked closely with them ever since. We had a very good meeting as we always have had. As a care leaver himself, the member for Swan has a very keen insight into and empathy for the situation of the members of CLAN and the men and women who were wronged by churches, charities and governments when they were in their care. An important thing for us to do is to acknowledge those wrongs, affirm that we believe them, that they are believed—and they are—and then ensure that redress is provided. We are working with state—

            There are a range of institutions and governments that owe responsibility to these Australians for the wrongs that have been done. Some state governments have very different views from others as to the manner in which redress should be provided. The Minister for
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
             Social Services
            </a>
            has been working constructively with those governments to ensure that redress is provided and we will be seeking to deliver a nationally consistent approach. But what honourable members opposite are proposing, I gather, is that the federal government should simply pay all of the compensation or all of the redress.

            The matter is being very carefully and empathically handled. We understand the situation. I say to honourable members opposite, particularly the member for Isaacs, who is a specialist in feigned indignation—nobody does a better line in indignation than him: there is no monopoly on compassion and empathy on their side of the House. We understand the problem. We are working sensitively through it with those affected, with institutions and with governments to ensure that justice is done.
