        Since the start of the year I have attended several school leadership team inaugurations around my electorate. Schools I have visited include Mango Hill State School, Bracken Ridge State School,

        and Scarborough State School, to name a few. It has been a great pleasure to present the school captains and other student leaders with their badges for 2014 and to meet the youths that, in a few years time, may very well be sitting in our seats.
       </p>

        They sang the national anthem with pride and their school songs with such enthusiasm. They spoke with confidence. When I asked some of the younger students at Mango Hill State School what they thought it meant to be a great leader, their answers were intelligent and inspirational. They gave answers like 'A good leader cares for others,' and 'A good leader cares for themselves, cares for the environment and cares for learning.' The school principal at Mango Hill State School, Ms Tracy Egan, and the other staff teach these important principles to the students. This is great to see. Congratulations, Mango Hill State School.
       </p>

        The unity I witnessed in all these schools throughout the Petrie electorate was tremendous. I wish the student leaders and all students at these schools across my electorate all the best for 2014 and for their future as bright and successful members of our society.
