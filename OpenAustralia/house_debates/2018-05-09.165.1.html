       <p>
        I'm thrilled to welcome more support for the Groom electorate from the federal budget released last night. Toowoomba and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darling_Downs" rel="nofollow">
         Darling Downs
        </a>
        are certainly setting the pace for regional Australia. We have a proven, strong local economy. We have the largest inland road project in Australia in the form of the Toowoomba second range crossing, currently under construction. We're progressing very well with plans for inland rail, Melbourne to Brisbane, and that will have a significant impact in my part of the world, on the Darling Downs. We continue to enjoy the benefits of the Toowoomba Wellcamp Airport, which is internationally capable. We continue to see, through the budget in particular, major highway upgrades on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrego_Highway" rel="nofollow">
         Warrego Highway
        </a>
        , particularly west of Oakey. World-class agriculture remains the signature of our region. As a regional centre for southern inland Queensland and northern inland
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        , we continue to attract health and education experts and services for people right throughout the regions. We're focused on a burgeoning tourism industry. As an early rollout site for both
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">

        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        , we have progressed a long way. But we know there is plenty more to do to make sure that everyone has the opportunity to benefit from opportunities in our part of the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'm particularly pleased to see my desire of studies proceeding towards passenger rail from Toowoomba to Brisbane, with a $15 million business case announced just last night as part of the budget, through the federal government's $250 million Major Project Business Case Fund. After decades of discussion and dreaming, we are taking this project from the drawing board through to delivery, and this will bring tremendous benefits to the whole region.
       </p>
       <p>
        In Groom, I've been very humbled to receive the continuing support of my party members as the re-endorsed candidate for the next federal election. And I note the interesting commentary from minor parties, in particular, who seem to focus on single issues, are ill-informed about local issues in Groom and across the Darling Downs, and yet seem to forget their own experience to date. I use the example of the performance of minor parties in the recent
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australian" rel="nofollow">
         South Australian
        </a>
        state election: theirs was an unmitigated disaster. In contrast to that, my region knows that our government is focused on tax relief to reward working Australians. We want to support our communities, ensure the essential services are in place and ensure the future.

        <p>
         The week before last, I held a forum for seniors in my electorate, in the beautiful memorial hall in Cockburn. Our guest was the shadow minister for families and social services, the honourable and the brilliant
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenny_Macklin" rel="nofollow">
          Jenny Macklin
         </a>
         . People asked questions or gave us their perspective about a range of issues, including pensions, health care, home care packages, dividend imputation, climate change, the resources and client services at Centrelink, and aged care services in general. Of course, we talked about the forthcoming budget and the areas in which Australia needs leadership, direction, action and a sense of purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
         The reality in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         is we are still fighting our way through the end of a recession. The reality for people on fixed incomes, like pensions, is that non-discretionary costs like gas and electricity, health costs, and health insurance are continuing to rise and they are far outstripping inflation. The reality for people in semiretirement is that we have the highest rate of unemployment in the country and opportunities to take on more work are extremely thin. Older Australians in my community—and seniors around the country—are closely bound up in the lives of their extended families, and they see close at hand the pressures their kids face at a time of falling real wages and record household debt. They're often called upon as a childcare backup when early childhood education places aren't available or affordable or when casual employment and shift work springs a surprise on parents, who, because of their financial position and insecurity of tenure, aren't in a position to pick and choose.
        </p>
        <p>
         So along came last night's budget, with people understandably hoping for some direction from government. But in the end, it is just more of the same. It's 'Let's play the old tune once more with feeling'. The government remains intent on $80 billion in tax cuts to big business, when company profits are strong—billions of dollars to go to the same banks and financial institutions which otherwise have relied on charging people unnecessary fees, sometimes after they're dead! The Turnbull government are going to push on with removing the clean energy supplement, they're going to persist with the Medicare freeze, they're going to proceed with a further cut of 1,280 jobs in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Human_Services" rel="nofollow">
          Department of Human Services
         </a>
         , with a further shift towards outsourcing and privatisation of essential services. That is a recipe for more delays; it's a recipe for more mistakes and more robo-debt disasters. The government that were elected nearly five years ago on the promise of no cuts to the ABC are cutting a further $84 million from our public broadcaster. There is not one new dollar for investment in infrastructure in my state or anywhere else, as far as I can see.
        </p>
        <p>
         This latest budget from the Abbott-Turnbull government continues their tradition of cuts to the things we share and largesse to the big end of town. There is no relief for those who need it most. It is a bitter disappointment. It is a dereliction of leadership and responsibility at a time when we need a government that will take on the big challenges and provide some solutions.

         <p>
          Firstly, I'd like the congratulate the Treasurer, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Finance for delivering a budget for all Australians—a budget that delivers more jobs, guarantees essential services and, through disciplined fiscal management, ensures the government is living within its means. The coalition government has a plan for a stronger economy and jobs. It was great to hear the member for Calwell recently talking about the coalition's Stronger Communities Program. It's great when a Labor member stands up and talks about our programs that are delivering to communities all across Australia.
         </p>
         <p>
          Our economy is in its 27th year of consecutive growth. Business conditions are at the highest level since the global financial crisis, and global growth is at its fastest pace in six years. Through this, jobs are being created, investment is rising and the budget is strengthening, enabling the government to guarantee services that Australians can rely on. Our careful approach to spending and our prudent measures to improve tax and welfare integrity have played a major role in assisting the budget's return to balance whilst investing in key projects across our nation.
         </p>
         <p>
          I think a lot of people forget that the government is actually spending taxpayer dollars. The benefits of a job and income, a wage and reward for effort are all reliant on a strong economy. As such, it is our responsibility to ensure the government is living within its means. I'm very proud to say that, for the first time in a decade, the government is no longer borrowing to pay for everyday expenses.
         </p>
         <p>
          Late last month the Prime Minister visited the great state of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
           Western Australia
          </a>
          to announce the coalition government's $2.3 billion infrastructure package—the largest single infrastructure investment we have seen, dedicating to keeping WA moving. The package is committed to busting congestion, improving safety for WA commuters and road users. It is beneficial to regional WA and people in the metro area like my constituents in Swan. This is on top of the $2.3 billion Boosting Jobs Busting Congestion package included in last year's budget, which included vital infrastructure such as the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manning_Road" rel="nofollow">
           Manning Road
          </a>
          on-ramp and the upgrades to the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roe_Highway" rel="nofollow">
           Roe Highway
          </a>
          and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalamunda_Road" rel="nofollow">
           Kalamunda Road
          </a>
          intersection in my electorate.
         </p>
         <p>
          Two key problem areas will be addressed by the new investment package. The first is the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welshpool_Road" rel="nofollow">
           Welshpool Road
          </a>
          and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leach_Highway" rel="nofollow">
           Leach Highway
          </a>
          intersection upgrade. The $47 million invested in this project will ensure a dramatic reduction of congestion all the way to the airport. A further $144 million is being invested into the Roe Highway Great Eastern Highway bypass, a stretch of road that has become increasingly dangerous with heavy traffic. The intersection upgrade and the investment package as a whole will create thousands of jobs, stimulate economic growth and bust congestion, allowing commuters to get home more quickly and safely. The Treasurer and the coalition government have delivered a budget that is lower taxing, simpler and fairer. It is fiscally responsible and, importantly, rewards effort.
