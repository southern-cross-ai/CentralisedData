       <p>
        Last month, I had the fortune of meeting Dr Rajendra Awal and Yogita Awal, a formidable team delivering medical care for the people of Sarina. I was in Sarina to announce that their practice, Awal Medical Centre, would receive $300,000 in funding to expand medical services and training after they were selected for a federal government grant. Patients in Sarina will soon feel the benefits of improved facilities in the Awal Medical Centre, a bonus in and of itself. The practice was amongst 67 offered grants under the government's Rural General Practice Grants Program. This grant will enable Awal Medical Centre to expand and improve its facilities. It will enable the Awals to improve the structure of the existing building, adding an additional four consultation rooms. They will also have a training room for student doctors and health specialists coming through.
       </p>
       <p>
        What touched me the most about this announcement was learning what an integral part the pair has played in the wellbeing of the Sarina community. Dr Awal, with support from Yogita, is trying to train as many medical students as possible so they retain them locally. Better facilities will allow more doctors, nurses and other health workers to gets hands-on training in general practices in regional areas like Sarina. They will be able to attend to patients and also, when they are fully qualified, are more likely to decide to stay in the region or in other regional communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The funding will also deliver a big waiting area where they can provide education for their patients to change lifestyle issues, using the area positively for the community at large. Dr Awal is absolutely dedicated to regional medical practice and ensuring that people in regional areas have access to decent health care. Their dedication to training and retaining local doctors goes beyond the call of duty, and I am so honoured that our government are supporting their endeavours through this new funding. Improving access to doctors and other health professionals in rural and regional Australia is a priority for our long-term national health plan. I applaud this wonderful duo for their ongoing commitment to the Sarina community.
