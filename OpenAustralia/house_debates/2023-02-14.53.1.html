        My question is to the Prime Minister. A single mother with six children in Queensland has been hit with a $1,500 electricity bill, much of which is due to the mother's need to charge her
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        -supported daughter's electric wheelchair. Given a worker at the mother's electricity company told this struggling single mother she will probably be paying her bill 'for the rest of her life', will the Prime Minister immediately apologise to this family for promising them a $275 annual cut to their power bill? Why do Australian families always pay more under Labor?

         I thank the member for Forde for his question. I do note he was absent—he had leave—when the vote happened in this parliament, which was $1.5 billion of assistance for people just like the constituent that he raised. That is why the Queensland government, as well as the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         government, as well as every state and territory government, as well as this national government all signed up to energy price relief—$1½ billion, but those opposite, of course, voted against that. They voted against price caps that are already having an impact on prices. We know the member for Hume hide the price rises before the election and then misled Australians about it—actually changed the rules so that it wouldn't be declared.

          <p>
           Of course, as well we know we're more vulnerable to international price increases than we should be because four gigawatts of capacity got taken out of the grid and only one gigawatt put in. We're more vulnerable because we had 22 energy policies announced but not a single one delivered. They left us with an energy grid that was built for the last century.
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snowy_Hydro" rel="nofollow">
            Snowy Hydro
           </a>
           is a positive initiative. They just forgot to plug it into the grid.
          </p>
          <p>
           Those opposite came up with all sorts of fantasies about a way forward, including one in Queensland I well remember—the feasibility study that was happening for the Collinsville power plant. I wonder who they gave $4 million for a feasibility study to. They gave it to the proponent—'Here's $4 million to see if your project stacks up.' They took that to an election. They told Queenslanders that it was going to make a difference.
