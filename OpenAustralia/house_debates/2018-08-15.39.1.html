        During the winter recess, I had the opportunity to attend the

         Country Women's Association
        </a>
        State Creative Arts Exhibition in the Leongatha Town Hall in south Gippsland. The hall was teeming with people and full of exhibits, with over 270 categories and over 1,800 items created by the talented members of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CWA" rel="nofollow">

        from across Victoriaâ€”a record number for recent years, with about one-third coming from the Gippsland region. Included in the displays were crafts, knitting, embroidery, art, cookery, preserves, floral art, toys, dolls and many other categories. It was inspiring to meet the many women who had crafted and created the items on display. CWA members had travelled from as far afield as Goulburn Murray and Warrnambool to attend the exhibition.

        I'd like to congratulate the organising committee on a great event. To Anne Du Ve, Heather Scott and

        ; the many other women who helped prepare the exhibition; and those who created the arts and crafts on display: thank you for your dedication to the CWA and for your commitment to our community. Local CWA branches were successful in the exhibition, with many receiving awards, including the Mackie family's trifecta, which saw Marilyn Mackie and her granddaughters, Jasmin and Ruby, all winning awards. Since 1928, the CWA has played an important leadership role in the community across this nation. To me, the CWA stands for truth, integrity, respect and compassion. If we can deliver more of that into our daily lives, we'll be much better off.
