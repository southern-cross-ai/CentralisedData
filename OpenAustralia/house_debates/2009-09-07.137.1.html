         Last Thursday
        </a>
        two significant events were held in my electorate of Page. One was in Grafton and was called Deadly Days. The other was in Lismore and was a jobs forum called Keep Australia Working. Deadly Days was supported by the Australian government and overwhelmingly supported locally. I commend the

        Aboriginal Learning Partnerships for their work and in particular Tony Driese for his work and commitment to making sure it was successful. There are actually three of them over the whole North Coast, but this particular one was in my electorate. I also want to thank local musician and Indigenous woman Evette Clague, who represented me at the Deadly Days and gave a lovely speech, which was prepared in braille so Evette could read it. I want to publicly thank her for that.

        I also thank the 110 community members, representatives of business, industry, unions and local government, including the mayors of
