       <p>
        I rise today to speak about something that is very near and dear to the people of Townsville, and that is women in sport.

        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townsville_Fire" rel="nofollow">
         Townsville Fire
        </a>
        almost folded last year, but this year the re-formed Townsville Fire, with a new board, a new brand and a new uniform, have won their first six games in a row. They are a fantastic team. We have a new facility in Townsville

        Stadium, and last week's game against the Sydney University Flames was a top-of-the-table clash and an absolute sell-out of just under 3,000 people.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian Women's National Basketball League is being broadcast by the ABC.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_ABC" rel="nofollow">
         The ABC
        </a>
        will go to Sydney, it will go to Melbourne, it will go to Bulleen and to Bendigo. It will go to Adelaide and it will go to Perth, but will the ABC come to Townsville? No, it will not! Here you have possibly the greatest women's basketball team in the history of the sport in Australia not being able to be shown on its home court. I call on the ABC to get behind the likes of Rachael Flanagan and her co-captain, to get behind our head coach, Chris Lucas, and the whole team. This includes the local talentâ€”the scholarship girls, the Froling twins, who are just about to finish school and who look like they will go on to play for Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australia is currently the silver medallist in basketball at the Olympics, and the ABC should be supporting Townsville Fire because they are a great side. Thank you very much.
