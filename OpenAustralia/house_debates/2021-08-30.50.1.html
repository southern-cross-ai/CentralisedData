        Two weeks ago the Premier of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        announced a further series of restrictions to combat the runaway delta outbreak. These restrictions now require workers in Werriwa to have a permit to go to work. As with previous announcements, there was scant detail about how this would work. Inevitably, this announcement caused a flurry of chaos and confusion. The state government, in its arrogance, got around to clearing up the confusion over the following days. In the intervening time, we had workers convinced they either wouldn't have a job or would be unable to go to their job because it's outside their

        . They fear fines and imprisonment but also, more disturbingly, poverty.
       </p>
       <p>
        My constituents are ready to do their bit; they have been since the crisis began. However, the New South Wales government continues to put hurdles in the way. Despite announcing the permits the week before, the application was only made available last Thursday evening prior to implementation. Inevitably, the demand caused the application on the Service

        site to crash.
       </p>
       <p>
        With each confusing announcement and botched delivery, the people become more wary, cynical and fatigued. It is time the state government got these things right. Lives are at stake, and their ineptitude is causing unnecessary stress for my community.
