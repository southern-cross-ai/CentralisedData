       <p>
        [by video link] Today I would like to talk about a proposed sports infrastructure project in my electorate of Chisholm. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waverley_Hockey_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Waverley Hockey Club
        </a>
        is looking to expand by constructing a second hockey pitch at Ashwood Reserve. This would mean that the club would be able to better support its members by providing the facilities for its teams, especially the women's team, to practise and play more games at home.
       </p>
       <p>
        A central issue that has prevented Waverley Hockey Club and another key supporter of the project, Monash City Council, from progressing further has been that several other local groups make use of Ashwood Reserve. The Victorian Sikh Association is one of those groups. I had the pleasure of meeting with its representatives,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manjit_Singh" rel="nofollow">
         Manjit Singh
        </a>
        , Jag Bal and others last week. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VSA" rel="nofollow">
         VSA
        </a>
        is a wonderful organisation committed to sharing their Sikh heritage through sports, cultural exchanges and active community participation. It is also an inclusive group which, despite its natural Sikh focus, welcomes people of all backgrounds to take part in its events and activities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Members of the VSA are justifiably worried about the future of their club and the possibility that they may need to move from their current home at Ashwood Reserve. That is why it was an important development that council resolved recently to recognise the need to accommodate the group and voted to only consider a project funding proposal in relation to Ashwood Reserve if funding for the cost associated with relocating the VSA was also received. It is vital that council follow-up this resolution with a detailed report on possible relocation options. This report should be completed as soon as possible. It is also absolutely necessary that it takes into account the views and preferences of the VSA. So I was heartened to see that council has resolved to work with the group on this matter going forward.
       </p>
       <p>
        I will do all that I can to ensure that council keeps its commitment. Ensuring that the report is completed without delay will be beneficial to all involved. The hockey club can begin to pursue funding opportunities with a clearer cost figure in mind and the VSA leadership will be able to begin consulting with members to make a decision as to whether they will support a move away from Ashwood Reserve. The broader community and some locals who I know are concerned about losing access to parts of the reserve will also have a better idea of what is being proposed.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a final matter, I want to thank the representatives of the VSA I mentioned previously, as well as those from Waverley Hockey Club, particularly
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Thompson" rel="nofollow">
         Brett Thompson
        </a>
        and Drew Ashton. This has been a long and at times frustrating process for those involved, but both clubs have conducted themselves and treated each other with respect and dignity, and I commend them for that. Whatever the ultimate outcome, I can truly say that I am proud that Chisholm is home to these groups. I wish both clubs a very, very good future.
