        I rise to speak about one of the very good organisations and situations in the electorate of Calare in the Parkes council area—that is, the Northparkes Mine, which is a copper and gold mine.

        , a great asset to the Parkes community, employ 325 full-time workers and a first-class mine receiving recognition on a national level. In the last few months, they have picked up a number of awards showing that they are really of world-class standard.
       </p>
       <p>
        In October, the mines emergency response team won the 2015 Victorian Mines Rescue Competition for the second year in a row. The competition involved 11 teams from across Australia, tested on first aid, fire skills, breathing apparatus, practical and theory. Congratulations to team captain Matt Greenaway and team manger Robbie Owens for leading their team to victory, and also to rookie team mate

        , who took out the Grunt Award for teamwork and attitude. The team have absolutely proven they are committed to zero-harm operations and are industry leaders in mine rescue.

        Obviously, there are always risks involved in mining, but Northparkes Mine go above and beyond to make sure it is at the heart of how they operate, having reached 150 days injury free very recently. The mine has also been recognised as Hard Rock Mine of the Year at the annual Australian Mining Prospect Awards. The award acknowledges exceptional performance across the board, an incredibly prestigious award.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Northparkes Mine have shown an unwavering commitment to improvement in safety, technology, innovation and community relations, and I can speak with personal knowledge of how good that is. Their involvement in the community has been extensive, including their community investment program. Their stand-out contribution is their volunteer leave program, where workers volunteer their time to the Parkes community, giving organisations and business access to skills they may not have access to otherwise. So far, over 200 people have volunteered over 1,000 hours, sharing their skills with community groups and organisations throughout the central west. Their volunteers provide skilled labour, heavy lifting or even cook for a cause.
       </p>
       <p>
        In a world first, Northparkes Mine has reached 100 per cent automation in its underground mining operations. This is a first for the mining industry.    Driverless loads run themselves, picking up ore, moving and dumping it. The breakthrough allows the mine to operate continuously 24/7, delivering high daily production at reduced cost. They are truly innovative and have achieved linking industry and science to the ultimate level. They are a yardstick to others in the industry, with their innovation a hallmark of their success.
       </p>
       <p>
        I must acknowledge China Molybdenum and their 20 per cent Japanese partners. China Molybdenum only took over their 80 per cent of the mine at the end of 2013, with the mine now in its 20th year of operation. These recent achievements attest to their smooth transition, a strong management team and a committed workforce. I commend them on taking out both awards and on reaching full automation underground.
       </p>
       <p>
        The boss at Northparkes, Steph Lawler, and all those who work there have set a standard that mines in Australia now have to make sure that they match.
