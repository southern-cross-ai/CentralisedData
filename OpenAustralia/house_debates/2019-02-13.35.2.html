        (a) the Jo Cox Loneliness Commission's inquiry into loneliness has succeeded due to bipartisan support, including the appointment of a responsible minister; and

       <p class="italic">
        (c) the problem of loneliness is under recognised, despite its acknowledged and significant negative impacts on individuals and society;

        That this House:

       <p class="italic">
        (2) notes with concern the existence of a policy of extrajudicial killing in the Philippines, an issue which has escalated with a nationwide drug campaign based merely on suspicion, providing police and vigilante groups with a 'licence to kill';

        (5) further notes that the conditions and circumstances of her arbitrary detention have restricted her:

        (a) freedom of movement; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) capacity to carry out her duties as an incumbent Senator of the Republic of the Philippines, including the very fundamental and critical right of a legislator to attend parliamentary hearings and cast her vote on legislative measures;

        (6) also notes that President Duterte is on record having made a number of attacks against Senator De Lima, publicly vowing to destroy her;
