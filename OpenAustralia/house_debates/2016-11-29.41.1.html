           First of all, I would like to congratulate him. He has made it to question No. 2! It is an auspicious day. I am not quite sure about what happened in the 'badget'. I imagine they found a badger in the 'badget'. I am not quite sure what you do with a 'badget'. What I can say is that the backpacker tax rate of 32½ per cent was brought about by Mr Wayne Swan, who now sits as the member for Lilley. He is the person—

              I have not called the Deputy Prime Minister yet. Deputy Prime Minister, you do not have the call. I have not finished addressing the House. It is early in question time. In response to the Manager of Opposition Business: yes; the Deputy Prime Minister will refer to members by their correct titles. It would assist the Speaker in hearing everything that the Deputy Prime Minister says if the level of interjections are lower. I would like to ask the House to lower the volume, or I will start doing it. The Deputy Prime Minister has the call.

               I know that they get very excited when the member for Hunter gets a question. I can understand why they would raise their voices. But it is very important to understand that it was the former Treasurer, now the member for Lilley—and he seems to be here for a fair while. The reason we had a 32½ per cent rate is by reason of the actions of the previous government, the Labor government.

                   in his actions in how he goes about it. He is a person who has no interest in actually bringing about a result. He just wants to fight. He probably gets that desire, that zeal for the fight, from his days in the union—where they can go into an area where things have been resolved and create chaos. The dilemma that we were placed in was we made sure, we made the promise, that we would resolve this issue by the time that the rate went back to 32½ per cent, which was 1 January next year. We made that promise. We honoured that promise. We delivered on that promise. And right now the Labor Party still hold to their promise of a 10½ per cent rate. Is the member for Maribyrnong going to stand up now and show his authenticity and show he is not duplicitous by saying he stands behind the 10½ per cent rate? Will you do that? Of course you will not, because you cannot be trusted.
