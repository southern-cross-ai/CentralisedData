       <p>
        Today I rise to acknowledge a phenomenal community champion in my electorate of Robertson: Maree Stokes, who has been involved with the Asbestos Diseases Foundation of Australia, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADFA" rel="nofollow">
         ADFA
        </a>
        , since 1997. Maree sadly lost her husband, Eddie, to mesothelioma at the age of 56. He contracted the disease whilst working as an apprentice, which exposed him to deadly dust particles. Eddie lost his battle with the disease in 2003.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2005 Maree became a coordinator for the ADFA and has fought tirelessly for victims of asbestosis, their families and friends. For members who are not aware, the ADFA assists sufferers of asbestosis and their families and friends with support and guidance. In 2007 Maree was elected vice-president of the ADFA and has been elected vice-president every year up until 2023. Maree has been steadfast in her advocacy other the years for victims of asbestosis and a fierce campaigner to ensure fair compensation for the victims of the disease and their families.
       </p>
       <p>
        Maree was one of the first community leaders I met after I was preselected to run for the federal seat of Robertson. I can confidently say Maree is an incredible woman and passionate about supporting her community. I take this opportunity to commend Maree on her many years of service to the ADFA and assisting sufferers of asbestosis across Australia, and for all her work supporting and assisting our
