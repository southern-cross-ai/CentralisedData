        On indulgence, we have two anniversaries this week of people in our ranks who have served 20 years in parliament: one in this parliament for the entirety of those 20 years and the other for 20 years in two parliaments.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmen_Lawrence" rel="nofollow">

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Jenkins" rel="nofollow">
         Harry Jenkins
        </a>
        has served 20 years in the federal parliament. Both have been, over the time, superb representatives of the people and superb representatives of the Labor Party. They have enjoyed senior positions: in the case of Carmen Lawrence, that of Premier and then that of a senior minister in the federal government; in the case of Harry Jenkins, that of a longstanding presiding officer in this place. I am sure all members of parliament will wish them well and join with me in my congratulations on their achievement.

         , also on indulgence, join the Leader of the Opposition in congratulating the member for Fremantle and also the member for Scullin. I recollect trying very hard 20 years ago, as a rather struggling Leader of the Opposition, to stop the member for Scullin succeeding his father in this place. I meandered through, I think, the Ford motor factory and I did not get a very friendly reception, I have got to say, but things looked up a bit later! He inherited and has maintained a very healthy margin in that seat.

         Apart from personal good wishes to the two members, can I say that I do think it is important, whatever our political differences are, to take opportunities to remind both ourselves and the Australian public of the importance of public service in political life. There is a tendency sometimes, even for us, to sort of accept and endorse the ritualistic denigration of political service. I think that is a huge mistake. I think the profession of politics is enormously important, and most people who come into this place do so with good motives, with good intentions and with goodwill to the Australian people. I include in that the member for Fremantle and also the member for Scullin. I wish both of them well. I do not think either of them will face any serious opposition from this side of politics, given the character of their seats. So, in the context of their own parties as well as the ongoing political struggle, I wish them well. I also wish the member for Hotham well, and I hope the member for Maribyrnong does not have his political career shortened.
