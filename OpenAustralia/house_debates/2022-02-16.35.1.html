       <p>
        Sport is central to the Australian way of life. That couldn't be truer than in my electorate of Reid, which is home to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympic_Park" rel="nofollow">
         Olympic Park
        </a>
        and other world-class sporting venues. Reid is a sporting seatâ€”and it has a very sporty member, I can tell you! That is why the Morrison government is backing our local sporting facilities with $5 million for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concord_Oval" rel="nofollow">
         Concord Oval
        </a>
        , which is home to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wests_Tigers" rel="nofollow">
         Wests Tigers
        </a>
        and the West Harbour Pirates. This is a massive redevelopment that will have a centre for excellence with incredible facilities for our football players and brand-new amenities for local community groups. I inspected the works last year, and I can tell you it is going to be world class! Also in Reid, upgrade work is almost completed at St Luke's Oval in Concord, home to the Concord Giants, where $500,000 has helped to widen the oval, returf the field and add new irrigation and drainage.

        But football isn't the only sport in Australia and it certainly isn't the only sport in Reid. Drummoyne Swimming Centre has produced some of Australia's finest Olympic champions, such as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_Fraser" rel="nofollow">
         Dawn Fraser
        </a>
        , and $500,000 has been allocated for that training and recreation facility. This funding has delivered a new multipurpose clubhouse for community groups, including the Drummoyne Devils Water Polo Club.
       </p>
       <p>
        Goddard Park at Concord is home to Yaralla Cricket Club, which has recently celebrated its 130th anniversary, and we have committed $1 million to upgrading the amenities block there.
