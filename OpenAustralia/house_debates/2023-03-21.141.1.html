       <p>
        As previously flagged, we have just reintroduced the amendments that we had struck in a deal with the government to introduce $1 million fines for bankers who break the law. I implore the government to accept these amendments, as per the agreement that we reached. I implore you to listen to the people of Australia and not the big banks and the big bank lobby, now led by a former Labor premier, and take into account the terrible experiences that so many people had with the banks and the huge breaches of regulations and the breaking of the law revealed by the recent banking royal commission. If we want to stop that from happening again, bankers need to face serious consequences for their actions. In fact, we have even amended this amendment to ensure that we carve out smaller banks, as a concern was raised. This was a reason given by the minister for reneging on the deal. We've carved that out. This will target only big bankers and big bank executives.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's a really simple amendment. It will make sure that bankers know they face serious consequences for their actions. We suggest to the government that, when considering how we regulate the financial industry, you should not listen to the bank lobby. It has just been revealed under a royal commission that the industry you're regulating and holding to account engaged in serious misconduct and, in some instances, resulted in people losing their homes and livelihoods. We think it seems pretty straightforward that, in those instances, we should perhaps listen to the people of Australia and not to the banking lobby and that we should impose serious, real-life consequences upon these bankers when they do break the law, because, when they do break the law, this often results in terrible human consequences.

         The question is that the amendments be disagreed to.

        <p>
         As it is necessary to resolve this question to enable further questions to be considered in relation to this bill, in accordance with standing order 195 the bill will be returned to the House for further consideration.
