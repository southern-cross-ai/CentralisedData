         They think it is a laughing matter—typical Labor with money. I refer the minister for finance to the reported $850 million blow-out in the solar panel rebate program. Given that the five-year, $150 million solar panel program has blown out to over $1 billion in just 18 months, how is this blow-out going to be funded?

Shortly prior to the election in 2007, the amount of the rebate involved was in fact doubled by the Howard government, and that in a sense has been the core reason why the program has blown out. The government has included within its budget calculations provision for the cost of the additional expense—

             This expenditure, like other expenditures which the government has committed to, is in fact provided for in the budget. Unlike many of the commitments that the Leader of the Opposition has been making in recent times, there are savings to cover this expenditure and other expenditures. There is a document called the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, which I would recommend to the dwindling band of fiscally and economically literate members of the opposition. It would be an interesting exercise for them to have a look at some budget papers from time to time.

             It is also important to note that, as a result of these changes in this program, the government has shifted its mechanism for subsidising householders putting solar panels on their roofs to the renewable energy target mechanism. So there is now a different system in place to enable what is otherwise a very worthwhile objective to be pursued. But again I think it is worth noting that the shadow Treasurer and the Leader of the Opposition, in pursuing—

                   The person who has asked the question of how this is going to be funded is somebody who presided over opposition finances where we had commitments to reduce fuel excise by 5c a litre, increase the pension, reintroduce the Investing in Our Schools Program, give a commitment to further capital gains tax relief for small business, $3.3 billion on a climate change policy that is uncosted, $3 billion of extra money for the Murray-Darling Basin and now an expanded parental leave policy—none of which has been funded by a single saving—

                    Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order on relevance. If he cannot answer where it is going to be funded, he should sit down.

                      The government’s position with respect to spending and savings is very clear and has been outlined by both me and the Treasurer in this parliament on a number of occasions—that is, new spending will be offset by savings, and spending will not be increased beyond two per cent in real terms once the growth rate in this economy goes beyond three per cent. And for an opposition that is engaged in a giant, unfunded spendathon, with a daily set of new billions of dollars worth of commitments that have no savings to back them up, to suggest that the government has a problem on this front is the absolute epitome of hypocrisy. The country demands sound economic management.

                      opposition has abandoned its core supporters and is a risk to the future prosperity of this nation. It has no idea of fiscal management and it would be a great threat to the future of the Australian economy.
