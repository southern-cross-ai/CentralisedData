        My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. Would the Attorney-General inform the House of new government initiatives to reduce domestic violence? Are there any alternative policies?

        <p>
         Yesterday, I can inform the member for Boothby, I launched the government’s Family Law Violence Strategy. This strategy will increase the understanding of how the family law system handles allegations of violence, through new research by the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Institute_of_Family_Studies" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Institute of Family Studies
         </a>
         . Under the strategy the government will work, as we should, closely with states and territories to achieve a faster investigation of allegations of violence and abuse. I am concerned that allegations raised in the family law proceedings are not receiving the priority they deserve from many of the state Labor governments and territory agencies that are responsible for investigating them. An allegation being raised in a separation does not make it any less of a priority to be investigated. The strategy also involves working with the courts to improve court processes for handling allegations. The government’s family law reforms will make protection from violence one of two primary factors to consider in a court in separation cases.
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite the public attacks on the government’s handling of domestic violence issues, I must say I am very disappointed that the honourable member for Gellibrand is trying to undo this change in some of her proposed amendments. I noticed yesterday that the member for Gellibrand claimed credit for the fact that this strategy is now being announced. She seems to think gestation takes only a matter of weeks! The fact is that preparation of the strategy does involve a good deal more cooperation and discussion than the honourable member seems to suggest. I notice also that she seems to be reminiscing. She reminisces over the Labor Party’s family law amendments of 1995. I would like to know where the Labor Party stands in relation to these matters in 2006, not 1995. The fact is that the member for Gellibrand, who seems to be obsessed with the past, needs to bring before this parliament a detailed statement of where the Labor Party stands on these matters or to get out of the road and let the government get on with the job.
