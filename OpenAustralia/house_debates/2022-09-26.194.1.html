       <p>
        I would like to place on the record my congratulations and appreciation for the incredibly brave actions of Corporal Hayden Guilfoyle from Shepparton in my electorate of Nicholls.
       </p>
       <p>
        Corporal Guilfoyle was commended for brave conduct in August 2022 for his actions during the rescue of teenagers from floodwaters in Townsville, Queensland, on 4 February 2019. At approximately 2 pm Corporal Guilfoyle was responding to calls for emergency assistance with colleagues in an Australian light armoured vehicle throughout flood affected parts of Townsville, when they noticed four teenagers clinging to a street sign in fast-flowing, neck-high water. An officer parked the light armoured vehicle approximately 25 metres away from the stranded teenagers so as not to risk the vehicle being swept away in the water. Corporal Guilfoyle and a colleague left the vehicle and waded through the water, dragging a rope with a heavy shackle on the end towards the teenagers. Corporal Guilfoyle and the colleague fixed the rope to a speed sign, creating a handrail between it and the light armoured vehicle. Using the rope, Corporal Guilfoyle and the colleague took each teenager back through the water to safety.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australian Bravery Decorations recognise acts of bravery where people selflessly put themselves in jeopardy to protect the lives and property of others, and I would like to personally acknowledge and celebrate Corporal Guilfoyle's deserved recognition. His bravery in this instance is also a shining example of the dedication and commitment of ADF personnel to serve others at home and abroad.
