         Across portfolios as a whole, the Pre-2008 Review identified 4,204 legislative instruments, or around 14 per cent of the stock, that were redundant or potentially redundant. In the process of identifying the redundant regulations, 10 Acts were also identified that appear to be redundant.

As such, this area did not meet the coordinated procurement contracting arrangements criteria.

As such, this area did not meet the coordinated procurement contracting arrangements criteria.
