        As the co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Men's Sheds, I've seen the importance of men's sheds in communities right across this nation. The Whittlesea Men's Shed, a cornerstone of our local community, has recently expanded its reach by launching a women's shed program. The initiative provides local women with the opportunity to connect, learn new skills and engage in shared activities with a supportive and collaborative environment. It's a fantastic example of how these spaces can evolve to meet the needs of the entire community. Men's sheds have long been a place for men to gather, to share their stories and to support one another, and it's wonderful to see the spirit of community being extended to the women in the area.
       </p>
       <p>
        The women's shed program, operating during times when the men's shed is not in use, ensures that the women have access to the tools, equipment, space, and knowhow necessary for their projects. It has already provided lots of positive feedback from the participants, saying that it's a valuable opportunity to connect with other women in our community while learning new and valuable skills. As the Whittlesea Men's Shed continues to thrive, the addition of the women's shed program marks a new chapter in its history, one that emphasises skill sharing and the importance of community connection. So congratulations to everyone that has been involved in this. I wish you every success and would like to see this program spread wider.
