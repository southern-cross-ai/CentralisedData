        I rise to inform the House of milestone achievements for two great organisations in my electorate of Bennelong. The 1st Epping Scouts was founded in July 1915, and I had the absolute pleasure of recently attending their 100th birthday celebrations. In attendance were descendants of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Hunt" rel="nofollow">

        , a local plumber who founded the group during the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         First World War
        </a>
        , only eight years after Baden-Powell launched the first group in England. It is one of the oldest scouting groups in the world. Over the century the group has expanded, merged and featured every possible facet of scouting, from

        , Joeys to Venturers. They have been in their current location in the centre of Epping for 90 years and have owned a boatshed on the

        since 1939. They have also been instrumental in the creation of five other scout groups around Bennelong. Many thousands of young people have benefitted from membership of this excellent group, and Bennelong's community has been enriched by the contribution of this scouting group and all those who have walked through its doors. Congratulations to Epping Scouts, and may you have many more decades of good service ahead of you.

        Another important local organisation is
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STARS" rel="nofollow">
         STARS
        </a>
        Sports, which runs sports camps, tournaments and training sessions for children in schools and through the holidays. Its aim is to promote a healthy lifestyle through participation in numerous sports, but the emphasis has always been on enjoyment and encouragement. This spirit of infectious fun is why STARS Sports has flourished in this its 10th year. It is run by a unique and tireless founder,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Hill" rel="nofollow">
         Andrew Hill
        </a>
        , who deserves special mention here as his drive and determination has not only led to STARS' success but enriched the electorate of Bennelong.
       </p>
       <p>
        Andrew is highly active in the local chamber of commerce and numerous other local groups and was deservedly recognised by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Ryde" rel="nofollow">
         City of Ryde
        </a>
        as the Citizen of the Year in 2007. He is also integral to the ongoing success of the Bennelong Cup, our local school table tennis competition, which I set up to encourage engagement in sports across the many ethnic groups with which we are lucky enough to share our community. Through STARS Sports, Andrew visits most schools within Bennelong in the weeks and months before the competition, drumming up excitement and teaching kids the vital table tennis skills for success. Without this work the cup would not be the success that it is. So, from the whole of Bennelong, congratulations on the last 10 years to STARS and Andrew Hill, and may there be many more years of success and activity in the future.
