        My question is to the Prime Minister. Yesterday the Deputy Prime Minister said that a net zero by 2050 target couldn't be legislated because of the impact on Australia if the target wasn't met. Doesn't this show this is another announcement the Prime Minister has no intention of delivering?

         The same basis that Australia made its commitment to Kyoto, the same basis that we made our commitment to Paris, is the same basis we would take anything forward at Glasgow. The proof of our record is we have met Kyoto 1; we have met Kyoto 2. We are going to meet our Paris 2030 and, in fact, beat Paris 2030. The Leader of the Opposition seems to confuse the processes that he wishes to engage in as having some material impact on what the outcome will be. Australians understand outcomes, and the outcomes are that under our government emissions are falling. They're falling. They're coming down. Emissions have fallen by 20 per cent and more on 2005 levels. They're lower.
        </p>
        <p>
         That's not the only thing that's lower. Unemployment is lower. Youth unemployment is lower. The level of investment in this country is greater. There are more Australians working in manufacturing today, and there were fewer under the Labor Party when they were in power. We've got major big resources projects happening all around the country. We are seeing our

         industry go from strength to strength, being world-leading, at the same time our policies are reducing emissions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Outcomes count, not broad rhetorical statements from politicians. Outcomes count. Outcomes count, so let me remind the House of a few outcomes: 20 per cent reduction in emissions; 69.2 per cent of Australians aged over 16 vaccinated; the lowest rate of fatality for COVID of almost any country in the world; the lowest unemployment rate in more than a decade. They're the results that the Labor Party don't want to speak about.
