        My question is to the Prime Minister. Vaccine supply in the

         I reject the assertion made by the member in putting the question forward. I particularly thank the member for Robertson for her advocacy and for working closely with me, the Minister for Health and, of course, Lieutenant General Frewen in working through the challenges of the supplies to those on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">

         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">

         s, pharmacists and all those distribution points and points of presence right across

         , with no changes to those supply arrangements. The New South Wales government made a choice to redirect supplies from state hubs in New South Wales, some 20,000. Last night I was able to advise the Premier that 180,000 additional doses would be brought forward to support the effort in New South Wales, on the condition also that the 20,000 doses went back into the regions, went back into the Central Coast, went back into the Hunter, went back into Armidale, went back into the

          South Coast

         of New South Wales and went back into those communities that needed them, and the Premier readily agreed. That means that we're able to do the rephasing over the course of the next month. And, when I spoke to Premier Palaszczuk last night, we were able to do the same. We were able to provide over 111,000 brought forward doses to support the vaccination in

         .

        <p>
         I appreciate and welcome the work that has been done by the Minister for Health, the secretary of Health and, of course, Lieutenant General Frewen in looking at what the urgent needs are and ensuring that we're able to rephase those supplies to get supplies where they need to go without taking a single dose from the vaccination program in any other state or territory or in any other place anywhere else around the country. We manage the program to deliver in the areas of critical need but ensure that we continue to support the program right across the country.

        <p>
         We've had another record day, with over 220,000 doses administered in a single day and well over million doses being delivered a week. Over 80 per cent of those aged over 70 now have had their first dose. The vaccination program goes from strength to strength. When the Leader of the Opposition finally decides to sit down and talk to Lieutenant General Frewen later today, I'm sure he can get the information. He has been absent when it comes to getting advice from those in the system who could assist him with his lackâ€”
