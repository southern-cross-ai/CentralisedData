       <p>
        The families and homes of MPs should never be the target of political attacks. Last week I received a package sent via
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Post" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Post
        </a>
        to my home.
       </p>
       <p>
        The sender's address on the package appeared to be fictitious. My family and I, including my children, were very shocked and concerned that our home was being targeted. In accordance with protocol, I notified the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Federal_Police" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Federal Police
        </a>
        , and they in turn contacted Orange police, who swiftly investigated and found that the package had been sent using a fake name, address and signature and was paid for with cash.
       </p>
       <p>
        The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CCTV" rel="nofollow">
         CCTV
        </a>
        at the post office revealed that the sender of the package was the chair of the Calare Federal Electorate Council of the New South Wales National Party, Janelle Culverson. She is a former Cabonne shire councillor, and, aside from the remaining state MPs, she is the most senior National Party member in the region. The package contained empty wine bottles bearing labels carrying an insulting message. When confronted by police over the weekend, she admitted to sending it. I have not spoken to Ms Culverson since January and do not regard her as a friend. This was no joke. I believe that the posting of the package, its contents and the steps taken by Ms Culverson to conceal her identity as the sender were designed to unsettle, create anxiety and fear amongst me and my family and also intimidate and pressure me into not contesting the seat of Calare at the next election. This is nasty, vicious and spiteful politics. I believe that our communities would be horrified, like I am, that the National Party has sunk to this filthy new low.
