        I will speak to the motion very briefly. It enables the Prime Minister at 11 am to make a statement to the House, followed by the Leader of the Opposition, about the Martin Place siege that occurred in Sydney. Many members of the families of those who were involved in the siege or, indeed, were victims of the siege are here today. Later in the day the motion allows the House to have no divisions or quorums from 4.15 to 5.45 so that members might, if they wish, go to the
