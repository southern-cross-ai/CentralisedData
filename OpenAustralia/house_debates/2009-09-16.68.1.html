        My question is to the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister for Education and Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Inclusion" rel="nofollow">
         Social Inclusion
        </a>
        . I refer the minister to the construction of demountable classrooms at Mullion Creek and Errowanbang schools at a cost of $550,000. Is the minister aware that the schools have attempted to contact her office by phone and email to tell her that these demountables do not meet the needs of these schools and could be constructed by local tradesmen at half the cost? Minister, how does paying a 100 per cent premium represent value for our taxpayers?

And then on the issue of comparisons about building cost, I will certainly look at that matter too. But I would say to the member who has raised the question that, during the course of this parliamentary fortnight, once again, the shadow minister for education raised the question of per square metre building costs at Berridale in

                    conclude by saying that, given that track record—one diary matter raised during this parliamentary fortnight which was completely incorrect; one building comparison raised by the shadow minister for education which, on investigation, proved to be completely incorrect—and against that background, I am sure the member will understand why, when matters are raised with me in question time by opposition members, what I say is: I will investigate them. And I will investigate them.
