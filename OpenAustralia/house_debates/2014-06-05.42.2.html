       <p>
        In December of last year, analog television was permanently switched off across our nation. It marked the end of an era for some, but for the residents on the west coast of Tasmania in my electorate of Braddon, it marked the end of reliable television services. Some might say the switch was a good thing—more channels to choose from—but it is not just about missing your favourite television show or missing the cricket or having no idea what a 'Block head' is. It is about treating people everywhere, no matter where they choose to live, fairly.
       </p>
       <p>
        Yes, the west coast of Tasmania is isolated, but why does this mean that people there should be forgotten? Would it be left so long if this were Sydney or Melbourne? There this just would not be acceptable, and it should not be acceptable for the west coast of Tasmania either.
       </p>
       <p>
        The problem is: due to the topography of my island home, the signal often clashes with the Victorian signal. So, on a clear day—can you believe it?—it is even worse.
       </p>
       <p>
       </p>
       <p>
        Surely, this needs to be fixed! Enough is enough: who is going to put up their hand to sort this mess out? Cathy Legge of Queenstown in my electorate has had enough: she has sent me this petition signed by 706 frustrated residents of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        who want action. I would like the residents of the West Coast to know that I am listening and that I am taking action to ensure that reliable television reception is returned to their area.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whilst this is not directly a federal government matter, I have written to all television stations seeking an explanation as to why residents are not having their concerns listened to and I have sought a meeting with Free

        Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        I seek leave to present an out of order petition from 760 petitioners.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
