        With the winter months well and truly upon us, one would be forgiven for thinking that the local community retreats indoors to escape the cold. This isn't true in the Oxley electorate, with a buzz of activity throughout the community recently. This includes the $1 million redevelopment and reopening of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YMCA" rel="nofollow">
         YMCA
        </a>
        Jamboree Heights last weekend. The works were largely completed due to the fundraising efforts of the YMCA, with brand new facilities now open for the local community to enjoy. I was fortunate enough to attend the grand opening of the Cheryle Beadman Group Exercise Room. Cheryle Beadman is well known throughout the community, having worked at the YMCA for 25 years at reception and for over a decade as the group exercise coordinator. Therefore, it is only fitting that we name the new room after Cheryle, who has given so much to the YMCA.

        I'd also like to acknowledge Eden Brighouse and Ryder Kelly, from the Redbank Plains Scout Group, who recently received their
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_Wolf" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        awards. The Grey Wolf award is the pinnacle of the cub scout section, and there are a number of requirements involved in earning this huge achievement. These include an overnight camp, an interpack activity and using a map to plan and lead a hike/walk for at least two hours duration with a leader and a group of three to six cub scouts. My congratulations to Eden and Ryder, and to the wonderful Redbank Plains Scouts for their leadership in our community.
