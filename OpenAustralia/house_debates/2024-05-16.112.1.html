        This is a question for the Prime Minister. The government's Future Made in Australia announcements sound consistent with our need to decarbonise for long-term prosperity, but we need to invest in building new industries where we have a comparative advantage. Will the government commit to investment decisions under Future Made in Australia being transparent and driven by independent expert economic analysis?

         I thank the member for Curtin for her question. I've noted her public comments supporting Future Made in Australia making more things here. That will be driven by the framework that will come before this parliament in legislation that the member for Curtin will have the opportunity to contribute to. Those opposite have already said they're going to vote against it. The WA Liberal Party leader, the leader of that massive group—I think there's two of them—but the leader of the Liberal Party in WA has said that she supports the Future Made in Australia agenda. The member for

           The Prime Minister will pause. I can't hear what he is saying because there is a live conversation going on between the shadow Treasurer and the Treasurer. You can both have a conversation outside—I can make that happen—but I think you'd like to stay. You will remain in silence for the remainder of this answer or you'll both be warned. The Prime Minister has the call.

           <p>
            This is a comprehensive plan, through measures like production tax credits for hydrogen and critical minerals. We know that Australia does have a comparative advantage in green hydrogen because we'll be able to have the space to have the green hydrogen produced by clean energy, which then could be used to manufacture things like green aluminium, green steel to give us a comparative advantage in the world.
           </p>
           <p>
            The way that will work for critical minerals is it will be 10 per cent of eligible processing costs. It will be $2 per kilogram for green hydrogen. Companies won't receive any credit until they have produced these resources. That's why it has been designed in this way, so it pays on success: it pays on creating jobs; it pays on creating not just for domestic use but for export potential as well. This incentive will make domestic production more cost competitive and will boost Australian industry. It will commence in the 2027-28 financial year and will support production until 2040. They're just some of the measures that we have.
           </p>
           <p>
            Here's a big tip: you can't build a future out of just saying no. That is what those opposite are doing. The only thing the Leader of the Opposition has ever been interested in manufacturing is division. That's the only thing. They don't have an agenda, just a vendetta. They have a vendetta against workers, against manufacturing, against fair wages, against aspiration and against ambition.

               Once again, I want to remind anyone raising a point of order—I can appreciate the point of order on relevance, but it is not an opportunity to make additional statements. This is really creeping into points of order. Every time a point of order on relevance has been made with an extra grab or an extra hook or an extra statement, Speakers in the past have simply stopped taking points of order from both sides. Going forward, we will make the point of order on relevance without the additional comments.

               The Prime Minister wasn't asked about alternative policies. He was asked about decisions being made driven by experts. I'm going to make sure his remarks are relevant for the remainder of the answer.

                What a Future Made in Australia agenda is about is shaping the future, because unless you do that the world will just go past us. We need to seize the opportunities that are happening because of the global changes in the economy. We're in a strong position to do so, but only if we seize those opportunities. I look forward to working with the member for Curtin to do just that.
