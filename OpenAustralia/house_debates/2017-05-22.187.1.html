        There are a group of people who go where no-one else will go. If you are not on fire, you do not need the fire brigade. If you have not broken the law, you do not need the police. If you are not in dire straits health wise, you do not need the ambos. That group are called the

        . They go where nobody else will go. They will go to somebody that nobody else has a reason to go to. They go where they are asked to go.

        That is how I finished my address on Friday morning when we launched the Red Shield Appeal with Amanda Hart. Her father was there from the city. Lieutenant Amanda Hart and all her team at the Salvation Army at Warragul gave a great presentation regarding the Salvation Army and what they do. I was thrilled to be asked to go. Actually, I was filling in for somebody else who could not turn up.

        The most important thing is that the Salvos will go where nobody else will go, and we appreciate everything that they do for us. They are there to go to people when we do not have the ability or are not in the place or do not have the time and the space to do what they can do. They do marvellous work throughout the whole of Australia but especially in regard to the homeless, families who are having a tough time and women who are on their own with kids. They are there for all of them on our behalf, not on their behalf. They do it on our behalf. So it was great to launch the appeal, and I hope that their appeal is extremely successful.
