        It is no exaggeration to say that we love our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rural_Fire_Service" rel="nofollow">
         Rural Fire Service
        </a>
        on the New South Wales
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         South Coast
        </a>
        . We have been through a lot together. Our firefighters are true heroes to local people. They helped us, protected us and put their lives on the line for us during the horrific bushfires of 2019-20. Not only that, but they, along with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">
         SES
        </a>
        and many other emergency service workers and volunteers, have been with us through too many floods to count.
       </p>
       <p>
        Every day when the call for help comes they answer without fail. We certainly don't take these selfless volunteers and firefighters for granted. We celebrate them at every opportunity. Recently, I attended three very special
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFS" rel="nofollow">
         RFS
        </a>
        presentations at Moruya, Vincentia and Jamberoo. I want to briefly take the time to acknowledge all of those members who received the national medals and long service medals at these presentations. In August the Far South Coast RFS held its presentation at Moruya, where 16 dedicated members received their long service or national medals and clasps, representing a total of 483 years of service. A further 63 people received the National Emergency Medal for their diligent service during the 2019-20 bushfires. I want to congratulate and thank each and every one. There are too many to name here, but all are very worthy of our thanks and recognition.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to briefly acknowledge a few key members of the brigade for their awards. I wish I could name them all but there just isn't enough time. David Decorte received a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Medal" rel="nofollow">

        first clasp for 33 years of service.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Hopkins" rel="nofollow">

        received the National Medal fourth clasp for 29 years of service.

        fifth clasp—this is incredible—Barbara for 50 years of service and Bruce for 61 years of service. Amazing. Congratulations to you all.
       </p>
       <p>
        Then on 16 October I was privileged to attend two of these ceremonies on the same day. The Shoalhaven rural fire district held its medal presentation at Vincentia RFS. Eight members received the National Medal and a further 16 received the Long Service Medal, with a combined total of 500 years of service between them—absolutely incredible. Again, I wish I could name you all, but I would like to acknowledge Andrew Catt, who received his National Medal first and second clasp for 42 years of service and Lindsay Parnell for receiving the Long Service Medal fourth clasp for 50 years of service. Well done to all of the Shoalhaven RFS members. Thank you for your incredible service to our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Later that afternoon I also went to the Jamberoo RFS brigade's special presentation. Twelve brigade members received the National Emergency Medal for their service during the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Summer" rel="nofollow">
         Black Summer
        </a>
        bushfires and another three members received their long service medals, for a total of 70 years of service. Congratulations to you all.
       </p>
       <p>
        All of these ceremonies are special but this one had a touch of something extra. Jamberoo brigade was also celebrating life member and stalwart
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Downes" rel="nofollow">
         John Downes
        </a>
        , who received the RFS Commissioner's Commendation for Service. I would like to briefly touch on John's accomplishments, as they are a real testament to the selfless spirit of our community and our Rural Fire Service. John joined the brigade at the age of 21 and has now given 55 years of service to the Jamberoo brigade. Like so many, John selflessly volunteers his time for the brigade. As a hard-working, local farmer he would often tend his farm during the day and then relieve other RFS members overnight, before returning to his milking the next morning. I often talk about the amazing farmers we have on the South Coast. John is a shining example of what they do, making ends meet on the farm during the day and helping his community at night. He is a role model and mentor to other brigade members, sharing his knowledge, experience and passion with others. He has even managed to recruit his kids and their partners. How great is that? What's John's attitude? That it is all part of being a member. It's the true-blue South Coast attitude. Thank you, John, for your dedication and service to our community. Once again, I would like to sincerely congratulate all of our RFS members on their medals this year. Thank you for allowing me to celebrate this achievement with you. I want to truly thank each and every member of our RFS and emergency services for everything that you do for us every day. We are so, so lucky to have you.
