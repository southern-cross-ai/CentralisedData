       <p>
        I rise to speak in relation to the Augusta Margaret River Tourism Association, which has designed a concept and working plans for the $3.2 million redevelopment of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewel_Cave" rel="nofollow">
         Jewel Cave
        </a>
        , near Augusta. This is a particularly worthwhile project. The Augusta Margaret River Tourism Association is a not-for-profit organisation, and is the custodian of three show caves—Lake Cave, Jewel Cave and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammoth_Cave" rel="nofollow">
         Mammoth Cave
        </a>
        . They are also the custodians of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Leeuwin" rel="nofollow">
         Cape Leeuwin
        </a>
        lighthouse and seven other caves which are currently open to the public. The Augusta Margaret River Tourism Association’s caves received 125,500 visitors in 2006-07.
       </p>
       <p>
        The reason I would like to speak on this issue is the organisation has been seeking a response from the government on this application for $810,000 through the area consultative committee and Regional Partnerships. They have contacted Minister Albanese’s office and have not been able to secure a response on this particular issue. They are desperate for some advice as to how they can proceed with this particular project as they have already been successful in achieving grants from Lotterywest and the South West Development Commission and $23,000 from the federal government’s Envirofund.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the past year they have also been working with the South West Area Consultative Committee on this particular approach as well as with the federal government’s department of transport and regional services on a Regional Partnerships grant. This is the $810,000, and they are seeking direction on this particular grant. They are looking to be advised on exactly what the outcome of this is. Similarly, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busselton_Jetty" rel="nofollow">
         Busselton Jetty
        </a>
        proposal—they are seeking direction on their application for funding for their Busselton Jetty rebuild project. These form part of a range of Regional Partnership projects that have gone through a rigorous process of evaluation, of seeking alternative partnerships with other groups and seeking responses at local, state and federal levels—but unfortunately have not received direction from the federal level.
       </p>
       <p>
        They need to get on with these particular projects. A lot of them have called on a range of local and community volunteer-type involvement and they are seeking strong, clear direction as to how they can progress. The Bunbury Sea Rescue group are waiting on direction on a $50,000 grant for a sea rescue boat that they are going to use for training purposes. On having received advice that this would be made available to them, they proceeded with the order for the boat—which is now on hold. It is a specific order, and they may still be liable for this particular commitment, given that this was specifically built. For a group of volunteers in my community who are providing a significant service, the delays are significant for them in this process.
       </p>
       <p>
        We also have an application from Milligan House, another group providing invaluable services in the small community. They are also seeking direction on the outcome of their particular application.
       </p>
       <p>
        All of these types of projects are very critical in time and in the resources already expended—some of these groups have already spent over 12 months in their process of application. They have gone to significant expense, and time itself is an expense when the cost of what you are attempting to purchase or do is increasing.
       </p>
       <p>
        I strongly encourage the government to focus on and give direction to these particular groups who have sought and received approval for or very good indications that they will get approval for these funds so that they can go ahead with their projects. The federal government should give the approval for them to receive the funding that they have had approved previously.
