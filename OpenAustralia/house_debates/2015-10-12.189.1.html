       <p>
        I rise today to congratulate two outstanding

        Tigers, and in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rugby_Union" rel="nofollow">
         Rugby Union
        </a>
        the Ourimbah Razorbacks. Both first-grade teams took victory over our southern neighbours during their recent grand finals. In the case of The Entrance Tigers, at the end of the season they had led the competition seven points clear of the other teams. Despite this, the Tigers first grade was put to the test against the opposing team and ended the season with a 22 to14 win. In Rugby Union, the end of season decider was especially significant for the Ourimbah Razorbacks, as the win resulted in their first ever major premiership. They defeated their opponents 27 to 20.
       </p>
       <p>
        Not only was I particularly happy to see two teams from the northern end of the Central Coast take out the grand finals, but there is also a special reason for supporting both of these particular teams. Many within the Central Coast community will recall the deliberately lit fires that completely destroyed the clubhouses of both Ourimbah and The Entrance a couple of months ago. These fires were devastating to our closely knit sporting community, so for these teams to take out their respective grand finals was a truly deserving win for both clubs.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not just the men who ended the season successfully, and I acknowledge the achievements of the Berkeley Vale Panthers Women's Rugby League team, whose success I plan on sharing with the House in the near future. I would just like to say congratulations to all our sporting teams on the Central Coast, especially those who won their grand final. Thank you.
