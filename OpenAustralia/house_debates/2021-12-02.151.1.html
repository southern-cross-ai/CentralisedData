        I have some very bright and talented students in my electorate who work hard and dedicate themselves to their passions, each and every day. It gives me great pleasure to share with the House some of the accomplishments of these amazing students. Windaroo Valley State High School has qualified for the finals of the Australian space design competition, which will be held at the beginning of January next year. Only 10 schools across the nation have qualified for this competition. The Australian space design competition is an industry simulation experience that combines elements of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, with an emphasis on teamwork, marketing and human relations, to provide a unique challenge. It is designed for secondary school students with a passion for space or who are considering a future in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STEM" rel="nofollow">
         STEM
        </a>
        fields. The competition has been regarded as the premier STEM competition for high school students and is recognised by universities. Students are required to respond to an industry-level engineering request for tender and a design of a futuristic space settlement.
       </p>
       <p>
        For the 2021 qualifying competition their coach, Mr Thrum, appointed Skyler Potter, a year 10 student, as president. Skyler has competed in the competition since its launch at Windaroo in 2019. The school submission was judged by a panel of industry and scholarly experts from groups such as

        , universities, Boeing, the Australian Space Agency and Gilmour Space Technologies. Competing at the Australian Space Design Competition national finals provides the students with an opportunity to be selected to compete for Australia in the world championships of the

        The students of Logan are not only academically outstanding but also host a large population of talented sportspeople. This week it was announced that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marsden_State_High_School" rel="nofollow">
         Marsden State High School
        </a>
        has been selected by the Brisbane Roar to host their junior skills training centre and academy base for their region-wide talent. Marsden State High School is one of the three largest state schools in the state with a strong sports focus. It is the perfect location for the Brisbane Roar to host their base, given its central location and state-of-the-art training facilities. The school has a progressive holistic philosophy towards player development and a proven track record of developing elite-level Queensland sporting talent. Marsden state high is also set to become Brisbane Roar's accredited high-performance football school, and these opportunities will give students the competitive edge they need when exploring a career at elite-level football. I thank the Brisbane Roar for their investment in our local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations to Windaroo State Valley High School and Marsden State High School, and I'm looking forward to their continued successes.
