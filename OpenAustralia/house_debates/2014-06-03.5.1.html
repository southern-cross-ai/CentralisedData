        , the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for consideration and report: Fit-out of new leased premises for the

        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Social Services currently leases space in multiple buildings across Woden and Tuggeranong in the Australian Capital Territory. The term of lease at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DSS" rel="nofollow">
         DSS
        </a>
        main building in Tuggeranong will expire on 5 December 2016, with no option available under that lease to extend the term. The department's current accommodation in Tuggeranong also has a range of deficiencies in terms of the occupational density and staff connectivity due to people being spread out over a series of 10 buildings.
       </p>
       <p>
        The department is committed to maintaining a presence in the area as a high proportion of staff reside in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuggeranong_Valley" rel="nofollow">
         Tuggeranong Valley
        </a>
        . The presence of a large department such as DSS in the area is also important to local small businesses. The department's proposed fit-out of the new leased premises will provide capacity for the co-location of approximately 70 per cent of its
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        based staff and opportunities for significant benefits in relation to functionality, operating efficiencies and reduced administrative overheads.
       </p>
       <p>
        DSS has estimated that the total cost of the proposed fit-out will be $55.860 million plus
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GST" rel="nofollow">
         GST
        </a>
        , including builders' costs, consultant and client costs, furniture, fittings and equipment and workstations. The 2014-15 budget provided $26.797 million over the forward estimates towards the project, with the remainder of the fit-out costs to be met through a lease incentive.
       </p>
       <p>
        This proposal will enable a reduction of more than $7 million in annual outlays already factored into the forward estimates on leased office space in the ACT from 2017 onwards. Subject to parliamentary approval, the proposed integrated fit-out works are scheduled to commence in January 2016 with practical completion scheduled for 1 October 2016.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am sure the committee will undertake a rigorous inquiry into the project and I look forward to reading its report in due course. I commend the motion to the House.

        Question agreed to.
