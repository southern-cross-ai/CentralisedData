        My question is to the Minister for the Environment and Energy. Will the minister update the House on the cost

         I thank the member for Barker for his question and I acknowledge his deep concern for the rising electricity prices across the state, like for the family-owned, fourth-generation

         Johnson &amp; Sons, which produces hay pallets for domestic use and for export. It has seen its energy bill go up by nearly $1 million. That is why we on this side of the House are focused on important reforms to rein in retail costs, to rein in network costs, to invest record amounts in battery storage, and also to get more gas into the market. Just today, with Ministers Sinodinos and Canavan, we were able to get a commitment from the pipeline operators that they would work with the gas suppliers to ensure that they would meet any shortfall for gas in the domestic market in the years ahead.

It would be cheaper—22 times cheaper—than his $550 million apology note to the people of South Australia. We have also found out today, with the announcement by ENGIE that it has secured the gas contracts, that the Prime Minister's efforts in getting the gas suppliers to put more gas into the domestic market are working. I spoke to the

         We know that the Premier of South Australia has undertaken a big experiment. We know that he was in denial. We know that he blamed the market operator, that he blamed the weather, that he blamed the federal government, that he blamed the lack of a carbon tax for the blackouts that have occurred across his state. But, now, the people of South Australia know the real cost of his failures and of his big experiment. Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition wants to take this 50 per cent
