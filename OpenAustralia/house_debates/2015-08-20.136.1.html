        On 5 August the Shoalhaven Homelessness Shark Tank took place to coincide with the national Homelessness Prevention Week. The Shoalhaven Homelessness and Good Living Conditions Interagency was the key organisation that invited local service providers to pitch their ideas on how to assist homeless people in their local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Prior to the event, a number of businesses were sent an invitation to participate and nominate an amount that they might be prepared to donate. I too was invited to attend. As the community knows, I am deeply concerned about this issue. I chose to join one of the shark tank groupings, affectionately called a tiger shark. We were then all given a bidding card saying 'I'm biting'. The service providers then gave a short

         PowerPoint
        </a>
        display or performance art presentation and described how the sharks could assist them. These projects varied from sponsorship for veggie garden plots to special mats for the children's play equipment at the women's refuge, to spare sleeping bags and tents, to scholarships for change, to community barbecues on Friday night for the homeless. It was an eclectic collection of suggestions and ideas.
       </p>
       <p>
        In one afternoon, the sharks contributed more than $35,000 in cash for great, forward-thinking community organisations including Southern Youth and Family Services,

        and the Nowra Youthie.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, sometimes to help homeless people you need more than money and at this event that is exactly what happened. One young man, Michael, who has struggled with homelessness for some time, ended up with a job at Classic Removals, and 14 other local businesses offered to mentor our young people at risk.

The afternoon was an invaluable and moving experience and I hope to be involved in another shark tank in the future.
