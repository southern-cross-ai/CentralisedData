        tenancy fit-out.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade proposes to undertake the base building refurbishment and an integrated fit-out of the area leased by the International Energy Agency within the Australian chancery complex in Paris. The Australian chancery in Paris accommodates the permanent missions to France and the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and the Australian delegation to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Built in 1977, the chancery has approximately 11,215 square metres of net lettable area, of which approximately 54 per cent, or 6,100 square metres, is surplus to the Australian government requirements. Of the surplus space, 5,565 square metres has been leased to the International Energy Agency since 1996. The International Energy Agency lease is due to expire in April 2017, and a new lease is being negotiated for a further 12-year term for their future office accommodation needs on commercial market terms.
       </p>
       <p>
        A precondition of the International Energy Agency's future occupation of the tenancy in the chancery is a refurbishment of base building services and an integrated fit-out of their tenancy to meet their requirements. The proposed works include base building refurbishments and an integrated fit-out of the International Energy Agency leased area to provide efficient, modern and functional accommodation that includes office facilities, an auditorium, conference rooms and improved amenities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The project is valued at an estimated $27.74 million and includes all costs associated with the fit-out such as builders costs, consultant fees, furniture, fittings and equipment, contingencies and escalation allowance. Subject to parliamentary approval of the project, the fit-out is expected to commence in mid-2016 with completion expected by mid-2018. I commend the motion to the House.
