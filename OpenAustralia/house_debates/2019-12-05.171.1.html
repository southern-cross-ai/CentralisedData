       <p>
        Recently I visited the City of Canada Bay Men's Shed in the lead-up to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Men's_Day" rel="nofollow">
         International Men's Day
        </a>
        on 19 November. In November we observed Men's Health Awareness Month, which is a great opportunity to bring attention to men's health issues that might not otherwise be raised in our communityâ€”issues such as anxiety, depression, prostate cancer, testicular cancer and, of course, men's suicide. While men's sheds are now an international phenomenon, the movement started here in Australia in order to improve the health and wellbeing of older men.
       </p>
       <p>
        Tragically, in Australia death by suicide among males occurs at a rate three times greater than that among females. This is largely because men are less likely to reach out when they need to. Many are unaware that the symptoms and experiences they are having are, in fact, psychological and linked to their mental health. For others, the stigma makes it difficult for them to seek help. Loneliness is one of the significant challenges to mental health in the 21st century, so it's especially important that organisations like our men's sheds exist to encourage connection and outward social focus.

         The City
        </a>
        of Canada Bay Men's Shed, known locally as Harry's Shed, was founded in 2013 and is one of the largest men's sheds in our area. The men are not shy in talking about the issues that impact them. The most important aspect of Harry's Shed is the way it encourages men to talk openly about their mental and physical health and to create lifelong friendships. During my visit, the founder and vice president of Harry's Shed, Mr Norm Tate, said to me, 'Men don't talk face to face; they talk shoulder to shoulder.' This is the essence of what the men's shed movement is all about.
       </p>
       <p>
        I heard firsthand experiences from members of Harry's Shed who told me that they were able to take action to improve their mental health through the friendships formed at the workshop. When they were doing it tough, there were friends to turn to. The shed also sets up guest speakers on a variety of topics to hold discussions with members about the ways they can improve their health and wellbeing. Some of the members told me that a recent talk on prostate cancer raised awareness and helped break down the stigma of talking about this particular issue.
       </p>
       <p>
        The organisation also contributes to community through charitable projects. Some are local, but others are global in their focus. Members work with Concord hospital to create rehabilitation equipment for patients who need to regain fine motor skills after a stroke. When I visited, the men's shed were restoring the Concord Public School's original school bell. They also showed me the beautiful handcrafted toys they send to children in villages across South-East Asia, building relationships across nations and borders.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not just our community that benefits from this fantastic project. We know that volunteering and contributing to charitable causes increases our sense of wellbeing and connection with others. For many older men, who may be retired, giving back to the community through these projects renews their sense of purpose. It allows them to use their skills to make a big difference in their lives and the lives of other people, and, through this process, they reduce their own feelings of isolation.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am so impressed with the work of the City of Canada Bay Men's Shed and all of its members. They are improving our community but also the health and wellbeing of men involved in the shed. These men are leading by example in their communities and families. It is fitting to acknowledge their work, having recently marked International Men's Day.
