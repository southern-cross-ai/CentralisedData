         I thank the member for Kingston for her question. I know that, as a health professional before she came to this place, she is particularly concerned about this issue. I think everyone in the House would be aware by now that the government are particularly concerned about the rates of binge drinking in the community. We are worried about a drinking problem and drinking patterns across the country that are costing us $15 billion every year. We are worried about the number of young women aged 18 to 24 being hospitalised for alcohol abuse that has doubled in less than a decade. We are worried that in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         the number of alcohol related assaults has doubled over the last decade to more than 20,000 assaults.
        </p>
        <p>
         But there are some in the community who are not worried about this issue, and most of them are sitting on the opposition benches. We know that the Leader of the Opposition’s scientific approach to binge drinking is ‘when you’re really getting stuck into it’. Compare that with the Newcastle local area commander, Mr Charles Haggett, who says ‘the higher levels of intoxication have resulted in higher levels of alcohol related crime’. We know that the member for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Sydney" rel="nofollow">
          North Sydney
         </a>
         does not think there is a problem. On 30 March he said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         … I don’t think you should overplay it. Let’s not go over the top.
        </p>
        <p>
         New South Wales Police Commissioner Andrew Scipione has described alcohol abuse as an ‘enormous’ national problem. He said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Something like about 70 per cent of every police engagement with a member of the community in the streets of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
          NSW
         </a>
         has alcohol as a factor.
        </p>
        <p>
         We know the member for Warringah heartily agrees. A few days ago he accused the government of moral panic on this issue and just yesterday in that interview on 3AW, among the entertaining antidotes that he shared with us about his views of the Leader of the Opposition and others, he said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         Despite this being an issue of concern to parents, health experts and police commissioners it’s a beat-up, not to put too fine a point on it.
        </p>
        <p>
         Contrast that with what Northern Territory Police Commissioner Paul White said:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         We’re witnessing a disturbing national trend towards greater levels of binge drinking by young people … Too many young men are drinking heavily and think they’re bullet proof, so end up getting involved in fights … while drunk.
        </p>
        <p>
         In case you are in any doubt about the opposition’s flippant approach to binge drinking, I will tell you one more story about the opposition. I am sorry that the member for Hinkler is not here because I have to confess that when I was walking the halls of parliament in the last few weeks I walked past the member for Hinkler’s office. I might say that the member for Hinkler last night said he does not want a $5 million
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">

         superclinic in his electorate. I wonder whether there is any electorate over here that might have one instead. In passing, he says he does not want one.

          Imagine my surprise, coming across in the window of the member for Hinkler’s office a life-sized bear. It was not just an ordinary bear; it was actually a white polar bear. It was quite a famous bear—the Bundy bear; the only bear in the country which has his whole life committed to promoting alcohol.

             I certainly will. The point is that we have the opposition with alcohol advertisements in their offices in the parliament; you have us, with the police commissioners, with the parents and with the health professionals, trying to tackle this problem. You and the distillers are the only ones who don’t think it is a problem.
