       <p>
        I am speaking about the hard work and dedication of aged-care facilities in my electorate of Chisholm. The COVID pandemic has been incredibly tough on all Australians, but those that have felt it the most are our aged-care workers. Facilities like Burwood Terrace, led by Sherman Brown, are working tirelessly to protect the most vulnerable in our community. They need our trust and support.
       </p>
       <p>
        Can we all take a moment to reflect on how tough these organisations must be doing it right now. I want all aged-care providers in my electorate of Chisholm to know that I am here for them and the coalition government is here for them. I regularly visit aged-care facilities in Chisholm. I love hearing the stories that residents share. Of course I have not had the chance to visit recently, but, as soon as it is safe, I will.
       </p>
       <p>
        This government will always back these crucial frontline workers. The Morrison government has given $1.5 billion in support for senior Australians in aged care. Initial payments, like the $205 million COVID-19 support payment that was provided to all residential aged-care providers in June, are having an immediate impact. I'm so glad to see a further $245 million injected into all facilities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The support this government has provided has assisted in enhanced infection control capabilities. The support this government provides is saving lives. We are also making sure that older Australians who temporarily need to relocate from aged care are supported too. An additional $71.4 million has been injected into the Commonwealth Home Support Program.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lastly, let me tell the House about Lisa Perry from Waverley Valley Aged Care in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Waverley" rel="nofollow">
         Glen Waverley
        </a>
        . We spoke about the shortcomings of COVID testing in Victoria. Sadly, she was told she wasn't a priority, even though she manages two aged-care facilities. Her passion and dedication to aged care is commendable. I really enjoyed our conversation and her sharing with me the vital work that they do for our senior Australians. Unlike Labor, aged care is always a priority for this government.
