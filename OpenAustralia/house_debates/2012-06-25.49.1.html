       <p>
        Today, I would like to share with everyone an email I received from an Australian soldier serving our country in Afghanistan:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        G'Day Russell, I am a deployed member serving in Afghanistan that just received one of the best parcels a soldier could from Australia.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        A gift packed by children I do not know, arranged by a teacher I have not met and sent with the best wishes and thoughts of a nation worth fighting for.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Could you please let Ms Jenny Budd and the children of Kindy and Year 1 at Thirlmere Public School know that their care package has arrived and I have just responded, so a letter should be there in a couple of weeks.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        The reason I am letting you know is because Jenny sent a cut out from the local paper where you sponsored a website promoting such actions.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Party politics aside... a great act by an elected representative.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Thankyou to you and particularly the teachers and students at Thirlmere Public School who have demonstrated in one small box what being Australian is all about... supporting your mates.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a lovely email from one of our soldiers who was touched by the kindness of some local children and their teacher. They did this as part of the Support the Troops Campaign, which was supported by many members of this House in the lead-up to Anzac Day.
       </p>
       <p>
        After receiving this email I visited the children at Thirlmere Public School with the state member for Wollondilly, Jai Rowell. The children were so excited to hear from the soldier and were keen to tell me about all the things they put in the care package for him.
       </p>
       <p>
        The response I received from this soldier shows how much it means to our troops to have the support of the Australian public behind them. Being away from family and friends to serve your country overseas is not an easy thing to do. I am glad that the children from Thirlmere were able to lift the spirits of this soldier and show him that he has the support of our nation behind him. I congratulate them on their efforts.
