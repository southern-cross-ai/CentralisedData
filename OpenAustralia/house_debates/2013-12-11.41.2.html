        Canberran Trish Keller
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        retires this week after a distinguished career as an educator and primary school principal. Trish has been the principal of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giralang_Primary_School" rel="nofollow">
         Giralang Primary School
        </a>
        since 2007 and was the principal of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrabundah_Primary_School" rel="nofollow">
         Narrabundah Primary School
        </a>
        from 2000 to 2006. During her time at Narrabundah Trish set up the innovative Koori classroom, a place where Indigenous students, parents and community members could feel comfortable and where other schools could learn about Indigenous culture.
       </p>
       <p>
        Another of Trish's Narrabundah projects was to get local businesses to provide food for students whose families were unable to give them breakfast. Trish has always believed in making the school an integral part of the community and has worked hard to achieve equity and excellence for vulnerable groups.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trish was awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Australia_Medal" rel="nofollow">
         Order of Australia Medal
        </a>
        in 2006 for service to the community. She is the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
         ACT
        </a>
        President of the Order of Australia Association and was involved in establishing the school-based Student Citizenship Awards program.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trish has nurtured a caring and inclusive environment at Giralang primary. She developed the school's unique relationship with the Rats of Tobruk Association and the special opportunities that has created for the association and the school.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trish is involved in a number of organisations outside of education, including the Friends of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Arboretum" rel="nofollow">
         National Arboretum
        </a>
        and the Friends of Opera. She has made a special contribution to the Canberra community and I wish her a very happy and fulfilling retirement.
