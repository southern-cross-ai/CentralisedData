        My question is to the Minister for Justice and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on Counter-Terrorism. Will the minister update the House on the Joint Police Taskforce into Industrial Criminality and Corruption? How is the taskforce tackling corrupt practices in the union movement?

         I thank the member for
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Trobe" rel="nofollow">
          La Trobe
         </a>
         for that question. I acknowledge that he, as a former police officer, is always interested in respect for the rule of law. Late last year the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission" rel="nofollow">
          Royal Commission
         </a>
         into Trade Union Governance and Corruption revealed evidence of widespread and deep seated corruption and lawlessness amongst some union officials. The commissioner conducted investigations for approximately 21 months, held 189 days of hearings and heard from more than 500 witnesses, but even after these extensive investigations the report only revealed 'the small tip of an enormous iceberg', according to Commissioner Heydon. The report contained allegations of bribery, extortion, kickbacks, blackmail, intimidation and collusion with organised criminals in a wide range of industries and unions.
        </p>
        <p>
         For evidence of the sorts of behaviour that we are talking about, you need to look no further than the extraordinary criminal record of Victoria's state secretary of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFMEU" rel="nofollow">
          CFMEU
         </a>
         , John Setka. He has been convicted and fined in relation to more than 40 charges—offences such as theft, assault, blackmail, criminal damage and assaulting police. But this criminal and corrupt behaviour is not isolated to a few rogue union officials, like the Labor Party would like us to believe; it is widespread and ingrained in union culture. The royal commission made 93 referrals to agencies, many of which were criminal referrals.
        </p>
        <p>
         The coalition will not tolerate corruption, criminality and organised crime links within the union movement. Some union officials—and this is very clear—either facilitate that corruption or are complicit in those activities. Criminal acts and association with serious criminals and outlaw motorcycle gangs is not acceptable for organisations charged with protecting the rights of their members. Hardworking and decent Australians are entitled to go to work free from fear and intimidation. That is why the government established a joint police task force in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales

         , Queensland, Victoria and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACT" rel="nofollow">
          ACT
         </a>
         to investigate and expose potential illegal activity uncovered during the royal commission. Eleven defendants are currently before the courts, and charges include providing false evidence, obstruction of Commonwealth officials, common assault, breach of bail and blackmail.
        </p>
        <p>
         Equally troubling evidence heard before the commission includes numerous examples of gross mismanagement and unauthorised use of union members' funds—for example, to buy box tickets to a Kiss concert, to buy Tiffany bracelets or, in some cases, to buy luxury cars. Labor have a very clear choice. They can continue to turn a blind eye to this sort of activity or they can join with us and stand for decency and rule of law.
