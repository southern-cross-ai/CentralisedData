        Securing a free and open Indo-Pacific of strong independent sovereign states, not a region dominated by hegemonic power with vassals, depends on parliamentarians understanding our alliances, strategic capability and threats. From June to August, the

        This year's exercise involved around 17,000 military personnel from not only Australia and the United States but also Canada, Japan,

        . We've got friends. There was also India and Indonesia, as well as other observer nations. This broad level of participation reflects the unanimity and commitment of like-minded liberal democratic nations to a rules based Indo-Pacific free from the coercion of emerging powers. Despite unprecedented change in our region, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANZUS" rel="nofollow">

        military alliance is approaching its 70th anniversary this year, demonstrating the depth and durability of our friendship. Our alliance has confronted and overcome many challenges over the last seven decades, and at Exercise Talisman Sabre 2021 we are strengthening and adapting to respond to the challenges of a new era.

        Like many members previously, Senator Ben Small, as well as the member for Fisher and current Deputy Speaker in the chair, the member for Oxley and I, participated in the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program to observe Exercise Talisman Sabre and see firsthand the depth of our defence alliances and our combined military capability. We flew from Rockhampton in an Army CH-47 Chinook helicopter to witness an impressive naval, land and air live firing at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoalwater_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Shoalwater Bay
        </a>
        . There we saw the utilisation of our remarkable hardware that enables the Navy,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Force" rel="nofollow">

        and Army to combine their firepower in defence of our sovereign interests. Later that day we landed in Townsville in a C-17 Globemaster aircraft for four days of site visits across the exercise's strategic operations. We—and I know, Deputy Speaker, that you, in particular—earned our stripes in Army and Air Force operations and learnt about the United States Space Force capacity and its role in the new frontier of warfare.
       </p>
       <p>
        I particularly thank those who support this program at the parliamentary level and, of course, in the ADF to enlarge our understanding of the critical work that you do. Thank you to veteran Jason Harrison for showing us around the Air Force base and the 2RAR historical museum, which reminded us of the sacrifices made together by Australian and US troops on battlefields from Korea to Iraq, defending freedom and democracy for successive generations. Thank you to those who have had success in organising and leading this iteration of Exercise Talisman Sabre: Lieutenant General Brian Ashley Power AO, Brigadier Kahlil Fegan, Major General Jake Ellwood, Lieutenant General Greg Bilton AO, Major Mark Herbert and Private Zabiri Salim.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thank you to Lieutenant Colonel Andy Martin, executive officer of the Australian Defence Force Parliamentary Program, for your championing of our understanding and interaction between the ADF and parliamentarians. It was an invaluable experience. It was invaluable because it gave us an insight into the important work that you do, and, more critically, the sacrifices that so many Australians have made in defence of our nation in the past and at present, and what we can do in this place to make sure that you have the equipment, the skills and the capability not just to defend our nation but to defend yourselves. Of course, whatever is to happen in the future, we on this side of the chamber back the ADF in its critical function, and I'm sure there are many members on the other side of the chamber who do as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        We want a strong and confident Australia to play its role, not just in the Indo-Pacific but across the world, because we can be a beacon light of hope for the rest of the world as part of a concert of nations, particularly liberal democracies, that secure peace, stability and prosperity for the whole of the world. So thank you for the work that you do. We thank and salute all of Australia's servicemen and women for your sacrifice for the security and safety of our nation. We want you to know that there are many members in this chamber, and of course the other one, who have your back, are prepared to support you every step of the way and appreciate every single thing that you do in the interests of our nation.
