        was dealing with a summer plagued with COVID-19, it was business as usual on many fronts when it came to natural disasters in South Australia, and volunteer emergency service personnel continued to do their jobs in attending to these natural disasters. On Monday 10 January a devastating fire raged through the community near Lucindale, burning through 16,800 hectares of land. The devastation that this fire left in its path affected more than 100 homes, but it was the loss of the life of a long-serving

        </a>
        Brigade that brought the state to a standstill. Louise Hincks is a name that will forever be engraved in the hearts and minds of my community as well as communities all around South Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        This tragedy occurred on a day of hot and windy extreme fire danger conditions, when temperatures soared to nearly 40 degrees. Louise, a volunteer with the CFS, selflessly put her community before herself, taking up the call for help. This wasn't in her home community. She'd travelled hundreds of kilometres to volunteer her skills to protect others in a community some distance away. During this dangerous time, she lost her life in the line of duty.
       </p>
       <p>
        There has been a public outpouring of grief over the loss of Louise, including from people like Tanya, who volunteered with her for seven years and described her as 'the sweetest, kindest selfless soul, utterly dedicated to the CFS and her community'. Katelyn said of Louise: 'I just hope one day I can touch as many lives as you did in the short time you were here. You are going to be missed.' Simone captured the incredible impact Louise had, saying, 'She was a fierce supporter and a wonderful role model for women in firefighting across the emergency services, highlighted by her beaming pride to see her daughters join as cadets.' I was really pleased to see that her daughter Alice won Happy Valley's 2021 CFS Cadet of the Year, that she was recognised. It was a privilege to witness this. It is an example of the role model that Louise was.
       </p>
       <p>
        Louise had a proud history of volunteering with the CFS. There are not many words to describe the type of courage, the type of bravery, that had to be displayed that day. But Louise, you are a hero in every sense of the word. You will forever be a hero. Vale Louise Hincks.
