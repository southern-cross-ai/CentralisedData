        I want to take this opportunity to thank and congratulate Kim Williams, as director, and also the

        Business Women Connect on their work in bringing networking and innovation to the business and professional women of my electorate.

       <p>
        Business Women Connect provides leading business women with a much needed and valuable forum to facilitate business and personal development. Professional business women, large and small business owners, public and private sector executives, managers and salespeople all benefit from Business Women Connect. This unique business networking opportunity is specifically designed for successful and up-and-coming business women who strive to develop themselves and their businesses and to offer their mentorship and guidance to other women. Just last week, the Minister for Employment Participation and Childcare and Minister for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_of_Women" rel="nofollow">

        ,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kate_Ellis" rel="nofollow">

        , addressed more than 100 business and professional women at a lunch on the Central Coast. Also in attendance were Councillor Vicki Scott and the Status of Women Committee of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosford_City_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Gosford City Council
        </a>
        . Minister Ellis mentioned that in all of her travels around Australia this was the first time she had met such a body working for women within a local council structureâ€”and they do a very fine job. I also acknowledge the presence there of Barbara Hunter, who has been a long-time leader in the Gosford chapter of the Business and Professional Women's Association. It was great to see these agencies together in one space on that particular day.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last week's lunch exemplified the benefits that can be experienced when women in the business and community sectors work together to expand the opportunities available to all women across the coast. The jewel in the crown of Business Women's Connect is the Central Coast Women in Business Awards. Every year, recognition is given to women in a number of categories for their ongoing work in the business, community, professional and education sectors.
       </p>
       <p>
        Today I would like to recognise and congratulate some of this year's award finalists. Business Women's Connect provides a great mentoring role for young businesswomen on the coast. I would like to recognise Rachel Davis of Beyond Your Balance and Erin McNab of Aspyre Natural Hair and Beauty as finalists for the Young Achiever Award. Congratulations to Michelle Allen of Webstuff.biz, Maidie Anne Dodd of JessEmma Equestrian Centre and Sue Henry of the Small Business Accelerator for their nominations in the Women in Business Award.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also like to recognise great local women Audrey Taggart of the Australian Plant Society, Nada Potter of Chertsey Primary School Schools as Community Centres and Tania Gurney of Gurney Financial Services for their continued great work in the community sector and recognition of this service through their nomination for the Gosford City Council &amp; Wyong Shire Council Women in Community Service Award for 2011. I very much look forward to celebrating with the winners a little later this year when the finalists gather to celebrate their success and acknowledge excellence by women on the Central Coast.
