        In the last week or so we've been hearing a lot about the major political parties fighting for hardworking Australians. I just want to go on the record. In Moreton I represent a marginal seat, and I want to show my support for those Moreton residents who are not quite hard working. Maybe they're just phoning it in. Maybe they're turning up for work but their heart's not in it. They're not quite hardworking Australians. I just want to let them know: 'I support you, even if you'd really rather go down to the

        </a>
        and go to the beach, rather than be at work. You might rather read a good book or do a bit of bushwalking or maybe even just sit on the couch.' I just want to let those people in Moreton know that I support them. Maybe they're working hard at home with the kids and perhaps they'd rather be at the cinema without the kids, away from the kids, without the kidsâ€”having a break from the kids. I'm just doing my bit to make sure that people in Moreton understand that Labor will support you.

        We hear this term 'hardworking Australians' thrown around like a sword by some politicians. I just want to let everyone know that I am particularly supportive. I saw it on the weekend when I had a barbecue with people coming along to talk about how some of Labor's proposals would be of benefit to them, particularly in terms of investing in education, health and aged care. Those were three areas we came up on the weekend. So I give a shout-out to those people in Moreton who are not quite hardworking.
