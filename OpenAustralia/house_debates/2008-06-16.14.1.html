        Mr Speaker, on indulgence: it is with great sadness that I inform the House of the death of Queensland state of origin great Dick ‘Tosser’ Turner. Dick was known as the godfather of Queensland rugby league. He was a former player and administrator with Norths, Redcliffe and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Queensland_Crushers" rel="nofollow">

        , but it was through his role as the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland_Rugby_League" rel="nofollow">
         Queensland Rugby League
        </a>
        origin team manager that he achieved his status as a legend of the game. He was co-manager of the Queensland state of origin team from 1982 through to 1996. It was no surprise when the Queensland team of the century was named recently that there was unanimous agreement that Dick would have to be its manager. As a measure of the regard in which Dick is held, the Queensland Rugby League awards the Dick ‘Tosser’ Turner Medal, as a recognition of long service to Queensland origin rugby league, to players who have donned the maroon jersey 20 or more times. Recipients include the game’s greats—

        s. FOGs is a non-profit organisation committed to helping rugby league and other communities and charities across Queensland. Just a few weeks ago the Treasurer and I were invited by Tosser to commemorate the great community work which has been done by that organisation—rugby league legends who continue to give to the community. On the morning of the event, we learnt that Tosser was too sick in his fight against cancer to attend. Wayne and I saw him just afterwards in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wesley_Hospital" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        in Brisbane. Tosser was in a fighting spirit—something we had known him for throughout his career. It was apparent that the cancer was taking its toll, and the end seemed near. Tosser’s loss will be felt greatly across the great family of rugby league in Queensland and I believe across the entire national rugby league community. A generous and giving man, Dick Turner was a true giant of rugby league, a proud Queenslander and a proud Australian. To his family—his wife, Jan, with whom I spoke this morning, and his three boys—and to his many friends: our thoughts and our prayers are with you. He was a great man, a great supporter of rugby league, a great Queenslander and a great Australian.

         was, as we have heard, the godfather of Queensland’s state of origin rugby league team. His name was synonymous with origin, and he became the maroons’ manager in the origin’s first year in 1980. Ever since, he was an integral part of the Queensland side and he worked with the team during its early heyday right through until the latest origin match last Wednesday. After the maroons had smashed
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         , battling cancer and wheelchair-bound he visited the maroons’ shed to personally congratulate them. His contribution on and off the field cannot be underestimated and he was regarded as a father figure by every origin player whom he ever had contact with. Over more than two decades he worked with all the greats—Marty Bella, the King, Vautin and Meninga. He founded the Former Origin Greats organisation, and it is also fitting that the Turner Medal, which recognises Queensland origin players who have donned the maroon jersey 20 times or more, is named in honour of him. He did not like the spotlight too much; he never did. He did his best work behind the scenes, most times without people even noticing what he was doing or what he had done. To this day he enjoys the utmost respect from past and present players for his contribution to Queensland’s origin success. He is an origin legend and one of the reasons why origin footy is as big as it is today.
        </p>

         I also take this opportunity to recognise the passing, last month, of the great
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Gibson" rel="nofollow">

         </a>
         . He was coach of the team of the century and is described by

          Peter Sterling

         as a man who not only made wonderful players but also made wonderful people. These men were two great Australians and two great contributors to the league, and they will be greatly missed.
