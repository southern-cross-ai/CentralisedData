       <p>
        Today I'd like to acknowledge and congratulate all the students at Beaudesert State High School on their recent leadership ceremony. Last week I had the pleasure of attending the ceremony. The true respect, talent and regard of the school's students was on full display. I want to congratulate Phoenix Brooks and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Smith" rel="nofollow">
         Jack Smith
        </a>
        on their appointments as school captains, and Mia Matthews and Daniel Murtagh on their appointments as Indigenous leaders. I also want to congratulate all of the students who were appointed school vice-captains, house sporting captains, and arts and extra curriculum captains.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to pay tribute to the dedicated, hardworking staff at the school: Damien Burke, who has recently been appointed as the acting principal, a role in which I am confident he will make positive, impactful changes in the school; the deputy principals, Sheryl Healy, Damian O'Brien, Rob Wonson, Kirsty Carey and Todd Winton; as well as the heads of departments and student welfare staff and all of the teachers at the high school. Without all of you, the school would simply not run and the students wouldn't get the vital education and the influence they all deserve.
       </p>
       <p>
        Congratulations to all the students at Beaudesert State High School. I have no doubt that you'll be a success in the future, whatever you set your minds to. All those students can achieve whatever they want from Beaudesert State High School.
