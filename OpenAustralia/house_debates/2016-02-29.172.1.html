       <p>
        I rise this afternoon to pay tribute to the football community within the Banks electorate. We are fortunate to have both the St George Football Association and the Bankstown District Amateur Football Association active in my area. As the largest sport played by the residents of my area, football is indeed a very important part of our community. Recently, through the Stronger Communities Program, the St George Football Association was successful in its application for defibrillators to be placed at fields within the Banks electorate. Defibrillators can be used in situations of cardiac arrest and are a very important piece of medical equipment. Through the Stronger Communities program, funding was also approved for a defibrillator at Playford Park in Padstow. That was also good news.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank Sok Mallios, the president of the St George Football Association, along with Matt Rippon, the general manager of the Bankstown District Amateur Football Association, for all their great work. It was great to meet with the Revesby Rovers recently and to hear about their issues and the success of their club in recent years. To the football community in the Banks electorate: thank you.
