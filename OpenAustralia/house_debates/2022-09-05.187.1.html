        I rise today to pay tribute to Councillor Alison Goode, the inaugural mayor of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Albany" rel="nofollow">
         City of Albany
        </a>
        , who passed away last week. In the late 1990s the rural shire of Albany merged with the historic town that surrounded it to become the most populous city in my electorate. Alison, who had been deputy president of the shire, was one of seven candidates who ran to become the mayor of the city. She won that election, and the next one. When she left this world on Wednesday, she was still a serving city councillor.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last year I was privileged to share a meal with Alison and her husband, Gerry Gregson. We caught up at the Redmond hall, a vibrant community hub in the rural West Ward that Alison had served so diligently. We swapped stories well into the night about the trials, tribulations, triumphs and tricks of local and federal politics. Councillor Goode and I were proud that night to open a new kitchen facility at the hall that had been built with financial assistance from both the Commonwealth and the city.
       </p>
       <p>
        Alison worked hard to represent her constituents right up until the end. My condolences go to Gerry and all of the family.

        of Albany will only ever have one inaugural mayor, and we were very lucky that it was Alison Goode.
