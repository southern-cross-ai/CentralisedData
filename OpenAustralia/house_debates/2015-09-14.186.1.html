       <p>
        Congratulations to the member for Hume: that is a real achievement. I present six petitions that have been approved by the House. There are three petitions from Dr Penny Vine from Albury and one each from Patrick Naughtin and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Block" rel="nofollow">
         Barbara Block
        </a>
        from Beechworth and Susan Brunskill from Wooragee. The six petitions are signed by 514 concerned Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the heart of all of these petitions is overwhelming care and concern for those who cannot look after themselves. The petitions: express concern about the proven physical and psychological damage of indefinite and arbitrary detention of asylum seekers; call on the government to legislate time limits in detention; express concern about the plight of children in detention in Australian centres and Nauru; call on the government to stop the detention of refugee and asylum seeker children; express concern with the withdrawal of legal representation for asylum seekers who are subject to fast-tracking processes; and call on the government to reinstate the Immigration Advice and Application Assistance Scheme.
       </p>
       <p>
        Refugees seek security and protection in Australia, not indefinite detention, not detention of children and not limited access to legal representation. We need an immigration system that reflects international law, is fair, and ensures people's health, safety and dignity is maintained. It gives me great pleasure to present these petitions.
       </p>

        Asylum seekers often lack the financial resources to pay for legal advice and representation .Without legal aid, asylum seekers will be left to present their protection visa applications on their own.

        We therefore ask the House that the Immigration Advice and Application Assistance Scheme (IAAAS) be reinstated for all asylum seekers, regardless of their date or mode of arrival.
