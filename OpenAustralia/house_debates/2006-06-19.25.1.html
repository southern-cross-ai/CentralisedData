       <p>
        Last month I had the honour of attending and speaking at a very special service and commemorative luncheon at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greek_Orthodox_Church" rel="nofollow">
         Greek Orthodox Church
        </a>
        of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Anna" rel="nofollow">
         St Anna
        </a>
        on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        . It was the 30th anniversary of the construction of the Greek community centre and original Greek Orthodox Church in our city—a milestone for the Greek community who came together to pay tribute to and honour the pioneers of the Greek community, to acknowledge their achievements.
       </p>
       <p>
        The vision and commitment of the early pioneers of the Greek community has meant that their community has grown strongly over the past 30 years with services from child care to respite supporting these wonderful migrants. It has meant that the Gold Coast has enjoyed wonderful food, wine and Greek culture each year with the Greek festival—a wonderful celebration of everything Greek. Our Gold Coast Greek community has made a wonderful contribution to the rich tapestry that makes our city what it is today.
       </p>
       <p>
        During the celebrations, Mr Jim Raptis, the honorary Greek consul, was presented with the cross of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Andrew" rel="nofollow">
         St Andrew
        </a>
        , the highest award that is given to laity by the Greek Orthodox Church in Australia, in honour of his community contributions over many years. Jim, along with his wife, Helen, has made an enormous contribution to our city. Their generosity to the community is well known and, of course, the Raptis Group has left a lasting legacy with signature buildings that line the landscape of our city. To Jim and Helen and all the Greek pioneers who have helped shape the identity of our city: I thank you on behalf or our city. Well done.
