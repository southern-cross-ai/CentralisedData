        We all know how competitive sport can be, not just on the field but between the various sporting codes themselves. Australia has a famous tradition of inter-sporting-code rivalry, so what could possibly unite six different sporting codes in the Berowra electorate? What could unite the Pennant Hills Stags rugby club, Pennant Hills Senior

        Club, Westbrook Junior AFL Club, Greenway Giants Baseball and Softball Club, West Pennant Hills Cherrybrook Cricket Club and Cherrybrook Senior and Little Athletics Centre? They all share a love of sport and service thousands in Berowra, but all six clubs also share Greenway Park in Cherrybrook. While they call it home, in its current state it's not the most fitting home. That's why the clubs have been talking to me about their vision for a truly great Greenway Park.

       <p>
        Last week, I met with representatives of the six clubs and they explained their current problems. Greenway Park sports club connects some 2,000 families and 8,000 community members, with players as young as five years old right through to her grandparents in their 80s. Despite the broad membership, Greenway Park has terrible off-field facilities, limited change rooms that discourage female participation, no shade for spectators and poor disability access and it lacks a simple shelter facility for gathering. Greenway Park also badly needs resurfacing. That's why the Greenway community sports house group has been established—to raise funds and lobby for resurfacing of Greenway Park and an upgrade to the Greenway sports clubhouse. I'll be supporting their aims and I’ll be fighting for funding to see a better Greenway Park for everyone.
