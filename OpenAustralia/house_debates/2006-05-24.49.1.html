        My question is to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services in his capacity, as we are informed, as the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage. Is the minister aware that in
        <i>
         Science
        </i>
        magazine 28 October 2005 Professor Dobson asserts that: ‘Bats are recognised globally as being a natural reservoir host for new emergent disease pathogens. Bats are host for the rabies virus’—bat lissavirus as it is known in Australia. ‘Three species,’ he states, ‘have been officially recorded as hosts of the virus that caused the

        </a>
        publication of 1 October warning that

        flying foxes carry Lyssavirus, which is probably always fatal, and to which 9.4 per cent tested positive; Hendra Virus, of which two of four reported cases were fatal; Leptospirosis, which is sometimes fatal; and Salmonella, which is also sometimes fatal—could the minister assure the people of North Queensland that they have the right to protect themselves and fellow citizens from such imminent dangers by culling? If not, would the minister not agree that the state and federal ministers refusing such permission would be responsible for any consequent deaths or diseases that result from such refusals?

         The answer to the first question is no, I cannot say that I have read the report by Professor Dobson or whoever it is that makes all of those claims. The answer to the last question is also no, because ministers who make responsible decisions and take into account all of the issues that need to be properly weighted cannot be held responsible for the sorts of outcomes that the honourable member referred to. If there is some further information that the minister for the environment would like to provide, I will give him that opportunity.
