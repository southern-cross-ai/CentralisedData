        My question is to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Minister, how is Australia responding to events in Georgia and what are the implications of the conflict for Russia’s standing in world affairs?

         I thank the member for her question. Members would be aware that overnight the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_President" rel="nofollow">
          Russian President
         </a>
         ,

          President Medvedev
         </a>
         , indicated that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Federation" rel="nofollow">
          Russian Federation
         </a>
         had recognised the independence of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Ossetia" rel="nofollow">
          South Ossetia
         </a>
         and Abkhazia, often known as the separatist region of Georgia. Australia does not support such recognition. That is Australia’s longstanding position. Australia recognises the territorial sovereignty of Georgia over the provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. The declaration by the Russian Federation is not a helpful contribution to tensions in that area of the world and not a helpful contribution to international relations. Indeed, some might say that such a declaration was provocative. It does not help the standing of the Russian Federation. In the Australian government’s view, it diminishes and lowers its standing.
        </p>
        <p>
         Members would recall that earlier this month, following the incursion of Georgian forces into South Ossetia, the Russian Federation deployed a large-scale military offensive in Georgia, not restricted to South Ossetia. That large-scale military offensive implemented and effected large-scale devastation upon parts of Georgia, including military and economic points. We saw, regrettably, civilian casualties and a large number of displaced persons, as a consequence of which the Australian government announced humanitarian assistance of a million dollars through relevant international agencies.
        </p>
        <p>
         The actions of the Russian Federation in this respect were clearly disproportionate. We welcomed very much the efforts of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Sarkozy" rel="nofollow">
          President Sarkozy
         </a>
         , the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_France" rel="nofollow">
          President of France
         </a>
         , in his position as European Union chair, and the Finnish Foreign Minister, my counterpart from Finland, in his position as chair of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, in effecting a ceasefire agreement between Georgia and the Russian Federation. Regrettably, Russia has not abided by that ceasefire and, as we have done publicly and through officials in both Canberra and Moscow, we again call upon the Russian Federation to return its troops to the positions they occupied prior to the commencement of hostilities on 6 and 7 August.
        </p>
        <p>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Russian_Federation" rel="nofollow">
          The Russian Federation
         </a>
         is a significant and influential player in world affairs. It is essential that it engages in dialogue and peaceful conduct. We urge the Russian Federation to abide by the ceasefire brokered by President Sarkozy and return its forces to those positions, and to engage fully in international affairs through the relevant regional multilateral forums—through discussion, not through the disproportionate use of military force of arms.
