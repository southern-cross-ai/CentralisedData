        On Monday 16 February and Tuesday 17 February, I will have the honour of hosting senior historian in the military history section of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_War_Memorial" rel="nofollow">
         Australian War Memorial
        </a>
        Mr Aaron Pegram for two public presentations in my electorate and three school visits on Australia's commitment in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_World_War" rel="nofollow">
         First World War
        </a>
        . Saturday, 25 April 2015 will mark 100 years since the Anzacs landed at Gallipoli. Over 8,000 men were killed, and over 19,000 were wounded in one of the most horrific of all battles in human history.
       </p>
       <p>
        That we as a nation remember the sacrifice of those who fought, and commemorate the centenary of that battle, is important for the memory of those who fought and their families but also for the nation who looks to those who fought at Gallipoli as exemplars of courage, mateship and tenacity. The history of events that led to the outbreak of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_War" rel="nofollow">
         Great War
        </a>
        and Australia's involvement on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Front" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , however, are less well known despite being just as bloody and just as horrific. That is why I have invited Mr Pegram from the Australian War Memorial to visit the north-west coast. He will help us to understand more of Australia's involvement at the outbreak of the war in

        </a>
        , the war at sea and the Gallipoli campaign, Sinai, Palestine, the Western Front and the legacies of the First World War.
       </p>
       <p>
        These important events will be held on 16 February at the Devonport
