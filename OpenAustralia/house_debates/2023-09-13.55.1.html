        My question is to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations. What is the outcome of the High Court case in relation to Qantas and its workers? What was the government's role, and how is this different from the previous government's approach?

         I thank the member for Calwell for her question, as she is someone who represents many aviation workers in her area. The government welcomes the decision of the High Court today. We congratulate the workers, and we congratulate the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Workers_Union" rel="nofollow">
          Transport Workers Union
         </a>
         , which took this case forward. Some of those 1,700 illegally sacked workers are here today in the public gallery right now. I met with three of them just before question time, Damien Pollard, Gavin Burns and Craig Fielding. Some of you may have seen Damien Pollard in the media conference outside the High Court. He referred to a sense of justification and redemption. I say to the workers who were illegally sacked: you did nothing wrong. Qantas broke the law, and the government of the time left you stranded.
        </p>
        <p>
         The difference in the approach between that government and this government now could not be more stark. Let's not forget what happened. They claimed JobKeeper, saying that that was for people to keep jobs.

          The minister will pause for a moment. There is far too much noise on my left. I cannot hear a word that is being said. If this continues, people will leave the chamber. There is far too much noise, and I mean it. The minister has the call.

           JobKeeper was paid to Qantas, the aviation sector support was provided and then Qantas said the workers, even though they were being paid JobKeeper, would run down their leave, and, once their leave had been run down and they came to be brought back on shift, they were told after being stood down for six months that they were fired. That's what happened. While their leave was being run down, the industrial relations minister of the day said it was 'a good model'. The transport minister of the day said, 'I know the decisions are in the best interest of their company going forward,' and Senator Cash said at the time, 'This is a commercial decisions for Qantas, and Qantas are entitled to make those decisions.' Well, you are not entitled to illegally sack people.
          </p>
          <p>
           While that was happening, from opposition, the now Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Government" rel="nofollow">
            Local Government
           </a>
           , the now Prime Minister and I stood shoulder to shoulder with those workers and said we would fight for them. From time to time, governments make decisions as to whether they will intervene in a High Court case. Those opposite will know this because they did intervene in High Court cases. They intervened to cut the conditions in enterprise agreements. They intervened in another case to cut the rights of casuals. They intervened to cut the rights of shift workers. Well, we intervened to protect the rights of those Qantas workers, and we welcome that justice has been given today for those workers after they experienced horrific treatment from a company that those opposite made excuses for, that those opposite made allowances for. They are now in a situation where, after we stood shoulder to shoulder with them, those workers now can see some justice.
