        I rise to congratulate the

        </a>
        and Warwick Farm Public School. Last week, I had the great pleasure of opening their new dirt
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMX" rel="nofollow">
         BMX
        </a>
        bike track, which is in the school grounds. Many times we see government money wasted on frivolous projects and enormous amounts spent. This project cost $5,000, with $3,000 spent on building the dirt BMX track. The rest was used to buy 50 bikes for the school. These were purchased through the local Men's Shed, members of which went around to local council clean-ups and got old bikes to recycle. They fixed their tyres up and gave them to the school, at the cost of just $30.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a very important program for this school. Many of the students at Warwick Farm Public School are recent refugees and settlers to our country. These are kids who have never had the opportunity to ride a bike before. This program gives them that opportunity. It also gives them the opportunity to have somewhere to go after school. Many of those kids are living in high-rise apartment blocks. They do not have the backyards to play in that many of us took for granted when we were kids. I again congratulate Warwick Farm School and the Australian Sports Commission on this wonderful program to create this BMX dirt track at their school.
