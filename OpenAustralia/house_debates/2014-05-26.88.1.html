        My question is to the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Services" rel="nofollow">
         Social Services
        </a>
        . Will the minister confirm that the pension will continue to increase every six months? What other measures is the government taking to reduce the cost of living for all Australians?

           </a>
           commend the member for Gilmore for her great work on behalf of the constituents of Gilmore since she has been a member and, indeed, prior to being a member of this place. It has been a very consistent effort over a long period of time.
          </p>
          <p>
           As the member for Gilmore says, and contrary to what the Labor Party is claiming, the pension in Australia will continue to increase every six months. Twice yearly, the pension will continue to go up. Indeed, in March, just a month or two ago, under this government, the pension increased by up to $15.70 for singles per fortnight and up to $11.90 per fortnight for each member of a couple. That is almost $12 for each member of a couple and almost $16 for singles. And the pension will increase again this September. So, contrary to the claims of the Labor Party, who are running around the country suggesting that somehow pensions will not increase, they actually increased in March, they will increase in September, they will increase in March and September next year and they will continue to go up.
          </p>
          <p>
           But more than that, the increase of the pension in March was actually driven by the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPI" rel="nofollow">
            CPI
           </a>
           —by the consumer price index—because of the wage levels. Indeed, from September 2017 we will do exactly that and ensure that the pension continues to increase by the CPI. So not only will the pension continue to increase every six months in this year so, too, will the pension supplement. It is currently up to $1,635.40 per year for singles and $2,464.80, again per year, for couples. That will increase again in September, along with the pensions themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
           So, this government is acting on cost of living for senior Australians and pensioners. They keep the energy supplement, worth up to $360 per annum for singles and $546 per annum for couples. Last October we reduced the deeming rates, and that has an immediate impact in terms of part pensions in particular. And we have done something which the Labor opposition never did, and that is we have indexed the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card. So we are concerned for the cost of living of seniors and pensioners in Australia.
          </p>
          <p>
           This stands in stark contrast to the Labor Party, that ran a Ponzi scheme with the Commonwealth finances so much that we are borrowing a billion dollars a month just to pay the interest. Shame on you!
