        I rise today to pay tribute to the life of Victoria Yeboah, who, until the middle of last year, was a resident of Gladesville in my electorate of Bennelong. On 17 December last year, Victoria lost her long battle with cancer. Victoria Yeboah was born into the royal family at the Kwenyako community in Ghana,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Africa" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        on 24 March 1975. In this community, the matriarchal magic of the queen was not the substance of ancient myth but a very powerful reality. The tribal elders guarded this in ceremonial and sacrificial ways involving human blood. Under her mother’s influence, Victoria converted to Christianity. This was an introduction that changed the course of Victoria’s life, the lives of her children and the community into which she was born.
       </p>
       <p>
        After one of her sisters and husband were murdered, Victoria took flight and left behind the traditions so at odds with her Christian values. In 2003, Victoria became a refugee, and her journey across Africa to Australia is crowded with the assistance of strangers and the pain of struggle. Victoria found herself at the Asylum Seekers Centre in Sydney and later made a home at

        . During this time, Victoria met Camilla Galwey and an extraordinary friendship began. In 2005, Victoria was first diagnosed with cancer. Camilla, her great friend, helped care for Victoria’s youngest child, baby Davie, and the miracles of Victoria’s journey took another turn. The

        community in Mosman in Sydney rallied together and provided Victoria with all the support that they could muster. Through the dedicated work of Advocate Immigration, Victoria was granted a special humanitarian visa in 2006. With the support of the group, Victoria was able to locate her four other children and another sister left behind in Ghana. The migration of Victoria’s children was made possible by many people, but particularly

        and Advocate Immigration.

        I had the pleasure of meeting Victoria when she required assistance with her children’s migration during her time in my electorate. The large and the small miracles which occurred all around her are extraordinary examples of individual and community compassion. I had the honour of presenting Victoria and her children with Australian citizenship in September of last year. Needless to say, she was not well. It was a great pleasure to share the joy of their reunion with all of the children and the joy of shared citizenship. A prouder and more grateful recipient I have yet to meet.
       </p>
       <p>
        Victoria had the wonderful ability to touch the hearts of everyone she met. She had a talent for friendship, a gentle wisdom, quiet strength and an insatiable hunger for knowledge. Her determination for change made her brave beyond compare. As five little pieces of Victoria Yeboah grow in safety into Australian citizens, I marvel at the gift that she has left across two continents.
