        My question is also to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Minister" rel="nofollow">
         Foreign Minister
        </a>
        . What are the consequences for Australia's standing on the world stage of one of the Liberal Party's biggest donors, mining magnate Sally Zou, establishing a company called Julie Bishop Glorious Foundation? Does the minister seriously expect the House to believe that a Liberal donor who she knows well set up a company in her name—the Julie Bishop Glorious Foundation—but never raised it with her on the many occasions that they met?

         Members on my left are preventing the foreign minister from answering the question. I am making it very clear now—the question having been asked and some people having their moment's fun—there will be no interjections.

          All donations to the Liberal Party are declared in accordance with the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AEC" rel="nofollow">
           AEC

          obligations. Until the matter was raised with me by the media a week ago, I had never heard of such a foundation. I say that in the solemnity of this parliament: I had never heard of such a foundation. The third point is that at no time have I ever compromised government policy in relation to foreign affairs. I have never given in to any influence, like Senator Sam Dastyari, who stands in stark contrast and who actually contradicted the opposition's policy on foreign affairs, has.

            He stood next to a Chinese benefactor, as I have never done, and publicly contradicted opposition policy on foreign affairs. Also, at no time have I ever had a benefactor who had alleged links with a foreign intelligence service while serving as the foreign minister or while serving on the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Committee" rel="nofollow">
             National Security Committee
            </a>
            . I know why the Labor Party is putting up the straw man argument. It is because the Leader of the Opposition has failed to investigate the very serious allegations against Senator Sam Dastyari, whom he then restored to his leadership position, and against the member for Hunter, who, as defence minister of this country and as a member of the National Security Committee, had a benefactor with alleged links to a foreign intelligence service. I can stand here and be proud of my record. Labor is covered in shame.
