        I want to talk today about 2NBC, an incredibly important part of our local community in the St George area. Founded back in 1983, 2NBC has provided fantastic radio coverage for almost four decades now. Just recently I met with
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_McGrath" rel="nofollow">
         Paul McGrath
        </a>
        , the general manager of 2NBC. We talked about some of the great initiatives that are happening at the moment. One of the things that 2NBC is really keen to do is get more women involved in the station and more women broadcasting on the air. There's a mentoring program going on at 2NBC at the moment, which the federal government is providing a $20,000 grant towards. That's a great initiative by 2NBC. 2NBC serves so many people in our community, broadcasting in so many different languages, Mandurang, Indian, Greek, Macedonian and a range of other languages; and providing 24-hour community radio to the people of St George. To Paul McGrath and everyone at 2NBC, thanks so much for what you do for our community.

        1st Oatley Bay Sea Scouts is one of the most popular scouting groups anywhere in southern Sydney. It does have the advantage, of course, of having a great waterside location on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_River" rel="nofollow">

        and access to canoes. Lots of kids take advantage of the opportunities of joining 1st Oatley Bay Sea Scouts: the 11- to 15-year-old scouts; the cubs, from eight to 11; and of course the joeys, from five to eight. Mark Connell, the president, who's been associated with this club for many decades, does a tremendous job, and it's great to be able to acknowledge him today. It's also great to be able to acknowledge

        , the cubs leader; Jen Attard, the scouts leader; and all of the very many parent volunteers. Scouts is an absolutely fundamental part of our society, of our community and of our country, and the 1st Oatley Bay Sea Scouts is a great example of scouts being very active in our local community.
