        My question is for the Minister for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_Change" rel="nofollow">
         Climate Change
        </a>
        and Energy. I refer to his answer earlier this week on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGS" rel="nofollow">
         RGS
        </a>
        , a manufacturer in my electorate that uses over 200 megawatt hours per year, which is facing an increase of around $43,000 in power bills. The default market offer, to which the minister referred in his answer, is only available to small businesses that consume less than 100 megawatt hours. So the minister did not answer my question. So I ask again: why are there such steep electricity prices facing this and many other businesses, and what is the government doing about it?

         I thank the honourable member for his question. My concern goes to all businesses in Queensland and all businesses across our country. My concern goes to all households across Australia and their energy bills, because we want to work and we are working and we will work to ensure that their power prices are as low as possible, whether they're on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DMO" rel="nofollow">
          DMO
         </a>
         or not. The DMO does feed into energy prices; that's a statement of fact. The former minister for energy knew that. Perhaps that's why he hid that increase from the Australian people.
        </p>
        <p>
         In the budget, we had a choice. We could have hidden the pressure on power prices—option A, which the previous government took. We could have hidden that. Option B is to actually be upfront with the Australian people about the pressures. That's the option we took. We take the option of actually being honest with the Australian people.

           It's a sad outcome that the member for Hume left us. But we are concerned and we are upfront. In relation to Queensland small businesses—small and large and medium—we should care about them all. The increase in small-business prices that the member for Hume hid from the Australian people was 12.8 per cent, $705, I make no apologies for pointing that to the House and the Australian people.
