        (a) the
        <i>
         Euthanasia Laws Act 1997
        </i>
        (known as the Andrews Bill) amended the
        <i>

          Northern Territory
         </a>
         (Self-Government) Act 1978
        </i>
        to deprive these two legislative assemblies of the power to make laws relating to euthanasia;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the Government of Prime Minister Howard justified this at the time as a constraint on young jurisdictions that were seen to be moving ahead of the broader public mood;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) when the Andrews Bill curtailed the right of territories to make laws relating to euthanasia, no other state or territory legislature had conducted a debate on similar laws;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) polls of public attitudes to doctor-led voluntary assisted dying suggest that support was in the high sixties in the 1980s, in the mid to high seventies in the 1990s, and in the low eighties in the past two decades;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) in recent years all state legislatures have debated legislation around voluntary assisted dying, with Victoria and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        legalising voluntary assisted dying, and New South Wales and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        rejecting legalisation, while Queensland and Tasmania have processes ongoing;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) the anachronistic Andrews Bill means that a quarter of a century since it was passed, 700,000 Australians who live in the Northern Territory or the Australian Capital Territory are still unable to participate in a democratic process to resolve community approaches to euthanasia;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (g) repealing the Andrews Bill would return to territories legal powers that are held by other Australian jurisdictions; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (h) restoring territory rights does not direct that either territory legislature should consider legislating on euthanasia, it merely allows them to do so if their properly elected representatives decide it appropriate;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) acknowledges that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) in each of the last two terms of parliament the Government has blocked debate on private Members' bills that would restore territory rights; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) while senators have debated and voted on related legislation, members of the House of Representatives have been prevented from expressing their views on this issue; and

       <p class="italic">
        (3) calls on the Government to:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) explain why, in 2021, two mature legislative jurisdictions are still singled out as unworthy of legislative self-determination;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) commit to introduce legislation into the House of Representatives that would grant territorians legislative equality with Australians in other jurisdictions; and
