        is a day when we recognise the locals who give back to our community, work hard for causes that matter and make our suburbs a better place to live. In that vein, I'm absolutely delighted to inform the House about Mr John Curdie
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        , who was recently named an Australian hero by Parramatta council. John was a key founder of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        sub-branch in Epping and has subsequently served as its president for 20 years. He is well known in our community and he has worked tirelessly to assist those who have served in uniform and their familiesâ€”a pertinent role today as we start a long-overdue conversation about the mental health of veterans in this country. He has contributed in numerous ways, including the upkeep of memorials, organising remembrance days and Anzac services, and providing support to members of the RSL community. Outside of his work at the RSL, John is a professional surveyor and he has made substantial contributions to his profession. I've known John personally for over seven years, and I can attest to his hard work, diligence and commitment. He is a wonderful asset to our community in Epping, which would not be the same without his work. It is very fitting that John should receive the City of Parramatta's Lord Mayor Community Service Award and I congratulate him. John is a good man to call a friend.
