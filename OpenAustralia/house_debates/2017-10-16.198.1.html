        The electorate of Mallee produces wonderful things. One of the great things we produce is our young Australians—but it doesn't just happen; we have people who care about them. Recently I had the privilege of talking to a group of young Australians who were working with adult mentors and hiking the

        . These are people who society has probably let slip through the cracks a little bit, so that mentor relationship really works with them. They were going to visit Bomana cemetery, where there are over 3,000 Australians who gave their lives. I was able to share a story from when I was a young man working in a shearing shed. When you work in a shearing shed, you stop for afternoon smoko and have a bit of chat, and I shared the story of working with a guy called Ron. Ron was in the 39th Battalion. He was rounded up and sent—without guns, I might say—up to

        and into Kokoda and was part of the people who fought in the Kokoda battle.
       </p>

        It is so encouraging for me, when I think about the future of Australians, to see two things: to see these young Australians hiking and remembering the sacrifice that Australians made at Kokoda and to see the community members who rally behind these young Australians. They sometimes help fundraise for them and also march beside them and encourage them. It says to these young people: 'Being an Australian is something to be proud of. Life might have thrown you some curve balls, but we will be your mentors and we will walk the Kokoda Trail together.' There is a symbolism that you can overcome obstacles in life and contribute. Well done to these young Australians from the Mallee.
