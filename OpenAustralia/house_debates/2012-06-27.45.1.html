        I congratulate Ainslie Parklands Primary School on the official opening of their $850,000
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BER" rel="nofollow">
         BER
        </a>
        project which I attended on 16 June. Also in attendance was
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Baker" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        , the school principal; the school council president, Dr Paul Chandler; the Mayor of Maroondah, Councillor Rob Steen; and many students, parents, teachers, former students and former teachers.
       </p>
       <p>
        The school has wisely invested its BER money in the construction and refurbishment of classrooms and a new school building foyer and facadeâ€”truly great additions to the school. I have now had the pleasure of opening more than 32 new BER building projects at schools in the electorate of Deakin and there are still more to come. I know that Ainslie Parklands' new classroom spaces and break-out rooms were handed over many months ago and, since then, the students, teachers and parents have been able to enjoy teaching and learning in a modern environment they thoroughly deserve.
       </p>
       <p>
        As good as it looks now, a project such as this does not happen overnight. It can often take a lot of time to get things right. Ainslie Parklands Primary School, although better known to me as Croydon West Primary School, is well established, with a long and proud history. This year, and indeed on this day of the official opening, was its 50th anniversary. I congratulate everyone involved with that. It was a great effort for the school. So many people put in so much time and effort to make the day a very special one. Combining it with their BER project was very fitting and special.
