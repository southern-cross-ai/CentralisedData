       <p class="italic">

        8 MR HAMMOND: To move:

        That this House:

       <p class="italic">
        (1) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the Government established a panel to review the Small Amount Credit Contract (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SACC" rel="nofollow">
         SACC
        </a>
        ) laws on 7 August 2015, which provided its final report to the Government on 3 March 2016;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the Government released its response to the SACC review on 28 November 2016, in which it agreed with the vast majority of the recommendations in part or in full;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) the Minister for Revenue and Financial Services said at the time that 'the implementation of these recommendations will ensure that vulnerable consumers are afforded appropriate levels of consumer protection while continuing to access SACCs and leases';
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) the Minister claimed in an interview on Lateline on 28 February 2017 that Treasury was drafting legislation to implement the review's recommendations; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) in response to questioning in Senate Additional Estimates by Senator Gallagher on 1 March 2017, Treasury's head of the Financial System Division confirmed that drafting had not commenced for a Bill to enact the SACC review recommendations accepted by the Government;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) acknowledges that consumer credit contracts and consumer leases have been shown to cause unnecessary hardship to vulnerable consumers, and that the Parliament should act to protect vulnerable consumers;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) recognises that the delay in introducing legislation for consideration by the Parliament, to implement the SACC review recommendations, results in an unnecessary continuation of hardship to vulnerable consumers and their families;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) congratulates the consumer advocate groups who attended

       <p class="italic">
        (5) calls on the Government to immediately prepare legislation for consideration by the Parliament, to implement the SACC review recommendations.
