       <p>
        We know the importance of looking after people who find themselves caught amidst the scourge of ice. Drugs in this country are a problem, as they are in so many other countries. They are a problem, particularly in regional areas. I was delighted last week to open a community facility for women which is being run by a group called
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO" rel="nofollow">
         WHO
        </a>
        , We Help Ourselves. This community facility is already being run for both women and men, but this particular housing will allow for six women at any one time to live on their own, with all the facilities necessary. It is vitally important that we keep doing everything we can to help transition people who are afflicted by an addiction to drug abuse back into the community but to do it in a way which respects their integrity, which allows them to get back to being their very best selves. That is why this particular grant money, which came from the Building Better Regions Fund, from the federal government, is being used so effectively with the We Help Ourselves group. I wish them and their team all the very best as they continue to help women.
