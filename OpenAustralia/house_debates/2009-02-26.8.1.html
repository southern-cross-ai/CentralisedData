          Appropriation Bill
         </a>
         (No. 6) 2008-2009

        provides additional funding for payments of a capital nature, such as for the purchase of administered assets and for payments to the states, territories and local government authorities.
       </p>

        The total additional appropriation sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 6) 2008-2009 is $1.83 billion.

       <p>
        The government also proposes under the package to bring forward $711 million to invest in building better roads. The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government will be provided with $392 million in 2008-09 for payment to the states, territories and local government to accelerate the commencement of a number of important projects on the national network and other strategic roads. This will bring forward expenditure on projects including the Bulahdelah bypass on the

        Consistent with the agreement reached with minor parties during the passage of the nation building and jobs package, the government proposes to bring forward expenditure totalling $500 million over four years beginning in 2008-09 to assist in expediting the return of water to the environment and deliver long-term benefits to the

        , Water, Heritage and the Arts will be provided with $250 million in 2008-09 for this purpose. The government considers that this is the maximum pace of water recovery that can be pursued without causing unnecessary disruption to the water market and without compromising the amount of water that can be returned to the rivers over time.

        I commend the bill to the House.
