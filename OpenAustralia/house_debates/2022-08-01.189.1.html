Our arts minister is already consulting on our national cultural policy, which will establish a comprehensive road map to guide the skills and resources required in order to transform and safeguard a diverse, vibrant and sustainable arts, entertainment and cultural sector now and into the future. I'm very pleased that he will be holding a town hall in my electorate next Monday to consult with the Canberra arts sector, and I encourage all Canberra artists and creatives and those who are interested to please make a submission and have their say.
