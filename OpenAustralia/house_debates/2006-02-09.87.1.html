        I would like to talk in this place about celebrating people who make a difference to our community. Through their often tireless, often very long and often unacknowledged efforts, these people make our community and our country a better place in which to live. I would like to acknowledge 19 people and two community based organisations that have made such a significant contribution that they were acknowledged in the Holt

        Awards on Australia Day. I would like to talk about these people briefly to let the parliament and the Australian people know about the contribution they make.
       </p>
       <p>
        Without going into too much detail, I would like to read into the record the names of the people who received the 2006 Holt Australia Day awards. As I said, because of their contribution to the community, their service to the community, they are the unrecognised heroes of our community. They make our community and our country a better place to be. The recipients of this year’s awards were: Carol Gaudoin, for services to the Andrews Centre; Dale Maggs, for services to the Casey Tourism Association and the Motorcycle Riders Association; Dianne Eigeneraam, for services to the Casey division of

        All of these people are unsung heroes—people who dedicate their lives to providing very simple services, but services that our community needs. When we talk about people not giving service to the community, we are not talking about the people whose names I have just read into

        . These are people who should be honoured for making our community and our country a better place to be.
