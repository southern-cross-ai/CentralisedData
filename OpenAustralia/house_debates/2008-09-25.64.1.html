        My question is to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts. Will the minister update the House on the government’s commitment to increase energy efficiency to help reduce Australia’s carbon pollution and deal with dangerous climate change?

            The government takes seriously the need to have a comprehensive approach to tackle dangerous climate change. In delivering the
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_Pollution_Reduction_Scheme" rel="nofollow">
             Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme
            </a>
            , we have committed to providing assistance to Australian households to take practical action to reduce their energy use, to save on energy bills and to make a tangible contribution to reducing carbon pollution. We are bringing forward a national strategy on energy efficiency to provide the coherence and national leadership in this area that has been lacking for the last 12 years—leadership for business, for industry and for households to take cost-effective energy efficiency actions.

             KPMG
            </a>
            and Ecos Corporation emphasising the importance of energy efficiency for households, particularly those on low incomes. We welcome the contribution of that report. It is something that the government understands very well. In fact, we are putting in place some $1 billion of household and community renewable energy and energy and water efficiency measures, which we have announced in the recent budget. Since 1 July, over 2,200 schools around Australia have registered to become solar schools. We very much welcome the great interest that communities and schools are showing around Australia for the Rudd Labor government’s program. We will be providing more funding and more installations of

              the member for Flinders, who is making interjections across the chamber, jumped out of an aeroplane to tell us how the solar industry was in free fall. Within days, we found that the figures on solar applications for the
              <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PV" rel="nofollow">
               PV

              s were at record highs. Memo to the member for Flinders: look before you leap.
             </p>
             <p>
              If we look at the coalition policy approach in this area, we can see that there is scant evidence that they recognise the importance of the scale of the challenge, or the role that constructive programs and a comprehensive strategy can bring into play. Next month, I am pleased to say, we will start seeing the first energy rating labels appear on televisions, which are one of the fastest growing sources of household energy use. Households will soon be able to identify cost-saving, superefficient appliances through new 10-star labels. Last Sunday, in Melbourne, I was pleased to announce, with the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, the Green Precincts Fund—a commitment of some $15 million to support at least 10 high-profile energy and water saving projects around Australia. We have launched Green Precincts—
