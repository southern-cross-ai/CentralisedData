        , who passed away on 4 March this year. At Murray's funeral, his daughter and grandsons spoke beautifully about Murray the dad and grandad. I can only speak of him in my capacity of having briefed him on many occasions when he was a silk and I was a junior solicitor. His kindness to and support and encouragement of me will always be appreciated.

I know the Hon. Justice Sandra Duggan has always spoken of his mentoring of her and how she owes so much of her career and success to Murray.
