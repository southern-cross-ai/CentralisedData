        When we picture the hard-hitting field of a rugby union game, strong burly men quickly spring to mind. Today I want to break down this image and talk about women's rugby. I have recently had the honour of being appointed the ambassador for the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        Rugby Sevens Women's Tournament, which will be held on 25 and 26 October at the Morrie Breen Oval, Wyong Leagues Club. This tournament is getting bigger and better each year. I am delighted to be involved to promote equality in sport. The tournament is leading the way towards achieving equality by acknowledging the outstanding level of competition this women's tournament delivers. This year the women's prize will be a record $12,000, making the Central Coast sevens one of the richest women's rugby sevens tournaments in the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        I recently had the opportunity to catch up with tournament director
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Morgan" rel="nofollow">
         Craig Morgan
        </a>
        and some of the players, including Melanie, Jayme, Kristie and Melaea, from the Central Coast Academy of Sport women's sevens team. Women from the Central Coast academy team this weekend will showcase their skills against the best in the world. The tournament will feature four of the top 10 world ranked teams in Australia, Canada, Brazil and Fiji. Also featured will be national teams from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">

        , Japan and the United States of America.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate Craig Morgan for his dedication and commitment to sevens rugby and for what I am sure will be a successful fourth year of rugby sevens competition on the Central Coast. I wish the Central Coast women's team all the very best at next weekend's competition. I have no doubt that they will do the Central Coast proud against the star-studded international teams.
