       <p>
        Haemochromatosis is the most common genetic disorder in Australia. In fact, one in 200 people are affected by it. This disorder causes your body to absorb too much iron from your daily diet. Those who have the disorder must visit health professionals on a regular basis to get blood removed in order to drop the iron in their body to safe levels. This treatment is called venesection or phlebotomy and is similar to donating blood. Many people don't realise that they have this disorder or don't realise that too much iron can be a major health problem. Because the symptoms of haemochromatosis, which are tiredness, muscle weakness and joint pain, are generic and non-specific, this disorder often goes undiagnosed.

        However, iron overload can be dangerous as the human body has a means to control iron levels but cannot excrete excess iron. This can damage and affect the liver, heart and pancreas. I believe that we need to raise more awareness of the health implications of haemochromatosis which is why it's great to hear that, for the first time this year, Haemochromatosis Australia will be painting Australia red by lighting up some of our country's most well-known landmarks and buildings for World Haemochromatosis Week from 1 to 7 June. This includes the

        </a>
        in Canberra today followed by the National Carillion from 3 to 7 June. Haemochromatosis can be detected before damage occurs, and doesn't stop people from going about their lives. I cannot stress too much the importance of seeing a medical professional for a check-up if you believe you may have this disorder.
