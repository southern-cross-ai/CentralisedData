        My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer to reports of the Prime Minister's verbal spat with the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales

          What the Australian government has done, together with the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
           New South Wales
          </a>
          government, is delivering support to businesses in New South Wales that is urgently needed as they work through this pandemic. We've been working closely with the New South Wales government to achieve that, and I'm very pleased that we were able to come to those arrangements not just on one occasion but to upgrade those arrangements, with the work that was done between the Treasurer and I and the Premier of New South Wales and the New South Wales Treasurer. What matters is that we get this support to those people who need it. I've just mentioned the significant support that has been provided through the COVID disaster assistance payment in New South Wales that has resulted in $1.7 billion of support going to people who have lost more than eight hours—not just more than 20 hours but more than eight hours—including those who are on benefit payments, which was the last issue of improvement that we made to those COVID disaster payments after we were working together with the New South Wales government. Increasingly, as the New South Wales government ensures that those payments are being made to New South Wales businesses, that's going to help them come through this current lockdown and be able to get to the other side.
         </p>
         <p>
          One thing I know—and I know it because we saw it last year when we came back from the COVID-19 recession, when we got to the point where we were able to graduate the Australian economy off JobKeeper, and I remember those opposite a-hopin' and a-prayin' that 100,000 people would still be out of a job, and they were proved wrong, and those results did not happen as they were trying to doomingly project—

                . I will just make the point that the reason question time gets to this robust state is that some of the questions carry some pretty heavy character assessments in them as well. In allowing and encouraging free speech, I allow it on the basis that, once that question's been asked, it actually allows the responder to respond to the issue without the accusation simply standing there. I do object to members reflecting on each other in that way. I've always made the point that, if a member has a problem with the conduct of another member, they need to raise it with me or in the House, and no-one has. The Prime Minister has the call.

                 While those opposite have sought to undermine the government, to talk down the programs like JobKeeper that we've put in place, to distance themselves and call it a waste, to undermine the government's efforts as we've sought to deal with the significant challenges we've had in the early phases of the vaccination program, which we have now turned around thanks to the magnificent efforts of those working in the

                 and under General Frewen's leadership, but more important those on the ground working in the vaccination clinics and in the vaccination hubs, today throughout question time our government has been thanking Australians for the work that they have done. We thank them for the work that they have done to get Australia on track because those Australians know that they want Australia to succeed. They want these programs to succeed because they know that that is the path back. We have set out the national plan that sets out that path for Australians to be able to make their way back from and through this COVID pandemic. And we will continue on that path, whether the opposition wants to support us or not.
