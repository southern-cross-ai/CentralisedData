       <p>
        Last Friday, 7 November, I held an interschool mixed basketball competition for primary school students, which I called the Cowan Challenge. I came up with the idea in order to help promote competitive sport and healthier living and to enable schools across the length of the electorate to compete against each other. These schools would not normally have any involvement with each other.
       </p>
       <p>
        The competition took place across the whole school day, with schools competing in two pools before the successful schools rose through the semifinals and then ultimately to the finals. I am pleased to report that a strong and consistent effort saw the top teams in each pool make it through to the final, with Camboon

        taking the gold medal by defeating Kingsway Christian College. Canboon Primary School was well represented by Naalia Tearoa, Tashreeq Babier, Mohamed Jammaloodien, Skye Leigh, Kevin Labib, Steven On, Nick Maurer, Jarvis Chan, Tiah Berryman and Liam McKay. Camboon was led by teacher Jodie Willox.

        The silver medal was taken by Kingsway Christian College, and I congratulate Matt Elliot and the staff of the college. For their great effort, I also congratulate the players: Brendon Armstrong, Tyson Armstrong, Michaela Brouwer, Elise Dodd, Kaleb Elliot, Lauren Le Coultre, Joel Offereins, Rachel Spencer and

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The bronze medal game was won by Neerabup Primary School, which defeated Ashdale Primary School in a close game. A great job was done by Jarred Foote and his enthusiastic team of Tyhara Garlett, Tsyon Feleke, LeShaye Hill, Tamika TeWano Grainger, Jasmine Kohli, Connor McKenna,

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I would like to acknowledge the referees from Woodvale Senior High School and their teacher, Kelvin Browner, for the outstanding support they provided on the day. I was surprised to hear that the referees were only in year 10, given the maturity and skill shown by them. Tyler Sinclair, Harrison Lovell, Kate Hedley, Ashleigh Cole, Grace Connell and Tayla Wellsteed all did a great job of keeping control of the game and assisting the teams to a better understanding of the sport.
       </p>
       <p>
        As a former Australian and state representative in rowing, I am a firm believer in the value of competitive sport. It is good on many levels. It is good for health and fitness, it is good as a learning experience and it is good for children to exercise control and good conduct despite being under a degree of pressure. To that end, I was very pleased that the competition was conducted in a competitive yet friendly manner. Once again, I thank the schools for their support and the competitors for their efforts on the day.
