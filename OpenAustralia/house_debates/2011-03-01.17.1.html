        My question is to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to his statement on 12 August last year, just nine days before the election, when he was asked on
        <i>
         The
        </i>
        <i>
         7.30 Report
        </i>
        :
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        … are you going to rule out a carbon tax in the next term of the Government - yes or no?
       </p>
       <p>
        to which he replied:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We have made our position very clear. We have ruled it out.
       </p>
       <p>
        Treasurer, why should the Australian people ever believe anything you say again?

         I thank the shadow Treasurer for asking me the same question he asked me before and the answer is, of course, the same. We have been committed to an emissions trading system for many years. The shadow Treasurer was committed to an emissions trading system until about a year or a year and a half ago when he changed his mind, proving yet again that he has no principles whatsoever. We are committed to an emissions trading scheme. We have announced a scheme with a fixed price moving to a floating price. That is what we have done. We said all the way through the election campaign we were determined to price carbon.

          Mr Speaker, a point of order on relevance: the Treasurer ruled out a carbon tax before the election; now he wants to introduce one.

            I was drawing a very clear contrast with our policy and that of the now opposition. The now opposition have a plan to tax families and to hand all of that money to polluters. That is what they are proposing to do—$10 billion worth of so-called direct action initiatives, we are told, which are going to be paid for by the Australian people and handed to the polluters. We, in contrast to them, will charge polluters and provide assistance to households and industry. You could not get a clearer contrast between both those approaches. Our approach is strongly supported by many others opposite, as I was saying before. I will quote the member for Wentworth, again from 8 February 2010:
           </p>
           <p class="italic">
            Having the government pick projects for subsidy is a recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale, and there will always be a temptation for projects to be selected for their political appeal.
