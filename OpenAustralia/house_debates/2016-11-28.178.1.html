        I was unable to speak on the private member's bill in the House this morning due to some competing commitments, but I want to put on record my support for World

        Day, which is on 1 December. This important day provides an opportunity to raise awareness for those who are suffering from this disease as well as those who tragically have lost their lives to it in the decades since the disease emerged both here in Australia and around the world.

         World AIDS Day

        is a time for considering on one hand the significant achievement in tackling the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HIV" rel="nofollow">
         HIV
        </a>
        epidemic around the world through unprecedented global efforts, through education and awareness and through improvements in prevention and, especially, treatment.
       </p>
       <p>
        At the same time, we must take stock of the challenges that still confront us. Of course, HIV still exists in Australia, with about 1,000 new diagnoses a year still being made on average. Obviously, there is not yet a cure or a vaccine. Despite many promising breakthroughs in both treatment and prevention, tens of thousands of Australians still have to manage their chronic conditions on a day-to-day basis. And behind such statistics are individual people, human lives and personal stories. It is worth noting in particular the challenges facing some of our neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region. We must keep up the fight and we must do more. I want to pay tribute to the Queensland AIDS Council and all the local community groups, health groups and practitioners in Brisbane and around Australia whose efforts continue to do so much.
