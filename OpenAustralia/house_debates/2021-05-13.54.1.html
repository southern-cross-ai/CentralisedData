       <p>
        Recently in my community of Longman we lost a true legend. I'd like to take the time today to pay tribute to a man who not only was a loving husband, father, grandfather and great-grandfather but went above and beyond for the people of Queensland. His outstanding achievements and lifelong service will be forever remembered by many.

        It's clear that Reverend Allan Charles Male touched the hearts of many people in our Queensland community. When I posted a tribute to the reverend on my Facebook page there were plenty of wonderful comments from people sharing great stories about him. This speaks volumes about the kind of man he was and how deeply he will be missed by his family, his friends and the Queensland community. He was a husband of 62 years to Kathleen, a father to his four children and had 14 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren. Some of his many achievements include being Queensland father of the year; a member of the Order of Australia; a member of the Order of the

        , and a Rotary Paul Harris Fellow. He received a Rotary International Presidential Citation. Allan was also an author and a former Director-General of Families, Youth and Community Care. He founded the Shaftesbury Citizenship Campus at Burpengary East, which is now Arethusa College, which is legendary in our community for the lives of the young people it has changed for the better. Thank you for your life of service Allan. Your devotion, achievements and passion will never be forgotten by your family, your friends or the Queensland community.
