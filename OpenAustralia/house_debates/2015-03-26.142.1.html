        I rise today to pay tribute to the students and staff at my old school, St. Mary's
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathedral_College" rel="nofollow">

        , in Sydney. On the first day of the new school year, his fellow students learned that Jacques Pacifique had had a relapse of the leukaemia that had been in remission for five years. His fellow students decided, in a great spirit, to show solidarity with their mate. They went to their teachers and decided collectively to engage in the World's Greatest Shave. Sixty-five year 12 students shaved their heads and five teachers did the same. They have raised $50,000 so far for the

        They got a lot of support from the community. The Bulldogs—the great supporters of

        and they assisted in shaving these young student's heads. The wellbeing master, Daniel Khoury, deserves congratulations for overseeing this process. It is such a heartening sign to see such school spirit at my old school. I wish Jacques all the best for his health and with what he is going through. His fellow students are in contact with him in between his treatments. On behalf of everyone in the parliament, I say best wishes to Jacques and well done to all of his mates.
