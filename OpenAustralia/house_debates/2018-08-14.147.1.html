        As always, it is a great pleasure to be able to get up in this debate and talk about the issues that affect the Goldstein community. But it's also an opportunity to pay honour to those who serve in our community and who have made a wonderful contribution to our community, to our state and ultimately to our nation. While it is now some time passed, it is important to acknowledge those wonderful citizens who had cause for celebration on the

          Her Majesty
         </a>
         from electorate offices across the country. Of course, there are people who were excited about the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen's_Birthday" rel="nofollow">
          Queen's Birthday
         </a>
         in 2018 because they were part of the honours program and were recognised for their incredible community service. In Goldstein, with a community of people who care and who come together and support each other, there were plenty of recipients of awards for their contribution to their community. They deserve their full acknowledgment, and I want to congratulate them.
        </p>
        <p>
         They included Mrs Kathryn Harby-Williams from
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brighton_East" rel="nofollow">
          Brighton East
         </a>
         , who was recognised for her significant service to netball as a player, national captain, coach, commentator, board member and players' advocate. One of the things we are very proud of in our Goldstein community is the number not just of opportunities for women to play sport but, particularly, of our incredible netball teams, for which we need more investment in local support and facilities. Mrs Sara (Shirley) Glance from Brighton was recognised for her service to the community, including as co-chair of the Bayside Polio Support Group for 10 years and president of the

        </p>
        <p>
         Another thing we are very proud of in our Goldstein community is the incredible contribution of Jewish communities. Goldstein is the electorate with the third-largest Jewish community in the nation. To my good friend Ian Robert Mence from Brighton my congratulations on the recognition of his service to the Brighton community, including as a former president of that stoic organisation the

Ian, we say thank you so much for everything you do and congratulations on your Queen's Birthday honour.

         The member for Indi shows affection. And Tim was very cute. I went and visited him at Bev's home in Black Rock before he was released, and he seemed to be on the way to rehabilitation. I'm very proud to say that Bev has since not just rehabilitated Tim but also let him loose on the world, and hopefully he will have a very successful and happy life hereafter.

         That's what we have in the Goldstein community: innovators, community contributors, people who make an incredible contribution to this community, to our state and to our nation. We are so proud of every single one of them, as well as those who continue to do work, volunteer based, without any expectation of thanks in return. So today is our day to turn around to you and say thank you for everything you have done, and we are very proud of the contribution you are making to our community.
