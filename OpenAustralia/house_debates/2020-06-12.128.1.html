        I'd like to take this opportunity to share with the House an update on a major infrastructure project in my electorate of Bonner: the Brisbane Metro. The Brisbane Metro is going to be a massive game changer for commuters, from university students to high schoolers to city workers. The new public transport system wouldn't have been possible without the $300 million funding from the Morrison government. The $944 million metro project will create 165 direct jobs during construction and 185 jobs once completed, something our region will greatly benefit from as we recover from the economic impact of the coronavirus epidemic.
       </p>
       <p>
        With the new depot to be built at Rochedale and four stops in Bonner, this forward-planning project to be delivered by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_City_Council" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        will get residents home sooner and safer, with more travel options and less congestion on our major roads. In fact, one of the great features of the new metro is doing away with timetables. Forget the timetable! If you miss the metro, there's another one just three minutes away, ready to take you into the

        also congratulate Councillor Ryan Murphy, who is now chair of public and active transport and has taken over the response ability for the Brisbane Metro project. Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to visit the depot site on Schools Road at Rochedale with Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner. The depot will house the new fleet of 60 high-capacity metro vehicles. I'm very pleased to share with the House that world-leading vehicle manufacturer

        So what makes the Brisbane Metro vehicles so unique? The metro vehicles will be an Australian first, using tried-and-tested European technology to help futureproof the city's public transport network. Each vehicle will have zero tailpipe emissions and be battery electric, with state-of-the-art flash-charging infrastructure. This means that, after completing a run, each vehicle will be able to be fully charged in under six minutes. Each vehicle will have the capacity to carry up to 150 passengers with a high level of accessibility, wi-fi and

        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holland_Park" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        â€”this not only is a win for commuters with reduced travel times but will help us bust congestion on the region's busy roads. I'm so pleased to be part of the government that jumped at the opportunity to fund this vital public transport infrastructure, and I acknowledge my good friend the member for Brisbane.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/He_and_I" rel="nofollow">
         He and I

        worked tirelessly to make sure that the Morrison government was able to fund that $300 million that was part of the Brisbane Metro.

        With construction of the depot now underway, stage 1 will begin construction next year. Once completed, the Brisbane Metro will provide a 21-kilometre service, connecting 18 stations along dedicated busways. For those who travel into the city for concerts and footy games, this will provide a fast, reliable and environmentally friendly way to get to and from your event. The Brisbane Metro vehicle will also offer close to silent operation and provide a smooth, comfortable journey for passengers. From

        </a>
        , the Brisbane Metro will deliver the public transport our city has been crying out for, taking cars off our roads and connecting communities. Public transport is a vital part of building a 21st century capital city. In my electorate of Bonner, families, students and workers will be connected to the Brisbane Metro at four stops, and this is a great win for the electorate of Bonner.
