        Last Friday, the Bendigo Youth Choir celebrated its 30th year. It celebrated in typical Bendigo Youth Choir style by hosting a concept at the Bendigo Capitol Theatre. In attendance were many of the former members of the choir, who joined the current choir on stage to sing a number of songs.

        Thirty years ago, Valerie Broad
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        had a dream to form a youth choir. Anyone who knows Valerie knows that once she has a dream, once she has a goal do not get in her way; she will achieve it. Over the 30 years she has delivered for Bendigo and for these young people a remarkable opportunity and a remarkable experience. But Valerie, in her comments on the night, reflected on the students, the young people who have been able to be involved in the choir. She said that looking back what she loved were seeing how the kids developed. She loved bringing together young people and musicâ€”two of her great passions. She has seen young people grow up, and she has seen them go on to wonderful things. She hopes that, in the 30 years to come, more and more young people will have this opportunity. The rest of Bendigo knows how wonderful this choir is. It hopes to bring its talents to this House next year to entertain us all in the gallery.
