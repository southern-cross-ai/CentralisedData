         <p>
          I state from the outset that this petition is a matter of utmost importance and requires the immediate attention of the minister. This petition draws to the attention of the House the callous cancellation of mobile breast-screening units, by the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NSW" rel="nofollow">
           NSW
          </a>
          Labor government, in Richmond and Springwood in the electorate of Macquarie.
         </p>
         <p>
          The principal petitioner is Coral Cleary of
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitt_Town" rel="nofollow">
           Pitt Town
          </a>
          , who resides in the electorate. I take this opportunity as a woman, mother and wife, to thank Coral and the 2,661 signatories who took the time to put pen to paper and raise awareness of this appalling decision to remove access to critical health services. One in nine
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">

          </a>
          women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in their lifetime. Many of us know someone who has been touched by breast cancer. It is so important to make access to services such as breast-screening easier rather than harder.
         </p>
         <p>
          Mobile services in places like Springwood and Richmond have been replaced by screening units set up in select Myer department stores, with the closest being Parramatta, Blacktown, Penrith and Lithgow. While this option may be helpful to people who can travel greater distances, it is not helpful for many older women, women with health and/or disability issues, and women who simply cannot afford the cost of the trip. With rising costs of living in groceries, utilities and fuel, many more women will be denied the opportunity to have a regular breast check.
         </p>
         <p>
          I am gravely concerned that access to such a vital service has been removed instead of increased, and that regional and semi-regional residents are missing out on equitable access yet again. And why were these vital important services cancelled by the Labor government? It was a cost-cutting measure. The cost of fitting out the breast-screening unit was too much so now residents are forced to drive long distances to neighbouring cities to be checked.
         </p>
         <p>
          Apparently the Labor government in New South Wales does not think women’s health is a priority. This is a ridiculous and dangerous decision when you consider that breast cancer is the second most common cause of cancer related deaths in Australian women. With the cost of living rising due to Labor’s reckless spending there is the real potential that some women will not have themselves checked.
         </p>
         <p>
          It is vital that mobile services be reinstated to Richmond in the Hawkesbury, and Springwood in the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_Mountains" rel="nofollow">
           Blue Mountains
          </a>
          , along with the rest of greater New South Wales. This will ensure women in our local communities will have easy and equitable access to screening now and into the future. Mr Speaker and members of the House, I present the petition and call on the minister to actively support the return of mobile breast-screening services to the Hawkesbury and Blue Mountains and to the rural, semi-rural and outer urban areas of New South Wales. This is a priority.
