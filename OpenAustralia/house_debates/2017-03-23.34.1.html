        is in a completely unacceptable condition and has been for a number of years. The lagoon, which was previously enjoyed by locals, is now a marshy wasteland. It is completely unacceptable and it needs to be fixed. What we have done is we have secured a $300,000 grant from the federal government to provide for the weir through which the water runs to the lagoon to be fixed. What that is going to mean is that the water will once again flow into the lagoon, and that will deal with the very bad environmental issue that we have there at the moment. We also going to be sending a

        team there for six months this year to get rid of all of the weeds, marsh and all that material that should not be in the lagoon. It is going to go. It should have gone years ago, but it will go this year.

        Today I met with John and Ashley from Skillset Environment, who are the main contractors on the upcoming Green Army project. It was great to see them and talk through the detail of this project. For Panania, for Picnic Point and for the surrounding community, we need to restore Yeramba Lagoon to what it used to be, which is a lagoon, from what it is now, which is a mess. That is what will be occurring this year.
