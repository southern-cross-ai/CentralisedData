       <p>
        Thank you Deputy Speaker Scott—and to his relative, the member for Hasluck.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was delighted to be asked to represent the Minister for Education recently to open the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland" rel="nofollow">
         University of Queensland
        </a>
        's Advanced Engineering Building. The innovative research to be undertaken there will boost three of Australia's most important industries—mining, construction and manufacturing. Supporting ground-breaking education in engineering will ensure that Australia remains globally competitive for generations to come.
       </p>
       <p>
        This state-of-the-art building will enable teaching and research that is crucial for Australia's future. I believe the Advanced Engineering Building has the potential to rapidly improve productivity in industries that are not only important to Queensland but also to our nation. It is an example of outstanding, innovative and sustainable engineering. The university should be proud of the 5 star green rating achieved through the building design. It is no surprise the building has won several Australian Institute of Architects' Queensland Awards. Congratulations to everyone involved.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the member for Ryan I am incredibly proud that the University of Queensland is one of the leading universities in the world. I have no doubt that the teaching and research delivered by the Advanced Engineering Building will produce many outstanding graduates in the years to come and I look forward to hearing about their many successes.
