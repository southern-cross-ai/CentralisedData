        In my electorate of Page there are a significant number of people who are referred to as forgotten Australians and lost innocents. I have been privileged to get to know some and become friends with them. I have supported their calls for an apology and forms of other redress covering reparation, compensation and a whole range of things. I know that some states have given apologies. I know that some forgotten Australians and lost innocents though want a formal apology and acknowledgement from the Australian national government. I have been supporting for some time the locals in my area who have been advocating for this—notably, Nicholas Kostyn, Deborah Lowe and

        </a>
        . I name them as they have been very public about this. They recently attended a morning tea I hosted on 16 July for forgotten Australians to hopefully raise more awareness in the community and make some who feel forgotten feel included.
       </p>
       <p>
        A man turned up at my office before the event because he saw it in a local newspaper. He was actually reading it when he accompanied his wife to an appointment. He came in and saw me. I encouraged him to come to the morning tea, and he did with his wife. It was the first time he had talked about the issue. He left behind a book for me to read. I have started to flick through it—I cannot quite face it yet because of some of the stories I know that are in there. I promised him that I would read it, and I will. All of us in this place have heard many stories about physical and psychological abuse. Reading some of the things that people have gone through sounds like torture.
       </p>
       <p>
        Nicholas Kostyn in my area has been very active in trying to establish a place for forgotten Australians to go locally. I have been supporting him and will continue to do so. I have approached the Australian government and the minister. I hope the state will pick up this responsibility as well. A lot of the people are left with poorer health and educational outcomes. They are poorer in general. It is not everyone, but statistically we know that there are a lot. They require support beyond what the general system gives.

        After the Prime Minister visited my electorate one person

        ed me: ‘Janelle, does the Prime Minister know about us?’ I said: ‘Of course the Prime Minister knows about you, as does everybody in this place. People do care.’ I said to him that something will happen. He asked whether I had advanced notice. I said: ‘No, I did not. I just sensed it.’ I was really pleased when I heard Minister Jenny Macklin on 30 August announce that by year’s end we would have a formal acknowledgement and apology.
