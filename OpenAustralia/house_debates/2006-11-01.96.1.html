       <p>
        I rise today to speak about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flinders_Medical_Centre" rel="nofollow">
         Flinders Medical Centre
        </a>
        and its proposal for a centre for innovation in cancer. The Flinders Medical Centre is an important institution in Adelaideâ€™s southern suburbs. It is a 500-bed teaching hospital, which has 3,500 staff and also 500 volunteers, making this the largest volunteer group of any hospital in Adelaide. It has expertise in a range of cancers and is world renowned for its work in leukaemia, bowel cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer and oesophageal cancer.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Flinders Medical Centre proposes to establish a centre for innovation in cancer care. This would be a centre which groups together clinicians and researchers and which would focus on being a centre of excellence in the prevention of cancer through approaches such as population screening, in which it has particular expertise. Australia does not have a cancer centre of this sort, although there are some cancer centres in the United States which adopt this approach. This would be a great facility for residents of the southern suburbs. As a public hospital doctor, a former surgical registrar, I know that when a hospital has a good research function and the clinicians are involved in research you do see excellence in care. This would be a good thing for my constituents.
       </p>
       <p>
        This proposal for a centre is expected to cost over $20 million. It is a very important priority for my constituents, and I will be working to see that the federal government makes a contribution to the Flinders cancer centre so that we can have this fantastic facility for the southern suburbs. In my electorate of Boothby we have a very high proportion of people over 65. It is an elderly population and, as a consequence, there is a prevalence of cancer. This would be a tremendous facility to add to what is already an outstanding public hospital.
