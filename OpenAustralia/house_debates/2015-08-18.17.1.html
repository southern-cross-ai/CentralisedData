       <p>
        This government's cuts to health and hospitals across the nation have been devastating, especially in regional and rural areas. We have seen cuts to hospital funding and dental care—and we have seen many versions of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
         GP
        </a>
        tax. In regional areas, locals blame the National Party for these harsh cuts and hold them responsible.
       </p>
       <p>
        When we look at hospitals, we see that this government has ripped up Labor's hospital funding agreements with the states. They are ripping more than $57 billion in funding from our public hospitals. What this means for the hospitals is an increase in emergency department waiting times and an increase in elective surgery waiting times, and it will reduce the number of hospital beds across the country. This will be even more devastating in regional areas.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have seen so many different versions of the GP tax. This government is cutting $2 billion from Medicare over the next four years in its latest attempt to introduce a GP tax. These cuts will see bulk-billing rates plummet and will mean increases in out-of-pocket costs for millions of patients. That is the reality. An article published in the
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Journal_of_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Medical Journal of Australia
         </a>
        </i>
        estimated that these cuts would see concessional patients who had previously been bulk-billed face new costs of at least $8.43 per visit—a huge increase that most people will not be able to afford.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have also seen some really savage cuts to dental care. Across two budgets this government has now ripped around half a billion dollars from programs designed to care for the dental health of some of Australia's most vulnerable patients. Shame on this government, which has made massive cuts to health and hospitals.

         Earlier this year I was very proud to announce the rollout of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBN" rel="nofollow">
          NBN
         </a>
         in

         and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narre_Warren_South" rel="nofollow">
          Narre Warren South
         </a>
         in June 2016. This has come after already having Narre Warren South on the planned rollout maps, only to have it ripped away from the community by the then Labor government. Furthermore, at the Timbarra community cabinet held by the Labor government in 2012, the then communications minister,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Conroy" rel="nofollow">
          Stephen Conroy
         </a>
         , when specifically asked about the NBN rollout in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Trobe" rel="nofollow">
          La Trobe
         </a>
         , responded that it was not even on the radar. By delivering NBN in La Trobe, the Liberal government has not only delivered what the Labor government could not; obviously, it will be delivered years earlier than Labor could have ever imagined.
        </p>
        <p>
         Special thanks go to

          This government's attacks on Medicare are starting to be felt in regional Australia, particularly in regional Victoria. To highlight the struggles that the small regional town of Hamilton in the electorate of Wannon is facing, I will read something that has been texted through to me. Hamilton Medical Group just posted this:
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          In view of the Government freezing of the Medicare rebate, in order to sustain a medical service and attract doctors to come and work in Hamilton, the Hamilton Medical Group will be changing its billing policy.
         </p>
         <p class="italic">
          From Monday, September 28, 2015 full payment will be required for all consultations on the day of service.
         </p>
         <p>
          This is how this government is breaking Medicare. This is how this government is smashing bulk-billing. It is a backdoor way to freeze the rebate to force local medical services to increase their fees. For people in Hamilton, like people in Bendigo, where other practices have been forced to do this, it means that, before they can get support, before they can get to see a doctor, they have to have the money in the bank. Another example in my own electorate relates to psychology services. Patients have been asked to have $165 up-front in their bank account before they can see somebody. Of course, this will be reimbursed, but they have to have the money up-front. They will be out of pocket by $40. These are the attacks of this government.
