        My question is to the Prime Minister. Will the Prime Minister advise the House of the government’s response to yesterday’s attack by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea" rel="nofollow">

         I thank the member for Banks for his question. I have had the opportunity to make some remarks publicly about this matter but believe it is appropriate to also make some remarks in this parliament. The government is deeply concerned by yesterday’s artillery attack on the Republic of Korea, a country we consider to be a very close partner and friend in our region. As members will be aware, yesterday two
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Korean" rel="nofollow">
          South Korean
         </a>
         soldiers were killed as a result of the shelling by
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korea" rel="nofollow">
          North Korea
         </a>
         of South Korean territory, and a number of military personnel and civilians were injured. The government condemns this act of provocation, an act which breaches all international norms and obligations and is in violation of the 1953 agreement. The government also offers its condolences on behalf of the Australian people to the people and the nation of the Republic of Korea for the loss of life and injuries that they have sustained.
        </p>
        <p>
         Yesterday’s events follow the March attack by a
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Korean" rel="nofollow">
          North Korean
         </a>
         submarine on a South Korean navy vessel. We should remind ourselves that 46
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Koreans" rel="nofollow">
          South Koreans
         </a>
         lost their lives in that attack. This also follows recent reports that North Korea is developing a sophisticated uranium enrichment program, in complete defiance of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UN" rel="nofollow">
          UN
         </a>
         Security Council resolutions. This series of events is deeply troubling. It threatens stability on the Korean peninsula and in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Asia" rel="nofollow">
          North Asia
         </a>
         , and in the face of these provocations it should be noted by this parliament that the Republic of Korea has acted responsibly and in a restrained way. We commend
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_Lee" rel="nofollow">
          President Lee
         </a>
         for his calm and capable leadership. But this is a tense situation. Both sides are heavily armed. Of course, there is a real risk that a miscalculation could arise and lead to further actions or that there could be an escalation, and the consequences of either a miscalculation or such escalation could be enormous. As a nation deeply engaged economically, politically and strategically in North Asia, Australia has much at stake in these events. The government calls on North Korea to abide by international norms of behaviour and to cease its hostile acts. We call on North Korea to abide by its 1953 agreement.
        </p>
        <p>
         The government is, of course, monitoring these events closely. Members of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Security_Committee" rel="nofollow">
          National Security Committee
         </a>
         of cabinet met this morning and considered latest developments, including our engagement with international partners. We are in close consultation with our South Korean friends, Japanese friends and of course with the United States of America. We also believe it is important that China use its influence, bring its influence to bear, on North Korea in the wake of these events. The United Nations Secretary-General has described yesterday’s events as ‘one of the gravest incidents on the Korean peninsula since the end of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_War" rel="nofollow">
          Korean War
         </a>
         ’, and so all nations must stand in condemnation of North Korea’s aggression and urge it to cease hostile acts.
