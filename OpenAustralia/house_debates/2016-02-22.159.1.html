        The local government authorities in my region have united to engage with the federal government to advance key infrastructure projects, economic development initiatives and strategic cooperation opportunities. A delegation from the cities of Joondalup, Wanneroo and Stirling has travelled to Canberra this week as part of the Tri-Cities Alliance. The joint local government delegation will deliver a presentation and meet with government ministers, as well as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        n members and senators, for the purpose of lobbying the federal government to provide funding to support local infrastructure, community facilities and economic development projects. I welcome Mayors Troy Pickard, Tracey Roberts and Giovanni Italiano, together with Chief Executive Officers Garry Hunt, Daniel Simms and Stuart Jardine.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Tri-Cities Alliance is a proactive initiative which raises the profile of our region and makes a greater impression with federal decision makers. Delegations of local governments to Canberra at a regional level are becoming an effective method of strategically positioning regions within a national context. This is particularly relevant as the three cities combined represent an estimated population of 570,000 residents currently, growing to a projected population of 750,000 residents by 2031.
       </p>
       <p>
        The rapidly growing north metropolitan region is of major strategic importance to my home state of Western Australia. Governments at all levels must work cooperatively to provide the essential infrastructure needed to provide a high level of service delivery, including in health, education, economic development, telecommunications, roads, public transport and other community services.

Investment in better road infrastructure will be of benefit to residents living in my electorate through less traffic congestion, improved road safety and access to local employment opportunities that minimise commuting time. Local economic development will also be promoted by providing efficient transport logistics to facilitate heavy vehicle movements and freight deliveries. The

        Local government plays an important role in delivering services and facilities for our local community. I am pleased to have served as a councillor for 14 years and appreciate the synergy of having close relationships between all levels of government.
