       <p class="italic">
        That this House notes:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) that the arts and cultural sector provides benefits far beyond the arts community itself;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) that cultural activities make a tangible and valuable contribution to policy objectives in areas such as health, mental health, social cohesion, regional development, tourism, foreign affairs, disability support, skills development, education, environmental stewardship and issues affecting First Nations Australians;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) that the new National Cultural Policy, 'Revive', takes a whole of government approach that emphasises the potential of the arts to serve public policy objectives across a range of portfolios and advances a cross-portfolio commitment to creative endeavour;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) that the Government recognises the centrality of the arts to our national identity, community life and individual wellbeing; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) Revive will provide new investment and new vision for the cultural sector, to begin repairing the damage caused by a decade of neglect of the arts by the previous Government.

       <p class="italic">
        (1) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the Government has no plan to ensure replacement energy generation is built on time to replace the 20 gigawatt of baseload energy slated to withdraw from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Electricity_Market" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        ) by 2035, causing energy to become more expensive and less reliable;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) despite promising Australians it would reduce household electricity costs by $275 the Government has created energy chaos and has delivered consecutive price hikes including further increases of up to 33 per cent due from 1 July 2023;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) the closure of

         Liddell Power Station
        </a>
        marks the start of a turbulent new era in Australia's energy market with 20 gigawatts of base load energy capacity (80 per cent of total baseload energy) to withdraw from the NEM by 2035;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) the Snowy 2.0 'mega battery' was commissioned by the former Government to support an orderly transition of the NEM, which is now under threat due to the current Government;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) the further delays to Snowy 2.0 will place further pressure on Australia's electricity market in coming years with 7.5 gigawats of baseload energy exiting the grid, before the 2 gigawatt Snowy 2.0 project is fully operational, from power stations including Liddell, Eraring, Yalloum and Vale Point B;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) the former Government actioned a comprehensive plan to enable a smooth powering down of the 2 gigawatt Liddell Power Station by extending its life, overseeing record investment in renewables and commissioning the 660 megawatt

        (g) since the Government came to office, there have been reports of massive blow-outs in both cost and the delivery timeframe for both the Snowy 2.0 and Kurri Kurri projects;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (h) the Government's uncommercial green hydrogen plan for Kurri Kurri has resulted in the project being delayed by at least a full year and has more than doubled the project's total cost; and

       <p class="italic">

        5 MR HILL: To move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) notes that the development and implementation of artificial intelligence (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI" rel="nofollow">
         AI
        </a>
        ) is rapidly accelerating globally and in Australia;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) acknowledges that while there is much uncertainty surrounding both the development and adoption of AI technologies, and that 'AI' is a term used to describe a variety of techniques and applications, what is clear is that these technologies will transform human society, how we experience our lives and how we understand reality;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) recognises that harnessing the benefits of AI presents enormous opportunities for Australia, including:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the potential for AI to boost productivity and revolutionise many industries;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the capacity to transform our economy with advances in every conceivable field of human endeavour;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) new employment opportunities through human-centered AI;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) improving health, wealth and equality outcomes for all Australians including through improved government service delivery; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) enhancements to environmental sustainability through better-informed decision making and accelerated scientific discovery;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) further notes that in order to safely harness these benefits, Australia must also act to mitigate the profound risks posed by AI, including:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) immediate and tangible threats to job security and industrial relations;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the risk that AI could perpetuate or amplify existing biases and discrimination;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) the risk that AI could perpetuate or enable new forms of disinformation and misinformation;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) social and democratic harm through the use of AI in cyber attacks and large-scale disinformation campaigns;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) further digital marginalisation and inequality; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) the threat of social disruption and national security risks;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) recognises that notwithstanding positive efforts underway to address matters related to AIâ€”including responsible AI standards and policyâ€”Australia has broader capability and governance gaps and needs to ensure that regulatory oversight of AI development and adoption in Australia is fit for purpose;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (6) affirms that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) AI is one of the most transformational technologies of the 21st century, on par with the industrial revolution;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the level of risk posed by unchecked AI, and the scope of policy development needed to curtail this risk, warrants urgent attention;
