        As we adjourn today at the end of this sitting week, I am going to be flying home to see my family. I cannot wait to see them. This week, I think all of our thoughts have been very much with the people of Manchester in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UK" rel="nofollow">
         UK
        </a>
        and all those impacted by the horrific attack there earlier this week. It was also great to see this chamber so united. Obviously we have differences of opinion when it comes to policy. I think it is fair to say we have different values and different priorities, but we have talked about them a lot this week. What we have in common, what unites us, we saw in this chamber this week—that is, a love of freedom and a want to make sure that our country is safe and secure. We reach out a hand of friendship to those around the world, like the families of the police officers in Indonesia who tonight do not have dad at home. I want to place on the record my condolences with those families. I noticed on Twitter there was the hashtag 'Kami Tidak Takut'. It means, 'We are not afraid.' I think that is a powerful message to see going around Indonesia and the world.

        Of course, Australia is not immune from these heinous crimes, as we have been reminded this week. We were reminded of the important work carried out by our security and intelligence agencies, our military, our police and our emergency services to secure our country and our communities. We were also reminded of the danger of that work and of the effect that work can sometimes have on the brave men and women of our security and military forces. I was very happy to support a couple of initiatives in recent weeks. One was Walk off the

        and the others who got the fire brigade and the military walking 20 kilometres with 20 kilograms in their packs to raise money for

        I also want to quickly acknowledge an ex-army engineer called Kirby Stocks. In the next couple of hours, Kirby is going to start walking from

I have asked him to have a breather when he gets tired—we want him to make sure he gets to Katherine safely. But he is really determined to raise some funds to help out other people who have gone through and are still battling
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PTSD" rel="nofollow">

        like he did. My thoughts are with him. He is an inspiring individual and, if you get on everydayhero, search for Kirby Stocks and think of him over the next three or so days as he walks down the

        This week I had the immense pleasure to meet some other inspiring Territorians who are part of the National Indigenous Youth Parliament program. They are another great reminder for us of what we are about in this House—of our responsibilities, representing our electorates and fighting for the best future we can achieve. During this week of attacks and much sorrow, these young leaders reminded us of the good that we need to keep recommitting ourselves to for the good of our electorates that we represent and for the good of our nation. They are talented young people. It was great to see them here in the House this week. I wish everyone a safe return home.
