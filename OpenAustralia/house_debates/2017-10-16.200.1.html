        On Saturday there was a very important function at Leongatha, which I will talk about another time when I have more time. But at that function was the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Gippsland" rel="nofollow">
         South Gippsland
        </a>
        Shire Brass Band. They were such an integral part of the day that I thought, 'Gee, if you want to look back 100 years, you'd only have to go to the activity statement of the brass band, who were there at every important function that was held in the community through all those years.' I realise there's one at Wonthaggi, one at Pakenham, based around the Cardinia Shire, and one at Warragul and South Gippsland. I have a particular affinity with the bands, because my great-grandfather was the leader of the Bairnsdale brass band. This family connection led me to think, at a really important function the other day, that the brass band was central to the whole celebration.

        Right across our electorates and across Australia, there is a history of these brass bands going back 100 and more years, and they have been consistent all the way through. I just want to pay tribute to those who are in bands today and their forefathers and mentors who have been in the bands before them. Especially I want to pay tribute to all the young children who have been able to enter into the world of music through their local brass band. I am watching that happening in South Gippsland, and congratulations to every one of you. We praise you for what you do.
