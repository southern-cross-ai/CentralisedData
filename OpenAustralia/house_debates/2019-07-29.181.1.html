        . It was a pleasure to join them on Saturday night, 27 July 2019, to acknowledge and celebrate this significant milestone, which is significant in particular for a community group that relies on dedicated and longstanding volunteers. I've never been a Guide, obviously, but I have been a Scout and I know that the Guides are teaching strong, resilient and resourceful women of the future.

        I want to acknowledge in particular a few of these wonderful volunteers as we did on Saturday night. Donna Milgate has 35 years worth of service. She is a leader of 1st Brownie guides and often volunteers for extra activities. Robyn West has been a volunteer for 40 years and continues as leader of the 1st Brownie guides. Sandra Voll has been a volunteer for 40 years. She is a leader of the 2nd Brownie guides and attended the Trailblazers stay camp to assist those staff. Faye Lawson has been a volunteer for 45 years and, in addition to her consistent leadership of 1st Brownies, has been a district leader for 20 years as well. And Katrina Arnold has been a volunteer for 55 years. What an achievement. Katrina is the leader of the 2nd Brownie Guides and continues to support the district more widely. Thank you very much to Elizabeth Wheeley, the district manager, and congratulations again to the Walton Bridge/The Gap Guides. I wish them 60 years more of success.
