       <p>
        I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Bethesda Lutheran Church in Beenleigh on celebrating, over the weekend, the 150th anniversary of the first Lutheran divine service in the Beenleigh district, led by Pastor Hausmann. The milestone was celebrated at a service last Sunday, and I was honoured to attend this special occasion. The service was attended by many from our local community and included the lighting of a unity candle to mark special events by the Lutheran church right around Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Bethesda Lutheran Church in Beenleigh has a proud history. Originally, it was actually three separate churches that eventually formed the one church. Today it provides a number of services to our community, including youth Sunday school, home Bible study groups, a women's fellowship and, most importantly, pastoral care for our community. Many in our community have been supported and assisted by those involved with the church over the last 150 years.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would like to thank all concerned for the time and effort they put into working with our local community to help make it what it is today. I celebrate their proud history and I wish them all the best for the next 150 years and, hopefully, longer.
       </p>
