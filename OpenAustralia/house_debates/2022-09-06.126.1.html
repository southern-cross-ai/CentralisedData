        The Aboriginal Cultural Centre in Western Australia is slowly becoming a reality—something that we've built in the heart of Perth. It's been discussed for decades. It was a vision that many governments have had. I'm pleased that it is now being delivered upon. The Albanese government has committed $52 million to make this project a reality, partnering with the state government, who are delivering $50 million. We're working to share the oldest stories on Earth. The centre's design will be world-class. It will be a unique feature for the Perth electorate and a tourism asset for all Australians. Between Matagarup—known as

        The site's location was recently announced by me and the

        following considerable consultation. I want to thank the Whadjuk Cultural Authority representative group, who did the hard work consulting on the site that was chosen, the

        has become an annual charity extravaganza. The first was described as chaotic. 1968 had the chaos of the Perth Telethon. 1969 had the chaos of Woodstock. The chaos of the 1968 Telethon was the chaos of a studio opened to the public for the first time. It was the chaos of a live broadcast with children everywhere. It was the chaos that came when, for the first time, they were taking donations in decimal currency. But from that chaos came beauty. The Perth Telethon is now the highest-donating telethon per capita in the world, surpassing a mammoth $475 million in 2021 and supporting 97 charity beneficiaries. Each of these beneficiaries is dedicated to children's health and wellbeing.

I was recently able to say thank you to the team who make Telethon a reality. I extend those thanks to the leadership of Richard Goyder, Mr Kerry Stokes and the trustees of Telethon. Most importantly, I thank the people of Western Australia for their generous donations.
