         I thank the member for Casey for that question. I thank him and the members for Deakin, Aston and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Trobe" rel="nofollow">
          La Trobe
         </a>
         for the campaign they are running on the eastern side of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_West" rel="nofollow">
          East West
         </a>
         Link and I thank the member for Corangamite for the efforts that she continues to put in on the western side—which, in fairness to the Leader of the Opposition, was his preferred option when he put in not one but two submissions to the Sir
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rod_Eddington" rel="nofollow">
          Rod Eddington
         </a>
         inquiry at the end of the last decade.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Rod_Eddington" rel="nofollow">
          Sir Rod Eddington
         </a>
         said that doing nothing was not an option. Melbourne needs another east-west crossing. That was made clear in Sir Rod Eddington's report, which the Leader of the Opposition supported twice—once as a union boss and once as the member for a western seat in Melbourne.
        </p>
        <p>
         What has become clear since the Victorian election is that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Andrews" rel="nofollow">
          Daniel Andrews
         </a>
         , the Leader of the Victorian Labor government, will tear up the East West contract. In an effort to hold the Greens at bay in the inner suburbs of Melbourne, he has said he would tear it up. It was an attempt he was half successful at; he lost to the Greens two of the seats they were trying to keep and he held onto the other two.

           </i>
           's reporting, it has become very obvious that the Victorian government is now considering legislation to legislate away the rights of this consortium—a lawfully signed contract that they signed just before the Victorian election. The Victorian government is now talking about legislating that away, risking Australia's sovereign risk and Victoria's credit rating. Indeed, last week the international
           <i>
            Infrastructure Investor
           </i>
           magazine had on its front page: 'Can Australia be taken at its word?' These are the sorts of headlines we are now seeing internationally.

              They think it is funny. These people think it is hilarious that they are going to rip up contracts. Mr Dix said: 'The impact on the perception of Victoria and Australia's sovereign risk is significant. It would certainly result in the decreased access of Australia to foreign capital, increased interest charges, degraded sovereign risk profile, degraded credit rating and less local opportunities for investment.' This is a serious issue and the Leader of the Opposition must tell the Australian public whether he supports legislating away the rights of this consortium or not.
