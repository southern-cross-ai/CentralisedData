       <p>
        In my electorate of Robertson on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        , we've got 43 fantastic schools. I've had the opportunity to meet many of the students and teachers at those schools in my electorate as well as here in the parliament. I'm always so pleased to see the passion that our students have for our community as well as their interest in issues that affect our nation. Recently, I visited year 6 students at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Point_Christian_College" rel="nofollow">
         Green Point Christian College
        </a>
        ahead of their excursion to Canberra. They had quite a few insights, in terms of their questions, and they took the time to write me some passionate letters following my visit to tell me what matters to them and what they would do if they were Prime Minister for day. I'd like to take this opportunity to share some of the students' responses.
       </p>
       <p>
        Porscha Altivilla, Carol Solimon, Hamish Woodhouse, Jonah Clifford, Katinka Wood and Aiden D were all concerned about the state of roads in their local areas, including Davistown, Ettalong and Gosford. Tahlia Hirst wrote that she would like to see drivers stop speeding down the road on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield_Road" rel="nofollow">
         Greenfield Road
        </a>
        in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empire_Bay" rel="nofollow">
         Empire Bay
        </a>
        , a concern a lot of local residents share.
       </p>
       <p>
        Luke Read told me if he were Prime Minister for a day the first thing he would do would be to have a cup of coffee, which I have to say I can't argue with at all! Rex Allwood said that if he were Prime Minister for a day he'd get voted in for longer. Travis G said that as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PM" rel="nofollow">
         PM
        </a>
        he would talk to the Treasurer about how much money we can raise and give that to all the things we need to fix and all the people in need of help. Grace T would raise awareness about cystic fibrosis by starting a petition. Grace, I would certainly encourage you to do so.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sasha Riggs, Jett Wood, Matias T and Joshua Abbott were all concerned with littering and the amount of rubbish on our streets. Sienna Pearce explained that if she were Prime Minister she would make a law to ensure that everyone picks up their rubbish. Nate Townsend and Tristan Byrne were concerned with how rubbish was affecting our waterways and marine life, which is a key concern on the Central Coast.
       </p>
       <p>
        If Siena Brown were a member of parliament she would create a program for abandoned animals so that they could be adopted. Noah Todd would help increase the number of wild animals on the Central Coast.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hallie Kumar said if she could fix one thing in her suburb it would be to see cleaner beaches at Umina and Ettalong. Amelia C said if she were the member for Robertson she would make the beaches safer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Evie Myers and Ben P said if they were members of parliament they would build more playgrounds on the Central Coast. Owen Blair would upgrade the playground near his house because he and Joel Drennan said they'd love to see a skate park in Macmasters Beach. This is all about infrastructure for our young people on the Central Coast.
       </p>
       <p>
        Keelan Black said that as a member of parliament he would encourage more people to play sport and stay fit and healthy. Keelan said his plan would be to spend most of Australia's money on sport to help more people achieve their sporting dreams.
       </p>
       <p>
        Evelyn Rajasekar said the most important issue to her would be to create more jobs on the Central Coast. Noah Bootes said that if he were a member of parliament he would want more job opportunities so that people can get the job they want. Joshua Waghorn would invest more money in local news.
       </p>
       <p>
        Grace Crain said that if she were a member of parliament she would like to be the Speaker so she could excuse people during question time for being rude. Georgia Dehn said she wasn't sure being a politician was for her. She said she thinks it's a hard job. If Lucas Keogh were a member of parliament he would advocate for a soccer field in Copacabana and make a no homework bill.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Turner" rel="nofollow">
         Matt Turner
        </a>
        said the issue most important to him is how many people are becoming addicted to a video game called
        <i>
         Fortnite
        </i>
        , and he's concerned kids aren't doing homework because of it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Sasha Harding said if she were Prime Minister for a day she would make sure that more kids like her had more of a say because their opinions matter. Guess what, Sasha? You are absolutely right. Each and every voice matters. Thank you to each and every one of you for taking the time to share what matters to you, including

        , Sophie Chen, Anastasia and Joshua N. No matter how old you are or where you live on the Central Coast, your voice does matter and it will be heard in this parliament. With brilliant minds like the students from year 6 at Greenpoint Christian College, I've got no doubt that our region on the Central Coast has a very bright future ahead indeed. I'm sure that students from across my electorate will make an outstanding contribution to our community in whatever they choose to pursue both now and in the future.
