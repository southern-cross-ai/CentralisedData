       <p>
        On 17 November 2009 I attended the year 12 graduation ceremony of Wanneroo Senior High School held in Wangara. The ceremony was particularly good. The formalities commenced with an address by Principal Pauline White. I found her address and her advice to her graduates particularly practical. It was, without doubt, advice for a modern age. I commend Pauline White for her commitment to her students and her keen understanding of the practicalities of the modern age. This was embodied by her suggestion that students watch what they put on social networking sites as those sites are being checked by potential employers. As I said, that is very good advice for a modern age.
       </p>
       <p>
        Apart from the address by the principal we heard from Ms Holly Chinnery in the keynote address. Ms Chinnery is a graduate of Wanneroo Senior High School. She is also the holder of a PhD and a scientist. In a candid and encouraging speech Ms Chinnery spoke about her struggles to succeed and ultimately her success both at university and internationally as a scientist. This young woman, who has achieved at a very high level, provided the graduating class with an excellent example of the opportunities that await them. Clearly being a student from Wanneroo Senior High School is no limitation on the opportunity for a great future.
       </p>
       <p>
        While all the graduates have the strong opportunities provided to them by the staff at Wanneroo Senior High School—and I am sure they will maximise their futures based on those opportunities—I would like to mention some of the award winners on the night. In particular I mention the winner of the academic dux award: Troy Miles. Troy also won prizes for applicable mathematics, chemistry, physics, calculus and material design and technology for metals. He was also the winner of the Institute of Engineers Award. A worthy recipient of the academic dux award, clearly Troy Miles will be able to turn his talents to a variety of technical and other disciplines in the future. He will do well.
       </p>
       <p>
        I would also mention the vocational dux, John Musulin. John Musulin was also successful in winning the senior science prize and the building and construction prize. Clearly John Musulin will have a strong future in the trades. I would also mention the winner of the Luke Simpkins Award, Marie Wiegand, for her excellent conduct and study efforts. Marie was also the winner of the visual communications photography prize and the English as a second language certificate. I congratulate Marie Wiegand.
       </p>
       <p>
        I welcomed the opportunity to attend the Wanneroo Senior High School graduation ceremony because these school graduation ceremonies are very special events. I have been to many of these graduations and I am very pleased to attend, even if it means crossing the country and flying overnight as part of that commitment to the year 12s. The reason I like to go to school graduations and indeed spend time in schools with my democratic information and role-play initiatives is that I like to meet with and encourage young people and children—those who have such vast potential ahead of them. It was the case as well with Wanneroo senior high on their graduation night. I saw the realised potential of Ms Holly Chinnery and I see the future potential of the 2009 undergraduates of Wanneroo Senior High School, a potential waiting to be achieved for themselves and Australia.
