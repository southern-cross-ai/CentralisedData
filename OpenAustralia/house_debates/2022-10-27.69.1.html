        Cassius Turvey died this week in hospital in Perth at the age of 15 years. He had been violently attacked while walking home from school in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Swan" rel="nofollow">
         Middle Swan
        </a>
        on 13 October. The death of any child is a tragedy, and this terrible event leaves our community in shock. We are witnessing an outpouring of sadness and grief, and my heart goes out to Cassius's mother and family and his friends who are directly affected.
       </p>
       <p>
        As the matter is before the courts, it would not be appropriate to comment on the circumstances of his passingâ€”a young man who was surrounded by a family who loved him. He went to school, he had a lawnmowing round and he attended the basketball program run by Koya Aboriginal Corporation. At the age of 11 he was invited to give an acknowledgement of country at the WA parliament. He was connected to his community, and he was ready to take on the world. Cassius's mother, Michelle, describes him as a joyous son, full of respect. His friends describe him as the one they would look up to.
       </p>
       <p>
        I join with Minister Burney and my colleagues who stand with the Turvey family in their loss and pain. I will be attending the candlelight vigil for Cassius on Monday. Every child needs to be able to walk home safely from school.
