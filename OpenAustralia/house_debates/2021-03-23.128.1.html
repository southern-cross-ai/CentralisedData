        The greatest assets our nation has have never been our natural resources but are our people. The Australia Day Awards recognise the work and achievements of those who have served their community. It was a proud moment in the history of the northern beaches when awards were given to eight residents in the electorate of Mackellar. Recipients were from all walks of life. However, they all had one thing in common: they lived our Australian values, which put their community first. Frequently their work went unrecognised. Standing out amongst candidates throughout Australia,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Allen" rel="nofollow">
         Ken Allen

        was awarded an

        . It recognised his distinguished service in representing Australia on the international stage. Of particular note was his work as our Consul-General in

        when 9/11 took placeâ€”a time of trial for both Australia and the United States, when we needed those with deep international expertise. It was moments such as these which showed just how critical is the maintenance of an international network of friends and allies, the value of soft diplomacy and the importance of supporting Australians abroad.

        Given this, Ken pioneered and led the development of Advance, a global information-sharing network for expatriate Australian professionals. Ken recognised that one of the greatest strengths of our nation was that we were outward-looking, our population being highly mobile. Advance is fundamentally about Australians helping Australians helping the world. Keeping our citizens abroad connected ensures that we are able to draw on our international talent, particularly in times of need. This is critical in delivering for Australians at home as we expand our ties with other nations. By empowering this smart grid of human capital, Ken was harnessing some of our best and brightest to make a genuine impact. In many ways, this network helps equip what you might call the next generation of Kens, whose work sees them travel extensively. His capacity to draw on international connections and experience remains one of Ken's most important value-adds. What I personally admire about this organisation is how it empowers successive generations of Australians who are following their aspirations in building a better Australia and a better world. As of January 2021, Ken is now an Officer of the Order of Australia. This honour recognises his continued work and dedication to charitable organisations and to helping this nation's young professionals.
