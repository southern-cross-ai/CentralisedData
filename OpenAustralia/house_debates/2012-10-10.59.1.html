        I would like to talk about a local, national and indeed an international institution: the Dapto Dogs.    Last week I had the great pleasure of attending a dinner to mark the 75th anniversary of the Dapto Greyhound Racing Club in my electorate of Throsby. My electorate office is only about 100 metres down the road from the Dapto Dogs, so I invite any honourable members of this place who visit the Illawarra—and a few of them have visited the region in the last few months—to attend with me on a Thursday night, around 7 pm.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Dapto Dogs have grown into an iconic local institution since the club was established in 1936. The first race meeting was held there on 25 February 1937. Racing was suspended during the

        when the Army annexed the showground and buildings for troop accommodation that was put in place. But, thankfully, races resumed again in 1944.
       </p>
       <p>
        Races at this time were held on a Saturday afternoon due to power restrictions but soon reverted to their Thursday evening timeslot, which they have occupied ever since. Last week's dinner provided some wonderful memories, which were shared by former bookmakers, dog owners and commentators, including the most famous of all, Mr Paul Ambrosoli.

        The most famous dog to race at Dapto was Nads. His winning debut was in 1996, at Dapto, and it was televised live on
