        Mr Speaker, I have a question to you, too. It also goes to the question of consistency and follows from a question I asked earlier this week. Today again you allowed the Leader of the House to rise to speak on a point of order raised by another member—in this case the member for Grayndler. In my view that was a correct interpretation. But in the last sitting week you refused to allow me to rise to speak on a point of order raised by another member, saying that I had no right to do so. I ask you to once again examine the
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        of the last sitting Thursday—and there were two occasions this week on which that has occurred—and provide to me some explanation of the rationale for the distinction between the treatment of the Leader of the House and my treatment.
       </p>

         In response to the member for Fraser, I will agree with the first part of his question.

          Mr Speaker, I have a question for you. I have had a look at the transcript of the
          <i>
           Hansard
          </i>
          for question time yesterday, when the Manager of Opposition Business raised a point of order concerning the conduct of the Leader of the House in relation to standing order 90 and you said ‘There are forms of the House.’ My question to you concerns the meaning. Are the ‘forms of the House’ you are referring to personal explanations or a request for a withdrawal? I ask this because standing order 90 has been enforced against me by you and by the Deputy Speaker, but I cannot see it being enforced against the Leader of the House or, for that matter, any other government members.

          <p>
           I thank the member for Wills. I would be happy to re-examine the
           <i>
            Hansard
           </i>
           , but, as I recall, the Manager of Opposition Business asked the Minister for
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_and_Ageing" rel="nofollow">
            Health and Ageing
           </a>
           to withdraw and he withdrew. That was using a form of the House. But other forms of the House are available, as appropriate, for whatever reason members choose to apply them.
