        A couple of weeks ago I had an opportunity to visit the Townsville Flexible Learning Centre, run by the Edmund Rice Foundation. Flexible Learning Centres are for high-school-aged students who find themselves outside the mainstream school system for a range of different reasons. When I had a walk around the school, I saw myself in a lot of these kids. I left school quite young. I was quite a ratbag—I still am a bit of a ratbag—and a school like this would have served me quite well.
       </p>

        So it was great to be able to announce a massive $2.3 million upgrade, as part of the Capital Grants Program. This program provides funding for non-government school communities to assist them to improve capital infrastructure where they otherwise may not have access to funding. That's why the Flexible Learning Centre in Townsville has been the perfect candidate. It's a small school with only 130 students and no fees. The project will see part of the current admin building demolished and the vacant land used to build new administration and staff facilitates, a general learning area, art rooms, closed walkways and student amenities. This is a new facility that will be purpose-built. As the campus head said, it's not about having 30 desks and chairs in a row with a whiteboard at the front; it's about being flexible and adapting the space to suit the learning situation. I look forward to going along with the school on this journey, because it's a fantastic initiative for our students.
