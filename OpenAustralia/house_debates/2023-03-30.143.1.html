       <p>
        My electorate of Capricornia holds the title of having the most coalmines in Australia. This industry employs thousands of my constituents in the resources sector alone and continues to support the nation by returning over $9 billion to the Australian economy. These mines in the regional towns that are the hubs for the resource sector are the engine room of Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        With new technologies being established to support the push for renewable energy and climate change targets, the need for the mining of natural resources is growing. Australia has an abundance of the critical minerals that are required for creating the technologies that are the way of the future. Investing in and developing Australia's world-leading mining industry is at a critical juncture. We must ensure that we keep pace with other countries, while mining resources to supply the growth of the technology industry. Australia is on the verge of another mining boom for these critical minerals. By 2030, to meet demand for electricity storage alone, the world will require 50 new lithium mines, 60 new nickel mines and 17 new cobalt mines. The economic value of this demand places Australia in prime position to take advantage of this boom. To support net zero emission by 2050, further investment will be needed not only for developing the required mining projects but also for providing a skilled and competent workforce.

        The coalition government recognises the importance of ensuring that our region is ready with proficient and highly trained people.

        University saw the need to invest in developing courses to produce highly skilled and qualified workers to meet the needs of the resource sector. I was proud to deliver $30 million for CQ University's School of Mining and Manufacturing at the Rockhampton and Gladstone campuses. On 15 March, this incredible new facility was officially opened. The purpose-built, state-of-the-art school of mining in Rockhampton will support training, education, research and workforce development to ensure the needs of the mining and resource sectors are met. In the first year alone, the school of mining will see 200 highly skilled graduates enter the resource industry.

        ers will now be able to train locally and learn the cutting-edge skills required for emerging markets. There is no doubt the new school of mining will also attract people to the Rockhampton region to study and gain employment in the minefields to the west, further driving the economic growth of Central Queensland.

        Professor Nick Klomp, CQ University's vice-chancellor, has been championing the importance of studying in the regions to support the needs of regional Australia. CQ University continues to take the lead in delivering training and higher education for regional Australians, and I commend Professor Klomp and his team for the work they do in skilling people to meet the needs of industries across Australia.
