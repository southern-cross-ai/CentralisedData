         I thank the member for Mallee for her question. She's a great advocate for her Victorian electorate. She understands just how important local government is. She understands how important stimulus is to those local governments. She represents 12 councils in the electorate of Mallee—12 councils that will receive, between them, $18.8 million as part of the stimulus package that we've just announced, of $1.8 billion, including $500 million under the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program. There will be $500 million towards those local roads, towards that community infrastructure, and a bring-forward of $1.3 billion of the financial assistance grants. That's so important so that we get the money out onto the ground for those local councils, because we know that, when it comes to local procurement, when it comes to local jobs, the $500 million as part of the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program is going to hit the ground, and we know that the bring-forward of the

         s is going to be so important for those councils.
        </p>

         The mayor of Buloke Shire Council, Carolyn Stewart, said of the stimulus package, the $1.8 billion, 'The doubling of the Roads to Recovery program and recent local roads and community infrastructure program announcements by the federal government are incredibly positive for the Buloke community.' Buloke represents Birchip, Charlton and Donald. They're great little towns, great little communities, and we want them to be their best selves. She continued, 'Agriculture is the mainstay of our shire, and investment into the local road network is critical to the safety and efficiency of our farming community.' Councillor Stewart understands, as does the member for Mallee—they both get it—how important this money is going to be for their local communities. And, of course, we understand that local councils have a role to play in cutting through some of the red tape that is impeding local jobs and local activities.

         The Treasurer had a bit to say about that this morning, as did Mr Morrison—that's
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Morrison" rel="nofollow">

         , who is the Property Council of Australia chief executive. He had this to say:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         “Australia is going to need its biggest engines of the economy firing and construction is one of those big engines,” … “It’s important that every planning authority and local council is taking its responsibility in this very seriously. They need to have a laser-beam focus in regards to assessing these projects and assessing them much faster.
        </p>
        <p>
         We understand that. Certainly during the COVID-19 situation I've been working—as has the Prime Minister—with our Transport and Infrastructure Council ministers to ensure that we get through planning, we get through development and we get it done as quickly as possible. We're prepared to do it at federal and state level. I call on councils to do the same.
