       <p>
        Today I rise to express my appreciation for a couple in the Cowper electorate who are building a stellar record of dedication and commitment to a very important cause. Barry and Von Gracey have dedicated themselves to keeping alive the memory of the Australian soldiers who so bravely fought at Pozieres in France. I have been to Pozieres. Today it is a simple, peaceful French village, but 101 years ago it was the scene of one of the bloodiest battles ever fought by Australian diggers.
       </p>
       <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Battle" rel="nofollow">
         The Battle
        </a>
        of Pozieres was part of the overall Somme offensive in the summer of 1916. On 23 July 1916, the Australian 1st Division captured the village of Pozieres from the Germans. The division clung to its gains despite almost continuous artillery fire and repeated German counterattacks. By the time it was relieved four days later, on 27 July, it had suffered 5,285 casualties.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian 2nd Division relieved the devastated but victorious 1st Division then mounted two further attacks. The first, on 29 July, did not succeed. The second attack, on 2 August, resulted in the seizure of further German positions beyond the village. Again, the Australians suffered heavily from artillery bombardments. They were relieved on 6 August.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Australian 4th Division was next into the line at Pozieres. It too endured a massive artillery bombardment and defeated a German counterattack on 7 August. This was the last attempt by the Germans to retake Pozieres.
       </p>
       <p>
        There were more than 23,000 Australian casualties at Pozieres in less than seven weeksâ€”only slightly less than the Gallipoli campaign, which lasted eight months. Of the casualties, 6,848 Australian soldiers were killed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The fighting around Pozieres Ridge has become part of Australia's military folklore. Official war historian
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bean" rel="nofollow">

        said Pozieres:

       </p>
       <p>
        Barry and Von Gracey have spent more than a decade working to keep alive the memory of the men who fought at Pozieres. They have done more to build the relationship between Pozieres and Australia than anyone else. Last year, Barry and Von were awarded the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Legion" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        of Honour by the French government. They are believed to be the first couple to jointly receive the honour since it was introduced by
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_Bonaparte" rel="nofollow">

        in 1802. This is an exceptional honour, and I am very proud to be their local member.
       </p>
       <p>
        A few weeks ago, I had the great pleasure of presenting Barry and Von with a federal member's award to provide local recognition of their outstanding efforts in ensuring the Battle for Pozieres and the sacrifice of our Australian servicemen will always be remembered.
