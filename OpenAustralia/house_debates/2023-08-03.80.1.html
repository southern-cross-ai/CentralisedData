        My question is to the member for Bruce as Chair of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Joint Committee
        </a>
        of Public Accounts and Audit, with reference to the committee's inquiry into Synergy 360 linked procurement at Services Australia and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIA" rel="nofollow">
         NDIA
        </a>
        . How and when was the inquiry initiated? What has been the process to date? What hearings have been scheduled, and with whom? What are the next steps? Can people still make submissions? What are the process impediments to completing the inquiry? When will a report be tabled?

         I thank the member for Jagajaga. I will address her questions about the inquiry's process and procedure. With regard to the inquiry's initiation, evidence was received at public hearings on 14 April for the inquiry into Commonwealth procurement from Dr Ian Watt
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC" rel="nofollow">
          AC
         </a>
         , the former secretary of the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_the_Prime_Minister_and_Cabinet" rel="nofollow">
          Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet
         </a>
         and finance departments, the chief executives of Services Australia and the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIA" rel="nofollow">
          NDIA
         </a>
         ; and Synergy 360 principals, including
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_Robert" rel="nofollow">
          Stuart Robert
         </a>
         's associates, Mr David Milo and Mr John Margerison. Procedurally, as Dr Watt was not able to examine the actions of ministers, lobbyists and vendors, the committee utilised its powers to initiate this inquiry focused on Synergy 360 related procurements, given the seriousness of the evidence regarding irregularities. The committee has held both public and in camera hearings, including with Mr Groff, Infosys vice-president; and an unnamed witness at an in camera hearing last Friday, 28 July, Witness A.
        </p>
        <p>
         The committee's progress has been seriously impeded due to the key witness, Mr Margerison, failing to answer questions. Therefore, on 27 June, the committee took a very rare step, resolving to order Mr Margerison to produce all documents that were requested, to fully respond to all questions and to appear at a hearing last Friday, 28 July. Unfortunately, Friday's hearing did not proceed, as Mr Margerison's lawyer informed us that Mr Margerison is now resident overseas, having severed all ties with the country of Australia many weeks ago. The committee's work is delayed as Mr Margerison's whereabouts are unknown, and he considers himself outside the jurisdiction of this parliament. At its private meeting this morning, the committee considered this turn of events and resolved to write to his lawyer, seeking advice as to Mr Margerison's whereabouts. Now, of course, it remains within the JCPAA's power to recommend referrals to other investigative bodies with additional resources and powers which we may not possess.
        </p>
        <p>
         The committee will also shortly publish new information from Infosys following evidence that Infosys paid Synergy 360 in the order of $16 million, including success fees, and held 11 meetings with former minister Stuart Robert, sometimes without public servants present. The committee has reached no conclusions at this stage, and anyone with information is encouraged to contact the committee and is welcome to make a submission. Further hearings may be held in August and September, but I cannot advise the House when a report will be tabled.
        </p>
        <p>
         Finally, in the interest of transparency, the committee has also issued a public reminder that witnesses before committees are protected with respect to evidence by the law of parliamentary privilege, and that interfering with or harassing witnesses in any way may be regarded as a contempt of the parliament.
