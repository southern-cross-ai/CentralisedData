       <p>
        The electorate of Lyne has sadly lost and farewelled two incredible men: 95-year-old Hugh McCrindle and 90-year-old Roy Meguyer. I'd like to pay tribute to both of them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Hugh McCrindle
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        was born in Sydney in 1928, and he made the move to Taree with his wife, May, in 1966. Hugh worked during that time as the general manager of the 2RE Radio station. In 1968, he joined the Taree North Rotary Club and marked the beginning of a long contribution to the community outside of broadcasting. He was twice awarded Rotary's highest honour, the Paul Harris Fellows medal, and was eventually made an honorary member. Hugh was a long supporter of local community organisations, and many in the Manning will remember him. I extend my sincere sympathy to Hugh's family.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to acknowledge the life of Roy Meguyer, who was born on the Isle of Wight in 1934 before migrating to Australia in 1951. Shortly after, Roy was called up for national service, and thereafter he served in the

        </a>
        . In the late 1990s, Roy and Eileen settled in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Bar" rel="nofollow">

        , and it was here that Roy became involved in the Old Bar Beach

        Club. Roy was a stalwart of the RSL and the Old Bar community, and I offer my heartfelt sympathies to Roy's family and his wife, Eileen. Thank you, Roy, for a life well lived.
