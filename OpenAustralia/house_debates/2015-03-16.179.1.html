        Last week I visited
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Joseph's" rel="nofollow">
         St Joseph's
        </a>
        Catholic Primary School in Riverwood. St Joseph's is a great school, drawing the majority of its students from the Riverwood, Peakhurst and Lugarno areas in my electorate. It has a fantastic reputation in the local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        My visit coincided with Catholic Schools Week, which was celebrated across
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        last week. It was the school's open day that I attended. To mark the occasion, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Director" rel="nofollow">
         Executive Director
        </a>
        of Catholic Schools for the Archdiocese of Sydney, Dr Dan White, was in attendance and addressed the students and parents. It was good to meet Dr White and discuss issues of importance in the Catholic school system.
       </p>
       <p>
        During my visit I also presented the 2015 school leaders with their congratulatory certificates for taking on these important roles. Special congratulations are due to Alanna Cogle and Billy Finn, who are the new school captains, and to Tayla Tandek and Nicholas Molloy, who are the new school vice-captains. There was a very nice liturgy in the morning which had some great songs from the choir and dance performances. I want to also take a moment to congratulate the principal of St Joseph's, Mrs Kim McCue, for her fantastic work in building one of the great schools of our region.
