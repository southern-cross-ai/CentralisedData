        poppy, which many of us are wearing here today, became accepted throughout the allied nations as the flower of remembrance.

        As I and many of my colleagues paused for a minute's silence in Canberra today, I thought about the many men and women in my electorate who have served. I would like to thank the people who laid wreaths on my behalf at services across the electorate of Hinkler. In particular, I thank my wife, Alison—who continues to put up with me—who laid a wreath at the Bundaberg service today, and
