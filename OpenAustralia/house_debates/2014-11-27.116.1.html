        I rise to present a petition on the importance of the East West Link, which was found to be in order by the Petitions Committee. The stack is right here, Madam Speaker.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

         The petition read as follows—

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        This petition of Corangamite and Geelong residents draws to the attention of the House that: the East West Link is a vital infrastructure project which will deliver more than 6,000 construction jobs and cut travel times for Geelong commuters. Only a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalition_Government" rel="nofollow">
         Coalition Government
        </a>
        will build East West Link. State Labor!
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        has vowed to stop it, threatening $3 billion of Federal funding and thousands of jobs. It is critical that Federal Labor MPs including in Geelong, western Melbourne and Ballarat support this project.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We therefore ask the House to: stand up for more than 6000 new jobs and back East West Link.
       </p>
       <p>
        from 489 citizens
       </p>
       <p>
        Petition received.
       </p>
       <p>
        The petition garnered more than 550 responses and 489 signatures. It reflects our absolute determination each and every day to fight for jobs across the Geelong region. There is no more important project for jobs than the East West Link: 6,700 jobs—3,700 in stage 1 and 3,000 in stage 2. The $3 billion contribution from the federal government is so important and, of course, in jeopardy if Labor is elected on Saturday. Construction on the western section, starting at the end of 2015, will absolutely boost Geelong. It will deliver a second river crossing. It will unblock the terrible quagmire on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Gate_Bridge" rel="nofollow">
         West Gate Bridge
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Currently, some 14,000 people from Geelong commute to Melbourne, and during peak hour it is an absolute nightmare. We are investing in the infrastructure of the future to resolve a massive problem for the Geelong economy. Currently, the West Gate Bridge is clogged with 200,000 vehicles a day. The western section of the East West Link will carry 100,000 vehicles. It will be an absolute boon for our local economy. It will drive business investment. It will give businesses the confidence to move down to Geelong, and it will give more families the confidence to move to Geelong and invest in our great city.
       </p>
       <p>
        Of course, as we have heard today.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Andrews" rel="nofollow">
         Daniel Andrews

        is a walking sovereign risk. His commitment to rip up the East West Link contracts is the most economically reckless and politically irresponsible action by any political leader that we have ever seen in Victoria. The consequences are dire. We will as a state incur more than $1 billion in damages for a road that will never be built. He will shut down our state. The only ones who will be getting a boost to their business will be the

        . Unfortunately, the Leader of the Opposition is not a man who has any courage of his convictions. Previously, he backed the East West Link. Now what we have from those opposite is absolute deafening silence. Shame on members opposite!

        Tomorrow at pre-poll and on Saturday, Victorians have a chance to re-elect a Napthine government—a government which is driving jobs growth and investment; a government which Victorians can trust. There is a wonderful op ed in today's

        , which sets out his case—the wonderful commitments. Denis Napthine has an incredible commitment to jobs growth. We have seen that with the recent announcement about the

        . And, of course, there are another 550 jobs following another great initiative by this Premier in moving WorkCover to Geelong.

       <p>
        We saw so many Labor disasters when they were in power—and more are to come. The Bellarine will be in dire straits with the Bay West proposal. It is an environmentally destructive proposal. Look at desal and the $1.8 million a day that Victorians are paying because of Labor's incompetence. We are delivering better schools, better local hospitals, bypasses. To build a better Geelong and a better Victoria, I urge Victorians to put their support behind Denis Napthine and a coalition government on Saturday.
