        My question is to the Prime Minister. Is the Prime Minister aware that the Perth Freight Link will not actually take freight to the port but instead stop three kilometres short of it? Why is this discredited project a priority for the Prime Minister, instead of expanding public transport in Perth through the METRONET?

          I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question, because this is a government—the Turnbull-Joyce government—which is getting on with the job of delivering right around Australia. We have a $50 billion infrastructure investment program right around Australia: in Perth, in Melbourne, in Sydney, in Brisbane and right throughout regional Australia through our regional highway programs, and in our small rural and remote towns as well. It is a $50 billion infrastructure investment program which is changing lives and saving lives.
         </p>
         <p>
          It changes lives, a project like Roe 8, the Perth Freight Link project. It will deliver freight in an efficient way to the port. It will improve safety for the community of Perth and the broader

         </p>
         <p>
          The Australian government has committed in the order of $1.2 billion to the Perth Freight Link project. We are getting on with the job right throughout Australia: in Western Australia, in Victoria, in
