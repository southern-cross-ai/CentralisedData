        I would like to inform the House of work undertaken by students at Lakes Grammar, in my electorate, to support
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_McDonald_House" rel="nofollow">
         Ronald McDonald House
        </a>
        . The opportunity class at Lakes Grammar, an Anglican school, consists of children from year 5 and year 6. These 10- and 11-year-olds have been involved in an integrated unit of work that looks at ethics, social justice and obligation. This learning inspired the opportunity class to raise funds to assist with a Ronald McDonald House project at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gosford_Hospital" rel="nofollow">
         Gosford Hospital
        </a>
        by planning and organising a dinner to raise funds.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ronald McDonald House provides support programs that directly improve the health and wellbeing of children. This particular project will see the development of a family room, attached to the paediatric ward at Gosford Hospital, which will provide families of very ill children with an area to relax.
       </p>
       <p>
        The dinner was held on 11 October, and, as a result of the students' efforts, over $15,000 was raised. Year 6 student Olivia Roberts commented:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        It was very stressful but we pulled together and have managed to make enough to make a big difference to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_McDonald_House_Charities" rel="nofollow">
         Ronald McDonald House Charities
        </a>
        . As well as the planning … we also cooked, cleaned, waited on tables, greeted our guests and much, much more.
       </p>
       <p>
        Student Deanna Barnes said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We have learned a lot about what we can do to help our community and the people in it … We have also learned that helping other people is something you can do no matter what age you are.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mr William Wallace, head of the junior school, was thrilled that the students were able to develop a greater sense of the needs of others and what they can do to help. The students were able to present their cheque for $15,000 to a representative of Ronald McDonald House Charities on 28 October. I commend the efforts of Lakes Grammar students to the House.
