        My question is to the Minister for Urban Infrastructure: Will the minister update the House on the coalition's record on delivering infrastructure projects across the nation, including for residents in Bennelong and neighbouring communities? Is the minister aware of any alternative approaches?

         I do thank the member for

          North Sydney
         </a>
         , who of course is a very strong champion of infrastructure and has very considerable expertise in infrastructure. And he's right to say that the Turnbull government is delivering infrastructure all around the country and certainly working closely with the Berejiklian government in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         . For example, there is $412 million going into NorthConnex, $1.5 billion into WestConnex plus a $2 billion concessional loan, and $1.7 billion going into
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney_Metro" rel="nofollow">
          Sydney Metro
         </a>
         City &amp; Southwest. And, of course, all of these will benefit the electorate of North Sydney.
        </p>
        <p>
         They'll also benefit the electorate of Bennelong. For example, people travelling along the M2 through the electorate of Bennelong will then have better access using NorthConnex. Of course, as Metro-style services—four minutes, turn up and go—come to stations like
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_Park" rel="nofollow">
          Macquarie Park
         </a>
         ,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macquarie_University" rel="nofollow">
          Macquarie University
         </a>
         and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Ryde" rel="nofollow">
          North Ryde
         </a>
         , that will deliver enormous benefits to the people of Bennelong.
        </p>
        <p>
         So too will the commitment by the Turnbull government jointly with the Berejiklian government to spend $100 million on a new bus interchange at the Macquarie University station.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Alexander" rel="nofollow">
          John Alexander

         , as the Liberal candidate for Bennelong, has been a very strong champion for that project and for addressing the needs of his electorate, including a reduction in congestion.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, there are some others who are putting their names forward, meekly, to serve the people in Bennelong. One of them, it must be acknowledged, does have a big transport project on her
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CV" rel="nofollow">
          CV
         </a>
         —the Sydney Metro—where she spent almost $500 million. That's quite impressive. But, unfortunately, the $500 million was spent to cancel the project. That is the track record of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristina_Keneally" rel="nofollow">
          Kristina Keneally
         </a>
         , the Labor member—the Labor candidate—and, of course, the former Labor Premier of New South Wales whose distinguished track record when it comes to public transport was to cancel the Sydney Metro.
        </p>
        <p>
         Of course, in the 2010 election they desperately re-announced Parramatta to Epping. Here's what somebody said on election night, August 2010:
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
         I think given the on-again off-again nature of transport commitments in this city, we are battling uphill to convince people of the credibility of that commitment.
        </p>
        <p>
         Who said that? That was the Labor candidate,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxine_McKew" rel="nofollow">
          Maxine McKew
         </a>
         , the failed Labor candidate for Bennelong, telling the truth in 2010 about the failure of Labor's rail. You cannot trust Labor. You cannot trust Kristina Keneally. But I'll tell you who you can trust: you can trust John Alexander.
