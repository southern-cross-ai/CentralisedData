        On the weekend the

        and the Parramatta Leagues Club paid tribute to Alan Overton AM following his passing, and I wanted to say a few words on behalf of the community today about the extraordinary contribution this chairman of both clubs between 1988 and 2009 made to the community of Parramatta. I grew up in

        Alan was one of eight children who grew up in Granville. He undertook national service at the age of 18. He worked for James Hardie. He became involved in the building of

         Ronald McDonald House
        </a>
        . He was also involved with the Parramatta football and rugby league club for 30 to 40 years. He was Chairman of the Eels and the leagues club. He was crucial both on and off the field. As one of the greatest sons of Parramatta, he was also integral in ensuring the growth of this community and seeing many of the important community developments that we have seen over the years blossom into a great centre for

        .
       </p>

        His passion for the community saw Alan receive numerous awards for his achievements, including the

        , for his work with Scouts groups and handicapped children and for his services to the clubs. On behalf of the entire membership of the Parramatta Eels and the Parramatta Leagues Club, the district, the community, my community of Mitchell and all of the people who've worked with Alan—including me, as I have had the pleasure of working with him over many years—to his wife, Merle, and his children, Karen, Craig and Grant, we say: vale, and a life well lived.
