       <p>
        by leave—Before parliament rises for the year, I want to update members on Operation Sovereign Borders and to reassure the Australian people that we are upholding our pledge to stop illegal boat arrivals. September marked the second anniversary of Operation Sovereign Borders, and this month marks two years since the turnback phase of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSB" rel="nofollow">
         OSB
        </a>
        commencing.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over 1,200 people drowned in their attempts to reach our country by boat, and many more, we feel, suffered the same fate under five years of Labor's appalling mismanagement of our borders. It is no coincidence that it is now two years since anybody died in Australian waters. Five years ago we watched in horror as a boat foundered on the cliffs of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
         Christmas Island
        </a>
        and at least 50 people—that we know of—drowned despite the heroism of our front-line border staff and many others who were present on that day.
       </p>
       <p>
        Australian Border and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defence_Force" rel="nofollow">
         Defence Force
        </a>
        personnel spent five years under Labor pulling people from the sea rather than protecting our maritime borders. We intend never to allow those days—where such tragedies become commonplace—to return.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since commencing turnbacks, more than 20 boats carrying over 650 passengers paying people smugglers to reach Australia illegally have been returned to their country of departure. The most important point to understand is that, if the 20 boats got through, people smugglers would have marketed that as being back in business and 200 or 2,000 boats would have followed.
       </p>
       <p>
        OSB is a tough policy—the toughest on people smugglers—but it is saving lives. With the boats stopped, we are now addressing the legacy we inherited from Labor: 30,000 people who had arrived illegally by boat over the previous five years. Labor opened 17 additional detention centres; we have closed 13. Around 9,000 people who arrived illegally by boat were in detention when OSB commenced; we have reduced this to just 900.
       </p>
       <p>
        This government has finalised 1,732 asylum claims, 80 per cent of which have been rejected, showing that most who paid people smugglers to come by boat were not refugees. And most importantly, we have reduced the number of children in detention. More than 8,600 children were detained during Labor's two terms, peaking at nearly 2,000 in July of 2013. We have reduced that number to fewer than 100 today.
       </p>
       <p>
        But much remains to be done to clear Labor's backlog; tens of thousands in the legacy caseload have yet to be processed. Those who are found to be owed protection will be issued temporary protection or safe haven enterprise visas. Some of those visa holders will follow a rigorous pathway to remain in Australia, under the mechanisms we legislated last December and in March this year. Many will eventually have to return to their origin countries, or resettle elsewhere.
       </p>
       <p>
        OSB's success has rebuilt public confidence in the integrity of our borders and is restoring faith in Australia's migration policy. According to the highly respected Scanlon Foundation, public support for migration is at its highest since 2007.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our success in tackling people smuggling has also eased the pressure on Australia's humanitarian program, which means we can focus on people waiting in trying conditions overseas. This was our compact with the Australian people: we would help those who do not seek advantage by paying people smugglers to reach our country by boat.
       </p>
       <p>
        The clearest dividend of OSB's success is the government's generosity in addressing the humanitarian crisis in Syria and Iraq by resettling 12,000 additional refugees here. These places are for the most vulnerable people—persecuted women, children, and families with the least prospect of ever returning to their homes.
       </p>
       <p>
        Having just visited Jordan and Lebanon, I understand firsthand this desire to move. But we cannot succumb to the misguided altruism that led to the collapse of our borders—and to 50,000 people arriving here illegally by boat.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite our successes, people smugglers want to believe that the way to Australia is open; they try to create opportunities to persuade people to pay for boat passage. So countering people smugglers' lies and misinformation demands constant vigilance.
       </p>
       <p>
        But we continue to stare down our adversaries: no successful people smuggling ventures in more than a year and a half vindicates our policy settings.
       </p>
       <p>
        The situation in Europe shows exactly what can happen when border controls break down—hundreds of thousands of people flowing across land and sea borders. Some are genuine refugees, others are using the disorder and chaos to self-select a new country of choice. This uncontrolled movement weakens Europe's will and capacity to support lawful migration.
       </p>
       <p>
        The shocking terrorist attacks in Paris are the extreme consequence of this loss of control. Australia is not immune from the terrorist threat crossing borders; however; indeed, this is as real here as it is in many countries in Europe and around the world.
       </p>
       <p>
        The number of Australians attempting to join extremist groups has increased in recent years; more will inevitably try to join. Sympathisers and supporters of extremists here are growing in number and determination.
       </p>
       <p>
        More than 145 Australian passports have been cancelled to prevent travel prejudicial to national security. Over 400 people are the subject of counter terrorism investigations—a doubling in the caseload since early last year. And 26 people have been charged since the National Terrorism Public Alert was raised to high in September last year.
       </p>
       <p>
        The government's response to terror has been comprehensive and multifaceted.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have legislated in five tranches to reduce the space available to terrorists to recruit or travel. This includes the Allegiance Bill which passed the lower House yesterday.
       </p>
       <p>
        Funding for counter-terrorism and national security has been restored to levels commensurate to the threat after Labor's neglect—an additional $1.3 billion. And programs to counter violent extremism in partnership with communities are being rolled out to strengthen resilience in our multicultural society.
       </p>
       <p>
        In terms of my portfolio, the stand-up of the Australian Border Force shows the government's resolve to protect our borders. This has resulted in the counter terrorism units offloading 199 passengers on national security grounds—having built upon the successes of Operation Sovereign Borders.
       </p>
       <p>
        Our investment in Smartgates—almost $90 million—has extended biometric technology to departure as well as arrival points. Extension of advance passenger processing further pushes out the Australian border to scrutinise inbound passengers.
       </p>
       <p>
        People smugglers, and terrorists, will continue to test our resolve; they will not succeed under this government.

        <p>
         There is no question that ending the journey between Java and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christmas_Island" rel="nofollow">
          Christmas Island
         </a>
         has been a critically important measure for Australia and the Australian government. It has ended a human tragedy which saw all too many people lose their lives at sea. I am sure everyone in this building and across the country hopes that that is now at an end and that the people smugglers who perpetrated their despicable trade are now out of business. We, of course, support the achievement of this and note it as a remarkable achievement and one which is very important for the future development of a bipartisan position in this country in relation to asylum seekers and immigration more generally.
        </p>
        <p>
         I do need to say that the air of self-congratulation that we see on the part of this government in relation to this is starting to become distasteful. We, of course, all remember the billboards on this issue that surrounded polling booths and were being paraded around during the 2013 election. There is no-one in this parliament who can deny how politically the coalition regard this issue. This more than any other issue has been the one that the coalition has gone to in order to raise its banner. In doing so, and as we have just heard from the minister, there is a vigorous attempt to lay blame and credit in particular places. There is no doubt—and we have been quite up-front about it—that Labor made mistakes during the time of the last Labor government. But it is also true that the coalition in making its arrangement with the Greens party during the course of 2011 and 2012 to stop the Malaysian arrangement really spoke to the most shining example of the political expediency pursued by the coalition in respect of this issue. That measure—which could have brought an end to this journey four years ago—was not able to be implemented and as a result more than 600 people lost their lives at sea after that moment.
        </p>
        <p>
         So, when history looks to lay the blame for what occurred in the past, it will not be nearly as simple as the minister's description just now. Equally, when history looks to ascribe credit to how we have brought an end to the journey from Java to Christmas Island, it will remember that the regional resettlement arrangement, which was put in place by the then Labor government and resulted in 90 per cent of the vessels from Java to Christmas Island stopping before the current government was ever sworn into office. Yes, there is no doubt that turning around the remaining 10 per cent of those vessels has been a critical step taken by this government, but this government has enjoyed an opposition which has supported it in its endeavours to bring an end to that journey between Java and Christmas Island—an enjoyment that was not shared by the former Labor government in respect of the former coalition opposition.
        </p>
        <p>
         All of that said, there remain very significant issues which are outstanding and need to be addressed. Offshore processing is a critically important step in bringing an end to this journey, but it is not being run in anything like the efficient or humane way that we ought to see happening in this country today. We saw, months after the regional resettlement arrangement was reached by the former Labor government, the new conservative government not even have a conversation with its counterpart in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
          Papua New Guinea
         </a>
         about the resettlement of those people who were in offshore detention in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PNG" rel="nofollow">
          PNG
         </a>
         . As a result, we are more than two years down the track and we are only just starting to see the beginnings of resettlement occur in that country. We have seen appalling decisions made in relation to the conditions that have persisted in offshore processing—decisions such as keeping people living in tents on Nauru; an active decision by the Turnbull government to keep people living in conditions which are worse than what the former Labor government had planned to construct. That really stands out when it comes to the treatment of refugees, and it is an appalling decision that was made by this government.
        </p>
        <p>
         We have seen for most of the last 2½ years a substandard medical facility existing on Manus—which, to be fair, has now been replaced by a very good facility, but that was not until Mr Hamid Kehazaei died from preventable septicaemia in that substandard medical facility that existed. There has been no attempt, no serious effort, to engage in third-country resettlement, which is ultimately at the heart of what needs to be done if we are to see the near 2,000 people on Manus and Nauru ultimately resettled somewhere else in the world. The attempt to go to Cambodia, spending something like $55 million on resettling three or four people, has turned out to be an expensive joke. We saw the announcement of an agreement with the Philippines to pursue some kind of option there, but within weeks of that agreement being announced the Philippines government made it clear that there would be no permanent resettlement occurring in their country. Then we saw run up the pole the bizarre flag of some kind of arrangement with Kyrgyzstan. What we now have remaining unresolved is the fate of those 2,000 people on Manus and Nauru. That continues to be a real sore in this country's handling of this issue.
        </p>
        <p>
         What oversees all of that is a total failure in terms of transparency. Onshore something like 30,000 people have been kept in limbo for years, to start with because this government stubbornly refused to process people until it had achieved its temporary protection visa policy but then it has also sought to put in place the fast-tracked Immigration Assessment Authority—but it was not really that fast-tracked because in seeking to get that infrastructure up and running people have been kept in limbo and their situation has been essentially set in cement. None of these are issues which are resolved today. While I do absolutely agree with the achievement of the government in having 12,000 Syrian refugees come to this country, it only happened after Labor put out there the need for this to occur—this was the government being dragged kicking and screaming—but it does shine a light on the way in which future immigration policy should happen: it should be based on bipartisanship and generosity. That is how Australia should proceed on this, not on the basis of the old partisan rhetoric much of which we have heard from the minister today.
