        I rise to congratulate the Kellyville Bushrangers Rugby League Club, which comprises many local residents, including residents from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanhope_Gardens" rel="nofollow">
         Stanhope Gardens
        </a>
        and Glenwood, on their generous efforts to help those affected by last summer's natural disasters in Queensland.
       </p>
       <p>
        In response to these tragedies, the Bushrangers raised $3,500 from a raffle at Stanhope Village Shopping Centre on 22 January and also received donations of jerseys and equipment from club supporters, which they have delivered to one of the worst hit junior rugby league clubs in Queensland, the Theodore Roosters.
       </p>
       <p>
        Earlier this year I joined the Kellyville Princesses—their all-girl pink-jersey team—for their open day. Club Secretary,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Morgan" rel="nofollow">
         Penny Morgan
        </a>
        , told me how moved she and other members were by reports that a local football, just like theirs, was left devastated by the floods. They all resolved to do something about it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Thanks to their virtual adoption by the Kellyville Bushrangers, the Roosters were still able to take to the field this year despite floodwaters destroying their club. Last weekend the Bushrangers flew the 1,200 kilometre journey north to Theodore in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Queensland" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        to play a one-off match against the Roosters on the ground they helped rebuild.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate efforts of all the Kellyville Bushrangers, especially Penny and their club president, Jeff Quick, for digging deep to support our friends in Queensland in their time of need and demonstrating the spirit of community in north-west Sydney, which does us all proud.
