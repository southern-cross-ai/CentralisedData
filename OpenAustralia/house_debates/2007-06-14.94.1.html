        The tempest that struck our region last Friday exposed the people of Newcastle and the Hunter to the world and, although we appeared battered and bruised, our community strength has been revealed for all to admire. The natural disaster began when 50-knot winds and 17-metre waves blasted the coal ship

        for his constant updates. Rescuing the 21 crew members in the horrendous weather was executed by the Westpac helicopter team with precision, skill and courage. Always our everyday heroes, on that day they were superheroes. To Graham Nickisson, the crew chief, and that bright, shiny boy I once taught: I am immensely proud. To the entire environmental damage control and salvage teams, thank you for being there so quickly. We hope for a safe and successful salvage.

        But Mother Nature had more in store. Rain continued to fall that day in quantities that would quench the thirst of this land, defying the man-made pass constructed to contain the run-off and cutting paths of destruction through streets, homes and businesses. Trees were uprooted, powerlines fell and torrents of water wreaked havoc everywhere, and thus the rescue effort began. Family members, neighbours and strangers undertook great acts of bravery and compassion. About 2½ thousand

        volunteers worked day and night, responding to 15,000 calls for help. At the height of the storm, 200,000 homes were blacked out, 28,000 people’s phones were off and water supply was cut in many areas. A superhuman effort by emergency and health workers, police, power, water and telephone teams, who swung into action, averted further tragedy.

        But the loss has been great and, while restoration has commenced, nothing can be done to bring back the nine people who lost their lives over the course of that terrible weekend. I extend my deepest sympathy to the families and loved ones of Wayne Bull; Adam Holt and Roslyn Bragg, their daughters, Madison and Jasmine, and their nephew Travis Bragg; Nigel Beeston; and Bob and

        commanders, police commanders and the Premier’s office for their coordination and updates. Thank you to all our agencies and authorities who kept the information flowing and a very special acknowledgement to the entire 1233 ABC Radio team for their amazing heart-warming round-the-clock coverage. For many people without power, the trannie tuned to the ABC was their only link to the world—a constant source of emergency information, human contact and hope. We are all grateful and proud.

        Now that the recovery phase has begun, it is time for everyone—political leaders, bureaucrats, insurance companies, contractors, tradesmen and retailers—to become heroes too. Today I name in parliament the first insurance company to fail that test. I name CommInsure, the insurance business arm of the
