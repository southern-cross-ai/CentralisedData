        Today I wish to honour the life of Mary Ellen Clare Ferguson, nee Bett. I met Mary almost 38 years ago when I went to university with two of her sons, Laurie and Martin. I spoke in this place on 23 September 2002 on the death of her husband,

        , the former
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Premier" rel="nofollow">
         Deputy Premier
        </a>
        of New South Wales.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since her death on 15 June 2012, much has been said about Mary. Mary was a political wife who graciously accepted the impact this had on both her and her children. Mary's total focus was on her children; they were the centre of her life. Mary believed in the strength and mutual support of family, not only her immediate family but her extended family and Jack's as well. Her parents, grandparents, cousins, nieces and nephews were as much a part of her as her immediate family. Her daughter Jenny said that Mary unselfishly allowed Jack to pursue his career.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mary's husband was elected to the New South Wales parliament in 1959. For the first decade, members had no staff or offices. Jack built a sunroom at the back of the house and an office in the back garden. Once Jack assumed frontbench duties, especially the deputy leadership, Mary was effectively the member. She had the perfect touch with all people but especially those in difficulty. Her kindness transcended language. She liked people and she liked to be with people. I recall visiting my aunty in

        </a>
        . Her English was limited. To my surprise, Mary was in the bed beside her. They spent a number of weeks in hospital together throughout that time. Mary was a calming and reassuring influence on her. Mary's extended family came to include people like me and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rodney_Cavalier" rel="nofollow">

        , friends of her children and, later, friends of their children. The local community became a part of her extensive family. Mary prided herself on her own education, and the later success of her children academically is testament to that principle. It must have been a source of satisfaction that both her daughters became teachers. Indeed, Deborah taught at the local public school in Guildford in the heart of the Ferguson's community.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mary's role as the heart of her family widened as the five children moved into their careers and, geographically, away from Guildford. Her children recollect the regular Christmas get-together and the customary phone calls to ensure that everyone knew what was happening with all the family. Advice would be provided but her children made their own decisions and were then supported. Her task expanded again with the advent of her grandchildren and, recently, her great-grandchildren. I last saw Mary when we both attended her grandson Ben's wedding in Melbourne on 4 February 2012. It was a great gathering of the clan. She overcame extreme hardship to be there.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are so many words to describe this unique person: unselfish, humble, authentic, generous, determined, supportive, immaculate, houseproud, energetic, independent, dignified, undemanding, down-to-earth and true to her faith. This is well illustrated by a recent event. When her son Andrew was experiencing his long court case, Mary gave up the lollies she loved as a penance—God would hear her prayers and justice would prevail. God did hear her prayers and justice did prevail. To celebrate, Mary indulged in a bag of chocolate almonds from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darrell_Lea" rel="nofollow">

        . In the months leading to her death, Mary was never alone; family members were always with her. Jenny commented that her mother was going to be surrounded by love, solidarity and strength—the things that she had portrayed to her family throughout her life. During the mass, Laurie gave a moving and warm tribute to his mother. At the end of the mass, her sons, son-in-law and grandsons carried the coffin from the church. The coffin had entered the church on wheels, pushed by her daughters, granddaughters, daughters-in-law and nieces. It was a powerful sight. Mary had first entered that church 88 years earlier. Her Catholic faith was absolute and unquestioning. I extend my condolences and those of my family to Mary's children: Laurie, Martin, Andrew, Deborah and Jenny; their families; and various relatives and extended family.
