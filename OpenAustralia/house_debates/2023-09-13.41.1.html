       <p>
        Last Friday we saw some of the strongest and wildest winds lash the south-west Victorian coast that we have seen for a very long time. Gusts up to 110 kilometres an hour caused severe damage to buildings and they caused trees to come down and a loss of power to many households. Our
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SES" rel="nofollow">
         SES
        </a>
        volunteers right along the coastline reacted and responded as only they can. They were out answering every call that came their way. There were a record number of calls to our SES, and they responded as they always respondâ€”quickly and making sure that they get the job done. Without their great volunteer service, we wouldn't have been able to respond to the wild weather that we saw rip along the south-west Victorian coastline.
       </p>
       <p>
        On behalf of all the communities in south-west Victoria, I thank all our SES volunteers. They do an extraordinary and outstanding job. They do it out of a sense of service. They don't want to be patted on the back. They just want to make sure that they're doing the right thing by their community, and they did that last Friday. Thank you very much to all our SES volunteers.
