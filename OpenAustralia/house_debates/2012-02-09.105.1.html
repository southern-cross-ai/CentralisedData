        honours. Dr John Keneally, from Gladesville, was awarded an AM for his services to medicine. As the former Head of the Department of Anaesthesia at the

        for Children, Dr Keneally has a longstanding specialisation in paediatric anaesthesia and pain management, together with roles as an academic and an adviser on public health organisations. His services to medicine and to our broader community have led to this long-overdue honour, particularly when compared to the recognition given to his brother Thomas and daughter-in-law, Kristina.

        Mrs Suzanne Ward, a previous recipient of an OAM, was awarded the title of 2012 City of Ryde Citizen of the Year, following decades of dedication to and tireless efforts for her family and local community, carrying the respect and admiration of all who know her. Many years ago Mrs Ward and her husband, Terry, adopted five babies with various physical and intellectual disabilities, including epilepsy, spina bifida and Asperger’s syndrome. They raised those children, who are now all aged in their 40s, to become self-supporting, independent and productive members of our community, including gaining success in gymnastics at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_Olympics" rel="nofollow">
         Special Olympics
        </a>
        and state representation in basketball, as well as in swimming, sailing and water polo. Their children’s achievements are a real credit to the commitment, hard work and love that Mr and Mrs Ward have given. Mrs Ward has been an active fundraiser for a range of local charities and has given many hours to local special schools and youth clubs. This has included work for the local disability services organisation, RASAID, whose efforts I have praised in this place several times before.
