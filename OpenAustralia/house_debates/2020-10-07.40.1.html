       <p>
        To anyone who is struggling with their mental health right now, the message from your government is clear: we have your back. You are not alone. The Morrison government has made mental health and suicide prevention a national priority. Our government's investment in mental health is at $5.7 billion this year alone. This is to deal with the devastating impact that not only bushfires but coronavirus have had on our mental health. This includes $7 million provided by Medicare subsidised mental health services, which have been delivered since March, and support will increase.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last night the Treasurer announced that the number of Medicare funded psychological services through the Better Access Initiative will double from 10 to 20. These additional sessions will be available for all Australians with a mental health care plan, regardless of their location. I have already received positive feedback from mental health professionals across the country, who have said that the additional 10 sessions will make a huge difference to the front line, particularly for people with complex cases.
       </p>
       <p>
        We are supporting young Australians too with mental health issues to help them participate in the workforce. In the coming weeks, our government will receive recommendations from the Productivity Commission's mental health final report and the interim report into suicide prevention commissioned by the Prime Minister. We look forward to acting on these reports, alongside states and territories, so we can continue to provide life-saving mental health services for all Australians.
