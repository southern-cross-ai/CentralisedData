       <p>
        Thank you for an opportunity to encourage and speak about seven schools in my electorate in the Wimmera region of Mallee which are taking an opportunity to utilise a program administered by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Institute_of_Sport" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . It is called the Active After-school Communities program. As part of a publicity campaign to encourage support for this program, I had the opportunity last week to visit two schools which will be moving into this program in the new year.
       </p>
       <p>
        The seven schools include the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Arnaud" rel="nofollow">
         St Arnaud
        </a>
        Primary School, Horsham Lutheran Primary School, Horsham North Primary School, Dimboola Lutheran School, Rupanyup Primary School, Rainbow Primary School and Hopetoun Primary School. These schools are spread across a huge region of north-west Victoria. It is good to see them taking an opportunity to utilise programs funded by the Commonwealth through the Australian Institute of Sport. All these schools are being headed up in the program by one teacher, a physical education teacher, Murray McKenzie. It was great to meet him at St Arnaud last Wednesday and again on Friday at the Horsham Lutheran school. I had a game of tennis with the youngsters at the Lutheran school. It was quite invigorating. There were 15 of them up one end and me and my state colleague

        , the member for Lowan, at the other end. They soundly trounced us.
       </p>
       <p>
        The objectives of this program are to enhance the physical activity of Australian primary school aged children. It is nationally coordinated so it could build to bigger things and the establishment of competition. The reason so many schools are needed is to combine small communities to get a football team—especially primary schools like Rainbow.

          I know Mr Quick is acquainted with Rainbow, having been born and raised there. We are hoping that with some publicity we will encourage more schools to participate in this program. It is going to give increased opportunities for inclusive participation in quality, safe and fun structured physical activities, especially after school. One of the great challenges today is obesity—it is a huge challenge, especially with children of a younger age. This program will enhance attention on health and vigorous activity in youngsters, so that they are less of a burden when they get to our age—our generation having not learnt soundly the need for vigorous physical activity. I commend those schools. I wish Murray McKenzie all the best. He has taken on a huge challenge and I look forward to opportunities to play some more tennis, football or netball with the youngsters, to give them the encouragement they deserve.
