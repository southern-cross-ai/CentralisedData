       <p>
        Last night was my first budget as a federal member of parliament, and it showed just how we, the Turnbull coalition government, are making the right choices for a responsible government. This budget will improve the lives of my constituents in Dunkley, increasing the standard-of-living amenities available and delivering on the commitments that we made to the Dunkley community when I was elected.
       </p>
       <p>
        Every school in Dunkley, all 51 of them, will have its funding either secured or increased under the fairer needs-based funding model. I am proud to be part of properly implementing Gonski funding, supporting many Dunkley schools, such as Kingsley Park Primary School, neglected by the Victorian budget last week.

        , much anticipated on the peninsula, will be fully funded. I have seen the anguish of so many families when I have met with them about their fears that there will be no-one to look after their children when they pass away. I can now reassure Henry, Marie, Norman, Joy and so many others that the Turnbull government has heard their concerns and acted upon them.
       </p>
       <p>
        The federal budget will return to balance by 2021 by ensuring that we as a government and as a country live within our means. We have an obligation to the Australian public to govern responsibly, and we will do exactly that. The tax cuts for small business will have a huge impact on Dunkley, where over 16,000 small businesses will benefit, in addition to benefiting from our extension of the small business asset write-off for 12 months. Additional money has also been allotted to give funding certainty to homelessness servicesâ€”$375 million is the latest contribution to looking after Australia's and Dunkley's most vulnerable people.

        to Recovery program carries over funding for many of my election commitments, and I am pleased that this will be continued. Pensioner concession cards will be issued to 92,000 Australians, including many in my electorate.
       </p>
       <p>
        This budget ensures that we as a nation are in a good place going forward. We are fortunate to be in a comparatively positive financial position, and this budget is about making sure that we make the right choices, live within our means, operate on a basis of fairness, ensure our security and have plenty of opportunities in our days ahead. I look forward to serving, with this coalition government, my constituents in Dunkley as we implement this budget.
