        When recently inducting the great Australian trumpeter

        into the Hall of Fame at the Jazz Bell Awards I was told something extraordinary by him: that weekend he had 3,500 young Australians gathering in

        to participate in training with Australia's leading jazz musicians. That says a lot about the yearning for creativity amongst young people in this country. The dynamism, imagination, enthusiasm and vision of people impresses anyone who works with the Australian arts sector. This includes Australia's visual artists, writers, classical jazz and contemporary musicians, film, theatre and circus people as well is the dedicated arts administrators.
       </p>
       <p>
        This budget has delivered excellently for the arts, especially for young people. In particular, I am pleased that $8 million has been provided in the budget for the Creative Young Stars Program. This program is part of the National Cultural Policy for a Creative Australia. It encourages young people up to 25 years old, with funding available in every federal electorate. I hope all the members sitting here are listening. A similar program exists to encourage young sports people, so I am delightful that this will be replicated in the area of the arts. We understand that many young gifted people are unable to take advantage of opportunities to pursue their interests in art and culture because they simply do not have the money. This can be the case in particular in Indigenous, non-English-speaking and low-income communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Creative Young Stars Program will help young Australians develop their talents, participate in events such as eisteddfods, public speaking contests and all types of competitions cultural, artistic and academic. Participation is an investment in the future that will help develop their talents, build professional connections and open up pathways to future employment.
       </p>
       <p>
        Grants of $500 for eligible individuals and $3,000 for eligible groups are now available. Each federal electorate will have 23 grants of $500 for individuals and four grants of $3,000 for groups to be awarded over two application rounds each financial year. Grants will be made by the federal member acting on the advice of an expert local committee. In round 1, the program will deliver grants to 12 individuals and two groups in each of the 150 electorates across Australia. Applications close on 21 June 2013.
       </p>
       <p>
        I am proud the Australian government is able to make this practical investment to ensure more young Australians get the chance to reach their potential and make an even greater contribution to Australia in the creative fields. I encourage honourable members to take part in this program, to publicise it in their electorates and encourage young people from across Australia to apply for these grants.
       </p>
       <p>
        James Morrison was inspiring, and the fact that 3Â½ thousand young people wanted to come from across Australia to get themselves into big bands or to learn jazz music is an indication, in many cultural areas, of where young people's motivation lies. We should encourage them and we will be via this Creative Young Stars Program.
