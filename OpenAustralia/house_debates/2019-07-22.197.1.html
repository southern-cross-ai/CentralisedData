       <p>
        I'm here to talk about the Residents of Tulliallan Community Action Group and commend them on their great efforts to secure a park of 6.8 hectares for their community and for the Tulliallan Primary School as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        In May this year, I was contacted by Srikant Rajan and Rebecca Hyland and asked to attend a residents group meeting in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranbourne_North" rel="nofollow">
         Cranbourne North
        </a>
        to listen to their concerns. The residents of the Tulliallan estate in Cranbourne North had bought into this wonderful estate, having been told by a particular real estate group,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM" rel="nofollow">
         RPM
        </a>
        Real Estate Group, and the developers, Konann Pty Ltd, that the area that they had bought around would be a park—we hear this often—but were not told that they were going to have to fight tooth and nail to ensure that it stayed a park.
       </p>
       <p>
        Due to their great lobbying efforts, their commitment and their respectful approach, they have won. Recently, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Casey" rel="nofollow">
         City of Casey
        </a>
        —and they are to be commended—have purchased that land so it can be held in perpetuity and turned into the parks and ovals that the Tulliallan residents group were told they would have when they bought into the property. So congratulations to the Tulliallan community action group. Congratulations to the City of Casey. People power does work. People's voices do matter.
