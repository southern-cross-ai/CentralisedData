          I thank the member for Bendigo for his question because I know he is one of the very proud members of this House to have the Bendigo
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
           GP
          </a>
          superclinic just opened in his electorate. His is the 19th superclinic that is fully operational, and it is providing extra GP services, nurses and allied health services in Bendigo and working very closely with the hospital services that are being provided.
         </p>
         <p>
          Our GP superclinics program has provided over 630,000 services to patients across Australia. But last night the Leader of the Opposition again made clear that this program is a program that he is going to cut. As per usual, the only policy that the Leader of the Opposition had was to say no. He has a $70 billion hole in his own budget and he is intending to fill it by saying no to doctors, no to nurses, no to superclinics, and no to hospital services.

               <p>
                So the Leader of the Opposition says no, but members of his frontbench say yes. I know that the member for Gilmore is sitting quietly there, but she happily attended, as she should as the local member, the opening of the Shellharbour superclinic, and she said that she believed these clinics were worth pursuing if they attracted services to doctor-starved regions like her own. So she says yes in her local electorate, but here the Leader of the Opposition just says no.
               </p>
               <p>
                What about the member for Parkes? Gunnedah used to be in his electorate. Unfortunately the redistribution has moved it, but the member for New England has been very appreciative. Mr Coulton said that this was a 'long-held dream' for the people of Gunnedah and 'an exciting model' and he paid 'tribute to Minister Roxon'. So although the Leader of the Opposition says no, the member for Parkes says yes.
               </p>
               <p>
                The majority of these clinics are in coalition seats, and these clinics are being welcomed by local members, although the Leader of the Opposition still says no. Let me give you the latest edition. The member for Flynn told locals in Emerald of their
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GP" rel="nofollow">
                 GP

               </p>
               <p>
                This is important. I think people should listen, because the member for Flynn said: 'Just for the record I have to say this. My party does not believe in super clinics but we do—we are in favour, we do stand with—we do support the Labor government and Minister Roxon and stand beside her in progressing these clinics and there is no-one more than myself who wants to see it work in Emerald.' So they cannot make up their minds which side of this they are on, because when it comes to health services the Leader of the Opposition just wants to say no and what he is proving is a leopard cannot change his spots.
