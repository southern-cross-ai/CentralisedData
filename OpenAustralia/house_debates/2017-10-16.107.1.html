        I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the interim report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Disability Insurance Scheme, entitled
        <i>
         Provision of hearing services under the Natio
        </i>
        <i>
         nal Disability Insurance Scheme
        </i>
        , which was presented on 14 September 2017.
       </p>
       <p>
        Leave granted.
       </p>
       <p>
        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That the House take note of the report.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is anticipated that approximately 16,000 to 20,000 people with hearing impairment as their primary disability will join the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
         NDIS
        </a>
        by 2019-20. This represents a small cohort within the schemeâ€”less than three per cent of NDIS participants. However, the introduction of the NDIS has undoubtedly had a disruptive effect on what is broadly recognised as international best practice in the support provided to the deaf and the hearing-impaired. Some extremely concerning issues have emerged and need to be resolved to ensure deaf and hard-of-hearing people continue to receive world-class services in this country.
       </p>
       <p>
        In March 2017, the committee delayed finalising its report, pending release by the National Disability Insurance Agency of (a) key operational guidelines or access criteria to the scheme for deaf and hard-of-hearing people, and (b) baseline reference packages to guide plan development for early intervention services. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIA" rel="nofollow">
         NDIA
        </a>
        indicated to the committee that it would release the guidelines and the packages by the end of April 2017. While the NDIA released guidelines for access criteria on 1 September, the early intervention packages remain outstanding. Without definitive information about the early intervention packages, the committee cannot report and make considered recommendations. This is a cause of great concern for many families, for the hearing sector and, indeed, for this committee. The committee has therefore decided to release an interim report while it awaits the release of the packages.
       </p>
       <p>
        The interim report focuses on the access criteria to the scheme and the issues pertaining to access and delivery of early intervention services. Until now, there has been a lack of clear access criteria to determine eligibility to NDIS services for deaf and hard-of-hearing people. This has caused great uncertainty for future access to services and supports for deaf and hard-of-hearing people, especially for newly-diagnosed infants and children. The committee is relieved that clear guidance to determine access to the scheme has finally been articulated and publicly released by the NDIA. However, the committee is frustrated that it has taken so long. Based on the evidence received to date, the recently released access criteria for early intervention requirements for deaf and hard-of-hearing people aged nought to 25 appear to be technically consistent with the current practices of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Hearing" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Hearing
        </a>
        and are, therefore, broadly welcomed by stakeholders. With regard to the access criteria for those aged 26 and older, the committee is concerned that the requirements may leave some people not eligible for the scheme, despite their need for reasonable and necessary supports.
       </p>
       <p>
        The committee is also concerned with the disruptions to early intervention services that have occurred since the introduction of the NDIS. The NDIS is failing to streamline intervention services from referral pathways to access and funding of services for newly-diagnosed participants. Guided pathways to ensure families could engage as early as possible with services that meet their needs have been lost. I will say that again: these guided pathways have been lost. It is a clinical fact that timely early intervention for deaf and hard-of-hearing children produces optimal results, yet evidence of delays to access therapies is mounting. Confusion, absence of guided advice and lack of choice and control over access to services are regularly reported by families and carers. Inadequate and underfunded NDIS plans are commonly awarded to children. As a result, opportunities for children to be taught to communicate as well as any other child with spoken or sign language are being lost. The committee believes it is critical that the NDIA addresses these issues as a matter of urgency. The introduction of guided referral pathways is necessary to ensure that there is no delay between diagnosis and commencement of therapies. Appropriately designed and funded early intervention reference packages must also be implemented.
       </p>
       <p>
        Accordingly, the committee has made a number of recommendations in relation to the matters discussed in this interim report. The committee intends to release its final report once the NDIA has introduced its early intervention reference packages. In addition to discussing the appropriateness of the packages, the final report will also discuss the other issues raised during the inquiry but not reported in the interim report. The committee will continue to consult with the hearing sector as required, until the committee completes its inquiry.

         I am very pleased to be able to support the remarks of the member for Menzies on the interim report on the provision of hearing services under the National Disability Insurance Scheme. I want to thank the member for Menzies, the chair of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIS" rel="nofollow">
          NDIS
         </a>
         , and all the other members and senators as well as the staff of the committee secretariat. The committee has been conducting a large number of inquiries, and the members of the committee and the secretariat have been taking a lot of time in listening to submissions from stakeholders and, of course, members of the public. I do want to particularly thank those peopleâ€”the service providers and familiesâ€”who came along to all the hearings that we had for this very important inquiry, for giving evidence and for making sure that we do understand the issues that the member for Menzies has just highlighted. Although it is the case that only around 20,000 Australians will be part of the NDIS as a result of their hearing impairments, we also know that early intervention, especially for babies and small children with hearing impairments, is absolutely imperative, and we are extremely concerned about the delays that have been occurring.
        </p>
        <p>
         The committee has made a number of recommendations so far. As this is only our interim report of course there will be further recommendations but I just want to highlight a few today. Recommendation 2 is that the National Disability Insurance Agency reviews immediately the cases of people with hearing impairment who were previously found ineligible and tests their eligibility against the revised guidelines. Recommendation 4 is that
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Hearing" rel="nofollow">
          Australian Hearing
         </a>
         be formally appointed as the independent referral pathway for access to early intervention services under the NDIS and funded appropriately to take on this new role. Recommendation 5 is that the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NDIA" rel="nofollow">
          NDIA
         </a>
         ensure that the early intervention packages take a holistic approach to the needs of participants. We do want to make sure of funding provision for additional services beyond core supports, depending on need, and that retrospective payment of the costs borne by approved service providers for the provision of necessary and reasonable supports between time of diagnosis and plan enactment is made. The sixth recommendation is that NDIA urgently finalise, publish and introduce the early intervention reference packages. This is, as I say, extremely important for babies and small children with hearing impairments and it is of great concern to the committee that this has been delayed so long. It is because of this delay that the committee decided to do an interim report and we urge the NDIA to finalise the reference packages as quickly as possible so that the committee can get on with finalising this very important inquiry.
