       <p>
        Last week, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        North Coast lost a great community advocate.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Robinson" rel="nofollow">
         Ian Robinson
        </a>
        served as an elected representative for three electorates across five decades. He was first elected to represent the seat of Casino in the New South Wales parliament, serving from 1953 to 1963, before making the switch to federal politics. He represented the seat of Cowper, the seat that I have had the honour to represent for over 15 years now. Mr Robinson represented the seat of Cowper from 1963 to 1984. In 1984 he successfully stood as a candidate for the new seat of Page and held Page in 1987 before losing to Labor's Harry Woods in 1990. Ian Robinson served as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deputy_Chairman" rel="nofollow">
         Deputy Chairman
        </a>
        of Committees from 1976 to 1983. He also served as Assistant Minister to the Postmaster-General from 1971 to 1972, and he served on a range of parliamentary committees, including Public Accounts and also Foreign Affairs and Defence.
       </p>
       <p>
        Over his 37 years as an MP, Mr Robinson established a reputation as a tireless advocate for rural communities. He fought passionately for regional development and for better infrastructure for country towns and communities. On reading the
        <i>
         Hansard
        </i>
        transcript of Mr Robinson's first speech to the Australian parliament, delivered just down the hill at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_Parliament_House" rel="nofollow">
         Old Parliament House
        </a>
        , I was reminded of the old saying that the more things change the more they stay the same. In that speech, he spoke of the challenges of decentralisation and regional development, battles still being fought by the Nationals more than 50 years later. He also spoke of the need to improve country roads, construct new dams, build a base of productive industries and provide options to allow people to have fulfilling careers in the regions. These were all relevant issues in 1964, and they remain relevant to Australian regional life today, and the Nationals continue to fight on behalf of regional communities for the same values. He also mentioned the vexed issue of electoral redistributions, another issue that remains contentious for communities along the New South Wales North Coast.
       </p>
       <p>
        In many respects, he was typical of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Party" rel="nofollow">
         Country Party
        </a>
        tradition that is now carried on by the Nationals. Before entering politics, he was a dairy farmer, a journalist and a businessman. As with so many Country Party and National Party representatives before and after him, his time as an MP was merely an extension of his lifelong commitment to community service. Although he was a politician for most of his career, he was not a career politician.
       </p>
       <p>
        Ian is survived by his beloved wife, Florence, and I extend my condolences to her and the Robinson family.

         It is a great honour to rise to speak of the late Hon.
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Robinson" rel="nofollow">
          Ian Robinson
         </a>
         , a great friend of my father,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_McVeigh" rel="nofollow">
          Tom McVeigh
         </a>
         , who served alongside him in the Australian parliament in the 1970s and 1980s. Ian Robinson was one who, in his long political and public life, never changed—wearing it on his sleeve and enclosing it in his heart, never to be erased—his allegiance to and support for his beloved
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_Party" rel="nofollow">
          Country Party
         </a>
         . He was the ultimate advocate for its philosophies, aims, objectives and policies and was a resolute defender of the same. He was grounded in these attributes by his mother and father, highly regarded and successful dairy farmers in the Casino district of northern
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         ; thus he had the advantage of both the practical and the theoretical knowledge of rural life. He knew how to milk a cow—unlike some, who believe milk comes from a plastic bottle, he knew it came from a cow's udder—and was a delegate to important rural meetings.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ian Robinson was never one to criticise. He had, rather, the courage to let the people decide after he had had a go. He was elected to the New South Wales parliament in his early 20s. He developed a reputation, through his logical comments expressed softly and without rancour towards opponents, to such an extent that, when
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_Earle_Page" rel="nofollow">
          Sir Earle Page
         </a>
         died during an election campaign and the seat was won by a Labor Party representative, the powers that be persuaded him to resign from the New South Wales parliament to contest the seat at the next federal election. He won the seat and held on to it until his retirement. He quickly made his mark, and in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sir_William_McMahon" rel="nofollow">
          Sir William McMahon
         </a>
         government was an assistant minister, strongly supported by party leader the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rt_Hon" rel="nofollow">
          Rt Hon
         </a>
         .
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JD" rel="nofollow">
          JD

         Anthony. He used to travel all around Australia, advocating and defending policies, and used to open field days and shows on account of his friendly manner and personal skills. On the defeat of the McMahon government he became, as it were, a tutor to the young recently elected Country Party members, all of whom warmed to him.
        </p>
        <p>
         He developed a very strong personal friendship with my father, Tom, and Tom was the only parliamentarian to be invited to help him in his various election campaigns. They were old-fashioned campaign street meetings with a loudspeaker in the back of a truck, where much enjoyment for both sides came from the to and fro of ideas. Yes, I am told that on one occasion rather rotten tomatoes were thrown, but they missed. Ian was assisted by his wife, Cynthia, who was a professional journalist. Cynthia and their son predeceased Ian. The late dinners at their home in Grafton overlooking the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarence_River" rel="nofollow">
          Clarence River
         </a>
         , I am told, were occasions of great fun. Both knew that, when staying over, Tom, my father, did not appreciate that his room was also the normal lodgings for their cat, and as a matter of courtesy the door and windows were sealed to ensure the cat slept outside. The cat always found a way through, I am told, and there was little doubt that Ian had a hand in that, simply in order to annoy Tom. Ian Robinson had a wonderful sense of humour.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ian was always immaculately dressed, even on visits to managers on his dairy farm. He was always generous to them and very supportive. He was the old-style politician who knew almost all of his constituents by name, their children, their schools attended, the names of their working dogs, home dogs and cats. He had a very special loyalty to his New South Wales Country Party leader,
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Punch" rel="nofollow">
          Leon Punch
         </a>
         , whom he called 'Punchy', federal colleagues the Hon.

          Bruce Cowan
         </a>
         and Reverend Phil Lucock, and his federal leader, the Rt Hon. JD Anthony. He was a lifetime member of the Masonic Society. He often laughed at how a friend of his—who will remain anonymous, but let's just say he is very well known to me—arranged for Ian to be photographed shaking hands with the Pope as the Pope moved through a guard of honour in the
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King's_Hall" rel="nofollow">
          King's Hall

         in the old Parliament House prior to an official dinner. He proudly displayed the photo in his electorate office in a prominent place for all who visited to see.
        </p>
        <p>
         During recent times, Ian shared his life with his second wife, Florence, at their Grafton home, and our thoughts are with her at this time. Finally, I personally recall fondly the visits to the beautiful Clarence River region of northern New South Wales to visit Ian with my father, Tom, and the fact that he always had lollies available for my younger brother, Peter, and I when we visited Canberra as young boys. Vale Ian Robinson. May he rest in peace.
