        I want to pass on my condolences following the loss of Mr
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Anderson" rel="nofollow">
         Stanley Anderson
        </a>
        , who passed away yesterday. I received a call around lunchtime yesterday to let me know that
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr_Anderson" rel="nofollow">
         Mr Anderson
        </a>
        passed away yesterday morning. Although Mr Anderson had had some health issues in recent years, his death comes as a great shock to the Smithfield community and I know to his family, and I wanted in the House of Representatives to pay tribute to him and to extend my condolences to his family.
       </p>
       <p>
        Stan was President of the Smithfield
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSL" rel="nofollow">
         RSL
        </a>
        Club, and he had been on the board for a long time and a member for over 30 years. He was also a long-serving member of the New South Wales Police Service in various capacities. Most particularly, he was a well-known figure in the Smithfield community—a man who made a great contribution. Personally, when I asked him if Smithfield RSL could host my annual pink ribbon morning tea, he would say yes, or our annual seniors morning tea, he would say yes. He would always provide an opportunity for Smithfield RSL Club to contribute to the broader community.
       </p>
       <p>
        He was also a great character—a larger than life figure; a big man with a big heart who was great company. As honourable members would understand and appreciate, at RSL functions and other community functions I would have the opportunity to spend time with Stan. He was always good for a laugh, good for a joke and good for a colourful insight into the local community. He was President of the

        </a>
        of Clubs New South Wales, and therefore made his contribution on a broader scale than just Smithfield. He wanted to make sure that Clubs New South Wales continued to make its outstanding contribution to communities across the country.
       </p>
       <p>
        I did want to take these few moments to record in the parliament my personal condolences and I am sure the condolences of all members for Stanley Anderson. I extend our condolences to his wife Barbara, whom I telephoned yesterday. I know that she is going through a great period of loss, but she has much to be proud of in her contribution with Stan and the contribution that her family has made. My best wishes go to Stan and Barbara's children, Scott and Robyn—Scott followed Stan into the New South Wales Police Service—and to their grandchildren, Jessica and Mark, Dale, Travis and Cooper. They were proud of all their grandchildren, and proud when Dale became captain of Smithfield Public School a couple of years ago. I was captain of Smithfield Public School in 1984, and I had a number of chats with the Anderson family about Dale's role as captain of Smithfield Public School, and I was pleased on my visits there to see him fulfilling that role very well. I extend my condolences—
