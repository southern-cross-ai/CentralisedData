        I rise to express my support for constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_Strait_Islanders" rel="nofollow">
         Torres Strait Islanders
        </a>
        and for an Indigenous Voice to Parliament. As we continue our journey towards reconciliation, it is imperative we take steps to sincerely engage with our Indigenous communities and give them a meaningful say in the decisions that affect them.
       </p>
       <p>
        Two weeks ago, I had the privilege of meeting with local Indigenous advocatesâ€”Melton councillor Ashleigh Vandenberg and her partner, Simon Vallone. During our conversation they shared with me their personal experiences as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indigenous_Australians" rel="nofollow">
         Indigenous Australians
        </a>
        and the challenges they had faced with many aspects of their life that most of us take for granted, from education to employment. They also spoke of the importance of identifying and protecting local sites of cultural significance. There are many sites in and around my electorate of Gorton, but they are not always recognised appropriately. I look forward to working closely with our local Indigenous groups, local councils and other agencies to help rectify this matter.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I listened to Ashleigh and Simon, it became clear that they believe the Voice will be an important step towards ensuring greater recognition and genuine consultation with Indigenous peoples. Constitutional recognition, to them, means acknowledging who they are and recognising the continuous connection they have with this country. It means being accepted by Australia and Australians as an integral and equal part. Ashleigh and Simon told me that they recognised the progress Australia has made in the last 20 or so years. This conversation could not have even been held when they were kids, they told me. They want to keep seeing Australia progress for their child and other Indigenous children.
       </p>
       <p>
        This is a critical moment in our nation's history. We have an opportunity to build a more just and equitable society that recognises and values the rich cultural heritage of our Indigenous communities. By supporting the Voice referendum, we can demonstrate our commitment to reconciliation and work towards a brighter future for all Australians. I urge all members of parliament and all Australians to support the Voice. Let us come together as a nation to create a future that is built on mutual respect, understanding and empowerment for all Australians.
