        I rise to pay tribute to some outstanding
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">

        locals who were included in the 2018

        Honours List. None of these people do the work they do for praise, recognition or reward. But I would like to acknowledge some of them who have helped to make the Central Coast one of the best regions in the very best country in the world. The 2018 awardees from Robertson are a mix of individuals from across the arts, sport, media and volunteer communities.
       </p>
       <p>
        Wayne Young has dedicated more than three decades to our community through his involvement with Fire and Rescue New South Wales, including responding to the Thredbo landslide in 1997 and the major storms back home on the Central Coast in 2007. Wayne, like all of those honoured, has committed much of his life to helping others.
       </p>

        A deserving inclusion is Merril Jackson, who in 2014 followed her dream to create the Poppy Project—a beautiful tribute to those who have served our nation, and one that truly captured the spirit of Anzac Day. Merril's vision inspired something that no local will forget—a stunning display of handmade poppies installed on the skillion at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Haven" rel="nofollow">
         The Haven
        </a>
        and at Poppy Park in Gosford. Merril coordinated hundreds of volunteers across the Central Coast to make the poppies. In doing so, she touched the heart of our community and indeed our nation as the beautiful tribute went viral across our country.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have a vibrant arts community on the Central Coast and it's wonderful to see so many of them recognised as part of this year's honours awards. Scott Levi has been part of the broadcasting community for over a decade but he has also committed to giving back to the community in his role as a volunteer surf lifesaver and through his work with the Central Coast Cancer Council.
