        I move:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        That this bill be now read a second time.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill gives effect to the tax arrangements required to support the entry into force of the Treaty between Australia and the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic" rel="nofollow">
         Democratic Republic
        </a>
        of Timor-Leste Establishing their Maritime Boundaries in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timor_Sea" rel="nofollow">
         Timor Sea
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        The treaty was signed on 6 March 2018 and is a historic agreement for Australia and Timor-Leste. This treaty establishes permanent maritime boundaries between our two countries and, importantly, lays the foundation for a new chapter in our relationship with one of our closest neighbours.
       </p>
       <p>
        The treaty provides benefits for both countries. The government recognises its significance for Timor-Leste and as Timor-Leste's leading economic partner we are committed to supporting them in their economic development.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the treaty, certain oil and gas fields in the Timor Sea will transition from joint Australian and Timor-Leste jurisdiction or exclusive Australian jurisdiction to Timor-Leste's exclusive jurisdiction.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill fulfils Australia's taxation related obligations under the treaty and provides certainty and security for those affected companies carrying out offshore petroleum operations in the Timor Sea.
       </p>
       <p>
        This bill ensures that taxation arrangements applying to these transitioned petroleum activities will continue in accordance with annex D to the treaty, which sets out the transitional arrangements for the treaty coming into force.
       </p>
       <p>
        This establishes a stable framework for resource development in the Timor Sea and provides Timor-Leste with new opportunities for income and continued resource development. It will also strengthen our bilateral relationship with Timor-Leste into the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        The tax amendments contained in the bill have been prepared, as you'd expect, with substantial consultation with Timor-Leste and the affected companies.
       </p>
       <p>
        <i>
         (Quorum formed)
        </i>
        I was just saying the full details of the amendments are contained in the explanatory memorandum.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debate adjourned.
