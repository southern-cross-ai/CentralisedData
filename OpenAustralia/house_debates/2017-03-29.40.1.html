        May I firstly welcome what appears to be officers from Australia and the region from one of our national security colleges here. I think I spy Colonel Justin Rookey.

        joined together 25 or 26 years ago. Oh, the stories, Colonel, we could tell.

       <p>
        But from the sublime to the local: I am so proud of what our local schools are doing, especially Pacific Pines State High School under the great leadership of principal Mark Peggrem. They have just hosted their first fete, which was a Pacific Pines Fiesta and which I opened. We had a few dramas with the sound and so we opened it with the

        on top of the hill. It was a cracker of an event. The Kokoda teams raised over $500 and Relay for Life, $130. Nearly $2000 was raised for a new school bus. The industrial technology design department secured a private contract to make 300 customised cheese boards, one of which I have and make great use of. Mr Deputy Speaker, if you like, I will get one for you as wellâ€”I am getting a nod from the member in the chair.

        They will be running the fete again next year. I will be very proud to be involved and to be its major sponsor next year. Pacific Pines State High School does a great job; it is well led. I was privileged to speak at their leadership ceremony to induct their new leaders. There is much our community can be proud of with this school and what it is doing.
