       <p>
        On Saturday, 7 September 2013, I made a pledge to the community of Hasluck—which was published in the local media—to engage with my constituents, because I believe that strong families and vibrant communities are an important part of the fabric of our society. A community is a population in a defined area. Within a defined population, people have something in common or share membership of a social organisation. I believe that often we talk about the suburb we live in, but it is really a community; and, if we changed our view of it from an inanimate mass to a vibrant group of people living in a defined area, then I think the wider engagement through events and points of social gathering would enhance the value of that community.

        I grew up in the country town of Corrigin, where belonging and committing to one another underpinned the way in which people connected. When I moved to Perth, I found that people kept to themselves, and I could relate to a

        <i>

        <i>

        </i>
        <i>

        , released in 1972. Bill Withers spent his childhood growing up in the town of

        , Virginia. He moved to

        </a>
        and found himself missing the strong community ethic of his home town, and he penned the lyrics to the song
        <i>
         Lean on Me
        </i>
        , which I related to and still relate to, and I want to cite part of the song:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        You just call on me, brother, when you need a hand
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We all need somebody to lean on
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        I just might have a problem that you'll understand
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We all need somebody to lean on
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Lean on me, when you're not strong
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        And I'll be your friend
       </p>
       <p>
        It is an ethos that I am trying to build through my electorate—that we give each other support in the things that we fight for and believe in.
       </p>
       <p>
        In smaller communities, new people are welcomed and become involved in that way of life that it leaves lingering memories for them. I am committed to working together and I believe that we need to work together in my electorate to build stronger local communities. Many of us belong to one or more of the many sporting, social, cultural, church, worker, professional, recreational, volunteer organisations or
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Returned_Services_League" rel="nofollow">

        subbranches. Every suburb has community groups, not-for-profit organisations, church groups, child care, playgroups, and community events that people can attend.
       </p>
       <p>
        To me, Perth is more than a beach, and I want to place emphasis on the quality of life and accessibility of lifestyle choice for people living in the electorate of Hasluck. We have exciting suburban communities in the east metropolitan region of Perth. Our communities are great places to live. We have great people, great local businesses and some incredible landmarks. But as a community we also face challenges in the future and, with the growing population, our community needs investment. I want to continue to work with all of our community leaders and the people of Hasluck to fight for the resources needed to add value to the way of life they chose when they bought their homes. Earlier today, I spoke of Graeme Harris, who, along with so many others, champion their communities. I believe that stronger local communities are about building the infrastructure, services and social supports that are needed.

        I doorknock two days every month and, every time I go down a street and knock on doors, I find people who are lonely, people whose lives are without human contact. To me, in this day and age, that is sad. If we are going to build stronger local communities, then we need to involve as many as possible of those who are not fortunate enough to have the company that many of us take for granted. I met a fly-in fly-out woman, who was also a wife, sometime ago and I asked her whether she had family here to support her, and she made the comment that she did not. She came from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        and went through Sydney to Perth, and at night-time she had no contact with anyone. In this day and age, to me, that is sad.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are many things I want to focus on: child care, youth, family services, aged care and seniors, disability programs, mental health and improved public transport. A more recent, important one was the Powder Room. Colleen Bitmead came and talked to me about a point of connection for women, and she said she needed a building. So I worked with the Kalamunda shire and we now have a building. There are some 25 women that have come together in the Powder Room. They are looking at women's interests and they are supporting each other, and they are encouraging those who have businesses to connect with other women and to share their experiences but, equally, to teach those who are part of the group. They are excited; they will expand.
       </p>
       <p>
        My commitment is to continue to build the capacity of the people who live within the seat of Hasluck and enjoy the quality of life.
