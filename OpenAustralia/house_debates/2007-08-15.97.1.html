       <p>
        I rise tonight to discuss once again the very important issue of forestry in my electorate. I mentioned last night that approximately $1 billion each year is contributed via the forestry industry. Tasmania grows unique, select timbers, including Huon pine, myrtle, Tasmanian hardwoods, blackwood—the list goes on. The industry contributes over 20 per cent of total manufacturing employment and 25 per cent of total manufacturing wages and salaries, which make up 24 per cent of total industry turnover. The recently announced
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_Head" rel="nofollow">
         Circular Head
        </a>
        and Huon veneer mills are an investment of some $32 million.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 2003-04 the total Tasmanian forest fibre production was over 23 per cent of national production and valued at some $381 million. This figure represents an increase of 65 per cent in value since 1997-98. Since 1997, around $1.4 billion has been invested in the industry. With over 42 per cent of Tasmania’s land mass in either state or national world heritage parks and reserves, the line in the sand has been drawn where the balance is just about right between conservation and forestry. But there is a huge risk.
       </p>
       <p>
        We had the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Rudd, in the electorate only a few weeks ago announcing that he supported the Tasmanian forestry agreements and the policies of the Howard government. The confusion within the electorate is where the shadow minister for the environment stands. This is a crucial issue to people planning for their future, whether they drive a log truck or work in the forestry industry. One only has to look at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Conservation_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Conservation Foundation
        </a>
        , which
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Garrett" rel="nofollow">
         Peter Garrett
        </a>
        led for a three-year term and is patron of. He stated after the most recent announcement and it is worth recalling:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">

       </p>
       <p>
        One million hectares were protected in total after the last election. There are 100 trees per hectare—that is, 100 million trees which are protected. Yet the shadow minister for the environment is still calling for more. According to the

                Tasmania has a lot to lose thanks to logging gone mad. The state’s flourishing tourism industry is threatened by consumer reaction to carnage in the forests.

                There is distress and uncertainty about the futures of the people of the north-west coast. They are concerned about their jobs, their homes, and even such matters as their kids, future schooling arrangements. It is not only on the north-west coast but throughout all of Tasmania where some 10,000 people rely on the industry for work. On the one hand, we have the Leader of the Opposition making one statement and, on the other hand, the shadow minister for the environment, who would be elected, making other statements. How long is it before the real policy is going to be announced?
