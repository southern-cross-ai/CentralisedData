        I rise to read a speech from Abi Julien, a young person who lives in Noranda, in my electorate of Cowan. Abi wrote this speech for the Raise Our Voice program this year, where members raise the voices of young people in parliament. Abi's response is to this year's question, which was: what change would make Australia a better place for future generations? Her speech reads:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Today, I address a very important matter that impacts the very core of our society - the mental health crisis that young Australians are facing. The future of our country is significantly dependent on the well-being of our youth, making it more than just a matter of the present, but one if not acted upon, could span generations.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In Australia, the situation of youth mental health is quite concerning. The data presents a bleak image: 1 in 4 young Australians suffer from mental health problems, and the percentage is rising. If these issues are not resolved, they may cause a lifetime of difficulties, such as strained relationships and interrupted prospects for work and education and possibly end in suicide.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Every year, more than 350 young people between the ages of 18 and 24 commit suicide. It's our friends, our classmates, our family. It's not just numbers on a chart. We need a country where it's okay to say, "I'm not okay, and I need help." A society where it is not seen as a weakness but a strength, because we are not just the future- we are the here and now.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        As we navigate the complex ground of youth mental health, it becomes critical to acknowledge the various difficulties associated with the Internet. The influence of social media on young people's mental health in an age of technological connectivity cannot be overstated.
       </p>

        , while a powerful tool for information and communication, can also be a breeding ground for the detrimental forces affecting the mental health of adolescents. Social media platforms amplify the struggles of young individuals in unique ways. The unrealistic body standards on display can give rise to a variety of issues, including self-esteem problems, body dysmorphia and anxiety, pushing young people further into isolation and depression.
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        In conclusion, the mental health of adolescents is critical to the future of our country and should not be disregarded. By working together, we can create a country that prioritises the health and happiness of its youth, ensuring a more optimistic and promising future for Australia.
       </p>
       <p>
        Well done, Abi, and I wholeheartedly agree with everything that you've said in your speech.
