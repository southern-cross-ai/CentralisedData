        My question is to the Prime Minister. Contrary to the misleading statement made earlier about climate policy by the environment minister, it's the Albanese government that voted with the coalition to frack the Beetaloo basin and to expand gas expansion, even more harmful to short-term global warming with methane emissions. Recent warnings predict we are going to tip over 1.5 degrees by 2027. Do you accept that it is greenwashing to approve new coal and gas projects when the advice is clear that this must stop?

         I thank the member for Warringah for her question. I acknowledge the fact that she has a genuine commitment to act on climate change with the majority of this parliament, but the leadership for that is coming, of course, from government because it's governments that change policy, it's governments that change direction of the country and it's this government that inherited more than a decade of denial, delay and neglect when it came to climate change.
        </p>

         This government was elected with a platform of 43 per cent reduction by 2030, and we delivered that legislation and that target. This government was elected with a platform of net zero by 2050, and we delivered that. This government was elected with a platform of making renewables 82 per cent of our renewable energy market by 2030, and if you look at what has happened to investment in renewables since we were elected, that is happening. Why it's happening is that we have provided investment certainty through the safeguard mechanism that was also delivered by this government. In addition to that, we signed the methane pledge at the

         </a>
         meeting that was held in December of last year.
        </p>
        <p>
         Just on the weekend, in conjunction with the G7 countries meeting in Japan, I engaged constructively with Germany about the opportunity that is there for hydrogen; with the United Kingdom about the opportunity that is there for exchange of critical minerals, and renewables as well; and with Prime Minister Modi, who we'll have further discussions with tomorrow about our renewable energy partnership and what is possible for the benefit of both our countries going forward. We continue also to engage with the United States, which through its Inflation Reduction Act, has by far the most significant investment by any government in driving down emissions not just in the United States but globally as well. The arrangements that we have, which will enable much more cross-fertilisation of engagement through the changes that President Biden is putting forward to Congress, will open up opportunities for business.
        </p>
        <p>
         What we understand is that good action on climate is good for our economy and good for jobs. That's why we're delivering it and that's why this government, including our energy minister and our environment minister, will continue to deliver that better future by acting on climate change.
