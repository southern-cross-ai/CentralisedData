        On behalf of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Committee" rel="nofollow">
         Joint Committee
        </a>
        of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the following report:

        <i>

        <i>
         annual report 2021-22
        </i>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).
       </p>
       <p>
        by leave—I will make a very short tabling statement. We are required by legislation to table an annual report. It's a fascinating read, of course, which I won't regale the House with on this occasion. There are the normal suite of inquiries, you might say, in terms of Auditor-General's reports, examination of the Parliamentary Budget Office and so on. The only one that I'd draw the House's attention to in particular is the 10-year review of the Auditor-General Act 1997. Overall, that review found that the act is working well and made 27 recommendations of varying import for change. I'd like to acknowledge the collaboration and what is a very strong bipartisan tradition of the audit committee. I think all reports were unanimous, a few with additional comments of varying degrees of colour and movement.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I just want to record a special and very personal thanks to the previous chair, the previous member for Robertson, Lucy Wicks. She was collegiate and dedicated in her approach to the committee, and I might declare that we did become very fond of each other—in an entirely appropriate fashion, of course. We come from very different sides of politics but greatly enjoyed working together. I look forward to another productive year of work, collaboratively, with the audit committee.
       </p>
       <p>
        I present executive minutes on reports Nos 486, 488, 489, 490, 491 and 492 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit.
