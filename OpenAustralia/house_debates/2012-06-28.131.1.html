       <p>
        Last Wednesday, I along with the member for Kingston hosted the inaugural function for the Parliamentary Friendship Group of Women in Science, Maths and Engineering. I am pleased to report that it was a great success with so many members of this place supporting it and over 200 people attending. The mission of the Parliamentary Friendship Group of Women in Science, Maths and Engineering has four parts. First, to promote the role and achievements of women in the areas of science, maths and engineering with parliamentarians and the wider community. Second, to encourage more women to consider careers in the areas of science, maths and engineering. Third, to look at any barriers that may exist. And fourth, to connect women in science, maths and engineering with their local parliamentarians in order for them to better understand their respective roles.
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the barriers that is faced by so many women in these fields is exemplified by the example of a constituent of mine, Dr Julia Sarant. Dr Sarant is currently a senior research fellow at the University of Melbourne and is a chief investigator on grants that she has received from the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Research_Council" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Research Council
        </a>
        . Dr Sarant faces the rather farcical situation whereby she can apply for a full-time grant and subsequently go part time; however, she cannot apply directly for a part-time grant. This simply does not make sense. Intended or not, it creates a natural barrier to women, in particular those who wish to balance a career and family life and who would greatly benefit from these more flexible part-time arrangements. There is no logical reason why Dr Sarant should not simply be able to apply for a part-time grant at the outset.
       </p>
       <p>
        But I digress: I wanted to particularly highlight the fact that on last Wednesday night we had over 40 different universities, associations, hospitals and research centres represented, with some of the best and brightest female scientists, engineers and mathematicians in the country and, of course, a couple of men. Nobel laureate Professor Elizabeth Blackburn

        </a>
        spoke as the guest of honour. She spoke about the importance of medical research and science in general, and discussed the challenges faced by women in what is traditionally a male dominated field. However, more interesting, was her take on the different approaches males and females adopt in relation to research and analysis and how vital it is to have a wide and varied mix of methods in order to come to well-informed and well-rounded conclusions.
       </p>

        I would personally like to thank all those who attended—in particular, the Leader of the Opposition,
