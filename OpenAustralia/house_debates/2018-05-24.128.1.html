        I rise to speak of and pay tribute to the vibrant sporting culture in my electorate of Bradfield, a sporting culture which has a strong emphasis on community participation as well as, appropriately, on excellence and achievement. Recently I had the chance to attend the Stewart-Close Cup, a hard-fought local derby between two neighbouring football teams, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kissing_Point" rel="nofollow">
         Kissing Point
        </a>
        and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Pymble" rel="nofollow">
         West Pymble
        </a>
        football clubs. That match was played in a spirit of great competition and great community involvement. Earlier this year I attended the Ku-ring-gai Amateur Swimming Club age championships held at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PLC" rel="nofollow">
         PLC
        </a>
        swimming centre, a magnificent facility. Again, the Ku-ring-gai Amateur Swimming Club has a tremendous culture of participation, with events open to people of all ages. Recently I attended the first game of the season—or games, I should say, quite a number of them—of the Ku-ring-gai Netball Association, held at the Canoon Road netball courts in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Turramurra" rel="nofollow">
         South Turramurra
        </a>
        . As usual, a very large number of girls and women were playing netball, and there were many people there to support and encourage them. I recently had the opportunity to attend the end-of-season awards at the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Ives" rel="nofollow">
         St Ives
        </a>
        Junior Cricket Club at Hassell Park and to present some awards for participation and achievement, including to one of the teams of young girls. Girls have been participating at St Ives Junior Cricket Club for some seasons now, and that's something very much to be celebrated and welcomed.
       </p>
       <p>
        In the last couple of months I've had the opportunity to participate in the Lindfield Rotary Fun Run—which, as its name suggests, winds through Lindfield and Roseville—managing to complete the 10 kilometre course in 51 minutes and seven seconds. My aim was to beat my age, and I just managed that. Earlier I joined in the Kuringgai Chase Fun Run through the streets of North Warrungah, another terrific event with strong community participation, supporting Special Olympics Upper North Shore. Later this year we'll have the San Run For Life through the streets of Wahroonga, and the Bare Creek Trail Run, which commences at Acron Oval in St Ives. There's a very strong culture of community participation in sport, and appropriately for those at the right level, a celebration of excellence and achievement as well. I particularly acknowledge the volunteers, coaches, referees, team managers, everybody who serves on a club committee, and all the mums and dads who make sure that their children of all ages get to events Saturday morning. My electorate around Sydney is very busy as people get to and from sporting events, but I celebrate the vibrant sporting culture in my electorate of Bradfield.
