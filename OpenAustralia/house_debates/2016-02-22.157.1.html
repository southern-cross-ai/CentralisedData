        With my good friend and colleague, the member for Dobell, we attended the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brisbane_Water" rel="nofollow">
         Brisbane Water
        </a>
        Local Area Command medals and award ceremony at Laycock Street Theatre in Gosford to honour some of the hardest-working men and women in my electorate, who dedicate themselves to keeping our streets safe. It is the case right across our region that the police are confronted with demanding and dangerous situations on a regular basis, only to put the safety and security of others above themselves. They serve us sacrificially, but not for praise. I believe it is appropriate to spend this short time today honouring their commitment and sacrifice. It is thanks to our emergency services personnel, like the police of our Local Area Command, that our family and friends can be safe from crime.

        On this occasion, we saw 55 officers from the Brisbane Water command presented with medals. They included Superintendent Danny Sullivan, who was awarded a national police service medal for 27 years of service. Superintendent Sullivan is a fearless and committed leader, and he is a tremendous communicator as well. I have seen his advocacy firsthand through his roles in our local Tackling Drugs &amp; Alcohol Committee, which has engaged local pubs and clubs, and other community members, to help tackle the scourge of illicit drugs in our community. Danny has also spoken up about the need to confront and address the serious issue of domestic violence on the

        . He has been a strong supporter of the need to roll out more crime prevention infrastructure such as better lighting and more

        cameras in my community, which has meant safer streets in locations such as Gosford CBD, Kincumber, Kariong and on the peninsula.
       </p>
       <p>
        What was most inspiring about the medals and awards ceremony in Gosford last week was that keeping our community requires a team of dedicated police men and women of all ranks, ability, roles and experience—like Acting Inspector Sergeant Phil Burgess, who also joined the police force 27 years ago. He shared how detective work has evolved from snail mail and typewriters to infrared technology and facial recognition. He also received a National Police Service Medal, along with Senior Constable Brooke Anderson; Sergeant Steven Carroll; former senior constables Neil Cartland, Heidi McCallum,

        . Sergeant Bruce Coates was awarded his 35-year clasp to his police medal, recognising him as the longest-serving officer in the command. Senior constables Gerard Pasfield and Emily Stallard were awarded the Northern Region Commendation for courage and commitment to duty, which included chasing down an armed criminal on foot. And the Certificate of Merit was awarded to another senior constable, Rhys Kirk, who demonstrated incredible bravery during a terrifying incident in

        . Details of these deeds are not often publicised, in many cases for good reason. So today I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation on behalf of the Central Coast—
