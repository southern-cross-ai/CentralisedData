       <p>
        This is a vitally important motion for all Australians. It raises awareness of the incidence of heart disease within our society and, at the same time, puts heart disease exactly where it should be on the map as the highest killer of Australians. Heart attack claims one Australian life every 47 minutes, and each year almost 4,000 people die of heart attack in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
         New South Wales
        </a>
        alone. More than half of heart-attack deaths occur before a person reaches a hospital. In an area I represent in this parliament, the Hunter-New England area, 350 people die of heart attack each year. This shows just how important it is that, as a nation, we address and recognise the importance of having a healthy cardiovascular system.
       </p>
       <p>
        The motion before the House notes that cardiovascular disease is not only heart attack but also stroke and blood vessel disease. These diseases are intertwined and have very similar causes. They kill an enormous number of Australians and affect more than 3.4 million Australians each year. These diseases impact on people's ability to live whole and full lives, to be able to participate in employment and to enjoy sport and exercise at the level other Australians can. I know that members in this House have similar experiences to the experience I had last week, where I was talking to a constituent about their son who has a severe heart condition and is prevented from working. It has impacted on every aspect of his life, and at the same time it has caused depression, which is one of the side effects of cardiovascular disease.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is important to note that there are things people can do and there are causes of heart disease. At the top of the list of causes is tobacco smoking. We need to exercise more. We need to eat properly. Alcohol consumption is another contributor to heart disease. So is high blood pressure. It is important that people monitor their blood pressure at all times. Something as simple as having a regular blood test to check the level of cholesterol that people have in their blood can be one of the most significant steps a person can take to lower their risk of cardiovascular disease. Diabetes and renal failure also contribute to heart disease. Many of these factors can be changed, and by changing these factors people immediately reduce their risk of heart disease. Another aspect of cardiovascular disease—and I am talking about heart attacks here—is that it is really important to recognise the fact that you are having a heart attack. There is the 'golden hour' where, if within that hour people recognise that they are having a heart attack and get treatment, their clinical outcome is much better. People have been surveyed in the area that I live in and 39 per cent of the people who were surveyed said that, if they thought they were having a heart attack, they would wait a while and see what happened. Another 68 per cent were unaware of what heart attack symptoms were, 49 per cent would not know what to do if they were having a heart attack and 24 per cent would make sure that they were having a heart attack before they called the ambulance. There is one thing that you do if you think you may be having a heart attack: call 000. Seek help immediately because, as I mentioned, that golden hour really contributes to your outcome. So what are the warning signs of a heart attack? I think it is really important to say here that no two heart attacks are the same. People can have chest pain or pain in their arms, their shoulders, their neck, their jaw or their back. They can feel short of breath, they can feel nauseous, they can have a cold sweat or they can be dizzy or lightheaded. These are all signs of a heart attack. So there is no one fit for all.

        I was at the launch of Go Red for Women on 6 May in the Hunter, and I will talk a little bit more about that in a moment. A speaker at the launch was a woman who had suffered a heart attack and her symptom was heartburn. She had had heartburn for a few days before. She said, 'I was just throwing down the antacid and it kept coming back.' She had her grandchildren when she had her heart attack. She was very fortunate that her young grandchild called the ambulance and she got to hospital. She thought that she was healthy. She was a very active woman in her late 50s or 60s. She worked and assisted with the care of her grandchildren. She exercised and she did not smoke. But the one thing that she did not check on was her cholesterol level. It is so important that people embrace the message put out by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_Foundation" rel="nofollow">
         Heart Foundation
        </a>
        .
       </p>
       <p>
        As I mentioned earlier, on 6 May I launched the Heart Foundation's Go Red for Women campaign in the Hunter. It is a campaign designed to raise awareness of heart disease in women. The facts relating to women and heart disease are really frightening and I do not think that they are recognised. The first thing is: what is the biggest killer of women in Australia? The No. 1 killer is heart disease. It kills four times as many women as breast cancer does. Most people do not know that. I think it is a really frightening fact. People tend to think that heart disease is something that just affects older men. Wrong. Almost as many women die from heart disease as men. So it is very important that women take responsibility for their health. Do not ignore those little signs. Act to turn it around. The message of the Go Red for Women campaign this year encourages women to take action. Part of taking action and something that women can do is joining the Healthy Heart Challenge. I have signed up for the Healthy Heart Challenge and it starts on 1 June. It was trialled in Queensland last year and I was an outsider who signed up. Following the guidelines of the challenge, I managed to lose 10 kilos over a period of time. There are tips on improving nutrition, because nutrition is very important, and tips on being active. The approach that I am taking this year is to try to increase my physical activity. I have put down a few goals. The first thing I am going to do is start a walking group. The first one of our walks will be leaving the start of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernleigh_Track" rel="nofollow">
         Fernleigh Track
        </a>
        in Belmont on 4 June this year. The following week I am looking to have one down at
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buff_Point" rel="nofollow">
         Buff Point
        </a>
        , in the southern part of my electorate. So at 8.30 in the morning on 4 June I hope that I have a number of people join me for that walk.
       </p>
       <p>
        Given the importance of heart disease and the importance of the Heart Foundation, I would like members who are speaking in this debate today to join with me to become friends of the Heart Foundation and fight cardiovascular disease. I would like to start a group here in parliament. It is very, very important that we get out there and get the message to all Australians. We need to take it back to our electorates. We can change things simply by taking action.

        <p>
         I rise today to support the motion put forward by my colleague the member for Shortland on the seriousness of cardiovascular disease and its implications for the health of Australians. Cardiovascular disease is a heart and blood vessel disease that kills one Australian every 11 minutes. Sadly, I have had a long and personal association with sufferers of cardiovascular disease. In my time as director of Aboriginal health in
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_South_Wales" rel="nofollow">
          New South Wales
         </a>
         and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
          Western Australia
         </a>
         , I had the opportunity to visit and spend time with cardiovascular disease patients in programs on both sides of the country.
        </p>
        <p>
         Cardiovascular disease covers all diseases and conditions of the heart and blood vessels. There are many forms and causes of diseases in this diverse group. The main underlying problem is atherosclerosis. In this condition, abnormal build-ups of fat, cholesterol and other substances occur in the inner lining of arteries. It is most serious when it affects the blood supply to the heart, causing angina or heart attack, or to the brain, which can lead to a stroke. It is a slow and complex process, often starting in childhood, and it progresses with age.
        </p>
        <p>
         The major preventable risk factors for cardiovascular disease are tobacco smoking, high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, insufficient physical activity, overweight and obesity, poor nutrition, diabetes and risky alcohol consumption. It is estimated that 92 per cent of Australian adults have at least one risk factor and almost 40 per cent have three or more risk factors. I would hazard a guess that many of us in this House belong to that 40 per cent.
        </p>
        <p>
         Cardiovascular disease affects more than 3.4 million Australians and prevents 1.4 million from living a full life because of the disability caused by it. In 2008, for example, it claimed the lives of almost 50,000 Australians. Cardiovascular disease is the most expensive disease group in terms of direct healthcare expenditure, at $5.9 billion. Advances in cardiovascular disease research, detection, prevention and care management plans have seen a reduction in the loss of life. I have lost family members to this disease and know firsthand the pain and suffering that those left behind must go through every day of their waking lives as they miss a member of the family. The tragedy is that the majority of these deaths were preventable.
        </p>
        <p>
         I commend successive governments for their work in helping to change the culture of smoking in Australia. It is having an effect. When you travel overseas, one of the first things you notice is how many people are smoking and where they are allowed to smoke. Returning to Australia, it is nice to be able to breathe fresh air, most of the time, without someone blowing smoke in your face. This antismoking effort has long been bipartisan in Australia, and long may it continue. But there needs to be more effort to re-engage those people in Australia who are under the impression that, if we do not smoke, then our risk of cardiovascular disease is very low. Unfortunately this is not the case. Many of us now live very sedentary lifestyles. We get in the car, go to work, come home and sit down to work or watch television. This is understandable, especially as people are working more hours now than ever before.
        </p>
        <p>
         A result of this increased work-life imbalance is poor nutrition. After a long day it is often too easy to get a takeaway meal or cook something very basic at home. This is why places like
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McDonald's" rel="nofollow">
          McDonald's
         </a>
         and
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungry_Jack's" rel="nofollow">
          Hungry Jack's
         </a>
         become very popular, because of the convenience aspect. This can lead to high blood pressure, being overweight, diabetes and increasing cholesterol levels.
        </p>
        <p>
         Kidney failure as a result of the above is a devastating long-term health consequence which kills thousands of Australians every year. I know people that receive regular dialysis and it is very challenging for them personally and for the families who have to care for that person. There are many initiatives to try and warn the public of the dangers of cardiovascular disease, but often we are too busy to hear them. However, I commend these efforts.
        </p>
        <p>
         I would like, not dissimilarly to my colleague, to put on the record the warning signs of a heart attack, so that people reading this might call for an ambulance if they notice the symptoms themselves or in someone else. Discomfort or pain in the centre of the chest is a key signal of an impending heart attack. Along with this is discomfort in the arms or neck, shoulders, jaw or the back. Other signs include shortness of breath, dizziness, nausea, cold sweats or light-headedness. I too would like to call on more Australians to take a senior first aid course so they can help save the life of someone having a heart attack. Just last week, I saw a person being resuscitated on the side of the road not far from my electoral office. The people kept the man alive until an ambulance could fight its way through peak hour traffic. Those few moments are crucial. Without
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPR" rel="nofollow">
          CPR
         </a>
         , many people that are here today would have passed away before help could arrive.
        </p>
        <p>
         But we know of course that prevention is better than a cure. I support local initiatives such as the 'walk to work and 'walk to school' days when they arise, and when taking public transport I try and get off a stop early so that I am forced to walk to my destination. Just 30 minutes a day of regular walking or exercise makes a dramatic difference to a person's cardiovascular health. None of these things are easy. Most of us are so busy we hardly take time to relax, let alone exercise. But it is also important that more effort needs to be made to ensure we live productive and healthier lives. I would like this House to note that the recognition of a heart attack and an early response increases cardiovascular awareness which, in turn, saves lives and prevents a related disability. I would also like this House to acknowledge that the promotion of healthy eating and increased exercise will lead to healthier lifestyles and a reduction in cardiovascular disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         Like the member for Shortland, I have been part of many programs in this country that have shaped some thinking around compliance with medications. But in addition to the compliance with medications and the management plans that are put in place, there is the whole notion that exercise is absolutely critical, along with the reduction of the factors that cause cardiovascular disease.
        </p>
        <p>
         In New South Wales I had the opportunity of working with a group of people who developed a program called the Mini Olympics. What was incredible was that people with chronic diseases, in particular cardiovascular diseases, used to come to these Mini Olympics. They did it for two reasons. One was that they shared information about what their health problem was and what they could do about it and they could take tips from each other in order to improve both their physical health condition and also their mental condition. Taking a positive attitude alleviates the depression that people often feel when they get a debilitating illness or a disease that in a sense creates a disability for them.
        </p>
        <p>
         I was asked to join in and I lined up behind a lady who had had a significant heart attack requiring open heart surgery. They had lines marked so that when you were playing in the Mini Olympics you stood according to your degree of incapability or the stress it would put on you. I took my turn and stood on the front line and she said, 'Hey, you, back here. You have not had a heart attack. You have not had an operation so you have to stand on the back line in order to play.'
        </p>
        <p>
         The thing I liked was the competitiveness between the towns in the south-eastern region of New South Wales where they do this. The other element was the way in which they would talk quite openly about the cardiovascular diseases, the doctors and the specialists they had. And they helped each other. They talked about nutrition, the exercises they did and the things that they did when they were alone at home. So it did not become a barrier. What I liked was the positivity. I too join with the member for Shortland in any work that we do around increasing the knowledge of cardiovascular disease and the way we can prevent it.
        </p>
        <p>
         But more important is bring quality to the lives of families, particularly those who have lost someone as well. Too often I have seen individuals impacted by the loss of a life due to a heart attack. But the more telling one is those who have strokes. I have seen some very capable and gifted people lose their capability to communicate and to do the things they had been doing prior to the stroke. The frustration that one must feel within that body would be quite noticeable, and I hope that I never reach that stage. I must admit that my other half has bought me one of those elliptical walking machines in order for me to lose weight. It is so easy for us as members of this House to accumulate weight because of all the functions we attend, the commitments that we have and the sedentary life that we lead in this chamber.

         <p>
          I am very pleased to speak on the member for Shortland's motion about cardiovascular disease, and I applaud her for it. As the member has pointed out, cardiovascular disease is a heart, stroke and blood vessel disease. Alarmingly, cardiovascular disease kills one Australian every 11 minutes, and affects more than 3.4 million Australians or two out of three families. In 2008 the disease was responsible for 34 per cent of all deaths in Australia. Sadly, many of these deaths are preventable through the right diet, lifestyle choices and medical treatment. As the member for Shortland and the member for Hasluck have pointed out, the risk factors include smoking, high blood cholesterol, obesity, alcohol consumption, high blood pressure, renal failure and diabetes.

          According to the

           National Health
          </a>
          and
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_Research_Council" rel="nofollow">
           Medical Research Council
          </a>
          , cardiovascular disease was significantly higher in females, at 55 per cent compared with males at 45 per cent. Cardiovascular disease is also identified as one of the leading causes of disability with about 1.4 million Australians estimated to have a disability associated with cardiovascular conditions. In 2008, the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Institute_of_Health_and_Welfare" rel="nofollow">
           Australian Institute of Health and Welfare
          </a>
          reported that cardiovascular disease is the most expensive disease group in terms of direct healthcare expenditure—$5.9 billion. Because of the known cost to the community and the potential for prevention, much funding has gone into research on cardiovascular diseases. In fact, between 2000 and 2007,
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHMRC" rel="nofollow">
           NHMRC
          </a>
          invested over $439.5 million in research. Knowing the signs of heart attack can also help response time and could save lives and prevent related disability, as pointed out by both the member for Shortland and the member for Hasluck. It bears mentioning the signs again—discomfort or pain in the chest, arms, neck, shoulders, jaw or back, shortness of breath, nausea, cold sweats, dizziness or light-headedness. Cardiovascular disease is a very serious health problem in Australia. However, continued efforts to raise awareness and encourage positive change will make a big difference, as the members have previously pointed out.

          The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare published some positive results in 2004—a fall in the death rate from heart, stroke and vascular disease coincided with a 21 per cent and a 16 per cent fall in smoking rates for males and females respectively over the decade. It also coincided with a 50 per cent fall in the prevalence of high blood pressure since the 1980s and a 25 per cent fall in the incidence of coronary events in the last decade. It also highlighted that over the same period there was a rapid increase in community use of prescription drugs to lower blood pressure and blood cholesterol, and antiplatelet drugs.

          Despite the declining rates of certain health problems, there are many others on the rise that contribute to cardiovascular disease, notably obesity, which you, Mr Deputy Speaker Georganas, know all about with your great work in the last parliament on the inquiry dealing with obesity. On 13 May this year the Minister for Health launched a Swap It, Don't Stop It campaign, which urges Australians to make simple lifestyle changes to become healthier by swapping large meals for smaller meals, frequent treats for occasional treats, fried food for fresh food and stationary activities for more active pursuits. The Swap It campaign follows on from the
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measure_Up" rel="nofollow">
           Measure Up
          </a>
          campaign and is directed particularly at 20- to 25-year-olds with children. It is increasingly important that adults take the lead in healthier lifestyle choices and provide the right example for their children. On 16 March this year I was delighted to join parents, staff and students at the National Ride2School Day at St Mark's Primary School in Drummoyne in my electoral of Reid. In a sea of scooters, bikes and skateboards, the students were thoroughly thrilled to have made it to school on their own wheels. The strong support for the federal government's initiative was clearly evident and would not be possible without the encouragement and interests of teachers and parents. I congratulate the St Mark's Primary School community for showing their support for Ride2School Day and I extend my congratulations to many other schools in my electorate of Reid that also participated in that event. More recently our government has also encouraged students to walk to school. I know many students in my electorate and elsewhere have participated in this program also and I again applaud all participants for taking the time to encourage healthier lifestyles and lifestyle choices.

          Australia is very lucky to enjoy a temperate climate that facilitates many outdoor activities and an abundance of fresh fruit and vegetables, meat and dairy products. I applaud the initiative of the member for Shortland today in promoting a healthy lifestyle and I commend her in her efforts to establish a parliamentary group of friends of the

           I am sure all my colleagues on this side of the House support the general intention of this motion on cardiovascular disease. The coalition will always support sensible proposals, and this is no exception. I was particularly encouraged to speak on this motion today given the

           's launch of this year's Go Red for Women campaign, which unites women in the fight against heart disease, the biggest killer of Australian women. Surprisingly, a woman is four times more likely to die of heart disease than of breast cancer.

           While there is little doubt that we have largely eliminated many fatal diseases that still afflict less developed and less affluent countries, we still have significant health problems. These are often of our own making through overconsumption and inactivity. Cardiovascular disease is high on the list of such diseases, affecting 3.4 million people and resulting in the death of one person every 11 minutes. This, despite heart diseases being in many cases simply a by-product of personal lifestyle choices.
          </p>
          <p>
           Surgical treatment of advanced cardiovascular disease is expensive and frequently does not result in a good outcome. In sharp contrast, early diagnosis and preventive treatment normally provides a much better outcome at a significantly lower financial cost. Clearly then our responsibility in this place is to ensure that all Australians are aware of these stark facts and are encouraged to seek medical advice in any case of doubt. Symptoms of cardiovascular disease may be present quite early, particularly if predisposing factors such as smoking, being overweight or high blood pressure are present.
          </p>
          <p>
           In light of the benefits of an early diagnosis, research is currently being conducted at the
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Queensland" rel="nofollow">

           in my electorate of Ryan into detecting heart disease through a simple saliva test. This is the first research of its kind conducted in Australia, and the team at the University of Queensland has made significant inroads. Currently heart disease is diagnosed through a biomolecule taken from blood. However, Dr Charmindie Punyadeera and her team have made a huge breakthrough by identifying the same biomolecule in saliva. This means that patients can receive a highly accurate non-invasive diagnosis in less than 15 minutes, making early detection and treatment of cardiovascular disease much more successful. Such research could lead to cardiac patients being able to monitor and treat their disease effectively from the comfort of their own home, ensuring considerably less stress and saving government and individuals alike on health costs. The benefits of this research alone demonstrate the need for continued funding of medical research.

           No-one would seriously recommend a strategy of running their car until it breaks down before getting it serviced, so why would one follow such a policy with their own health? As with servicing a car, a regular check-up visit to one's doctor is really the only sensible course.
          </p>

           In conclusion, may I reiterate my support for moves to make a preventive approach the default in dealing with

           cardiovascular disease and similar diseases affected by lifestyle which afflict Australians. Success in this endeavour will bring a health and lifestyle bonus to a significant number of Australians while reducing needless demands on the public purse, and is therefore very worthwhile.

           I commend the suggestion of the member for Shortland that we in this place should become more active. I note that one of the six key goals for women—and the challenge for the Go Red for Women campaign is that we adopt one of these six key goals—is to be active every day, so perhaps in this place more of us should take the stairs instead of catching the elevator. I look forward to congestion on the stairways in
