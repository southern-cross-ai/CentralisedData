        I endorse the very fine remarks of the safe seat member for Kingston. It was a good day and I thank her for her cooperation in organising it.
       </p>
       <p>
        I rise today to reflect on the council elections in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         South Australia
        </a>
        on the weekend, particularly those councils in my area, and the changes to some of the mayoral arrangements in local government. Particularly I want to pay tribute to three mayors who are no longer continuing, either by retirement or by the decision of electors. The first is Peter Whitford, who has retired as Mayor of Yankalilla. Peter has been a stalwart of local government in South Australia in the Yankalilla area. He was first elected to the Myponga ward in 1981. He has represented that ward since that time and in the last several elections has been the mayor for the area and has done an outstanding job, particularly in taking up the digital

        issue, which of course is a big issue in the area of Yankalilla, which has not had access to digital TV. Peter’s son-in-law,

        , is a state member of parliament, so Peter has had a long-time involvement with the political system. I thank Peter and Madge for their service to the community and wish them well in their future.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also thank the retiring Mayor of

        , Mary-Lou Corcoran, who comes from a different political colour to me but I must say did an absolutely outstanding job in her four years as mayor. Far be it for those on the other side to take my advice, but I would have thought that, given the state of the current state Labor Party, it would be a very, very wise choice if they made sure that there was a seat—

          I think she is actually moving into areas which you would be more interested in, member for Kingston. It would be good if she were put into state parliament, which I understand is her desire, because I think she would make a good contribution, although obviously I do not necessarily agree with everything she pursues.
         </p>
         <p>
          The final person I would like to mention is Mayor Bill Cooksley, who was unsuccessful in his bid for re-election in the

           Adelaide Hills Council
          </a>
          . I pay tribute to Bill. We have not necessarily always agreed with each other on different issues, but he has served his community extremely well in his time and I wish him very well in the future. I am sure Bill will stay involved in local issues.
         </p>
         <p>
          I congratulate those who were re-elected: in
