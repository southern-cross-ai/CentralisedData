        Today I want to bring to the attention of the House something that I am very proud of—the wonderful example of the public education system in my electorate of Canberra. Last Wednesday evening, I had the pleasure of attending the 10th birthday celebration of Lanyon

        is in the southern end of my electorate and it services the newest urban area in it. Lanyon High School turning 10 was a very big event, but what really pleased me was to see such wonderful examples of the public education system and the teachers in it doing such a terrific job.
       </p>
       <p>
        We had singing groups, drama, Shakespeare, several short films and dance items, all coming from the students, with the films written and produced by the students. We also had juniors from the feeder primary schools of

        coming along and participating at what will probably be their high school of the future.
       </p>
       <p>
        I put on record my congratulations, in particular to all of the staff and all of the helpers at Lanyon High School, on this terrific example of what they are achieving. Academically, they are doing wonderfully well, and this 10th birthday celebration went so well. My best wishes also, of course, go to every one of the students, whether they be from Lanyon or from Conder, Tharwa or Bonython primary schools. Thank you for a wonderful evening.
