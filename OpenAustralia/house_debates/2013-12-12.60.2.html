        As the House would know, along with the Leader of the Opposition I had the honour of travelling to
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa" rel="nofollow">
         South Africa
        </a>
        to represent our country at the memorial service for
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelson_Mandela" rel="nofollow">
         Nelson Mandela
        </a>
        . I have to say that it had, as is fitting, the air of a celebration much more than the air of a funeral. While we were sorry to see him leave us, we were thrilled that he had had such a long life full of such splendid example. Nelson Mandela was not only the father of modern South Africa but also one of the giants of the 20th century. He taught the world how to forgive and he taught the leaders of Africa how to leave office peacefully. These are very substantial lessons indeed.
       </p>
       <p>
        As President Barack Obama said in his splendid panegyric, what seems obvious and inevitable to us now seemed impossible when Nelson Mandela began his long campaign. To us, a democratic, multiracial South Africa seems the natural order of things but in the mid-1960s it must have seemed an impossible dream. But it was achieved because one man had the guts, the decency and the idealism to fix on this and to see it through to the very end. Whatever the hardship, whatever the risk, whatever the difficulty, he was determined to see it through.
       </p>
       <p>
        All the people of modern South Africa, all the people of Africa and indeed all of us everywhere are the better off for his life. He was a man in form—he was a person who achieved extraordinary things although he was always at pains to point out he was just an ordinary man. The lesson that we take from his life is that we can all do extraordinary things if we have the courage to dream, if we strive constantly to be not just what we want to be but to be always our best selves. He will be missed, not just by the people of South Africa but by the people of Australia too.

         I, too, rise to record my deep regret that on 5 December

          South Africa
         </a>
         , passed away. I acknowledge the Deputy Prime Minister and my own deputy, the member for Sydney, for their notable words on this motion in the House earlier this week. Nelson Mandela was arguably one of the world's greatest figures of our time. It is true what many have said this week in Johannesburg, that we will never see his like again.
        </p>
        <p>
         In troubled times in South Africa Nelson Mandela stood tall. He led his nation out of an incredibly difficult time; not with a violent struggle but with peace, compassion and the force of moral leadership. It is impossible to imagine what 27 years in prison would do to one's spirit, but in the case Nelson Mandela it steeled his resolve. He suffered so his people could be free. Nelson Mandela was a symbol to the rest of the world. He achieved perhaps more than any other world leader in his pursuit of peace, acceptance and justice. His example to all of us is as powerful today as it was 20 years ago when he was released from prison. The slow struggle for reconciliation does not end with Mandela's passing, not for South Africa and not for any of us. Let us renew our resolve for reconciliation. Let us think of Nelson Mandela in hard times and forge on with his strength in our hearts. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family, his country and all of those who look to him and hope for a better world. We are all the better because of Nelson Mandela's life—may he rest in peace.

          I thank those members who have signed the condolence book, which will now be returned to the embassy, expressing individual messages from individual members. The question is that the motion be agreed to. I ask all present, including those in the gallery, to signify their approval by rising in their places.
