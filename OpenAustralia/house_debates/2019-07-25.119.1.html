         The amendment that's in front of us the opposition is just working through now. We take the government at its word that it's not controversial, but, with respect for due process, we're going through it now. We don't in any way want this to undermine the fact that this is a very important, bipartisan moment for the parliament. What's happening right now is that, in many ways, the parliament is taking Australia's reputation and Australia's relationship with our neighbours very seriously.
        </p>
        <p>
         We're working through the amendment right now. For the sake of detail, I might invite the minister, if he has some specific notes—he might; he might not—to give a quick description. If not, for the benefit of the House I might read out the amendment that's in front of us, just so that everybody, when they're voting, knows exactly what they're dealing with:

         I'm sure that will help everyone listening on the radio—

         (5A)   However, the Joint Authority must not consent under section 270 of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006 to the surrender, in whole or in part, of the new licence unless the pipeline to which the licence relates has been removed from the surrender area to the satisfaction of NOPSEMA.

        </p>
        <p>
         The shadow minister has just left the chamber to, I think, get that detail confirmed right now. So, in terms of the process, I let people know that we'll be dealing with this quickly for the very simple reason that we all want to make sure that, before we hit half past four, we haven't got through just this bill but also the two ancillary bills that are attached to it. We'll be limiting speeches accordingly to make sure that's dealt with. I'll stop now.

         <p>
          In the short time available to us, we've come to the conclusion that we have not been consulted on this. We're happy to be corrected if that is untrue, but we are unaware of it. I can't have any confidence that I know what this amendment does. I have a fair idea and I'm fairly relaxed about it. On the basis that I doubt very much, on what is very much a bipartisan issue, that the government would put forward anything that would disturb us, the opposition is prepared, regrettably in the circumstances, to support the amendment.

           I'm advised this was provided to your office two days ago, but we appreciate that the shadow minister may not have seen it. This amendment essentially ensures that the relevant section of the pipeline be removed before the Australian licence for the pipeline, and therefore the responsibilities of the relevant licensee will end. It's a technical amendment just to ensure the intention, as has always been the intention of both sides of the House, is given effect. We believe it's an uncontroversial amendment but appreciate the shadow minister needs to look at it at the very least. But I think it's very uncontroversial.
