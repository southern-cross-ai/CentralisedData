        On Saturday night I had the chance to do something I haven't done for a while, which was to attend a debutante ball. In this case, it was organised by Butucarbin, a not-for-profit
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Nations" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        community group doing tremendous work in the Chifley electorate. I'm proud of my longstanding relationship with that group and even prouder of the dedication of Aunty Jenny Beale and Uncle Jack Gibson. It was a pleasure to accept their invite to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NAIDOC" rel="nofollow">
         NAIDOC
        </a>
        debutante ball, representing the Prime Minister.
       </p>
       <p>
        Debutante balls might seem pretty old school, but I've got to say I love the way that Butucarbin have taken on the concept and used it as a platform to celebrate young First Nations people, bringing the community together and teaching a few handy skills along the way. No doubt a few of the young fellas there were learning how to dance much better, and there's also a dressmaking program to learn how to design and sew. In particular, it has also been good to see the incorporation of First Nations culture within that. For anyone who's interested in learning more, Nakkiah Lui and Miranda Tapsell did a whole podcast series talking about not just this debutante ball but the way that debutante balls have been used by First Nations communities to celebrate their young. I just want to congratulate them on that—and also on the message that Minister Burney provided in a speech by video to commend the debutantes, as the federal government seeks to enshrine in the Constitution the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice to Parliament. So, well done to them.
       </p>
       <p>
        I also want to use this opportunity to recognise some of the great work being done by sporting clubs in our area. The
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacktown_City_Football_Club" rel="nofollow">

        won the grand final of the National Premier Leagues New South Wales Men's Championship—a huge effort from the high-performing team to deliver another great result.
       </p>
       <p>
        I want to congratulate local

        in Birmingham. That makes it her third Commonwealth Games gold medal, a tremendous effort.
       </p>
       <p>
        Finally, I want to give a shout-out to Ian and Taylor Wilson from the Plumpton Braves Baseball Club for 20 years of service to the club—a tremendous effort. They've been incredibly hard workers for the community. And I'm pleased to see both the Lakhota and Omaha teams make it past the semifinal rounds. Go Braves! I proudly display a Plumpton Braves baseball in the office. It is terrific to see community champions like the Taylors do their work. To all the sports clubs in our area, who enrich our community life: thank you very much for all your hard work.
