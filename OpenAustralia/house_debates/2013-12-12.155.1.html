       <p>
        In my first speech, I was able to thank those who supported the Labor campaign in Scullin and whose efforts, much more than mine, made it a successful one. I take this opportunity in this place to thank those who made particularly significant contributions to the Labor cause in the recent election in addition to those I have already thanked. I start with the Jenkins family, most especially Michele and Amanda, for their kindness, advice and hard work. I hope they are enjoying seeing more of Harry.
       </p>
       <p>
        As I said in my first speech, I was very fortunate to have an extraordinary campaign committee to work with and for. I thank Ellen and Brian Smiddy. When I think of our party at its very best, of its soul really, I think of Ellen and of Brian. I thank Sam Spadafora, who showed extraordinary leadership and particularly looked after me on election day, better than I could have hoped for. I thank my good mate and comrade Greg Bulliff. I extend my best wishes to Greg and his wife-to-be, Shani. I thank Trish Makin. I thank Barbara Breaks, John Pathinathan and Ray Rosales, three people who, despite personal challenges, put in an extraordinary contribution to the Labor cause. I thank Vince and Sandra O'Grady, who did everything and more for my campaign and who inspire me every day. I thank Armen Emirizan; Arthur Yong;

        ; Pam McLeod, a giant of the community of Melbourne's north, as you well know, Mr Deputy Speaker Mitchell; Sofia Kotanidis; Kim Travers; and Cassandra Kemp. I thank Yogi Thurairatnam and his extra extended family, who did so much around

        , and, rounding out the campaign committee, a wonderful group of young activists: Alahna Desiato, Samil Demir, Matthew Rossi, Adam Bullock, Matthew O'Keefe, Dominique Ottobre, Berna Doksatli, Varnan Garnash and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_McDonald" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . I enjoyed working for all these people and I enjoy being guided by them as I go about my work.
       </p>
       <p>
        Beyond this formal campaign committee, many others did so much in shaping and supporting Labor's campaign in Scullin. I take this opportunity to acknowledge in particular the efforts of Jenny Mikakos

        and Demi Tsiogris; Chris Piper and Virginia Wellard, who are often lent to me, and I appreciate all their work; my old friend and cricketing colleague Shaun Thomas, who took time off work to assist me doing unglamorous but important work; Councillors Kris Pavlidis, Adrian Spinelli and

       <p>
        When I think back to the recent election campaign, I think of early mornings at train stations, of stuffing envelopes, of doorknocking and letterboxing—unglamorous but vital work. I think of the efforts of the many booth captains—too many people to thank even now, but there are many who went beyond the call of duty. I mention now Elinor Summers,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nathan_Roberts" rel="nofollow">

        and all the members of the La Trobe

        Club, people who tell me that our movement and politics have a bright future. I mention also

       </p>
       <p>
        Last but not least I think of some old friends who helped out, many of whom do not have the depth of commitment to the Labor Party of those I have mentioned earlier:

        </a>
        , Lisa Knott, Andrew Wear, Claire Hockley, Cain Jackson, Martha Zakharakis, Jonathan Gurry, Jane Fennessy, Eric Locke, Sally Maddison and Dean Tighe. You gave me extraordinary support in the recent election campaign, but more importantly you have shaped my life in getting me to this point. It is my great privilege to have known you and to have enjoyed your support. All of those who made a contribution to Labor's campaign in Scullin are people whose debt I am in and will remain in. It has been my privilege to work with you all and all constituents of Scullin. I look forward to continuing to do so and I commit to not letting you down.
