        I know that the Prime Minister elect has referred to rescuing a government that had lost its way, but I remind Australians that what we have in Prime Minister elect Gillard is a minister who has walked out on a ministry that lost its way years ago. We know about the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Building_the_Education_Revolution" rel="nofollow">
         Building the Education Revolution
        </a>
        —we know about the $5 billion that disappeared into the pockets of state governments, project managers and assorted spivs. We know about the $1.7 billion that was sold by Prime Minister elect Gillard as an expansion of the program but was just another blow-out. We know that only 30 per cent of those school laptops have been delivered, and that so many of the children waiting on that election promise of 2007 are yet to touch and feel a laptop. We know that only 13 of the 2,650 trades training centres have even been built. Parents, promised so much more, have seen so little from this Prime Minister elect. And, finally, only 38 of the 260 promised childcare centres have actually been delivered, and that means that every childcare centre in the area of Redlands secretly fears a ‘

        memorial childcare centre’ right next to their own. It is a dreadful predicament we are left in with education—and this is a Prime Minister who promises a fairer go.

        But don’t just believe me. Once again, I have asked anyone who is not a party member who wishes to communicate with me on Facebook to have their say, and here they are. Glenn Irvine from Capalaba says:

        There is a name for someone who one day categorically denies leadership intentions, and the next, stages a coup for that leadership… it is called “Raw Ambition” …

        From Gabby Lewis:

        Rudd was not bad! he was doing fine! Gillard is bad! just because she is a woman people think she will do better i strongly disagree

       <p class="italic">
        I believe Australians are switched on enough to see this for what it is. A blatant re-establishment of the time-honoured tradition of unions manipulating the strings of Australian parliament and government as a whole.

        It is not fair that it wasn’t a full vote! They can’t just decide to change it with only 100 odd people voting.

        She says that Rudd was doing just fine.

       <p class="italic">
        … many professionals are worried about the amount of muscle that has been shown by the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWU" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Many support the decision to oust the duddster however are scared and shocked that the unions had so much power over the situation … just a thought to chew on.
       </p>
       <p>
        There you see a very clear message from my local people. Many are concerned that we are returning to a period of ‘bash of the boss’, a
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hood" rel="nofollow">
         Robin Hood
        </a>
        period where anything that is good for Labor is automatically fairer. Ordinary people in my electorate have not been well served in the last two years. They are tired of those promises and they know you could not slide a piece of paper between Prime Minister elect Gillard and
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Rudd" rel="nofollow">
         Kevin Rudd
        </a>
        . She is behind all of those same mistakes. For her to foist them on the previous Prime Minister is disappointing to the electors in my area. To see her again mouth the mantra of toughness on borders without a clue as to how to deliver it shows that she is just another potential Labor leader who walks down one side of the street trying to keep her Labor members happy and then down the other side trying to talk tough to the general population.
       </p>
       <p>
        What she is doing is leaving Education behind, in a mess, to take up the reins of the country. I suspect that the people of Redlands will not forget that. Whether you send your kids to child care but you have had your indexation frozen, or you have had the rebates capped or cut and the prices for child care go up, you will not forget the previous responsibilities of Prime Minister elect Gillard. If you are going to school and you have not seen laptop computers or you have them but they are not insured or there is no broadband on which to run them, you know to blame Prime Minister elect Julia Gillard. And, if you are waiting for a trades training centre but there is not even a lathe in your school, then you know you need to blame this Prime Minister elect, Julia Gillard.
