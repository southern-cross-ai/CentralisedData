        Buying a brand-new home in a brand-new housing estate should be an exciting and happy time for any family, especially when they've bought in at a premium price, with the promise of first-rate community facilities, infrastructure and services. But, for residents of the Ashbury housing estate in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armstrong_Creek" rel="nofollow">
         Armstrong Creek
        </a>
        , within my electorate, it hasn't turned out as promised. They've been badly let down by their council, the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Greater_Geelong" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . Council has failed to ensure delivery of much promised infrastructure and services.
       </p>
       <p>
        I met with a group of Ashbury residents recently and was dismayed to hear of the challenges they and their children are facing in getting basic services like walking and bike paths, playgrounds, sporting and community facilities and road traffic safety treatments. They were promised these facilities by council, and they were told they would be well and truly delivered by now. But, instead of playing fields, there is a mosquito-ridden drainage swamp. Instead of 18 kilometres of bike and walking paths, there is predominantly long grass and mud. Major access roads to the estate are potholed.
       </p>
       <p>
        Residents rightly feel neglected. Other estates are receiving promised infrastructure while their estate is lagging. Residents deserve to know a time frame for the provision of overdue facilities. That's why I've started up a petition. I want residents to sign the petition, to have a voice to say to the council: 'You must deliver the infrastructure. You must deliver it now.' I urge the council to do the right thing and deliver what's promised.
