        The Calare electorate is made up of many dedicated, hardworking and passionate community groups. I would like to recognise a number of them today. Firstly, there is the Capertee Progress Association. I'd like to make special mention of the president, Graeme Pike; vice-president, Judy Eckersley; secretary, Dorothy Pike; treasurer, Lyn Stanford; and members, Bill Leuffen, Rachel Trounson, Colette Parr, Dave Eckersley, Judith Amey, Joyce Kirk, Anne Rohrich, Lyn Vidler, Kathy Grimshaw,

        and Stan Stanford. The Capertee Progress Association have been extremely busy in the last 12 months. It's their goal to ensure the prosperity of the community, so they have started train rides into the valley. The

         Capertee Valley
        </a>
        is indeed something special. It's the second largest canyon in the world. It's just one kilometre wider than the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Canyon" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        . In August last year, they began train rides into the valley for high tea. Another was held in May and planning is underway for their third train ride in November. It is an extremely popular event. I would like to congratulate them for the great work they do.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to congratulate the Cullen Bullen Progress Association and make special mention of the president, Carol Banks; vice-president, Agnes Tilley; secretary, Elaine Deveigne; and treasurer,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Caesar" rel="nofollow">

        . They are famous for their Back to Cullen events. Every two to three years, the association invites former residents back to the community that they grew up in. The reunion involves entertainment and dinner. Between 250 and 300 people come home for the event.
       </p>

        It's wonderful community organisations like these which keep our country communities going, just like the Wellington
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PCYC" rel="nofollow">
         PCYC
        </a>
        . It has more than 500 members and an amazing team, including the club manager, Matthew Devenish; the youth case manager, Senior Constable Leigh Davy; the gymnastics instructors,

        and

        and Georgia Knijff. They do wonderful work in the Wellington community, particularly with our young people, and they need to be acknowledged here today.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lastly, I'd like to thank and acknowledge the Gulgong Pioneers Museum. My parents visited there just last week. I'd like to make special mention of president, Marie Gorrie; senior vice-president, Chris Fies; junior vice-president,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Johnson" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        ; secretary Bronwyn Assaf; treasurer, Karen Reedy; and committee members, Gene Monaghan, Penny Pinnock, Alan Rickwood and Marlene Roach. The Gulgong Pioneers Museum is home to a range of memorabilia from Australia's pioneering days. It's one of the leading museums in Australia, I think. It also has one of the best printing displays in

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        We thank the Capertee and District Progress Association, the Cullen Bullen Progress Association, the Wellington PCYC and the Gulgong Pioneers Museum for their contribution to our great country communities. Keep up the great work.
