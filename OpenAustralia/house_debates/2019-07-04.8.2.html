         I want to thank the Leader of the House for the discussion that's gone on in the lead-up to these standing order changes. They've been agreed. There are some that go to the direct, smooth running of the House and some of them which deal with the change of the number of members from 150 to 151 and some consequential changes there. There's nothing controversial, but the opposition is grateful for the consultation that's happened in the lead-up to this.

          I thank the member for Watson for the discussions that we've had. As he notes, the changes are largely procedural. They largely emanate from an interim and final committee report on the issue—for instance, changing quorum to 31, amongst other matters—and no doubt the standing orders will be a matter for ongoing discussion between the member for Watson and me over the course of this parliament.
