        On Monday, 22 September students from Kingsway Christian College will once again make the journey across Australia to Canberra from their school in the suburb of Darch, in my electorate of Cowan. I understand that this is the 17th year of visits by Kingsway Christian College. This year 64 students and 10 parents or teachers will visit. I look forward to joining them for their visit.
       </p>
       <p>
        I have a great regard for this school, as I like the message and the positive values that it promotes. The Kingsway Christian College is a non-denominational Christian day school with students from kindergarten to year 12. The school was established in 1984 based upon strong Christian beliefs and values. The first students graduated in 1988. Today the college provides education from kindergarten to year 12, has an enrolment of 1,100 students and employs more than 120 staff. My association with the school started a couple of years ago, and I have been to two very well run Anzac Day ceremonies. From these events it is clear that they take this important day very seriously and their effort and commitment shows what a well balanced school they are.
       </p>
       <p>
        Mrs Jeanette Giroud is the principal. Jeanette is a very positive and supportive leader of the school community who strongly promotes the educational, co-curricular and spiritual aspects to the education of her students. I am also privileged to know Mr Ruston Long, the community relations manager. Not only does he perform this key role for the school but he also is very active at the Warwick Church of Christ, which is also my church. The Chaplain is Debra Kerbey, who leads pastoral care at the school. Mrs Kerbey is a bright and highly positive spiritual influence for the students and school community.

        Last Friday I had the honour of opening the 2008 Kingsway Christian College art exhibition entitled
        <i>
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Journey_Continues" rel="nofollow">
          The Journey Continues
         </a>
        </i>
        . This was the first time I have ever opened an art exhibition. To say that I was impressed would be an understatement. There were hundreds of imaginative and inspired contributions from the students of the school. I enjoyed a range of art from Indigenous inspired painted boomerangs to landscapes. The influence of artist in residence, Mrs Francine Riches, was very clear, as was the creative leadership of Mrs Necia Drazevic, the head of art. In opening the exhibition I stated my encouragement for young people making their mark on the world. But I drew the stark comparison between those who think making such a mark on the world is accomplished via graffiti or tyre rubber and the correct way, via building or creating something which is positive. The exhibition was an example of the positive contribution that the students of the Kingsway Christian College make to the local community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I had the opportunity to speak with Miss Renee Clark, a year 12 student. I congratulated her on the pieces of art that she stood next to. I said that she should be very pleased with her results, to which she replied that she had worked very hard and made sacrifices to achieve those results. What I would like to say about Renee is that, apart from being a highly skilled artist, she has already learnt that no success comes without effort and commitment. I am sure this young lady will succeed in her coming exams and in the future after graduation. I should also mention that Renee won the public choice award for secondary school artwork and is about to have her work featured in a state art competition. Last year she was a state finalist for WA at the Apex Australia Teenage Fashion Awards.
       </p>
       <p>
        From my experiences and visits to Kingsway Christian College I find it very easy to have confidence that the students and the school will be counted, both now and in the future, as good and positive influences on this country. In a recent email from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liz_Robertson" rel="nofollow">
         Liz Robertson
        </a>
        , the teacher leading the 2008 visit to Canberra, she included a proverb which is perfectly accurate and appropriate for all of us who are parents. The proverb is 22:6:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        Teach your children to choose the right path, and when they are older, they will remain upon it.
       </p>
       <p>
        Never a truer word. I want to thank Jeanette Giroud, Debra Kerby, Ruston Long, Necia Drazevic, the staff, the board and the school community for the positive and important work they do for the students at Kingsway Christian College. It is a excellent educational institution because they have their priorities right. I look forward to the continued success of this great school.
