       <p>
        I take this opportunity to recognise a great community leader, developer and dear friend of mine,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Morris" rel="nofollow">
         John Morris
        </a>
        . I also wish John a very happy 90th birthday for this Thursday. John is known as 'Mister
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Douglas" rel="nofollow">
         Port Douglas
        </a>
        ' and is a living icon in the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Far_North" rel="nofollow">
         Far North
        </a>
        . His vision and determination has helped to shape our beautiful local areas like Port Douglas, Mossman, Cairns and the Tablelands. John was instrumental in establishing Port Douglas as a resort destination, having developed and operated several resorts, including Sheraton Mirage and Radisson Treetops. He created unique experiences and outback adventures in the area, such as Wetherby Station, Crystalbrook Station and the Wildlife Habitat, just to name a few. His latest initiative is the Mount Emerald Wind Farm, which now sits on top of a mountain range in the tablelands. He continues, at the age of 90, with new projects as he's going through the process.
       </p>
       <p>
        In his personal life, he's been a very kind and generous mentor to people of all ages, sharing with many his experiences, his values and of course his wealth of knowledge. John loves old trains and recently established the Choo-Choo cafe and steam engine train rides, which I highly recommend should you be visiting the area and find yourself in Port Douglas. You will most likely find John sitting on the deck with a cuppa, taking in our community's enjoyment and love of his many creations. John, I wish you all the very best for your birthday, my friend. Have a glass of red with your beautiful familyâ€”
