        Clive Armitage was a true gentleman, a great man and a good friend. Toowoomba came together to mourn his passing last week and to wrap the city's love around his wife, Conchita, their children, Heidi and Howard, and their families. Clive came to Australia in 1965 as a

        , and, boy, did we get our money's worth. Together with Conchita he became one of the city's largest employers and one of our most prominent philanthropists.

        Through his work with Rotary, with the

        or directly, he supported so many people in our city. He supported big things, like the Queensland Museum Cobb+Co, the

        , where his legacy is now forever celebrated at the Armitage Centre. He supported little things. Howard recalled a time when Clive bought a new pram for a new mother whose story of hardship he'd read in the

        . He was a giver, and he blessed our city with his generosity.

        His outstanding efforts in business and philanthropy are well known, but his impact on politics both locally and nationally was also immense. He brought the same conviction, dignity, decency and energy to political debate that won him acclaim elsewhere. He could hold his own with anyone from
