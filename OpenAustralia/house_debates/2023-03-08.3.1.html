        3 DR HAINES: To move—That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) recognises that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the Government has set a target of net-zero emissions by 2050; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) Australia's agriculture sector currently generates 16 per cent of Australia's national emissions;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) notes that climate change represents a serious and present threat to the Australian agricultural sector's continued productivity and profitability, including on the international market;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) further recognises that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the Government is continuing to support a carbon market through the use of Australian Carbon Credit Units (
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACCU" rel="nofollow">
         ACCU
        </a>
        s), including under the Safeguard Mechanism (Crediting) Bill 2022; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the Government is encouraging farmer participation in new markets including the:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) ACCUs market, via programs such as the Carbon Farming Outreach Program; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (ii) biodiversity credit market through the proposed Nature Repair Market Bill; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) Australia's agriculture sector may need to retain their own credits for carbon in-setting, in order to comply with international trade requirements that will require farmers to address their own emissions;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (4) further notes that agricultural extension officers have historically played an important role in translating science into practice for Australia's agricultural sector; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (5) calls on the Government to do more to encourage farmers to deploy low-emissions technologies and practices, and participate in carbon and biodiversity markets, by:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) providing ongoing and increased investment in agricultural and climate science research and development, including in accurate measurement of soil carbon and nutritional additives to reduce methane emissions in livestock;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) funding a network of 200 context-specific, trusted and neutral agricultural extension officers through providers such as Natural Resource Management or Landcare organisations to provide educational outreach services and advice on technology, products and practices that will help farmers lower their emissions and subsequently participate in new carbon and biodiversity markets; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) allowing farmers to certify their products as net-zero through a dedicated carbon neutral certification standard for farms through the ClimateActive initiative which would help farmers access price premiums for their products and protect their access to overseas markets.

        (1) notes that the Government:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) has failed to admit that the headline aged care promises they made to older Australians and their families, at the 2022 election, are undeliverable; and

       <p class="italic">
        (b) has blatantly ignored the Opposition's concerns that their expedited timeframe could force aged care homes to close because they can't access staff, residents kicked out of their homes, and caused older Australians from rural and regional Australia forced to travel miles away from their community to receive support; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) further notes that the University of Technology Sydney Ageing Research Collaborative report released in 2022 confirms that the Government's expedited requirements for aged care facilities will see homes closed down and older Australians abandoned, and the report states:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) that meeting the incoming mandated standards will require an additional 6,922 full-time registered nurses in Australia; and

        7 MR BIRRELL: To move—That this House:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (1) notes that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) the October 2022 budget contained an undisclosed amount intended for water buybacks in the Murray-Darling Basin, and that confirmation of the Government's intention to recommence buybacks has already had an impact on the water market;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the country's largest water broker, Adelaide-based Waterfind, issued and then withdrew, an expression of interest for Commonwealth buybacks;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (c) water entitlement holders have withdrawn from the market to wait for the expected premium when the Government enters the market;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (d) a 2018 agreement reached by Australia's water ministers guarantees that positive, or neutral, socio-economic outcomes must be demonstrated for approval of any further recovery of Murray-Darling Basin environmental water;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (e) the Government is ignoring expert reports and is pursuing a timeline for completion of the Murray-Darling Basin plan and buybacks which will cause economic and social harm in Basin communities; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (f) the Government is ignoring former Prime Minister Julia Gillard's stated position on the additional 450 gigalitres when she announced with the then Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, that it would only be recovered via water recovery projects that minimise the impact on communities, to ensure there is no social and economic downside for communities;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) acknowledges that Murray-Darling Basin communities have already done the heavy lifting on the recovery of water for the environment and any further recovery should be done in a manner that does not deliver more social and economic harm to those communities; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (3) calls on the Government to extend the timeline for completion of the Murray-Darling Basin plan and work with Basin communities on projects to recover further water for the environment in a manner that has a neutral or positive socio-economic impact.

        (1) notes that:

       <p class="italic">
        (a) forestry destroyed or degraded 40,000 hectares of Australian public native forests in 2020, and each year releases an estimated 30 MtCO2-e of greenhouse gas emissions, equivalent to around 6 per cent of Australia's emissions;

       <p class="italic">
        (c) logging dries out forests (increasing their vulnerability to bushfires), reduces water quality in rivers and dams by causing sediment erosion, and threatens regional tourism businesses by degrading the natural resource base;

        (2) recognises the need:

        (a) to rapidly end the logging of Australian public native forests; and
