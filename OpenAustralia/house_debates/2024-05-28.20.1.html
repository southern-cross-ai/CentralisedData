        When our government was elected, we promised to govern for all Australians, including young people. But, while young people may be our nation's future, the issues of today affect them now, too. That's why our budget is deliberately designed to help people under pressure and set them up for a better future. We're providing a tax cut for every Australian taxpayer and $300 off energy bills for every household, providing much-needed relief for Australians, especially young Australians.
       </p>
       <p>
        The best way governments can help young people is by listening and actually hearing their voices, and that's what the Albanese Labor government is doing. Young people are at the centre of this budget. We're wiping $3 billion in

        Last week, I launched the new Moreton Youth Advisory Council. I was joined by young people from right across my electorate from different cultures and different backgrounds. From housing to health care, climate change and

        justice, it was great to hear directly from them about the issues that are most important to them. We explored practical and constructive ways to achieve better outcomes for young people together.
       </p>
       <p>
        There were some items in the budget that the group appreciated, but we know that there's more to be done. We'll keep working every day to deliver for all of Australians, especially young people. While this was our first meeting of the Moreton Youth Advisory Council, I can already see how deeply engaged, proactive and committed these enthusiastic young people are. I'll finish with some of their words: 'The opportunity to be surrounded by a group so motivated to use this opportunity to speak up for those without a voice is empowering.'
