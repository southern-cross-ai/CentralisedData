        As anyone will tell you—particularly my family—I am usually not much of a cricket watcher. However, when parliament closes on Thursday, I will be searching for the cricket highlights, because Nic Maddinson will make his debut for Australia in the third test against
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Africa" rel="nofollow">
         South Africa
        </a>
        . Nic will play on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelaide_Oval" rel="nofollow">
         Adelaide Oval
        </a>
        . While this is one of cricket's greatest honours, more importantly Nic is a resident of the Shoalhaven area, in my electorate of Gilmore. Alongside fellow Shoalhaven resident
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Davis" rel="nofollow">
         Ian Davis
        </a>
        , Nic will be the Shoalhaven's second test cricketer.
       </p>
       <p>
        Nic has had close to 60 first-class games and has previously played for Australia in the Twenty20 and an Australian A team. On the local scene, Nic has competed in the Bradman Cup,
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Zone" rel="nofollow">
         Southern Zone
        </a>
        and country teams. He began playing representative cricket for the Shoalhaven in the under-12s, competed in state teams and national junior teams and was a member of the Australian under-19s who successfully competed in and won the World Cup in 2010.
       </p>
       <p>
        Locally, Nic has been awarded the Shoalhaven Sportstar of the Year award for three years and was also the recipient of the very famous Bernie Regan Memorial Sporting Trust Grant.
       </p>
       <p>
        More than five years ago, at the age of 18 years, Nic made his
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheffield_Shield" rel="nofollow">
         Sheffield Shield
        </a>
        debut in Adelaide and posted 113, which broke a 70-year-old state record as the youngest century-maker on debut. Everyone in our region will be sending their best wishes to Nic in his first test cricket match because he makes us all so proud. Go, Nic!
