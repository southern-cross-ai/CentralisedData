       <p>
        I rise today to speak about the current situation regarding the Children of Vietnam Veterans Health Study. At the last election the Howard government refused to commit to a study, instead committing only to a feasibility study. Never before has a feasibility study been required for any of the health studies by the Department of Veterans’ Affairs. After a long and drawn-out process, the feasibility study was conducted. The results of this study were clear: (1) a study was feasible and very worth while and (2) a pilot study should be completed.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Minister for Veterans’ Affairs said that he did not like the findings of the feasibility study, as they had recommended a study into children of only male Army Vietnam veterans. However, the minister neglected to mention that the reasons for this were fully explained in the feasibility study itself. We also have learnt from responses to questions that the department received no complaints from any veterans organisations that this format would be a problem. Furthermore, the department has revealed that they received no scientific or expert advice that such a study would be unreasonable. Therefore, it seems that it was the minister and the minister alone who had these concerns.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite this, the government refused to commit to a study or even a pilot study. Instead, they wanted yet another preliminary study to try to determine possible research protocols. It should be noted that never before in the history of veterans’ health studies in this country has a study had to be conducted into the development of research protocols separate from an actual study. Obviously, if the government had committed to a full study, they could have developed research protocols as part of this. However, the government are refusing to commit to a study.
       </p>
       <p>
        In responses to questions on notice and questions at the last two estimates hearings, the department has refused to say a study is now guaranteed. At the last estimates hearings Mr Sullivan said:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        We are expending this money in the hope and expectation that the CMVH will provide us with some methodologies and advice which will help—through the minister—the government to determine whether it can conduct such a study.
       </p>
       <p>
        My simple question is: why? The independent feasibility study has already found that a study is feasible; therefore, there is no reason why this government cannot commit right now to a study. Instead, we are now waiting for the results of yet another preliminary study which, we are told, will be handed to the department on 30 June 2007. Given the current minister’s form when it comes to time taken to consider reviews, we will be lucky to have a firm commitment on this before the next election.
       </p>
       <p>
        There are two things that should be clearly understood by the veterans community: (1) there is no reason why the government cannot commit to a study right now and (2) the department has repeatedly failed to give a guarantee that a study will actually take place. I call on the minister to make a public commitment that this government will conduct a full study. If he will not do this, I call on him to come clean with the veterans community and explain that the government is unwilling to commit to this very important study. The people should have no doubt and the parliament should understand that the health of the children of Vietnam veterans is a serious issue—for example, they have three times the suicide rate of the general community.
