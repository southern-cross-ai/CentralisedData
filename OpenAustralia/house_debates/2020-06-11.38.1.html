        I rise today to bring to the attention of the House the retirement of four fabulous women in my electorate who have given a lifetime of service to schools education. In 2020, Moira Findlay retired. She had been Iramoo Primary School principal since 1997 and was named in Monday's Queen's Birthday Honours for her service. Julie Mason, the principal of Baden Powell College—retiring in 2020—was first the principal, and the founding principal, at Glen Orden. She was awarded an

        , in 2020. Maureen Price from Mossfiel Primary School has served for over 50 years as a teacher and principal in local schools and has been the principal of Mossfiel Primary School for 22 years. At the Recognition of

        in Victoria in 2018, she was recognised for 50 years of service. Finally, I acknowledge Marlene Monahan, the principal of Bethany Catholic Primary School. Marlene was also the founding principal of St James The Apostle, in Lalor electorate. She has served for 37 years as an educator and leader in local schools and was awarded an OAM in 2009. These four fabulous women—fabulous educators, ground-breaking leaders in education—all served my wonderful electorate and my wonderful community. Personally, they are my former colleagues as a principal; they were mentors. I have watched their leadership, and it helped me grow as a teacher.
