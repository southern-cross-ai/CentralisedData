         Western Sydney
        </a>
        is full of aspirational people. We know this because over 300,000 people commute out of Western Sydney every day for work. Lindsay is home to people who are working hard in their small businesses and working hard to get ahead for their families. To recognise their hard work and to fight for them, I would like to talk about Jeff and his wife, Tracey, who own J Sinclair Engineering.
       </p>
       <p>
        Like many people in Lindsay, Jeff and Tracey are passionate about Australian manufacturing and Australian made products. When I visited them, Tracey even made me a cake. Jeff has been working in manufacturing for 42 years, and he and Tracey sometimes spend seven days a week working in their family business to contribute to our community and to keep local people in jobs.
       </p>
       <p>
        Most days, Jeff starts at 5.30 am and finishes at 7.30 at night. He's worked in manufacturing since he was 15, and he's now 57 and running his own business. His business works primarily with the manufacturing and rail industries and has been servicing and fixing machines for 15 years. Six years ago, Jeff was fortunate to buy an Australian manufacturing business that has been making Australian machines since 1986. Because of his great experience in his business, Jeff is doing really great work every single day, working hard, employing local people in his business and keeping manufacturing in Western Sydney alive.
