        On a much brighter note, last week, I was thrilled to join with the Norwood Sporting Club, Ringwood U3A and community members to officially opening the Kevin Pratt Pavilion at Mullum Mullum Reserve in Ringwood.    This new facility will serve as a home base for the Norwood Sporting Club, which includes the Norwood football and cricket clubs, the Norwood Junior Football Club as well as the Norwood Netball Club and the Norwood Social Club. Importantly, it will also serve as a home for the Ringwood U3A, which is a wonderful complement to the sporting club.
       </p>
       <p>
        Highlights of the new pavilion include a new multipurpose room on the first floor, which will provide a very big space for social functions. It also includes a viewing deck; media room; new kitchen and canteen; and a new gym, which will provide enhanced training facilities for all the players, as well as refurbished and additional change rooms, which will cater for the increasing levels of female participation in all sports but, in particular, football.
       </p>

        I am delighted to have been able to assist in making this project a reality through securing a $400,000 grant from the Commonwealth's Community Development Grants Program. But, really, all substantial credit should go to the amazing members and supporters of the Norwood Sporting Club and in particular to President Mark Etherington and his committee, whose passion and dedication ultimately made this project a reality. I would also like to thank local state members
