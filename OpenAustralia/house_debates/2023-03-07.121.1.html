        I would like to acknowledge the Albanese Labor government's commitment, since winning government in May 2022, to supporting the Australian
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passport_Office" rel="nofollow">
         Passport Office
        </a>
        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APO" rel="nofollow">
         APO
        </a>
        , to overcome the enormous backlog of passport applications left behind by the former Liberal-National government. The Australian Passport Office do an exceptional job receiving and processing applications and issuing passports to Australians to enable them to travel safely and efficiently and to connect them with the rest of the world. The Australian Passport Office is considered one of the best passport offices in the world when it comes to passport security, passport technology and customer service. The Passport Office continues to strengthen and implement new features regularly to ensure our passports maintain their international cutting-edge superiority.
       </p>
       <p>
        It's no secret that Australians love to travel, especially to our favourite destinations, including
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Zealand" rel="nofollow">
         New Zealand
        </a>
        , Indonesia, the United States, Europe and many places throughout Asia. During 2022-23, Australians have once again begun to embrace international travel since the global pandemic. Each month the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics" rel="nofollow">
         Australian Bureau of Statistics
        </a>
        records a steady increase in overseas departures. During December 2022, over 1.5 million people had departed our international airports across Australia for an overseas destination.
       </p>
       <p>
        However, there had been a great deal of distress and a great deal of uncertainty for many Australians last year as the new Albanese Labor government responded to an overwhelming number of passport applications that had been left behind by the former Liberal-National government. At 430,000 outstanding applications at its peak, our new government got straight to work employing and training more staff in the Passport Office to address the gargantuan, gigantic build-up of requests for passports. Between July and December 2022, the Passport Office issued the most passports ever in a six-month period, at over 1.6 million passports, and that's over half a million more than in the same period in 2019, which was the previous six-month record.
       </p>
       <p>
        In my electorate of Robertson, constituents were frequently contacting my office for assistance to get their passports, as wait times had blown out from an average of 14 business days to as much as 50 business days. Many constituents were emailing and calling our office for help. Where my staff were prepared and able to assist, we managed to process every request for assistance, and in every circumstance we were able to provide the correct information to the constituent or organise for their passports to arrive before their departure date. Of course, this could not occur if it were not for the outstanding and professional public servants working in the Australian Passport Office, who understood the mammoth task that was ahead of them and did not waver in getting on top of this crisis.
       </p>
       <p>
        I'd also like to thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny_Wong" rel="nofollow">
         Penny Wong
        </a>
        , who immediately understood the situation and put into place practical measures to address the passport backlog, as well as the assistant minister, the Hon.
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Watts" rel="nofollow">
         Tim Watts
        </a>
        , whose office continues to help and provide advice on all aspects of passports and wait times. Thank you, Minister. I am still encouraging constituents in Robertson and, indeed, all Australians around the nation, to reach out to their local federal member if they are experiencing longer than usual wait times for new passports. On the

        </a>
        , Assistant Minister the Hon. Emma McBride and I are welcoming and ready to assist any constituent with their passport inquiry.
       </p>
       <p>
        Further, the greatest advice that I can provide to constituents and Australians is to prepare to travel well in advance of that travel. If you need to renew your passport or you need to acquire a passport, get in and get it done. The online system is efficient and simple to navigate. Lastly, safe travels to any Australian heading overseas. Be a smart traveller, ensure you have travel insurance, register your travel at smartraveller.gov.au, enjoy your time away, and happy holidays.
