        Last Saturday, I had the great privilege of joining Mary-Anne Thomas, the Labor member for Macedon, at the Kyneton Primary School arts show. It was not just an open day for future students to come with their parents to enrol; it was also a chance for the school to celebrate and share their art. We had the great privilege of being shown through the classrooms to view the art by the school captains. It really speaks volumes to the pride that these students had in their art. The school has some limited means to employ an artist as their art teacher, who actually volunteers a lot of his time. He is in the school, performing extra work outside of pay hours.

        Kyneton Primary School is a small school. It is in a town of about 6,000. Recently, it was announced that Kyneton Primary School will get a new school to be built by the new Labor government, which will be a wonderful opportunity for the students of the Kyneton community and for the school. This school has had its challenges. It is an old bluestone building. It is one of the oldest schools we have in the country, so the students welcomed the fact that the new Labor government will help build a new school and, with that, a new art room. So there will be many more art shows into the future. I congratulate the students on a wonderful art show.
