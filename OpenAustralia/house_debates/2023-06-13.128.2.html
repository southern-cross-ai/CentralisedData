       <p>
        Before the Federation Chamber considers the first portfolio, I would like to remind all members of the purpose of consideration in detail stage and outline the way it is expected to proceed. On Monday 22 May, the House agreed to a resolution setting the order and timing for consideration of portfolios. Any variation to this order and timing can only be made by a motion moved by a minister. Consideration in detail is a debate, and the call will alternate between government and non-government members, as always. Even though the debate sometimes takes the format of questions and answers, this is not question time. Ministers and government backbench members will both be considered as speakers for the government's turn and should bear this in mind when they seek the call.
       </p>
       <p>
        All speakers are required to be relevant to whichever portfolio is being examined, but there's no requirement of direct relevance in respect of any responses. Given the time limits applying to each portfolio, it might be practical for ministers to respond to more than one speaker when they seek the call. Each minister and member will have up to five minutes to speak each time they are called, but they may wish to speak for a shorter time. Ministers may wish to speak first and make an introductory statement when the debate on their portfolio begins, but that is a matter for them to decide. Members will be aware of the terms in which the resolution providing the dates and times after which the question 'that the proposed expenditure be agreed to' on each portfolio will be put. To avoid confusion, when these times are reached, a member who is speaking will be allowed to continue their remarks, but the chairs are obligated to put the question immediately at the conclusion of the member's speech and no further debate will be permitted.
