         What a day. What a day for love, for equality, for respect. Australia has done it. Every Australian had their say and they said, 'It's fair. Get on with it,' and the parliament has got on with it and we have voted today for equality, for love. It's time for more marriages, more commitment, more love, more respect. We respect every Australian who has voted, those who voted yes and those who voted no. This belongs to us all. This is Australia: fair, diverse, loving and filled with respect. For every one of us, this is a great day. It belongs to every Australian. The 45th Parliament is doing its job—delivering and getting on with it. It's fair. We've done the work and we've done it together. Let's do it. Let's finalise this bill right now.

           <p>
            Australia, we are going to make marriage equality a reality in minutes. The Australia of tomorrow begins with what we do today. At long last,
            <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBTIQ" rel="nofollow">
             LGBTIQ
            </a>
            Australians will be equal under the law. Our law will speak for a modern Australia, inclusive and fair. Those of us in parliament, who are privileged to serve, understand that we do so with humility, the humility to recognise that the passage of this law does not, in essence, belong to us, but the credit for the passage of this law belongs to all Australians.
           </p>
           <p>
            I say to those who voted no: I recognise that now is the time for healing, to put this debate behind us. And when this law is passed, we should declare that we are no longer a nation of people who voted no or people who voted yes—we are simply Australians, one and all. I say to LGBTIQ Australians in particular: you have given us a gift. When this parliament passes the marriage equality law, it will not be a gift from us to LGBTIQ Australians. Equality is never a gift to be given. Equality is an inalienable birthright of every Australian, and this equality is long overdue. The gift that LGBTIQ Australians have given all of us is that when we are a nation that includes all of our people and values all relationships and all families then we are a better nation altogether.
           </p>
           <p>
            So as it is written that 'there is a time for everything, and a season for every activity under the heavens', it is now a time to heal, a time to build, a time to laugh, a time to embrace, a time to love and now, at last, a time for marriage equality.

             What a big day for love, because, despite the years of bigotry and hate, and despite the years of violence, lies, ignorance and fear, love has won and it's time to pop the bubbly. I'm going to keep this short and sweet, because it's time to let the bells ring and let the people sing, because love has won.
