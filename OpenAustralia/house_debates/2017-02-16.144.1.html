        I rise to talk about a few special community members from my electorate who were honoured recently on
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australia_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Australia Day
        </a>
        . On 26 January each year, we celebrate what it means to be an Aussie and are thankful for the wonderful lifestyle and freedoms that we enjoy. Australia Day also provides an opportunity to recognise extraordinary Australians who are going the extra mile to make others' lives better, whether that is directly or indirectly.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was proud to see a number of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Gold Coast
        </a>
        ers on the list, in particular some outstanding individuals from my electorate. Major
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Anderson" rel="nofollow">
         Keith Anderson
        </a>
        was awarded an Order of Australia medal for his dedicated service to Gold Coast Legacy. I have had a long association with Keith. He has been a tireless advocate for veterans and their families, and I was honoured to support Keith's nomination for this award and to thank him for his valuable work in the community for so many years. Another nomination I was very proud to support was that of Tony Hickey. He is a notable business figure on the Gold Coast, known for his extensive work with local charities and community organisations. The annual Red Shield Appeal fundraising breakfast consistently pulls a large crowd of local businesspeople, raising at least $200,000 a year and, in some years, up to $300,000 or $400,000 to support the Salvation Army's work with the homeless and disadvantaged. Having built a successful law firm on the Gold Coast, Tony has used his business acumen and relationships with civic leaders to draw attention to social issues that affect our community.
       </p>
       <p>
        I congratulate Tony and two of my other constituents who were recognised by the Governor-General on Australia Day: Gayle Alessio from Broadbeach, who received an
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAM" rel="nofollow">
         OAM
        </a>
        for service to education, and

        from
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mermaid_Beach" rel="nofollow">
         Mermaid Beach
        </a>
        , who was awarded an AM for his significant service to cycling and the community. He is an incredibly inspirational Australian, someone who has made a profound difference by providing a role model to young Aussie kids about getting involved in sport. I thank all of those in our many community organisations and sporting clubs who are working hard every day to make the Gold Coast a better place.
       </p>
       <p>
        I was also pleased to see Griffith University's Professor Ian O'Connor named as the Gold Coast Citizen of the Year ahead of local Australia Day celebrations. Ian's passion for growing the city's health and knowledge precinct has seen the development of a world-class university teaching hospital and research facilities at Griffith, putting the Gold Coast on the map as a leading medical research destination. The fact is Gold Coast city is blessed to have so many incredible people who make such a profound difference in our community. I applaud and salute all of them for their outstanding contribution to the Gold Coast community.
