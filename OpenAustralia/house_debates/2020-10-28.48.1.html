       <p>
        Yesterday the Treasurer was in here all angry—angry at the Victorian government, angry about what had happened in Victoria. The Treasurer doesn't have the right to be angry. He's in a position to do something about it. As Treasurer of this country, he's in the prime seat to lead the economic recovery that has government, and all of the powers that government brings, to do something about it. If the Treasurer is to be angry at anyone, it should be his own government, and the failed app. Don't be angry at the Victorian government for the lack of contact tracing. What about the app that particularly failed?
       </p>
       <p>
        Victorians are in front of the Treasurer when it comes to the right to be angry—the people who've lost loved ones in aged care because this government neglected the sector, the people who've lost their businesses, the people who are struggling to get back on their feet—yet what we have is an angry government, angry and blaming everyone else. Well, you don't get that luxury. You are the government. It is your job to step up and help lead this country out of an economic recession that has been brought on by a pandemic but made worse because its government will not take responsibility and a Treasurer chooses an opportunity in this parliament to get angry and blame others, not to do his job.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Treasurer has the power, through the budget, to help others out. Extend JobKeeper, extend JobSeeker, help small businesses through this tough time. Don't be angry, don't be a crankypants; do your job.
