        You just can't trust Labor in this country anymore. Most people today are actually worse off as a result of Labor's budget. The low and middle income tax offset is gone, so, if you were relying on that as a tax refund this year, kiss it goodbye. Ladies and gentlemen, I can tell you that on 200 occasions before coming to government there was a promise by Labor of a $275 tax credit to your electricity bill. No-one in my electorate of Wright has seen that $275. In fact, energy prices have gone through the roof. They've gone up so much that those on the government side have offered a $300 tax incentive for electricity payments. But, really, with the cost of electricity going up the way that it is, it needs to be more like $1,000 to stay on track.

        , through its monetary policy, has had two feet on the brakes trying to slow the economy down, while this government has slammed over $300 billion worth of stimulus payments into the economy, which most economic commentators around the country have alluded to as a bad idea. You cannot trust this government.
