        I welcomed the news last week that the federal government is to spend $4.2 million on infrastructure for the replacement of a number of bridges on main arterial roads across the state. The funding will make possible the much-needed upgrade to local bridges in my electorate of Lyons as part of the federal government's $300 million Bridges Renewal Program. I met with Northern Midlands Mayor David Downie at Westmoor Bridge on Powranna Road near Cressy to view the bridge which is one of those successful in what was a very competitive round. The

        will receive $922,000 in federal funding towards the $1.8 million new bridge across the Macquarie river on the Powranna Road. The ongoing maintenance cost for the structures is significant. The replacement bridge on what has become a major connector road between the

        and the rapidly developing a group agricultural industry zone at the other end of the road near Cressy.
       </p>
       <p>
        The improved road infrastructure will help businesses like award-winning Tasmanian Quality Meats, Burlington Berries and Petuna Seafoods, as well as operations at the other end of the road such as the saleyards near the Midland Highway. A further $3.3 million of funding announced from the federal government's Bridges Renewal program for the Lyons electorate will go towards a $6.7 million state government project to replace two under-strength bridges on the Esk Main Road near Fingal and Avoca. It is part of $114 million round, the first of the rounds which are part of a total of $300 million commitment over five years for bridge renewal nationally.
