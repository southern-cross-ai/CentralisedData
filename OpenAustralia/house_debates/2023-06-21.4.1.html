        (2) acknowledges the Government's commitment to an ambitious housing agenda which will boost the supply of all housing, with more social housing, more affordable housing, more homes to rent and more homes to buy, and includes:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) establishing the Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee three months early, helping regional Australians purchase a home with as little as a 5 per cent deposit and avoiding paying Lenders' Mortgage Insurance;

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (i) expanding eligibility for the Home Guarantee Scheme, which helps people purchase a home sooner by reducing the deposit they need to save; and

       <p class="italic">
        (b) the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission is the point of contact for concerns and complaints about aged service provider responsibilities but it appears to be understaffed, have limited powers of investigation and be restricted in the way sanctions can be imposed on providers; and

        (1) recognises that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) up to one in six recent migrants to Australia is paid less than the minimum wage;

        (b) exploitation does not just affect individual workers but effectively drives down wages and worsens conditions for all Australian workers; and

       <p class="italic">
        (c) about 20 per cent of anonymous reports and disputes resolved by the

        </a>

       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (2) acknowledges the Government is delivering on its commitment to improving employer compliance in the workplace by:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) introducing new criminal offences, additional enforcement tools, increased pecuniary penalties and a prohibition measure; and

         Pacific Island

        communities alike as a program that has efficiently reduced labour shortages, increased financial opportunities for workers and strengthened ties between Pacific countries and Australia;
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the Government's union-backed reforms to the PALM scheme are a huge threat to farmers, consumers, Pacific workers and our foreign relations;

        (2) acknowledges that:
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (a) farmers are now threatening to boycott the program which will force those from nine Pacific Island countries and Timor-Leste to be paid a minimum of 30 hours a week, every week under Labor's plans; and
       </p>
       <p class="italic">
        (b) the changes to the scheme were made without adequate consultation with stakeholders and the adverse reaction shows the Government needs to go back to the drawing board; and

       <p class="italic">
        (3) recognises that Labor's changes are being rammed through without warranted consideration and attention and have the potential to cause major disruptions to the scheme which would see an increase of labour shortages, a breakdown in Pacific relations and increased costs being passed onto the consumer at the grocery store.
