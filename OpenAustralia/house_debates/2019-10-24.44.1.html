        I was delighted to attend the first-ever Australian Muslim Social Services Agency open day earlier this month, along with Ellen Sandell, the Greens state member for Melbourne, and hundreds of others. When AMSSA needed over $3 million to purchase their centre and mosque in

        , Somalis managed to raise the entire amount from the community. When they were $800,000 short six months before settlement, members of the community donated money that was supposed to be for house deposits and emergencies. Others provided interest free loans. They didn't have money to spare but they gave it anyway. Because of that sacrifice, AMSSA is a thriving hub for

        and other Muslims in my electorate, where people go almost daily to pray, learn, eat and play.
       </p>
       <p>
        The open day was a magnificent celebration of the community's contribution to our city and included free food, drinks and even a jumping castle, which my kids loved. I know it was a big decision for many at the mosque to hold their first open day, but it was the right one. I congratulate President Abdirashid Ahmed, Adem Salah and all of the committee and volunteers. I live a short walk from AMSSA, and I'm proud not just to have them in my electorate but to know they're my neighbours as well.
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite the best efforts of some in the media and parliament to demonise Muslim Australians, AMSSA and other hardworking community organisations and individuals have managed to create a welcoming, peaceful and culturally rich community that has made, and will continue to make, an invaluable contribution to the Melbourne community. I thank AMSSA for the invitation to speak and attend, and I'm looking forward to the next open day.
