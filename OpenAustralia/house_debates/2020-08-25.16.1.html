        Today I rise to honour the Berowra electorate's latest centenarian, Roy Ringrose of Thornleigh. Roy was born on 15 August 1920 at Temora. He joined the Second

        in March 1942, serving at Cowra,

        , Bathurst and Darwin. He then went to work at the Registrar General's department until 1980.
       </p>
       <p>
        Roy obtained a

        </a>
        studying at night after working for many decades at the land titles office. At the age of 73 he commenced working at the law firm Malleson Stephen Jaques, retiring when he was 81. I had the opportunity of working with Roy at Mallesons. The former chairman Frank Zipfinger describes Roy as 'a terrific practitioner, the best in his field and a wonderful gentleman universally loved at the firm'.
       </p>
       <p>
        Roy's 100th birthday celebration was held online and attended by family, friends and former colleagues. Mallesons partners made him a cake, shaped as a certificate of title with a covenant charge in favour of his wife, Roma.
       </p>
       <p>
        Roy and Roma also celebrated their 75th wedding anniversary earlier this year. Roy and Roma were married during World War

        on Roma's 21st birthday. They have six children, 20 grandchildren and 41 great-grandchildren. Their youngest daughter Lynelle says her dad still has his cheeky since of humour and loves sharing stories, particularly about his practice,

        and of course his family.
       </p>
       <p>
        Roy credits his long life to a careful choice of ancestors, his Christian faith and being married to a good woman. Congratulations, Roy Ringrose, on turning 100. Thank you very much.
