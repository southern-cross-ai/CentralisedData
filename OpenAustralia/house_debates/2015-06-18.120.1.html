        . I was delighted to attend the presentation of the gold cup at

        resort in Wisemans Ferry on Sunday 7 June. The presentation concluded the annual ride, which attracted almost 350 competitors, and their horses, from across this great country and internationally. In a test of athletic ability, commitment and trust between horse and rider, competitors were required to navigate and complete a set course of 160 kilometres in 24 hours. For most, just completing the course was considered a win. The ride commenced at midnight on Friday 5 June and wound through national park trails, rural roads and private properties. The winner,

        The first gold cup event was held in the Hawkesbury in 1966 and signified the beginning of endurance riding in Australia. The ride was the idea of the late respected Australian bushman
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RM" rel="nofollow">
         RM
        </a>
        Williams. Inspired by the idea of a long-distance competitive horse ride, Williams wrote to his friend Tom Quilty, a great horseman who lived in the Kimberley area of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Australia" rel="nofollow">
         Western Australia
        </a>
        . In the letter he asked for Quilty's support for beginning a 100-mile ride. Quilty agreed and donated $1,000. This was used to make a gold cup, the prize for the winner of the event, which was presented at the award presentation on the Sunday. The ride was also named after him. The Hawkesbury region was chosen to host the first ride 50 years ago due to its central location. The ride was held there for about 20 years before rotating across other states.

        I particularly acknowledge all the volunteers and the team for their generosity and commitment to ensuring that such a prestigious event celebrated its 50th milestone in the region where it first began. Of special mention are Ron and Val Males of

        , who have been involved since the beginning. Mr Males, who has competed in the event 22 times, was inducted into the Tom Quilty Hall of Fame at this year's event. Events such as these which attract international attention provide a fantastic boost for tourism in our beautiful region in the electorate of Macquarie.
