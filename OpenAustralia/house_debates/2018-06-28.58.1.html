        We've heard a lot of talk about aspiration from the Turnbull government this week. Unfortunately, it's been more like the kind of talk you'd hear around a merchant banker's corporate boardroom than around the family dining tables of Australia. Australians' aspirations are much bigger than increasing the bottom line of the top end of town. When Prime Minister Turnbull cut $17 billion from Australian schools, he showed his ignorance of the aspirations of millions of Australians who dream of their children reaching their full potential in life. When Prime Minister Turnbull cut $3.8 billion from Australian universities, he showed his ignorance of the aspirations of tens of thousands of Australians who dream of being the first from their family to go to university. When the Prime Minister refused to rule out the construction of new coal-fired power plants under his government, he showed contempt for the aspirations of millions of Australians who dream of being able to share the

        Prime Minister, the aspirations of Australians are far richer than the bank balances of millionaires and the big end of town. Labor understands this, and a Shorten Labor government will meet the aspirations of Australians, not just in the tax system but in our hospitals, our schools, our universities, our

        s, our workplaces and our natural environment and, importantly, at the next federal election. Labor understands aspiration in this country. We understand the dreams of parents and the dreams of children. And we will build a country where all Australian children can reach their full potential, a fair society where everyone's aspirations are treated equally.
