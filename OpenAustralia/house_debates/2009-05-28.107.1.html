       <p>
        Last Monday I had the pleasure of visiting Northlakes High School in acknowledgment of the fine work that is being done by everybody associated with the CATE program. I have to congratulate the careers advisor, Phil Williamson. He is the person that signed the program and has implemented it within Northlakes High School.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a rather visionary program. It looks at recognising students and the work that they do, to actively increase their employability skills through participation in a variety of vocation based programs. In these challenging economic times where it is much more difficult to obtain a job, it is those people who have the skills and the personal attributes that they need who will be fortunate in finding employment. As the job market contracts, employers will be seeking young people as employees who have some skills and who have a record of being able to participate in the workforce.
       </p>
       <p>
        The CATE programs endeavours to acknowledge and reward students who have demonstrated personal attributes and employability skills through a program of vocation based activities. They are activities and programs that are assessed by both the school and the industry sector. It is an industry based and assessed workplace experience. Occupational health and safety and senior first aid are part of the course, as are community and school based voluntary projects and activities, an employability skills audit, undertaking extensive career based assessment activities and interviews, a career path transition plan, an employment portfolio and CATE interviews upon completion.
       </p>
       <p>
        The CATE program is offered to students in years 10, 11 and 12. It is not designed to overburden students; rather, it is aimed to enhance their employability and their view of the world. It recognises student activities and the engagement that they have had to date. It acknowledges student participation in course placement and experience in part-time or casual employment, voluntary work and career planning. Students can undertake the CATE program over a maximum of two years. At the end of it they are awarded two documents: a career and transition excellence award and a record of achievement. This is an excellent program that is supported by industryâ€”
