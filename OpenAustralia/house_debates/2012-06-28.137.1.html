       <p>
        I rise this morning to advise that tomorrow is the 25th anniversary of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Nose_Day" rel="nofollow">
         Red Nose Day
        </a>
        . Red Nose Day occurs every year on the last Friday of June. Red Nose Day is, of course, organised through
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIDS" rel="nofollow">
         SIDS
        </a>
        and Kids, which is a fantastic national organisation dedicated to saving the lives of babies and children during pregnancy, birth, infancy and childhood up to a child is the age of 18. SIDS and Kids provides much-needed support to bereaved families, with over 3,500 Australian families experiencing the sudden and unexpected death of a baby or child each year.
       </p>
       <p>
        Last year I was named the patron for SIDS and Kids
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Territory" rel="nofollow">
         Northern Territory
        </a>
        , which is a role that I take very seriously. I am absolutely delighted that I have got this privileged position. In the Northern Territory we have been working very hard to raise money and to sell the red noses. I would like to take a little bit of time to acknowledge those people that have been helping the outstanding SIDS and Kids committee that we have in the Northern Territory. Deborah Gardiner-Munro, is the chairperson of SIDS and Kids and she is incredible. Fiona Peters is the vice-chairperson. Christine Paynter is a committee member, with Kelly Yates. The Harley Owners Group Darwin Chapter has contributed significantly to SIDS and Kids, as has the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NT" rel="nofollow">
         NT
        </a>
        Motorcycle Centre with their substantial donation to SIDS and Kids. I note the dedicated staff: Brenda Day, who is the educator, and Christina Erb, who looks after the grants and is the fundraising officer.
       </p>
       <p>
        We have been selling the red noses for the whole of June. I thank the Navy personnel in Darwin. In particular, Leading Seaman Bradley Thomas, from the electronic maintenance room, has organised some of his colleagues to help out on our stalls. So we have had helping Leading Seaman Kieran Jarrett, Seaman Cook, Seaman Dalziel, Seaman Corbett, Able Seaman Sergiacomi, Seaman Pollock, Seaman Lee Groves, Seaman Matt Chambers, Seaman Turner, Seaman Miller, Seaman Matt Chambers, Seaman Ludwig, Seaman Thomas, Seaman Fairbanks, Seaman Adams, Seaman Pollock and Seaman Hauser. We have also had members of the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiwanis_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Kiwanis Club
        </a>
        , the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lions_Club" rel="nofollow">
         Lions Club
        </a>
        and Quota International assisting and also some of my parliamentary colleagues in the Northern Territory. We have had

        ,

        and two of my 'up and coming and hopeful' colleagues in Kim Loveday, who is the candidate for Nightcliff, and Lia Finocchiaro, who is the candidate for Drysdale. So a big thank you to all of them for their help during June to help SIDS and Kids.
