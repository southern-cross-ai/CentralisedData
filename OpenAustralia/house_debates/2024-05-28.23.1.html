        We need to take stronger action to address domestic violence, and that includes more support for frontline services. I want to pay tribute to one such service in Wentworth, called ReLove. Established by Renuka Fernando and Ben Stammer in 2019, ReLove supports women and children impacted by domestic violence by providing them with good quality rescued furniture and household items free of charge. It's been my pleasure to meet Ren and Ben on many occasions, as well as some of the women they work with.
       </p>
       <p>
        Through partnerships with organisations such as
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayside_Chapel" rel="nofollow">
         Wayside Chapel
        </a>
        , the B Miles Women's Foundation and Jewish House, ReLove supports 15 women and their children every week. ReLove rescues furniture from suppliers with surplus or returned stock as well as from hotels, removalists and community donations. Clients can choose the items they need, which are assembled and delivered to them. On average, each client receives between $10,000 and $15,000 worth of furniture to help them restart their lives. The dignity of that choice is so critical. When women's lives are falling apart, they can go somewhere and start to create the home that they want to take their families into.
       </p>
       <p>
        ReLove has also saved an amazing 1,800 tonnes of furniture from landfill. I would like to pay tribute to the clubs and companies that support ReLove—Easts Rugby Foundation, Wilson Asset Management and Atlassian—and say congratulations for the amazing work they do to support those who need it.
