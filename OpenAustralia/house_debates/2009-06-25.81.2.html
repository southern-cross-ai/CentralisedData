        War brings many tragedies and next week we commemorate one of the greatest tragedies of the

         Second World War
        </a>
        . On 1 July 1942, a United States submarine patrolling the Babuyan Channel leading from Luzon in the Philippines into the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_China_Sea" rel="nofollow">
         South China Sea
        </a>
        torpedoed and sank what it believed to be a Japanese merchant vessel. It was in fact the

          Montevideo Maru
         </a>
        </i>
        carrying Australian prisoners of war. Its sinking is the greatest single maritime tragedy in Australia’s history, with the loss of 1,053 Australian lives. The
        <i>
         Montevideo Maru
        </i>
        carried no markers identifying it as a

        transport and was indistinguishable from legitimate targets of allied aircraft and submarines. The prisoners were locked in the hold with no means of escape once the ship was struck. The
        <i>
         Montevideo Maru
        </i>
        took 11 minutes to sink. No prisoners survived.
       </p>
       <p>
        What we know of this tragedy comes from Japanese survivors who eventually reached Manila and reported the sinking. By the time searches were launched, it was too late. No trace of the vessel or any survivors could be found. On board were 1,053 Australian prisoners of war and civilians who had been captured and held by the Japanese at Rabaul on the island of

        Through the war, Australian authorities sought information on the whereabouts of those captured at Rabaul. However, they were never informed that the
        <i>
         Montevideo Maru
        </i>
        was sunk with the loss of all prisoners during the war. It was not until after the war that Australian authorities discovered the tragic story. With 1 July this year being the 67th anniversary of the sinking of the ship, we will pause to remember the loss. The servicemen lost on the
        <i>
         Montevideo Maru
        </i>
        are among the 12,104 casualties of World War

        who have no known grave.
       </p>
       <p>
        On 1 July this year, the Australian Ambassador to the Philippines, Mr Rod Smith, will unveil a plaque commemorating those on board the
        <i>

        The families and associations with connections to the
        <i>

        </i>
        have never lost sight of the tragedy that occurred 67 years ago. That it is still shrouded in mystery must also add to their sense of loss. It is something that we as a nation should never forget, as I am sure all members would agree.

         I rise on indulgence, Mr Speaker. I would like to associate the coalition with the minister’s remarks. The sinking of the
         <i>
          <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montevideo_Maru" rel="nofollow">
           Montevideo Maru

         </i>
         with the loss of 1,053 Australian prisoners of war and civilians on 1 July 1942 is the greatest single tragedy in Australia’s maritime history. More importantly, it is also one of our lesser known. The
         <i>
          Montevideo Maru
         </i>
         sank after being torpedoed off the Philippines. There were no survivors. The Australian prisoners of war and civilians who perished had been captured and held by the Japanese at Rabaul on the Island of
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Britain" rel="nofollow">
          New Britain
         </a>
         in what is now known as
         <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papua_New_Guinea" rel="nofollow">
          Papua New Guinea
         </a>
         . I note that the names of the army and air force casualties are listed on the memorial to the missing at the Bita Paka war cemetery in Rabaul, which I have had the honour of visiting.
        </p>
        <p>
         In placing my condolences on the record today, I wish to help to bring to the attention of the Australian public this little-known sacrifice of 1,053 Australians on board the
         <i>
          Montevideo Maru
         </i>
         so many years ago. In particular, I wish to thank and acknowledge those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for this nation, a sacrifice that has contributed to the peace that we enjoy today.
        </p>
        <p>
         I understand that on 1 July on the 67th anniversary of the tragedy the Australian Ambassador to the Philippines will unveil a new plaque commemorating those on board the
         <i>
          Montevideo Maru
         </i>
         on behalf of the

          Hell Ships
         </a>
         Memorial established in memory of all the ships that carried prisoners of war. I commend this latest acknowledgement of the tragedy, but also wish to remind the House of the important and vital contribution of our veteran community, past, present and also into the future. It is important in honouring those who have served our nation and given the ultimate sacrifice and also in acknowledging the significant loss to their families that every effort is made to locate the resting place of those who lost their lives at sea on that fateful day. I ask and urge the government to do everything that it can to locate the resting place of those who lost their lives when the
         <i>
          Montevideo Maru
         </i>
         sank. Lest we forget.
