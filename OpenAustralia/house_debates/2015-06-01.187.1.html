        Madam Deputy Speaker, as I am sure you are aware, we in the House recently acknowledged National Volunteer Week, which ran from 11 May to 17 May. It is a privilege to rise today to once again bring to the attention of the House the invaluable and tireless efforts of volunteers across Australia every day. Driven by their kindness, compassion and sense of duty to their community, over six million volunteers in Australia contribute enormous economic and social benefits to our nation.
       </p>

        One such gentleman, who resides in the electorate of Canning, encapsulates this community spirit and dedication to serving fellow citizens in quite a remarkable way. Mr Athol Wigg
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JP" rel="nofollow">
         JP
        </a>
        has devoted over 60 years of his life to serving his community, most notably in a number of different community organisations based in Serpentine in the north of my electorate. He has also served the Serpentine St John Ambulance association, the Serpentine Scout Committee as its chairman, and the Serpentine Tennis Club, as well as a plethora of other community groups and committees too numerous to list in the time constraints upon me.
       </p>
       <p>
        In 1996, Mr Athol Wigg JP was appointed a justice of the peace. From 2002 to 2007, he was a councillor of the Shire of Serpentine-Jarrahdale, winning the shire's community service award in 2002. He continues his good work as a member of the Serpentine-Jarrahdale Land Conservation District Committee and as a member of the Serpentine Jarrahdale Shire Reserves Advisory Group. I am honoured to acknowledge Mr Wigg's record.
