       <p>
        I rise in relation to the strong partnership Australia has with Japan under this government. It is a relationship that is mutually beneficial, built on a strong trade agreement and a significant strategic partnership. Our shared interests in peace and security make us natural partners. There is an increasing confidence and trust because our two countries share not only a strong bond of friendship but also common values and interestsâ€”freedom, democracy, rule of law, open markets and free trade. Australia has also agreed to share defence science technology and equipment, which will deepen our security relationship.
       </p>
       <p>
        Locally, our partnership has important flow-on effects for my electorate of Robertson through the bilateral free trade agreement. It is a significant step and the first time Japan has signed any trade agreement with a major agricultural country. This will enhance two-way trade and investment between Australia and Japan and will help the creation of more jobs on the coast. One-in-five jobs in Australia is linked to trade, so to complete this agreement with a major trading partner in Asia is only going to provide more opportunity for our local exporters and services on the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Coast" rel="nofollow">
         Central Coast
        </a>
        and to create more jobs. In my electorate that is great news, particularly for the people of
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove_Mountain" rel="nofollow">
         Mangrove Mountain
        </a>
        . There is a strong local industry there for poultry, tomatoes, citrus, avocados and also Asian vegetables such as bok choy.
       </p>
       <p>
        Services are 70 per cent of our Australian economy, and this agreement will mean that business service firms on the Central Coast will be able to have access to Japan that they have not had before. It is one of many examples of how building stronger trading relationships in Asia is critical to Australia's economic future. I commend the Australian government for enhancing the relationship between Australia and Japan, and I acknowledge the importance of the visit to Australia of the Prime Minister of Japan, His Excellency Mr Shinzo Abe, next month and his address to the House of Representatives on Tuesday, 8 July. It is another step in further building our strategic partnership with Japan into a new, special relationship.
       </p>
       <p>
        The relationship between our nations can also be seen on a much smaller scale in Gosford. Gosford has been a sister city with Edogawa in Tokyo for the past 26 years, and there is a beautiful Japanese garden in
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Gosford" rel="nofollow">
         East Gosford
        </a>
        that is a long-standing marker of our friendship. It was a gift to the
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/City_of_Gosford" rel="nofollow">

        </a>
        from the people of Edogawa. It was officially opened in 1994 and it has been a place for reflection and peace ever since. Through the bilateral free trade agreement with Japan and our strategic partnership, this government is building a relationship that is good for the Central Coast region, good for Australia, good for Japan and good for the world.
