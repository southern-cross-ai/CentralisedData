Unclear how funneling money to a Japanese software company led an ABC journalist to consider that this might help the 100,000's of people employed in the live music and hospitality sectors. Clickbait title even by ABC standards 
no, this shit will not help our music industry, decreasing the alcohol tax, giving venues more protections from NIMBYS, and giving venues some forms of help with the increasing cost of insurance is what will help the music business.
If by ‘save’ you mean ‘make immeasurably worse’ then sure
lol no
Who the fuck would pay 200 bucks to watch a cartoon on a screen.
HATSUNE MIKU !!!!!!! 💜 💜 💜
We have people who are brilliant musicians, but no let's use some mindless computer characters instead?
This stuff will catch on in Australia eventually but it's not really a competitor to the music industry here. 

The reporter doesn't understand that it's an assholes to oranges comparison.
No.
Those artists usually are backed by big companies with lots of $$$  

If we had big companies splashing around lots of $$$ into the industry, would the problem exist in the first case?
The concert has sold out, and Hatsune Miku is really popular. The songs and visuals mixed with the energy from the crowd is really nice.
Me!!!
The “computer characters” are still made by human beings…
I strongly doubt that this technology will save the Australian music industry. It might help some producers but I think it will be detrimental to the musicians who create the music.
