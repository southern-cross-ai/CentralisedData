The majority of discussion here is about accuracy of statistics, not how women are suffering indignity and potentially endangering their health by using sanitary products beyond reasonable time frames in place. 

Does anyone else feel like the point is being sorely missed here?
>About three in five people with periods have struggled to afford menstrual products and one in four have worn a tampon or pad for more than four hours in the past year due to cost, an Australian survey of more than 153,000 people has found.
>
>In its second triennial report on period poverty, charity Share the Dignity found that periods were still having a substantial impact on the ability of women, girls and gender-diverse people who menstruate to study, work and play sport without interruption, due to cost, pain and stigma.
I switched to a cup in 2021. My child i buy the big w washable undies. I highly recommend use of cups and other reusable stuff.
The fact that period products aren't universally free and accessible as a essential item in this day and age if nothing short of disappointing. People who have allergies and require specific products get a special hell as well.

Edit: typo, are -> aren't.
I’m really impressed with the modibodi period underwear. If you get them on sale it’s a worthwhile investment. Wish I’d bought them years ago.
Am I missing something, period poverty is normal poverty. There are lots of indignities from being poor, this being one of them. Our quality of life has decreased while cost of living and housing is out of control. This isn't really a gender equality issue, it is a greedy capitalism one, and people trying to turn it into a wedge culture war issue like everything else as a distraction.
I'm assuming this is 1 in 5 women with periods..
The 'heh well actually' crowd don't care about things like dignity and hygiene.
Completely missing the point in favour of arguing semantics is what reddit is best at.
They couldn't have missed it harder if they tried.
Some people here only care about people like them, and it shows.
What worries me the most about this headline is the implicit assumption that "1 in 5 aussies" includes men, implying that the true number is actually >2 in 5.

It appears as though the headline has been chosen to downplay a pretty fucking serious issue in our society.
> one in four have worn a tampon or pad for more than four hours

lol, I don’t know anyone who gets up in the middle of the night to change a tampon

Actually that’s not true, I did on occasion of DEVIL FLOW due to endo, but only if I woke up
While still a lot, "1 in five people with periods" is a very different number than "1 in five Australians"


Like, less than half.
I bought a cup but haven’t tried it yet, but the reusable undies are pretty fantastic on days I’m at home. Kmart have a cheap version of anyone wants proof of concept before they invest in something like the bonds or modibodi ones.

The cup I bought says to replace it after a year, which makes it on par or more expensive than disposables.
I use the underwear, but I'll point out the underwear, while great, is a considerable upfront investment ($25-$40/pair) AND requires access to the ability to wash them in cold water and air-dry them.
Yeah, I use cups and washable undies these days. The cup took a bit of getting used to, and putting it in and removing it isn't the most comfortable, but it's great while it's in there. The undies I prefer to pads because they're more comfortable and you don't have to worry about them coming unstuck, though rinsing them is a little work and I don't like how they feel when they're wet. They're fantastic for those days at the beginning and end of your cycle when you're bleeding lightly or stopping and starting so you either take a risk or waste a pad.
> This isn't really a gender equality issue

Huh, weird, I could've sworn that period products absolutely effected one gender over the other at a significant rate.

> people trying to turn it into a wedge culture war issue like everything else as a distraction.

No-one is doing that, it's literally a charity that's focused on menstrual products and the like reporting their findings that the cost of living is fucking over people who need said products, you'd know this if you actually read it instead of running to make your snowflake post.
It's a charity focused on periods so yeah, they only survey people with periods. That said the sample is really large, over 150k. Most people get periods for a good four decades of their life, so 1 in 5 of that group is still a large chunk of the total population.
You do realise that covers the vast majority of girls and women aged 9 - 60, right? It's not a small number.
Not quite; it's 1 in 5 **people** with periods [have improvised due to cost] **in the past year**

Not just women, and not 'in their lifetime' or anything like that.
Especially when they get to "um, actually" about something that doesn't directly effect them.
They did try, and they tried to make others miss it or doubt its relevance or credibility.
I don't think the headline is as big an issue as the inaction we have seen and will see on this issue.

It could 1/2 Aussies in the headline in actuality and it will spur no action.
> due to cost

They may wear it all night, but those 3 words at the end you left out implies that they are increasing the time between so a packet can last longer. I.e. if they had money they would change it more often, but they can't afford to change it as often as they would like, or perhaps should in some cases.

I can't comment on time with regards to this, would have to ask my wife as I never noticed and didn't need to worry about how much she needed something.  
But I did grown up poor, and making something last twice as long when it was broken and dirty, well I wish that on no one, it's embarrassing and something you hide and as a society I think we should, and can do better.
Kind of missing the point, aren’t you?
There's multiple comments about this. Duh why do you need this clarified? Of course it means women, why so pedantic?
Agree. Headline is misleading. 

They reckon 26% of people globally menstruate, so if that’s true in Australia, we’re looking at ~5% of Australians who have improvised due to cost. 

I wasn’t part of this survey, and period products are very expensive, but I’ve definitely had to improvise due to being a dumbarse who can’t use a calendar. Not for cost, though I’m not at all surprised that it’s a problem.
Definitely people should try the cheap cups first, I shelled out $60 a while back when Diva cup was the only one around only to find that my body is not cup compatible.
Mine is like 7 years old. I should probably replace it. Diva cup website says 5 years though Healthline says some last up to 10.
I’ve been using the same cup for 10 years 💀to be fair I don’t bleed every month (hormonal birth control) but throwing it out every year is crazy 
You can get some real cheap at Kmart. They are definitely a lot less on-the-go than pads, though. They're not something I'd like to be dealing with outside the home, either in terms of changing them or having to have them on hand and switch in if my period suddenly started. I'd only wear them out if I didn't expect to be bleeding into them much.
I bought my child two packs of the big w girl ones and they cost $50 total. She’s been using them for 6 months on rotation, I wash them and air dry near the heater. Really happy with the quality and cheap and dry quickly
I did the survey and they asked a lot of questions which could determine if you have bleed in the past, currently get your period, trying for a baby, menopause etc. so they knew how to interpret the data
Oh period poverty is definitely a thing. I just think the metric they used was a bit strange. Four hours really isn’t a long time at all and if your flow is light it can actually be painful taking out a tampon before it’s full.
Because transgender men and non binary people get periods as well , they're using inclusive language.
Its still a lot of people, and it shouldnt happen at all. In some places sanitary items are free so no one has to suffer the indignity of not being able to afford them.
It’s not misleading. Even if one person couldn’t afford it that is still too much for a lucky country, wouldn’t you agree?
But saying 5% is also misleading when the problem isn't applicable to over half of the population. Headline should be 20% of people who menstraute, not 20% of australians OR 5% of australians.
The paperwork in my divacup says one year. Good to know their website says longer.
That's cool! I love a well designed survey, and I'm impressed by that sample size. It really shows how many people wanted to share their opinions on periods.
Ah, sorry, felt like you were dismissing it all on one point.

Looking in to it though, it seems that's a baseline, less than 4 is not in the questions, which would be because of this in the article: 

> Medical experts recommend changing disposable period products every four to eight hours to avoid infection.

I have no idea how right or wrong the above statement is(no references in the article), I'm guessing that's where the 4hrs came from though.

The wording is poor, perhaps it just sounded more clickable, if only the free internet didn't need ads...
I think they're taking more problem with the headline being "one in five australians" rather than "one in five australians who require period products"
I mean why are the commenters being pedantic not the article
More because plenty of people with the right equipment don't have periods - because they're too old, too young, pregnant, breast feeding, on hormonal birth control, having health issues that block menstruation, or any one of a dozen other reasons.


A biological female who lives to eighty will only menstruate for around half her life.
There are still places that they’re free, it’s just not super widely advertised. My old uni had free pads in a lot of the bathrooms and my town’s library has a free dispenser in the bathrooms that gives (I believe) two tampons and a pad in a little box and there’s no limit.
It's not just misleading, it's flat out wrong. But it's hardly the most important point to discuss anyway, it's too high regardless.  It would be nice if you wrote an accurate h aslibe next time, if only so the comments don't get diverted
It’s definitely misleading. 

I said the cost is too high, and I said that I’m not surprised cost is a problem, but yes, anyone who understands statistics knows that this headline is misleading.
Not sure if you’re aware of this, but the ~ symbol I used before 5% means approximately. 

But yeah, i wrote a social media comment, not a published headline.
> Period poverty in Australia is forcing people to make their own menstrual products

If you'd actually clicked the link you'd learn this was the published headline, if you actually cared about the content of the story you would also be far more annoyed by how badly people are being affected by something that should be a basic right, instead of a minor incongruity.
Absolutely.

I was put off at the start because it was so long, but then I figured “if everybody couldn’t be bothered we will never learn anything about our bodies”
Yeah it’s something we are all taught in high school about period product safety - it’s to reduce the (already extremely low) risk of what’s called Toxic Shock Syndrome. TSS is very serious but also extremely rare, between 0.3 and 3-4 cases per 100,000 depending on the type of bacteria and location (higher in the developing world due to lack of clean water). 

Because the condition can be so serious the recommendations are very very conservative, to the point of absurdity. “Don’t leave in longer than 4 hours” is a bit like “women shouldn’t drink more than two standard drinks a week to reduce their lifetime risk of death.”
Approx would hardly change the sentiment.   
No one is reading the headline and thinking it means 20% of australians when we know 20% wouldn't even have periods.
Never said I didn't care, just responding to people who are using the headline inaccuracy to minimise the problem.
