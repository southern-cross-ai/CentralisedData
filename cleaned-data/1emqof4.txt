Just classic New Zealand politics when stuff is going shit domestically they make dumb statements like this
From reading the article, the guy's just a cunt all round.
The guy is a cockwomble
What a moron. If you are going to have a bit of banter you need to be a little cheeky or smart with it (ie raising the IQ of both countries). It needs to be funny and usually you want to person you're taking the piss out of there to have a giggle with you.

It just looks bad to just basically flat out say Australians are dumb to a bunch of non-Australians. No cheek, no double meaning, nothing witty about it, nobody there to laugh it off. 

Best part is the video where Winston Peters just looks to the sky and cringes.
Just call Australians dumb distract Kiwis from realising how much better life is over here.
To give some perspective, imagine if Australia had Alan Joyce as prime minister. That‚Äôs what it‚Äôs like for NZ at the moment.

But hey, a country usually deserves the politicians it elects.
Maybe we could appoint Trevor Chappell as ambassador to New Zealand. That way nothing would go over Chris Luxon's head.
> Goldsmith said he didn‚Äôt think Burke would know what Aotearoa meant.

This is just dumb, rent free, little brother shit.
Good grief, I almost feel bad for the NZ people for having to deal with an entire term with these wankers in power, but then I remembered that the people voted them into government in the first place for some reason.
Racist cunt is being a racist cunt. More news at 11.
Does he think a *multicultural affairs minister* will throw a letter in the bin if it has words he doesn't understand in it?
I just spent six months in a leaky boat
>Goldsmith said he didn‚Äôt think Burke would know what Aotearoa meant.

I seriously doubt that.
Bloke‚Äôs just dirty we‚Äôre up in the medal tally
We really should annex these guys.
Conservative politicians worldwide say stupid stuff & are weird.  
Who knew.
That‚Äôs all good. Us in Australian are used to coping NZ‚Äôs shit when they want to cause distraction from their own domestic problems, which are mounting up under him I might add.
Do you reckon Kiwis die instantly the second they climb down off their  high horse, or is there a grace period? Either way, we'll never know.
Yeah mr luxon is a push over I have no idea what he was doing in his CEO days but man it must of been bad.
Luxon is not fit to govern, and goldsmith needs to stay out of operational matters at tvnz. Part of language revitalisation is using it even when the recipient doesn't understand it - because they will go google for themselves. Toi tu te tiriti
Sad indication of things to come- üòû
Someone got an address we can start sending inflatable sheep to? This miserable bastard seems like he could use the pick me up
The ghost of Piggy Muldoon arises.
Oh. I thought it was because he's a racist cunt.
The guy in the photo reminds me of the best thing we ever stole from kiwiland - John Clarke
If they were to send a letter to a non English speaking country written in the language of that land would we not respect and appreciate the effort to communicate effectively?
Mind you Australia doesn't have a formally recognised national language üòÜ
Right-wing politician stirs nationalistic sentiment. *sigh*
Luxon is a racist
Lol k
Krikey Jacinda hasn't aged well
>Ah, c'mon all you lads

>Let's forget and forgive

>There's a world to explore

>Tales to tell back on shore
Egg head tries to appease everyone, does the opposite. Such a people guy
Face like a slapped arse,
Didnt they just get rid of Maori names for stuff themselves? Pretty sure that was on the news last year
He's speaking to a domestic audience (in the same vein as that classic "NZers who move to Australia improve the IQ of both countries" saying from back in the day)

There are a lot of activists in New Zealand who simply do not understand that *almost no-one outside New Zealand speaks any Maori whatsoever* (and most NZers do not speak it either; it's "flavour text" for the majority of the population), and so it should be treated as a "foreign language".

Like if an Indonesian Government Minister wishes to communicate with an Australian Government (or any English-speaking Government, for that matter) Minister, they aren't going to begin the letter in English with "Yang terhormat Pak Menteri", fill it with random Indonesian phrases, and sign it off with "Dengan Hormat".

Basically, writing in English and filling your communication with lots of foreign words/phrases has the same pretentious energy as those people who randomly drop French or Latin or Japanese words into conversation to make themselves sound smart (or point out to others how smart they are) and it doesn't go down well.

Remember: Literally every person in New Zealand who speaks Maori also speaks fluent English too. It's not like Quebec where half the population (again, literally) cannot and does not speak English *at all*.
Shades of that cunt Piggy Muldoon.
Please stop embrassing me Chris, I like it here
Do you know what ‚ÄúnƒÅku noa, nƒÅ‚Äù means? I‚Äôm a kiwi and I have no idea. 

The government use the proper name of the country in official communications, there is nothing wrong with that.

The name of the country is ‚ÄúNew Zealand‚Äù and has been since long before the name ‚ÄúAotearoa‚Äù was ever used to refer to the country. 

If the name of the country is going to change then there should be a referendum about it.
It's a funny joke but it's pretty poor taste when people feel Maori culture is being repeatedly disrespected
Who cares. NZ should know it's place by now. It will always be the little sibling and will never tell Australia what to do.
Is it mandatory to say hello and goodbye in the Maori language in letters?  Noone outside of new Zealand knows what that means. Should leave Aotearoa in the leter sure...
Ironically he's trying to implement a copy of how you guys treat the native people it seems
Come on mates It's just banter, we have that kind of relationship with NZ - sorry you got your knickers in a twist¬†


¬†Fk me when did ya'll get so fkn sensitive?


Responses to this article absolutely proving this guy right tbh
Would love to know what you think of Albanese?
What swipe? I saw nothing but factual statements from him.
I hate the guy, but this:

>‚ÄúIn my dealings with Australians it always pays to be incredibly simple‚Äù

Unfathomably based.
This is called a Dad Joke
Tbf the reason stuff goes to shit domestically is because of dickheads like him in power
Yep, the dead cat is a beloved technique in every country Crosby Textor operates. Nobody did it better than PM John Key.
Kiwi here, yes.
I came back to Australia because of this guy
Yes many kiwis hate him.
If Winston Peters thinks you're a bit of a dick, then you really should stop and evaluate what you've just said or done - because you've just received an evaluation from an expert.

(I've always really wanted to like Winston Peters, but truth is he's not much better than a slightly smarter & less contentious Barnaby or Katter. And you could probably make a fair argument against the "slightly smarter" and "less contentious" parts of that statement...)
Ironically ‚Äòraising the IQ of both countries‚Äô is an insult to intelligence that is itself flat out plagiarised. Its has been around since the 1930s or 1940s in various forms usually applied to people moving from one US State to another.
New Zealand is /r/iamverysmart in nation-state form. The national currency is the Dunning-Kruger. If it wasn't such an intellectual and economic wasteland they mightn't continue to be obsessed with the neigbour their fellow countrymen continue to emigrate en masse to
He was probably thinking ‚Äúshit, he‚Äôs insulting our most important ally and security guarantor.‚Äù
Both his kids know.
They can't distract us, we all realise it already. Luxon is so astronomically out of touch with the average Kiwi that it is unlikely that he has any idea what we think about anything.
Bro don't act like we don't know. There's a reason we're losing so many people to you guys each year
Not even Trevor could deliver such a low ball. Man's got his head in a hole.
We should seriously do that. Cracker idea. He'd be high commissioner though, we don't have ambassadors between Commonwealth countries.
Don't feel sorry for us. This Government's approval rating has barely even dropped.
It‚Äôs like Muldoon all over again, except instead of massive public spending, they all lose their jobs and end up migrating to Australia.
Thanks for the sentiments mate. You are right. There are plenty of people who seem to be happy with this bunch of ghouls. It's pretty disheartening stuff.
Yeah people that voted these fkrs in are the 
Don't tread on me folk.
No, he wanted to remove te reo from official communications for ideological reasons, and came up with a pathetic excuse when called on it because it's still better than admitting the actual reason.
He was probably thinking ‚Äúshit, I‚Äôve been called out for being a bigot‚Ä¶ I should probably insult our most important ally!‚Äù
Luxon would, and so would most of his cabinet.
No, but he might just do it because it's from New Zealand
lucky
Nothing to it, leaky boaaat
Lucky just to keep afloat
100% New Zealand

100% natural resources

100% there for the taking
As someone who plays HOI4 as Australia alot, I really feel this statement.
Please do, our sheep borders are open
The irony is that nobody would be happier than Chris Luxon.
To be fair, Australia,New Zealand and the Pacific nations would be better off under one government and economy.
TBF we are vacuuming up all of their skilled labour thanks to this buffoon.
yeah, hows that for simple :P
Mismanaging Air NZ. You never hear a nice word said about him from the people who worked under him
The difference being that John Clarke was a legend and a national treasure. This guy is a conservative piece of trash.
I mean, it was an invitation to Matarirki, the only Maori public holiday and the minister went out of his way to remove the Maori and then the PM tried to defend it by saying that Australians need "incredibly simple" communication. C'mon.
> fill it with random Indonesian phrases...

> ...filling your communication with lots of foreign words/phrases

You repeat this as if simply saying it will make it become a truthful depiction of what happened. 2 phrases in the places where you expect the greeting and the sign off to be, plus the name of the country, is not *filling* it with *random* phrases.

I'm sure a lot of countries sprinkle in a bit of their own language in a similar way, and believe it or not people are capable of looking up words if they don't know what they mean.
Nah it's a bit poor. Most educated Aussies know what Aotearoa means, and could reasonably infer the use of Maori in place of hello and goodbye in a formal letter. If it's a letter for the minister for multicultural affairs, he should at least be familiar with the greetings of the countries who we have long standing relationships with (Indonesia, PNG, Philippines, China, India, NZ). It's not pretentious at all.

I'm just a white guy but even I know what Bharat and Zhongguo refer to
What?
Oh dear
Try reading the article before making a cunt out yourself.
Most of the guys downvoting you are terminally online beltway Kiwis who don‚Äôt like Luxon. Aussies don‚Äôt give a shit or care.
Yeah man it‚Äôs obviously a joke. No idea why people are biting
Yes, it's like these people have never seen a sheep f*ker joke either

This sub will take anything to be outraged over I guess.
My dad was a cunt too.
Kiwi here: agreed
I cannot articulate how much I loathe CT Group. "Sir" Lynton Crosby is a real piece of shit.
Seconded. Also a kiwi
And my axe
I think you mean, "Kiwi here, yis" üôÉ
I'm giving up on NZ and leaving if these absolute fuckwits get re-elected. I am already this close.
> really wanted to like Winston Peters, but truth is he's not much better than a slightly smarter & less contentious ~~Barnaby or~~ Katter.

I'd agree with most of that... you have to listen to Bob, 'cos every so often (well, maybe not *that* often) there's something worth hearing
You have put that perfectly. Peters could be great, there's something there, but he just turns out to be a bit shit each time.
More like a less-bigoted-but-still-bigoted and much smarter Pauline Hanson.
Yes [Will Rogers phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Rogers_phenomenon): 

> When the Okies left Oklahoma and moved to California, they raised the average intelligence level in both states.
Alright mate settle down lol. The irony of this comment calling anybody else iamverysmart material
Just remind them of the time the *whole country* fell for a mockumentary by Peter Jackson. That should bring em down a bit.
All of them from all sides of the political spectrum have no fucking clue what its like to be an average punter trying to survive, they all watch shit go up and do fuck all to alieviate the tension.
Woo Hoo !!
Fucking oath, imagine the bloody rugby team?
Yeah, I should have emphasised that he reminds me physically. Pretty sure that Clarke would not be on board politically.
That doesn't change anything. Official invitations in English to the national days of other countries aren't filled with random "foreign" phrases. NZ isn't special.
By my count there's at least seven different Maori words or phrases in the letter, one of which is repeated five times throughout the letter (and not actually given an explanation or translation until after it has been used a few times already).

And regardless of whether someone can "look up words if they don't know what they mean": That's not how clear, formal communication works, and absolutely not how it should work at International Ministerial level either.
üòÇ you are the dude he's describing mate
I did¬†


Now try watching the actual video of the comment in their parliament mate¬†¬†


¬†¬†Actually don't do that, I'd imagine you might get incredibly upset ???
Joke of the year, right? From one of the funniest guys working the circuit...

fuck me, if that was a joke we're more fucked than I thought.

And I reckon we are fucking fucked.
Yes it is hereditary
Sorry your country voted this idiot in. We all thought you might not got full Scott Morrison.
Thurdid
2023 NZ election was the first one I just... didn't want to vote in. Labour fucking up for three years, NACT being the dumpster fire it always was, and what, two Greens MPs arrested now?
Do it - Moved to Aus three years ago from Auckland. No regrets. Thanks for having me, seriously.
I actually agree with that - if you listen to a proper speech, presentation, or interview with Bob, particularly going back before the early 00's (and even further, when he was a state politician), it's clear that he's far from dumb and often quite insightful. I never particularly agreed with the man's politics, but they weren't stupid or clownish.

But at some point in the late 90's the media started choosing to focus on only the bits that made him look like a clown. *Then* he decided the best way to stay in the spotlight was to play along with that, *then* he decided to leave the Nats and become an independent, so the media went all-in on him being the hick clown. And they've done that ever since.

Still fairly smart underneath all that though, even if he does seem to suffer from occasional bouts of Relevance Deprivation Syndrome...
Thanks to Muldoon, most of the country believed that superannuation was a scam that would steal people‚Äôs money and turn New Zealand into a socialist state. Safe to say, not all Kiwis are the sharpest tools in the shed.
How are those Iraqi WMD's working out for you guys?¬†
There are very few negatives and a shit ton of positives, our exports would be world class our combined economies would boom, no passport needed to travel between NZ/Aussie/Fiji/Samoa etc and the rugby team would be godlike
Clarke would have been in his element taking the piss out of this guy.

He would have doubled his income with a regular pisstake of Luxon and whatever Australian politician du jour. üòâ
Ah yes, random foreign phrases like "Aotearoa New Zealand".
Damn bro you're really doubling down on this bad take. Talk about pretentious energy.
I never said it was funny. What I said was even an organism with a single braincell would be able to identify that it was said in jest.

I mean what kind of pathetic existence do all these people have to get upset by something so innocuous. It's a fucking embarrassment. Go do something meaningful with your time.
Fucking oath it is.
You had ScoMo, we‚Äôve got OhNo
Forfed
Arrested for what?¬†
Yeah, issue last time around is we had no one of any colour to vote for.
I lived in the UK for several years and moved back to NZ recently. Despite what a shitshow the UK has been for a few years now, I genuinely regret returning. NZ is clearly on the wrong track and the current lot are doing a speedrun. I have several friends and family members in Australia and nobody is even considering returning.
Good read, I am on board with this assessment.
Katter is certainly a character.  My favourite story is we were in a pub in Paddington Sydney - reasonably fancy - and Katter is at another table having dinner.

He didn't even look at the menu just told the waiter to ask the cook if he could have steak & eggs (it wasn't on the menu).  Lo and behold Katter gets his steak & eggs!  And then after dinner proceeds to go into the kitchen to thank the cooks.  

Everyone was noticing and to be honest we were pretty impressed by his whole schtick.  He's been 'method acting' for so long I actually think he is just like this now.
The election ad where he is sitting at his desk peddling this nonsense is just funny. I kind of liked Muldoon though, he didn't take any crap from anyone and said what he thought, even if it was bollocks.
Fithed
One shoplifted 10000 dollars worth of items, the other exploited migrants. 

The previous leader James Shaw left recently, he couldn‚Äôt deal with it anymore.
Yeah, it's really, really sad. Our poor country.
Suxed.
And james shaw was actually the normal one.

That's what I was waiting for. Thank you.¬†


I urge you all to listen to David Marr interview the director of the ANU history biography project on ABC's Late Night Live podcast. The woman has a glorious full Kiwi accent and she had me smirking all the way through. Sadly she did not say "sweet as", but she came damn close. Very refreshing.¬†

Well played.

I really love the Kiwis. Great people, very chill. And I could listen to them all day, especially when they get pissed off at us Aussie enimels, ay.¬†
