Threat Level Midnight
Does that mean they'll remove all the rubbish bins at the train stations again?
Meanwhile Barnaby Joyce is dog whistling gun owners because of wind farms.
People probably think “brown people from the Middle East” when they see this.

But in all likelihood, I’d expect they’re more worried about domestic threats from the ever present “cookers” that have been supercharged since COVID.

Edit: as if to prove my point, I’m now being direct messaged by cookers that I have upset.
>but noted an overall increase in polarisation in Australia and other western countries.

While this is definitely true, but has there actually been that many problems that have arised from that here? Looking at the UK, USA, Europe there seems to be a lot of violence especially compared to here.
Considering what’s happening in England at the moment, I’m not really surprised by this update.
I mean, didn’t we just have a far right radicalised teenager plan to take out a Labor MP? 

If there’s any risk, it’s domestic risk from both cookers and extreme far right groups and individuals.
>Mr Dutton said leaders should be clear that we "adhere to a strong set of values … the rule of law" and "respectful debate".

This potato is going to ignore his own words almost immediately, I guarantee it
> The Greens senator David Shoebridge said it was “deeply irresponsible for prime minister Albanese to use this moment as a platform to air his political grievances and conflate good people concerned with specific actions of his government with far-right conspiracy theorists”.

What's he referring to?
Going by what's happening in England right now we need to be on the look out for angry, violent, fat, bald, white men.
Since this is based largely on polarisation, I wonder if the government could use this to justify a crack down on the sources of polarisation, especially Murdoch media
"Lawful dissent, lawful protests are fine,” Burgess said. “It’s the people who think violence is the answer... "

There's a massive gap between lawful protest and violent protest in this country. One of the reasons people are pissed off is because every time someone does go out and protest, the arseholes in government go and tighten free speech laws making it nearly impossible to conduct a lawful protest. Free speech in this country is at an a time low, the police can run around and destroy people's lives with zero cause or evidence. 

It's happened to me

It happened very publicly to Friendly Jordies
Might be a link between what is happening in Europe, with regard to riots. If they state that these are terrorist events the penalties are much harsher. Seems they have been careful in where they perceive the threat to come from.
Australia, meanwhile, has raised its security level from “No worries” to “She’ll be alright, Mate.” Two more escalation levels remain: “Crikey! I think we’ll need to cancel the barbie this weekend!” and “The barbie is cancelled.” So far, no situation has ever warranted use of the final escalation level.…John Cleese..
Our news sites are terrible at keeping us informed as to what is going on in the world. You might think the only thing going on was the olympics by reading them. Burger inflation gets prominent placing on the ABC website at the moment.

A looming and imminent war in the middle east surely is the reason rather than covid cookers. At least be honest about it.
Congrats to the ASIO staff reading this on your overtime.
There's a war the other side of the world, ASIO has warned us the danger is imminent, Dutton's sensible response to this?... The Government should've done more about Uni Protestors. Everyone is concerned about Geopolitics. NOT DUTTON! he's gotta drag the Labor party through the shit Cause there's an election coming. SMRT MAN!!
I assume this just mean Mike Burgess wants a bigger budget and/or some more surveillance laws.
There is a reason why Mark Zuckerberg has built his family a bunker on a Hawaiian island, he has built the hate machine, and he can't turn it off because the investors wouldn't let him, so now we have to see it play out, and Mark can do that from his relatively safe, remote location while the rest of the keyboard warriors duke it out online and now it looks like it's going to turn real.
Yeah they aren't explicitly saying it, but it's the right wingers, fundamentalists and cookers. It's homegrown but heavily influenced by US Politics and ideology.
hmm they've been mentioning catching indian and Russian spies a lot in the past few weeks. they had the Chinese kidnap a political refugee not that long ago and they've said that indian spies are starting up training cells all across Australia while the indian goverment black balls us with proclamations of racism if we say anything..

as a brown Aussie, about time, I think.
What year is this? 2002?
There must be some bad shit coming out about the Federal Police.
The threat is white supremacy groups.. sorry to disappoint

Following on what’s been happening in England
Government hoping for another good ol distraction so the people briefly forget how shit our government is.
Probably a cooker.... most likely a cooker.
Thank you r/bobbyboobies for alerting Australia

Remember that "polarisation" is a bit of a politically correct term for "right wing violence". It would be a bit of a faux pas for a politician to refer to people who lean not much further to the right than the leader of the opposition as a domestic terror threat. But in reality the threat of violence from political extremes is heavily skewed towards the end that is most closely aligned with the views of the Nazi Party.

Lol the Australian watch list is full of anti Vax drug addicts
Genuine question - is the days of large scale terrorism attacks over now? As it’s all just lone actors or 2 man bands that can’t get access to anything? So therefore probability and ability to prevent is massively reduced as it’s harder to cover?
Is this so they can keep the fence on top of Parliament House?
This is connected to the presumed invasion of Lebanon by its neighbour.
Why don't they start by cracking down on Tiktok and Facebook Insta. Especially those fake articles sites. Where do they think people get these brainwashed ideas from. Those sites have gotten so out of hand. The negatives of these apps outweigh any positive it has.  
Mostly Facebook Tiktok and Instagram- They don't do enough with restricting fake content people put up. Any random person can make an article or video reel these days. I've deleted all three of those apps as they have completely gone off the rails.
Do you think the terrorists had nothing planned, heard this, and they’re having a quick brainstorm to see if they can pull something together for the occasion?
Yeah but how good is trading higher immigration to combat Australian citizens declining birth rates, higher house prices and rental income for those with property investment portfolios, cheaper competitive wages for corporations ultimately leading to the end result of a more racist divided country, constant protests about international problems and a higher threat of terrorism and a worst quality of life for everyone overall.
How strangely anomalous of them to announce big scary monsters hiding under the bed just before the full audit and request on what they have spent billions of taxpayers $$$$$ on. An organisation run by a fine gentleman that was in control of Te$tlra's 'cyber security' during its worst ravaging Burgess' styled 'sale of the century' of customer services/data and privacy and the telecommunications sectors worst data breaches in history as well as being an advisers during the whole submarine fiasco. 

Let's see which city they seed with magically and inexplicably, early released repeat offenders, this time. Maybe I should avoid the 'ethical hand brakes' and start an SP booky scheme to see which city wins. We could run it as a sweep stake and donate the money to charity. 

You can also guarantee old mate Dutto' is in amongst this somewhere. Drooling at getting more tax paying money for Wilson's, Serco and Lendlease for his friends and family not to mention companies that have no premises, employees or infrastructure.

Who gives a fuck I can’t even afford to move into a rental lol. That’s what I’m worried about
white supremacists and other hate groups are the cause of this
"...social cohesion was under strain..."


It appears self evident to me that policies like immigration and income tax are going to create tension within society as unemployment rises and cost of living puts further pressure on households. In prosperous times Governments get a huge amount of leeway to just extend and pretend but when an economic growth model collapses Governments get punished for trying to extend and pretend.


Having some friction and disharmony within society isn't always a bad thing. Times change, so must we.
good thing i dont live in a capital
>“But the advice that we have received is that more Australians are embracing a more diverse range of extreme ideologies and it is our responsibility to be vigilant.”

> The prime minister appealed to fellow political leaders to watch their language and to engage in public debate in “a way that is respectful”.

> “When the temperature of the security environment is rising, we must lower the temperature of debate – something I’ve been saying for some time,” he said. “Our words and our actions matter.”

my cracked theory (with nothing to back it up):  THIS IS A HONEY-POT.  
I think ASIO may be running a short-term campaign of high-sensitivity data collection, and have asked the government to very publicly & loudly BAIT a reaction.  Then they're watching what happens, who talks to who, where the traffic is coming from, and what demographic(s) their targeted audience is.  
We can then use the resulting data to strengthen Australian security, properly re-targeting our surveillance to where it will be most effective.
Conservatives injecting fear. Late stage capitalism yay
The ASIO boss reiterates that while Gaza is not the cause of the terror alert increase, it was a **”significant driver”**.

“It’s driven more emotion and heat into society,” Burgess says.

That’s a worrying link. The crowds of people demanding “Where’s the Jews” on October 8th was an interesting portent to this happening.

[We're at terror alert orange, which means something might go down, somewhere, in some way, at some point in time](https://youtu.be/VrNKh0b7Cog?si=K-sedhNWEYjoNNi0&t=1)
Vibes level : sketch
The problem has always been that loud minority confused about their identity. Social media indoctrinated and united them.
So the increase is supposed to mean there's a >50% chance of an incident in the next year in Australia, even though there is no imminent plan anyone is aware of.

I'm sorry I'd like to see the working out of that figure.
Will the USA blow up your gas supply pipeline?
So sort out the fucking social issues! This is just a drama-queen’s way of saying “we’re not doing a good enough job at looking after everybody and the people who aren’t getting looked after are becoming absolutely desperate”.  

I’m probably already on a list for some of the shit I’ve said in these subs.
When you ignore, marginalise, then berate entire groups, radicalisation becomes more likely. But let's just call these people names and demonise them some more. The important thing is we feel superior, not de-escalation.

There's a great talk by an economist, Mark Blythe, called Global Trumpism. People who think this phenomena of the rising far right is just racism are deeply misguided.
If this comment thread isn’t exact proof of what they’re talking about then I don’t know what is.

Half saying it’s just racist white people which ironically is racist in itself and just completely disregarding the fact that the article clearly states that the middle east situation is a “significant driver”.

The other half of the comments are people saying it’s the brown people and are also just completely disregarding parts of the article.

Guess what? You’re both right!

If you genuinely believe that this whole situation hasn’t made any australian muslims who genuinely believe that the other side are genocide deniers, more radicalised, you’re off your head.

And yet If you genuinely believe that seeing the streets full of muslims with the protests and straight up terrorist sympathisers hasn’t made already racist people more so, you’re also off your head.

There’s scumbags on both sides of this coin. There always is.
About time. 
What does that mean? I'm American. Our terrorism threat levels are red, orange, yellow, green, or sometimes blue.
i'm confused as to what extremist means though, does it refer to neo-nazis and fascists or anarchists and communists?
U.S dude here. Why? What did I miss?
Some serious global volatility right now. I know, I know… “things are always unstable”… but particularly right now with an imminent attack from Iran/hezbola , stocks tanking, unrest in the UK. Things are fucked.
Beige alert.
I think you mean threat level "We might need to cancel the barbie"
When he says extremism or far right,  he means normal every day political neutral citizens getting upset.  
When he says online radicalism, he means they want more ways to invade your privacy.

You can't fool us any more.
Still the safest time in human history for the average human.
Albo: prolly
keep an eye out for terrorism everyone
Bulldogs fans amirite
The only terrorist group in Australia I'm worried about is Albo's Labor party if I'm being honest.
Oh, so this is the new distraction we have being spewed to us all? Back to terrorists now?
Western society allowed people to vehemently support a terrorist group that does not share its core values, did not support it's long-time democratic ally being attacked on multiple fronts and now wonders why people are now becoming radicalised.

You couldn't make this up.
Islam is incompatible with the modern world.

I came to this conclusion after doing some reading of my own.

Liberal or moderate Islam is fine by all means, however, Islamic practice varies significantly due to cultural factors for example, Pakistan. Add in political factors such Sunni vs Shia factions, it's no wonder we have to deal with the problem that are exported. Islam has a long history of imperialism. 

I was shocked when Christopher Hitchens went full anti Islam after 911. I now realise he was way ahead.

Western left leaning folks are better served if holistic view of Islam is applied rather than traditional, 'underdog' perspective. Blind tolerance for the most intolerant of major religions is illogical and harmful for the modern democracy.

Having said all this, far right cookers are likely to do something terrible first. Pathetic belief that white race will wiped off will fuel some Fwit.
We need michael scarn
We're upping the terror level to ***Blackwatch Plaid***.
Not you, Dwigt.

Pricks like that just make responsible firearms owners and users lives even worse. Shits me up the wall.
Ralph Babet isn’t even dog whistling, dudes straight up spoiling for some kind of conflict against “the radical left.” Who is apparently responsible for this.
It’s always the ones you most medium suspect.
Where I live we have a bunch of the components sitting at our port waiting to get tricked into posi where they’ll be installed. I always knew they were big but fuck me dead, those things are fucken big
I kept getting Barnaby's mail when I rented his old house. Bloke doesn't respond and there is a pile about knee high of letters haha
The article very clearly says "The advisory says the spy agency Asio is “observing the emergence of domestic actors increasingly driven to action by socio-political issues, intersecting with personal grievances”.

“There is an increase in extremism, fuelled by conspiracy theories and anti-authority ideologies,” it states."

I mean, I take that as read to mean cookers, conspiracy nuts etc, so you're not wrong don't worry!
Supercharged is a good word to describe how off the hook they have become with their ideologies
I agree with this. Back in late 2020, I signed up to the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine trial and just made a post for friends to see as to what I had signed up for and that I'd continue to post updates as the trial continued. 

The amount of direct messages I had received from Cooked cunts was insane, particularly as it wasn't even a public post (someone screenshotted it and shared it). They ranged from "you're a government shill getting paid" to "I'll drop you cunt if I see you on the streets" because covid wasn't real... my wife was also hounded and told that I'd be "put on trial at Nuremberg 2.0" for facilitating the genocide. Some seriously unwell people.

It was truly insane and made we realise that we do have a tiny segment of hyper-aggressive, brainwashed radicals in this country.
Let's not forget that one of the more recent terrorism convictions was against Phil Galea, who was planning to bomb the Melbourne Anarchist Club, Socialist Alliance HQ, Trades Hall and 3CR radio whilst actively involved in the far-right milieu that also fueled the radicalisation of the Christchurch massacre shooter. Some of their people are cookers or share cooker "thinking points" and others are lifestylists but I have little doubt there would be those who see themselves as active crusaders amongst them still.
It’s probably going to be some terminally online 18 year old incel who’s watched too much Andrew Tate and then decides women or brown people or LGBT people are the reason for his failures in life
Yep. There’s a cooker at my work (white caucasian) who’s all in on the whole anti-government, cash only, racist, sovereign citizen, everything is a conspiracy thing… loves Trump and never shuts up about it all. Wherever he gets his information… that’s a scary place.
Yep just look what happened in Wieambilla
I made the mistake of replying to an antivax comment on social media about the polio vaccine, and the guy responded implying that it created AIDS. You can't reason these people out of positions they didn't reason themselves into...
Lol those people should really never cook again. They've burnt their fucking brains out of their skull. Like cool be sceptical. Question shit. 100%. But learn to ask the right questions, these people make my autistic ass look normal
100%. We’re almost certainly in more danger from the local lunatics than anyone from overseas.
Cookers are just the new diet right whingers
Only gonna get worse as nutjobs work themselves up with the American election, gonna be cooker central even in aus if trump (and let’s hope he does) loses in nov
100%, a senate committee took submissions on far right extremism twelve days ago.

i’d definitely be worried seeing what’s happening in the UK
“Don’t you dare call us domestic terrorists or bad things will happen to you!” - least insane Cooker
Oh it's definitely cookers behind this change in threat levels.
sorry im a bit ootl, what's a 'cooker'
Nice work - carry on upsetting them! Cookers gonna cook
The people upset by this are seriously, bafflingly weird
What’s cookers? 
What's a cooker?
To be fair, they have mentioned the middle east quite a few times now, and this new does seem to coincide with what's going on in England, but also what's going on in the Middle East.

Jim Chalmers has said said 7th of October several times.

Islamic Fundamentalism is going to be a problem for western civilization for a long time.
Well given what’s currently going on in the ME I wouldn’t be so sure about that. But then given whats going on in UK who knows?  Either way the world is turning to shit sadly
what does cookers mean in this context? Sorry if it seems like a stupid question but is it just slang for conspiracy theorists or does it mean something else? When I look it up online I just get ovens and air fries as search results.

edit: never mind I see this was already answered further down the thread.
110% its going to be a Covid cooker that finally decides they want to play Mr Stabby at the local Westfields or something.
I honestly am worried its more so the trump supporters.
I've been invited to an anti terrorism talk before, police hosted it and had guests from anti terror squads there to talk.

Guess who was the biggest thing they were worried about from the trends they were seeing in their daily work? Was it the immigrants? Nope. 

Hint: They like to cook. And they cook hard.
> But in all likelihood, I’d expect they’re more worried about domestic threats from the ever present “cookers” that have been supercharged since COVID.

even ignoring the cookers, there also a lot of despair in young people who have worked hard, done everything right, yet are facing homelessness due to unsustainable growth in housing costs.
Nothing like a fear of domestic terrorism to turn people into domestic terrorists.
Cookers?
Did you see the presser?
The vast majority of all terrorists attacks in the U.S. have been perpetrated by white American males.
American here: what’s a ‘cooker’? I googled it but came up short.
Like the religious nutters held up in the compounds the likes of which shot those police. We  cant mention them can we now. Nor the Nazis dancing around in state forests threatening people while wanting to start immigration race wars. "Friends of Sky News"
White Males are the ones most likely to commit terror attacks. What this nation has plenty of is white males with an anger issue. I am only surprised it has taken this long to raise the threat level.
It is brown people from the middle. They know that pledging “unwavering support for Israel “ , even when they are killing thousands of civilians, upsets those irrational arabs.
Yes definitely nothing to do with even the US telling it's citizens to get out of Lebanon as quickly as they can. /RollsEyes
>there actually been that many problems that have arised from that here?

There was that Australian white nationalist who left Australia to go kill 54 people in New Zealand. Could just as easily have happened here.
Did you forget when those chubby Nazis had their [little pride parade](https://www.9news.com.au/national/victoria-news-neo-nazis-storm-ballarat-on-anniversary-of-eureka-stockade/246e4aae-5b54-4e07-a47c-14eea23c64c5) in Ballarat, and when they were [randomly bashing hikers in national parks](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-03-22/neo-nazi-court-appeal-thomas-sewell-jacob-hersant/103619202)?  

There was an article just a few days ago about them trying to rebrand all the Nazi clubs as "Active Clubs" now. They'll keep trying this shit until we're just like the USA
I believe the threat level is referring to the risk of events happening in the future, not in the past
There's been several far right types caught with explosives and or plans for attacks in the past decade or so. We also had those crazies on that farm kill several cops, we've seen Nazis marching and assaulting people, and these groups are expanding.


There are actual problems here, you've just not been on the receiving end.
there have been organized/pre-meditated gay bashings in Canberra over the last few weeks. 

tell me that's not radicalised teens.
What I suspect the raising of today’s threat level is linked to is the increase in nationalist and right wing violence all over but especially in Europe and the UK over the last few days. You’ve got UK politicians like Farage stoking mobs of right wing extremists bashing the daylights out of people with dark skin and setting fire to buildings. This is politically motivated violence, ie terrorism.

With the increased rhetoric (Albo made multiple mentions of lowering the temperature) and some politicians and the media here determined to stoke the same level of tension for votes and ratings then we probably aren’t far off a similar outbreak of violence. Economic pressures certainly aren’t helping.
First of all, while we haven’t had an outright pogrom, there has been an increase in far-right “protests” including a few Nazi rallies.

Secondly, we absolutely do not want to open the door to these kinds of things. Not only do we need to be prepared for white supremacist attacks, but we also need to educating and deradicalising those that would be susceptible to Nazi propaganda
Probably why they raised the threat level, especially after the far right riots in the UK
Pretty sure the victims of the stabbing in the mall would say yes.
It's all connected. The same factors in play there exist here, we have high immigration, a globalised economy, and culture wars with a local population that feels aggrieved by all this, and is plugged into the international discourse fuelling the incidents. Australia might get lucky, but it might also just be behind the curve, there's no sense in pretending Australia is just magically immune to all of the pressures the Western world is facing.
Someone put a petrol IED on a Sydney man’s car [for flying a Palestinian flag](https://www.9news.com.au/national/palestine-flag-car-bomb-nsw-police-hunt-for-person-who-made-sinister-device/ffb48310-3e27-4a81-8880-31347ee92a6d) and a Palestinian man’s business in Melbourne [was burned down](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-01-31/burgertory-fire-two-people-arrested-caulfield/103409946), both earlier this year.

Definitely still violence here that needs to be discouraged.
As somebody who moved to Australia from the US, and for whom the political climate was a major factor I pray it doesn't get that way here. 

It's not been my experience so far, with Australia being far more middle of the road and moderate on most issues. Hopefully it can stay that way.
I keep seeing this but no one really is explaining what’s happening, I haven’t seen anything or caught up on the latest could you explain
Yep, the brownshirts are coming.
> from both cookers and extreme far right groups and individuals.


> both


This Venn diagram is a circle
Was that the guy with the fake gun in Frankston?
But, on the plus side, my Australian registered 'security' company with no address, phone, infrastructure, employees can expect a jolly good cash injection in the near future.
Albanese included a winge about the pro-Palestine protests that have been going on outside his office in the announcement about the raised terror threat, 
                  
"No-one is suggesting people should have conformity to particular views, but the way people express things is important," he said.
                
"It is not normal to have people in occupations for months outside [electorate offices](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-05/asio-lifts-terror-threat-level-to-probable/104141650), where the work of those electorate offices is to assist people." (ABC)
                 
As he has been doing for [some time](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jun/04/pro-palestine-protests-targeting-mps-electorate-offices-have-no-place-in-a-democracy-albanese-says) now,
              
The Greens are saying it's people's democratic [right to protest](https://greens.org.au/news/media-release/albanese-politicising-terror-threat-levels-doesnt-keep-us-safe) it & relevant given the government is permitting arms exports to the genocide.
               
Regardless of the issue being protested it just seems a bit entitled and absurd to me. You're a politician, you've specifically campaigned to have the job with the highest level of political responsibility in the land under the premise that you're fit for it. Don't want people protesting for months on end outside your office? Do a less shit job maybe.
Leave the bald community out of this.
Why is it always people that look like me? Bald fat white men need to take back our teddy bear image
I'm a woman. I've always been on the lookout for this....
Hey, Dutton isn't *that* violent
There is some real cognitive dissonance in that lot. Violent white men rioting following the crime of another violent young man. They refuse to admit that violent men are the issue here? Doesn’t matter the skin colour or religion, men’s violence is the problem
Finally, a riot where we’re allowed to discuss what the rioters look like and believe 
I assumed that was the exact reason for the increased threat level. Home grown cooker terrorism.
Don’t forget Rosy Red Faced, I like to call those ‘Pressure Cookers’ cause a little bit of something that’s a inconvenience or not their liking the Redder they get It’s like watching the Bus Driver in Billy Madison.
I fit 3 of these categories just not the angry and violent ones.
Why the hell would they do that? They *need* polarisation to keep the LNP afloat, because if the LNP collapses, then Labour has to compete with the Greens and Teals on *policy*, when they... have no good policies, just watered-down inadequate bullshit. Hell, if the LNP tanked *today*, and media had to treat the Greens as Opposition, the next election would be a catastrophe for Labour *solely* on 'they are wasting billions of our money on useless submarines to kiss America's ass instead of helping **you**'. Labour's shithead policies have made any Opposition *less shit* than them *dangerous*, and they need the LNP to stay relevant.
We can dream
They're more likely to crack down on pro-Palestinian rhetoric. Labor's stance on this issue is bleeding them voters. Making discussion on this become difficult would benefit them a lot more than taking on Murdoch again. They got absolutely rolled last time they tried that.
Murdoch is laughing his ass off right now. After decades of cuts to education, publicly aired misinformation and disinformation combined with deliberately inflammatory rhetoric, his life's work is finally paying off. Keeping the dumb racist poors fighting the disadvantaged immigrant poors so he and his fellow oligarchs can completely control the government not just without any scrutiny or challenge, but with the active SUPPORT of the dumb racist poors. He has successfully made any kind of political discourse impossible in favour of mouth frothing populism.
No, just invade everyones digital privacy further.  Media is OK.
I vote for the new scale as follows:

No worries > She’ll be right > Bit how ya goin’ > Crikey! > Fuck me dead!
I mean, the first thing on last nights ABC news was the escalatio threat in the ME vis a vis the 2 assasinations and attack on Beiruit, even before any Olympics items. But ok?
The burger inflation article is a pretty good read about how maccas is likely hiding profits overseas, reducing tax paid in Australia and making it seem like their pricing aligns with inflation when it realistically does not.
This is nonsense. The biggest terrorist threat in this country is the growing Neo-Nazi movement, who are *actively doing terrorist acts* in seeking to spread terror.
Well the hell DO we go to find better news?
You're doing a 50% great job fellas (disregard if half the raids are no longer at the wrong address).
If only the kids didn't protest there wouldn't be terrorism!
Bingo. Yesterday I was just wondering when terrorism would be back in the media-doom cycle.
He is being vague to cover himself against Murdoch but shit like this stews more hate against PoC and black people.
No it's not, he has mentioned the middle east and october seven many many times. It's probably both things sure, Russian misinformation also.
You think India is going to carry out a terror attack in Australia?

IMHO this is two things, Israel/Gaza and separately white fascists.
Nah, the Indian spies were here to keep a watch on anti-Indian govt dissenters & activities, they aren't interested in Aussies

On Australian soil, yes I think the probability of large scale attacks is low. By that I mean a large organised sophisticated group. But as Bondi proved, some lone fuckhead with a knife can inflict significant harm. Burgess was on 7:30 talking about the terminally online loners with zero crim history going from 0 - violence as their biggest concern.
Yep - any one who thinks it’s going to be right wing cookers hasn’t been reading the news….
Reddit is literally no better.
This seems to be being completely buried in these comments in favour of pretending it's because of the anti-vaxxers. Don't get me wrong, some of them are crazy, but ASIO doesn't seem to think they're planning to turn to violence.

The anti-Semitism is getting very real. We're talking people getting on the train in Caulfield (Melbourne suburb with a large Jewish population) asking every passenger in the carriage if they're Jewish. This has the terrifying feeling of 1930's Germany.
There is a very real normalisation of anti-Semitism going on at the moment, and it's not from Nazis. I've seen people walking around with shirts on saying "FUCK ISRAEL" and "FUCK THE JEWS", people being targeted and intimidated for daring speak in support of Israel and now businesses like Officeworks discriminating against Jewish people.

There is a consensus that because it's those on the Left doing all of this, it's okay. It's not.
Not sure why you were downvoted for a common sense comment, and one that places the blame equally on both sides of the political spectrum. Until we all accept responsibility across the entire diaspora, we'll have these issues. Society is a reflection of what we tolerate and that applies equally to all sides. We all share the responsibility to ensure no group is marginalised, no group is unheard, no group is mistreated. Apply that concept equally for a cohesive society.
I think this one is 50% chance of an attack in the next 12mths
It's kinda broad (just extremism in general) but they do specifically call out racist/nationalistic/religious motivations as a key motivator, so there seems to be more of a fear of rises in right wing ideologies.... although there seems to be a fear of "mixed ideologies" that are just kinda intellectually stupid, like "ANTIFA Nazi's"

> "[In] one particular incident, we have an individual that's latched onto ANTIFA, so extreme left wing, but actually in the manifesto, there's neo-Nazis … that defies logic," he said.

I haven’t caught a train in a long time. 
10 years ago bins were removed from most major stations as a safety precaution. Over the years they’ve been added back in these stations in transparent bags. Was it the IRA that caused the removal of bins in the UK?
It happened in Brisbane a few years back when everyone was in a panic over unattended bags.

Unforutantely the only high profile people that seem to support firearm owners in this country are generally fucking idiots.  We've had 20+ years of fear mongering of 'all guns are bad' in this country.  Would be unpopular/political suicide, for anyone with a lower status in politics to support senisble/fair firearms laws.    


Instead we get politicians trying to get cheap and easy points by being 'tough on guns' and bringing in half baked new laws.  


So yeah, firearm owners get made to look bad further by being associated with people like Barnaby.  Death spiral lol

> “There is an increase in extremism, fuelled by conspiracy theories and anti-authority ideologies,” it states."

Sovereign citizens
I mean the article also says:

The ASIO boss reiterates that while Gaza is not the cause of the terror alert increase, it was a **”significant driver**.

“It’s driven more emotion and heat into society,” Burgess says.

So not all blame lies at the feet of covid cookers unfortunately.
I think it’s across the board. There’s petrol being poured on everything online and add in societal issues and you’ve got a recipe for disaster. Cookers, Nazis, incels/manosphere, Jihadis, tankies etc just inhaling content online that isn’t even dark web or niche forums. Just out there in twitter etc. 

ASIO’s getting stretched across all of this and they’re dealing with the biggest uptick in actual foreign agents etc since the Cold War.
>Asked by a reporter whether any particular groups, including Jewish Australians, were more at risk of being targeted, Burgess said it was “across the board”.
>
> “Yes, there’s plenty of antisemitism but there’s plenty of Islamophobia at the same time. It’s kind of an almost equal treatment, not quite, but almost equal treatment.”
Yep. Cookers.
Expecting copycats from the UK stuff perhaps.

Wonder if Wieambilla inquest and upcoming Queensland elections has anything to do with it?
I've visited Australia and spoken to people from ages ranging from 15 to 45 and honestly was shocked at how many people believe what I'd consider conspiracy theories. When I asked why they believe in this or dig a bit deeper never got compelling answers.

Unfortunately it doesn't seem to be that tiny anymore:-(
I’m on the flip side- I’m in a study because I have never had covid despite multiple close exposures and I’m also highly reactive to the vaccine (hospitalised after each 3 doses). With my circle I joke I’m medically immune, but god forbid you say it publicly or you sound like a cooker trying to get out of wearing a mask and being immunised. I’d love to stay up to date with the vax, but I physically can’t!
This isn't too far off what happened with the Wiembilla shooting. The couple responsible had been radicalised online. Apparently the kid who stabbed that priest in Sydney back in April had been interacting with extremists online, too. 

I don't think it'll necessarily just be incels or young people, though. Ten years ago that might have been how it was, but nowadays middle aged and older people are also increasingly being radicalised online. It'll probably end up being a variety of different people because everyone's expecting it to be the stereotypical Arab person or occasionally a young whitey who's clearly been raised by the internet, when in reality *anyone* can end up like that nowadays.
I'm also very concerned about fuckwits who see everything that's kicked off in the UK and want their own action.
Not even that - just look at the Wieambilla incident.. methed up disillusioned sovereign citizens who went crazy after COVID. Shit I had friends whose political and social ideals went into red-flag territory and I had to let them go due to their unpredictable personalities..
Andrew Tate is brown - his father was an Afro American chess master.
This approach doesn't help, I think.  Sure, tbf, they're absolute msled dipshits.  However, if we were talking about radicalised young Muslim men we'd be all wringing our hands and asking how society failed them so badly that they'd turn so nasty.


These incels?  Nope. They're loser scum.


Disregard their starting points, and these two groups have a lot in common.  I feel people are quite vicious whem disregarding the perceived gripes of one group.


Not saying I disagree, though.  Both disaffected groups need monitoring, mentoring, and constructive direction.

> When Judge Blair sentenced him to 37 days in prison for violent disorder, she ruled he did not have to return to custody given he had already spent more than half a year in custody, which she described as "sufficient punishment".

> Hersant, who spent **three days behind bars**, was also not sentenced to further prison time but was ordered to complete 200 hours of community work.

> Last year, minutes after walking free from court, Hersant made a hand gesture in front of journalists and was later charged by police, who alleged it was a Nazi salute.

Completely learn their lesson from the 'sufficient punishment'.

They can keep trying but the system is designed to be so complex that it ensnare them every step of the way.
i really think elon musk is elevating the threat as well, as a lot of these cookers look up to him and think he’s some kind of god. it seems a lot of violence goes up at targeted groups especially when elon involves himself
Raising the terror threat and putting more resources into anti-terror police or laws or whatever wouldn't have stopped that.

We needed more mental health funding and we've gotten fuck all so far seemingly.
What I find to be a possible difference is that our geography and distribution of population is so different to the UK and US.

Everyone (statistically) lives within 100 kms of the east coast (Adelaide and Perth excepted), but the migrant population essentially lives in the (relatively) massive coastal capital cities, and mostly in the eastern ones.

Our Fox news - Sky - is broadcasting for free to regional Australia, and the right wing social media algorithms are obviously everywhere, but their target audience - pissed off poor and conservative people that want to be rich people - are either in the outer suburbs where multiculturalism is essentially already happening by default, or in the rural areas where (unfortunately) the main target is the local indigenous populations, which last time I checked, are accused of all sorts of things, but terror attacks seem very low on the list of Rupert's manufactured fears.

So I figure we are going to for sure to get cookers and whackos like everywhere else, but the chances of a Broken Hill local getting lunatic over a immigration family committing a crime are so low to be laughable. In Sydney for sure more likely, but the Italians, Sundanese and Lebannese in the surrounding suburbs are going to be equally horrified for various reasons and condemn it. 

Ranting, but TLDR - I see some hope we might be different. And as always - preferential and mandatory voting, its a fucking lifesaver from extremism.

Or we might just be 15 years behind the US as usual, who knows. :(
The Burgertory arsons were found by police to have not been hate crime related.
~~Ignore the other guy commenting, they're a troll who is posting blatant misinformation all over this comment section.~~ *(Edit - Their comments were removed, good riddance)* A 17 year old kid stabbed several children at a Taylor swift dance class, with 3 of them dying. Racists immediately jumped onto the fact that the perpetrator was brown and called it an Islamic terrorist attack, and have used that as an excuse to begin rioting in several cities. In reality, the perpetrator is not a Muslim (they were apparently raised Christian), and was born in Wales.
Some children were fatally stabbed at a Taylor Swift event. There was a lot of online misinformation after the stabbing that claimed it was perpetrated by an Islamic terrorist. This misinformation has led to mass protests by violent right wingers across England.
Background:

There’s been steadily rising tensions in Europe with immigrants, and in recent years those tensions have been really high. This started in the late 2000s/early 2010s, partially due to the immigration crises with people fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East. The other reason being the jihadist terror attacks with Europe being targeted a lot more than other western nations. That and these immigrants often struggle to assimilate with society for various reasons such as it being generally difficult to give up your local country, getting stuck in poverty when they arrive, and also general disdain towards these immigrants (due to the aforementioned reasons). This has affected countries like the UK, France, and Germany the most as these were the most desirable end goals for immigrants for various reasons. Places like Italy and Spain were also hit bad due to being the easiest places to get into Europe from.

People outside Europe like to think Europeans complaining about immigrants is just a case of racism, but it’s a big problem over there which we don’t experience in places like Australia because we’ve never had a problem like it before. There’s also genuine fear due to Europe being hit a lot harder than everyone else by the terrorist attacks in the early to mid 2010s. Those fears aren’t misplaced either, but it does create a lot of unfair hatred towards migrants.

Add in that western politics between the left and right has become a lot more divisive since Trump campaigned in 2016, and you get a lot more people supportive of right wing and far right wing ideologies in Europe. It’s why right wing ideologies are becoming incredibly popular in Europe, and while many mightn’t go to the same extreme levels, these tensions with immigrants are pushing a lot more people that way. Add in the US culture war that’s being exported across the west with Russia and China fanning the flames of this culture war, and you can see why politics has become hugely divisive in Europe and a lot of this hate is being taken out on immigrants. Side note, all of this is why Brexit was so popular despite being idiotic. People were scared of immigrants, and Brexit was perceived to offer safety from them despite the fact that it was idiotic.

What’s happened:

Recently the UK had their elections and the Labor Party (their left wing party) had a huge victory. This has caused a bunch of political tension between the left and right, with the far right groups in particular letting the country know they’re not happy by protesting heavily, and trying to intimidate a lot of people in these protests.

Then, the worst thing imaginable happened. A British man whose parents were Rwandan immigrants stabbed 10 kids, killing 3 (I think) and severely injuring the other 7. I’m sure you can see how this event angers the already pissed off far right crowd, and suddenly these protests turn into riots. But that’s not it. On top of that, there’s an information war being waged. Initially there was widespread misinformation saying the man was Arabic, exaggerating the damage, and saying there were multiple attacks, making this crowd even angrier thinking it wasn’t just 1 event. Then misinformation came from the other side initially saying the attack never happened, he was white etc. Problem with this, suddenly nobody knows what the truth actually is. Meaning, people speculate on the truth, and then they create their own truths to suit their narratives, and then they spread those truths. Which then spreads the hate, and suddenly the riots become worse.

What’s the real problem?

A lot of the genuine problems with immigrants are no longer real. Terrorism is no longer a concern and the immigration crisis has died down to sustainable levels. However, unfortunately because people are still cared of them, they’re an easy target to scapegoat for the real problems. What are real problems facing the UK? Years of economic mismanagement that have sent a lot of the country into poverty with little social security to protect them. This has caused crime to rise up massively, which has caused crime organisations and gangs to form, which has caused violent crime rates to skyrocket. That just causes more fear of immigrants since they make up a disproportionately large portion of the impoverished communities.

It also causes illicit drug use to increase a lot, as well as making medication a lot more unaffordable. What is comfortably the leading cause of random acts of violent crimes (ie against strangers and with no obvious motive)? Psychosis. What are the 2 main things that cause psychosis? Drug abuse and bad mental health. Something that’s only going to be more common in the current British economy. You seriously think a man will randomly walk into a room a stab to death a bunch of 10 year old girls for fun? While motive isn’t known, I’m willing to be it’s due to psychosis or mental health issues, both of which could’ve been avoided under a better economy.

Religion is antithesis to education, and lack of education causes so many of these violent men

Simply, education goes up, violence goes down. No wonder the third world is so violent
Except skin colour and religion do seem to matter as it is WHITE males of CHRISTIAN background that cause the most terror attacks. We need to stop glossing over this fact. We need to stop blaming immigrants and people of colour for shit that White Australian males do.
Ding ding ding!
As opposed to the ABC or even the BBC website, where it's not present at all.

Within a day or so, depending on how Iran decides to respond, there could be a literal all out war between them - including our major ally the USA. One is a nuclear power and the other a threshold nuclear power. Are we having the debate about what Australia is to do? No. We're talking about the threat from covid cookers and burgers.

If you were around for the first Iraq war it was saturation 24x7 coverage in the days and hours before it kicked off. So yeah.. ok.

That's fascinating. Did you by chance happen to catch the swine flu during the 2009 pandemic?

I recall the researchers discussing at one stage that there was an interesting but not well understood correlation between those who contracted the swine flu having close to a natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Whilst the viruses aren't connected or at all similar, the T-cells that were generated from H1N1 were effective against Covid.
We had some incel teen dress up in "tactical" gear and walk around Newcastle with a knife a few weeks ago.  
He went into our (labor) MPs office but noped out without talking to anyone, then wandered around the portside museum until the cops picked him up.  
He had this huge manifesto on the breakdown of society and all that crap.

That is not how the majority of people talk about Muslim terrorists and you know it. It is, however, the way many people and the majority of our media talk about men who commit femicide as well as homophobic and racist hate crimes; see here, the good bloke narrative. 

I agree with your last two paragraphs however.
> However, if we were talking about radicalised young Muslim men we'd be all wringing our hands and asking how society failed them so badly that they'd turn so nasty.

Really? Because it feels like when the shopping center stabbing attack happened people were ***really*** quick to speculate the attacker was an immigrant/refugee psycho. Or all the discourse around youth crime. Lots of handwringing there, definitely no one jumping to conclusions or talking about "extreme measures".

What system? You seem to have a lot of confidence that there's anything in place that will actually stop them, even though up until now not only has it not stopped them, but our political systems have actively protected and encouraged them, or are we just going to ignore the cops forever protecting them while they're sig heiling and the like?
You asked if radicalisation was really having noticeable effects. Yes yes it is.


You know it's not always the "mentally unwell" in the sense you imply that do things.

Though also more than one thing can be real.

We do need more mental health funding. also housing. Also access to third spaces. Also communities of various shapes and places to support people. Also raised alerts. Also open conversations. Also better education. Also better communication. Also less tolerance of the intolerable and so on.

Edit: I said radicalisation and you said polarisation. These are not the same but I think these days have convergent effects.

You really have to be careful, just look at the UK at the moment throwing everyday people like mom dads and the kids into one basket and calling them " right wing extremists"  

These people are ordinary people who are  protesting  about crime and the ability of their kids to walk the streets safely at all times. The majority are not haters.  

Its a bit unfair calling these ordinary legitimate protestors right wing extremists when they have a legitimate right to protest. Sure there is violence that is being promoted by extremists  with  hidden agendas of racism. 

My concern is that the UK  government seems to want to sweep the real social problems of crime in the UK under the carpet because its caused by their own policies. We don't want that culture here in Australia where everyone that we don't agree with suddenly becomes a threat to society and governments who don't want to take responsibility for the impacts of their  failed policies.  

And lets be honest all the European countries have the same issues. Country by country their populations are becoming very vocal because governments are trying to tag them as racists and right wing extremists. The reality is that is their failed policies that  lacks resources to make their policies fair and just while keeping the concept of a welcoming community alive. Frankly they are failing miserably.

We are slowly marching on the road towards Chinese communist party style totalitarianism. This is  where everyone that we dont like  or hate because their opinions or thinking does not agree with our and  governments  as well as the likes of  certain media groups pushing their own agendas. Do we really want to treat anyone with different thinking  like  a terrorist group. Is that a pretend  free democracy that we really want?
Are you really over hear making audio jokes? Lol. Love it.
Underrated comment, goddamn this was clever
Aaaagh... the trauma, the trauma...
You need to watch the actual interview on 730 because that article does a very poor job of paraphrasing Burgess’s response.

“It’s not a direct … so we didn’t raise the threat level in response to the conflict in Gaza but of course it has an indirect impact. **It has driven protest, it has driven division and those protests are getting very emotional and there’s been spontaneous violence** and it becomes a bit of it’s own weather system and the wrong thing happens and it fires up the other wrong thing. So **it’s driving very strong emotions and strong reactions**, again that’s our concern. 

Violence is more permissible for your political objective or promoting your cause. Peaceful protest is absolutely fine in this country, lawful protest and dissent is fine but when it becomes in peaceful and unlawful is when we know we have a problem.”

You are right, the contradiction in the ABC article is odd.
Have similarly noticed people within my social circle being very openly pro-genocide and speaking about Palestinian civilians as though they are all terrorist sympathisers that deserve to die.

It’s also incredibly sad that it’s true.
Why not both is because in this particular case it's all about politics.. they want to raise the awareness level without discussing divisive topics. The threat seemingly popped out of nowhere and there is no time to discuss - we just have to go where poppa US leads us. As for the commercial outlets there is no revenue in it, so again it's off the agenda.

Gulf war 1 was a relatively minor conflict where the result was never in doubt and the world didn't really have much stake in. There was the whole, the cold war is over so let's get out our toys thing going on.. but on the whole this situation is much more serious and should be seriously discussed.

Well to be fair, anyone in Gaza who didn't support terrorism before the Israeli counter attack would probably be thinking that terrorism isn't such a bad idea after being exposed to the horrors of war first hand. 

What's clear is the violence only causes more violence and it is an excellent tool to radicalise the other side. 

Things are so fucked up over there that "extremism" is the new mainstream and anyone who DOESN'T want to preemptively wipe out the other side is considered the extremist for not "supporting their own side" 

And this cancer is affecting our society. It's crazy how we have so many of our own who would be willing to sacrifice themselves for a far away country they probably never been to

The thing with H1N1 was that most people who had it, weren't aware. Maybe when your partner contracted it, your immune system was exposed to it which in turn may have bolstered / altered your T-cells to fight off SARS-CoV-2... or I could be talking complete nonsense (hopefully someone smarter than I can read this and correct me if I'm wrong).

> Two men were told to set fire to a Melbourne burger store through a middleman who took orders from “somebody above”, police have alleged in court.

Seems weird though that someone would randomly have hired goons burn down a Palestinian guy’s restaurant don’t you think? The goons and middleman paid to blaze it are motivated by money not hatred, but you think it was the magic arson fairy who bankrolled it?

No idea. Not sure who else it would be though. They could pass on to relevant people if it’s not them.
It will be added to a big pile of information and might get them put on a list. In all honesty for most cases it won’t do anything but sometimes it’s the missing piece of the puzzle
I’m pretty sure these guys sit above crimestoppers - I’ve seen the signs in the airport/s so I think they’re tied up with AFP etc
In reality, this isn't a "two-sides" issue. Most people believe both sides deserve rights & statehood. Most people believe both sides are racist & violent.

The problem is Israel has complete power over the region, hoarding land, resources, & political legitimacy. People say Hamas are terrorists that should be wiped out, i don't disagree, but Israel has committed far greater acts of destruction & slaughter. Hamas killed 43 children in Israel, Israel killed over 15'000, intentionally reducing a state to rubble.

Israel denies any occupation, but claims complete authority over Palestine when they say they won't allow statehood (holding rights hostage). International law is clear, occupations must be temporary & provide for locals, they can never take land or displace people.

I think Free-Palestine is mostly about freedom & human rights for the people who lack it (requires an end to the hostile occupation), and for the violence to stop (requires Israel be condemned alongside Hamas).

If we ask for the UN to arbitrate peaceful borders, it becomes clear that Israel proponents don't want that. They want Israel to dictate their terms one-sidedly (despite Israel's failure over the past 50-80 years).
You sound way smarter than me so I’ll take it. I’ll ask the researchers next time I have a blood draw anyway, because it sounds like something they’d know about! 

You also stay healthy; it’s been a hell of a winter.
Bless for the extra info - will be looking into it more tomorrow. 


I don't "like" being a "snitch" but certain trains of thought should be stamped out and redirected to a healthier way of thinking 🤷
Just to point out, you say "holding rights hostage' while the other side are literally holding human hostages. You can think what you want, but these ideas of having to pick between two bad sides are not helpful. Yes, ine side is currently being disproportionately violent against the other compared to all violence before it, but this is nowhere near the start of this tit for tat, and is not without precedent just 10 months ago.

To the Israelis, they genuinely believe that they must crush Gaza with force because if they don't then they will get repeat October 7 attacks, as promised. I don't agree it can be crushed with force, but they do.

It is well over the top and inhumane, but the point still stands that this is the inevitable result of two sides using violence to escalate one another,  The suffering is also extreme for the Israelis, as they too have been killed in great numbers and live in fear, so this is in no way a one sided issue, in a psychological sense.
Please snitch.  Even if it's a case erring on the side of caution.
