Bob Katter is donning his akubra and preparing a "told you so" speech
What an awful story. Crocs can be very sneaky until they attack.
So sad for the family, kids left behind.

Visited the area recently. Camping etc. It was lovely. Never once thought to enter any major waterway, but I’ve lived in the tropics for the vast majority of my life.
The victim’s wife and kids must be traumatised.
It’s astonishing how fast they move. I saw a video at the croc place in Freo, this man walked to the edge of the water carrying a bucket, and before he could move one step a croc flashed out the water, snatched the bucket and made off with it. The guy was frozen still.
As is anyone who has been on the receiving end of Bobs rants.
