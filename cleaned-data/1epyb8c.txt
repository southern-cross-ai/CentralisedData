Is that not for the sleeper cab on the Kenworth.
But does Scania have swag? Thought so.
Scary if that's driving in cities.
It's not ot just the visibility, comically stupid cab design. Hilarious watching overweight men swinging on the monkey bars to get in.
I got that photo of the Scania to show it still doing heavy work, but you can get the same windows on a full size sleeper cabin which is larger than the Kenworth
That Scania no, but you can get sleeper Scania's ect with the same windows.
You see them all the time in Melbourne on normal roads
Wow. It's like a sick misinterpretation of Vision Zero.
