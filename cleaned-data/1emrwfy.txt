Fuck yeah we really popping off this Olympics
The fact it's not gold doesn't matter. He got a medal
I'm glad we're finally discussing discus.
Sensational effort. 

Persistence wins the day.
Damn so the only time until now that we won a medal in discus was during the first modern olympic games in 1896
Dude is an Olympian. They were already counted in the realm of gods. Now they've got a freakin' medal as well!
Saw him in Coles in the vege section. I think he was lost. My mother was born in his town (Allora).
It’s brown gold. 

Well done Denny.
On the day the Succulent Chinese Meal man passed away… seems appropriate for an Aussie to win a medal for spinning a version of a Lazy Susan very far and fast. 

(I’m hoping here that my remembering of going to Chinese restaurants when I was little for special family meals, in the early 80’ was the first time I’d ever experienced the device and concept of the lazy Susan….   how, if this was a “just me” thing… then my post above makes no sense 🫣😀)

Also… yay Denny 🇦🇺… treat yourself to a Chinese take out mate
Woo hoo Matt
Onya Denny
Absolute Legend! ... seems like a nice bloke on the telly.
He's a beast! Fuck yeah.
Top bloke good on him. That is a brutally hard sport on your body
Good ol' Denny Discus.
I really hate the “it’s not gold, but”. Let’s just celebrate this legend’s achievement. Third best in the world at something.
getting a medal in discus is amazing
Legend. Get IN
Yew !!!!!
Discus Denny likes discus music.
I like that in order to throw the disc he has become the disc.
Delete "It's not gold, but" .
Awesome dad bod hero
Thought you were asking us to discuss this bronze medal win
These throwing events seem really, really hard to win.

I mean I know all events are insanely difficult to gold in, but if I had to choose something to *git gud* at, it would not be a throwing event.

A bronze in discus is huge.
Good on him!
go get em green n gold 🤘🤘🤘
He looks like a hit man. Glad he’s on our side.
Why you gotta stress it's not gold? The dude got a medal at the Olympics in a sport that doesn't attract big sponsorship and big money.  Just making it to the Olympics is an amazing achievement.  Being the 3rd best in the world..... give the man his props rather than act like he could have done better. 

What colour medal have you got?
Lucky enough to attend the Games last weekend. Absolute vibe, and so proud of our team 💛💚 just crushing it
He's from Allora! How awesome that someone from such a tiny place pulled off a feat like that on the world stage. Getem mate.
Yeah can’t believe this even needs to be said. I was like, holy shit a fucking bronze in discus!!!!!
Any medal is amazing work, a top 5 is even great in my books. All athletes deserve some praise for their efforts regardless and the ones who didn't do as well as they hoped will be hard on themselves enough and hopefully come back better next time.
Never mind the medals, just being able to say you’re an Olympian is impressive as fuck.
We can discuss the discus disco later.
The fact that this conversation has been wanted for so long is discusting.
I say we continue to shun discus discussion.
Its discusting its taken so long.
Yes we really needed this discussion...its been too long!
About time we had some discourse and discussed discus on dis course
Or the century!
Australia is one of only five countries to have a participant at every Summer Games!
Now I'm just imaging what the 1892 Olympics were like
Allora represent. I knew the town had made it when Beetoota Advocate made an article about him and Allora.
Agree. Mad respect for him.
It must really be a vibe. Australia is just showing up :D
Hats off to the French. They've nailed it. Great enthusiastic crowds, turning up for every sport.
Apparently if Queensland were to compete separately they would currently be 7th in the medal tally
yeah, no lies.   Just qualifying to go is a huge achievement
[Eric the Eel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_the_Eel) and [Elizabeth Swaney](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Swaney) would be laughing at this.
Oh that's a neat fact.
The others being Switzerland, France, Greece, and the UK
They weren't.
They have a pretty good mural on the pub there dedicated to him
Stefanovich the other morning pronouncing it “Al-Lora “ 🤦‍♀️ dont get me started on the local news reporters either who should know how to pronounce it!
Wasn't that kind of skewed though? Because it just took where athletes live, ignoring the fact that many have moved to Queensland to train as that's were the Olympic team trains or something
The reason those performances are so memorable is because they are the exception. That can’t honestly be the level you imagine if you hear someone competed at the Olympics?
Most of the swimming team live and train in Queensland.
I know. He’s just winding you up. Have a good day.
