Glad to see some athletics medals for Aus! But the Ukrainian gold medallist was elite, there was no beating her.
Australia is used to having a few stand out individuals become world class in athletics here and there, but to have 2 of the best high jumpers in the world concurrently is pretty special. This is the first time we've won 2 medals in the same athletics field event. Nicola Olyslagers also becomes the only Australian field athlete to win a medal at consecutive Olympics. Huge achievement for both her and Eleanor Patterson!
All great. Beautiful beanpoles and fun to watch. 
Sucks she didn’t win gold because that’s the only medal that counts according to Australia.
Even though they ended up jumping the same height, Mahuchikh looked on another level with her technique and the amount of clearance she got at 2.00m. Can see how she has been able to jump so much higher even if she didn’t end up doing it last night.
Mahuchikh only jumped 2m. Nicola has jumped 2.03 before so she definitely had a chance.
No one says that. Its silly Americans who think all 3 medals have the same value.
Mahuchikh has jumped a 2.10m before which is the world record. But I was rooting for Nicola!
