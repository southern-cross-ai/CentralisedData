I know the weather is different in different parts of the country, but I’ve only had two mornings I’d consider properly cold this year. 

The midwinter 6am dog walks in Canberra are usually murder, but this year has been fine…
They never said it would be a warm winter. Only that their models indicated a higher chance of it being warmer than usual, than colder than usual.

Was the model or the BOM's analysis "wrong"? Of course not.
It's winter! It's cold. It's weather. Trying to cast aspersions on the BOM seems to be the medias fallback position these days. Even the above article recognises we are STILL ABOVE AVERAGE! The headline is borderline climate change denialist.


Climate is still warming, and Australia's average is increasing. Daily highs may be average, but overnight mins continue to increase.


Be thankful this winter is relatively cool....who knows what the next decade will look like?
I thought you weren’t allowed to call them the BOM anymore
I'm in Mandurah, WA, and for us here I think it has been mild and reasonably warm so far.
Because their supercomputer upgrade project was screwed by the IT contractor and they have not had a supercomputer for weather prediction for two years.
So much for global warming!
People don't understand probability.
Any reporting around the BOM seems absolute dogshit these days. But then everything is clickbaited to the extreme now.

BOM said on 30th May "there is an 80% chance of above median temperatures across the whole country. There will probably be typical rainfall levels for large swathes of the country."

And then I see headlines like:

"Unusually warm with a chance of rain: What Australia's weather is going to do in winter" - Actual headline by 9 31st May
That is simplistic. There is a lot more to the hpc and model upgrade than simply contractors == bad.
Probably not.
It is so so painful. And an easy thing to get views with.
Another case for Prollaby the Wallaby
