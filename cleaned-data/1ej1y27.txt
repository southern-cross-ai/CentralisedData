I can't believe it, the USA took another silver from us. How do they keep doing it?
Honorary Australian citizenship to the french spectator in the last point of the match.   

*”aller australie!!”*

Yes mate.  You’ve been lovely hosts.
So wholesome that two mid-30s dads just won gold. Seeing them celebrate with their kids was so heart-warming. Incredible work put in by the boys! 
FUCK YES. Down a set, down a break and came in very clutch in the last two tiebreaks. Very scary last few points though. 

Side note: Australia's now second on the medal tally.
Must feel bloody good for Matt after winning one lone game against Djokovic in the singles!
Australians are absolutely smashing it this games
Back to #2 spot in the medal tally, just one gold behind China
Thank god the crossed fingers did work the 4th time, the girl needs to practise more on her magic powers /s
Fucking great effort boys. Coming from a break down in the 2nd was very impressive.
Congratulations to the US team as well for winning an equal number of medals in the men's doubles.
Yeah thanks boys for taking it to the LAST BLOODY MEDAL POINT!!
The true winner was Peers' daughter crossing her fingers for those last few points. So pleased they were able to get the gold for her. That girl was STRESSED
"You'll remember that volley for the rest of your life, fuck ya"

Great celebration picked up on the stream 😂
My heart was in my mouth! What a game and what a win... allez Australia...
Psss psss psss, "this was an epic match".
Roy and HG are gonna love this.
Just great to see two normal knockabout blokes win and celebrate with their families. Not throwing shade on the other great performances,  but it's special to see "non big names" work their arses off and do themselves and us proud. Well done, .guys
Second in the medal table, let’s gooooooo

AUSSIE AUSSIE AUSSIE
Legendary!
These magnificent bastards!
Get it! Super happy with a win
What a great match to watch. Exciting the whole way
That was a cracking game of tennis.
Fucking Australians lol. Gg guys. I guess australia and the usa are rivals for life now. And to think that I used to tell people australian bake off was the best version.  (Still is although I havnt tried the new hosts and judges.)
Incredible match right down to the wire for both teams, good effort lads.
“We won!!!!!!” “I know!!!!!”
It was always going to be hard to beat two woodies.
Hell yeh tip to tip
This is like Jojo's cover and I love it.
Wow! I did not see that coming! Fucking great work, guys!
One of the greatest doubles matches I've ever watched, what a gutsy win!
So fuckin proud 👏👏👏
Couldn’t be happier about this one. Peers is such a good guy
After watching Ebden get destroyed by Novak, it was amazing to see him control the doubles matches so well. Ultra fast reaction time perfectly suited for doubles as opposed to the endurance and power required for singles. Fritz in the semi final was struggling to even understand where the ball went sometimes.
Does anyone else get excited reading "first" just to be disappointed soon after with "since".

Why not just say they won gold medal since...

It's always going to be first time since the last one.
"do I need a mint?!?"
Yeah the boiz
WHO??  Why have I not heard of these guys.  I’m not a huge tennis fan but am interested enough that I would expect to have at least heard of anyone capable of winning Olympic gold.  Will we see more of them on the tour now?
Dont you just hate how a lot of (mostly male) Olympic medallists seem to turn into screaming bags of hubristic hormones when they win?

Or they act like movie stars stepping out at a Premiere when they are introduced?

Just a short while ago, humility was pretty commonplace. Not any more it seems.

They were leading 7:6 4:2 as well, makes it even more sweet. Peers did some sorcery stuff in the super tiebreak, returning one of the balls back into play almost from the stands.
Probably should be *allez* - it means GO! (in plural, formal)
haha i also heard this and appreciated it.
It was cute seeing John Peers daughter both hands out in front her , fingers crossed. 🤞
Fuck they look old for mid '30s, they got them sun years on them for sure.
Amazing. If we had a “standard” rowing Olympics we could have been leading at this stage. Insane.
>Side note: Australia's now second on the medal tally.

Australia's lead tends to diminish over time, as the swimming events wrap up and other sports spin up. On the other hand, we were a lot lower recently, so who knows.
If Djokovic loses to Alcaraz I’d love him to message the joker for a gold medal update
Only bust so far has been rowing.
Second week is always our slow week.
They may win bronze too so unfortunately they extend their lead /s
They've both been on the tour for years and are well-ranked doubles players who have each won multiple grand slam tournaments.
This is a terrible take. 

Olympic athletes regardless of gender put in a lifetime of work and sacrifice to get there just to complete. Getting gold is the highest achievement on the planet. 

And in this case they had an absolutely nail biting win that took heroics and luck till the last ball. All that anticipation all, that stress and what? You want them to... Politely bow?

Why are you policing how someone emotionally expresses themselves, specifically men? Jess Fox was in tears. Saya Sakakibara screamed and collapsed on her bike. Our relay teams jumped around for joy. Do you hate those as well? 

It's sad that instead of empathizing with someone achieving success you have to critique how they express their emotions. Sad.
That was such a nuts point. Channeled his inner Alcaraz with that one
Absolutely, such a sweet moment! Her excitement was palpable, like a mini cheerleader! 🎉
Thats was adorable
Have missed most of the rowing this time around but what’s the reason? Just a bit of a transition Olympics or just some unfortunate events that saw us perform below par?
We’ve never been this high. 

We’ve won 12 gold so far. The most we’ve EVER won is 17. 

Considering the women rugby 7s didn’t win gold as well as quite a few male swimmers not winning as expected we’ve done amazing. 

We have some long distance runners who are solid medal chances and some field athletes too.
It’s a very unique situation for Australia to be this high on the medal tally at this stage in the Games. In fact, it has never happened. 

Yes we’ll drop back in the second week but what’s happened so far is quite remarkable.
Track and Field starts, Swimming stops and we tumble.
Not really a "if", I mean a 37 year old with a dodgy leg against a 21 year old seems like a forgone conclusion. We saw it at wimbledon this year. 

Djokovic has a lot of records, but father time is undefeated. Next gen/new gen outside of Sinner and Alcaraz continue to be a massive disappointment
And Rugby.
Depends how we are going in team sports. We have progressed in a fair few but not comfortably.
Yeah second week is where the U.S will start bringing in a lot
Isn't it day 8? And on day 8 we went from 8-12 medals. How's that slow?
You seem to have gotten confused over what I said that I hate. Sad.
Seriously, that moment was wild! Peers pulled off a miracle shot. It’s like he was playing on another level. Epic tennis!
Sacrificed most events in favour of men's eight.
Water Polo is looking strong. They just knocked off Hungry the World no 1 in group stage and have already beat France.
Hockey's looking good.
All of the sports starting in week two are beginning with heats/semis - their medals will start to come in the next couple of days. Mostly track/field.
You seem to hate the success of others, most likely due to the lack of your own.
Women’s hockey too.
Perhaps, all things are possible. 

But I am curious as to why you think that this is the "most likely" reason.
Just locked in a medal in a boxing as well possible to be gold still
One of the sailors seems to be way ahead through a few races too
