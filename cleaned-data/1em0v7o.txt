Bizarrely found this in the packaging of a face cream I bought at Chemist Warehouse.

Seen a few on eBay for wild amounts. Anything special about this one, or is it just a $1 beauty? 
Currently worth $1, but you might get more if you can find a greater fool. Tell them it's *an investment*...
yeah - about a dollar
Pretty sure it's worth 100 cents
Uncirculated one I found is $8: [https://shop.bradfordcoins.com.au/year-of-the-outback-2002-one-dollar-b-mint-mark-uncirculated-coin/](https://shop.bradfordcoins.com.au/year-of-the-outback-2002-one-dollar-b-mint-mark-uncirculated-coin/) but the 'catalogue value' for that is $6. A circulated one looks like it sold on ebay for $2.10: [https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/154907843312](https://www.ebay.com.au/itm/154907843312)

Since it's in pretty rough shape and not absolute mint condition it'll be much less than that, potentially not much more than its face value, alas.
I'll have to talk to my coin guy, and after three sets of ads he'll say it's worth 50 cents but I can only give you 25 cents because I have to make money.
LOL, "limited edition". They were mass-produced.
I'll give you 50 Cents.
Just collect them, i have heaps of 1 and 2s in a portfolio, not gonna spend them anyway
it’s worth the $1 but you can probably put it on EBay and see how much it will go for if you feel like it haha
'Bout tree fiddy.
Yes.
Make sure it's a hedge fund. Compound interest is key!
Selling a $2 coin on eBay for $2.10 + $2 shipping.

Assuming it cost $1 for a stamp and taking off the 13.25% eBay fee and the cost of the coin they are making a whopping $0.62
Not including the cost of an envelope.
35,373,000 to be exact

You should have invested in 1s and 0s.  The digital economy is the place to be.
Instructions were unclear. I fucked up and bought a hedgehog instead.
Yeah I'm not saying it's lucrative or anything but just wanted actual proof of what they might be trading for.

That said it is a thing in, say, the personally-run vending machine world. You do a quick scan of coins after they're sorted and pull out any 'special' ones, swap in a regular circulation coin so the balance is still the same and then flog it off somehow. 30% extra on a few coins might make the time to do so worthwhile, maaaaaaaaybe, though a lot less special/weirdo coins in Australia than (say) America.
It'll take a long time to get that through customs.
Oh yeah, eBay is the best place to see what something is worth.

I’ve sold quite a bit on eBay in the last few years (over $8k in sales since 2020) which is why I did the math.

I find a lot of people will sell things at or close to a “retail price” and not realize the fees on the sale price and shipping is so high. They end up losing money.
Yeah I hadn’t done the maths but I had worked out in my head they probably didn’t see a huge return… haven’t quite sold that much on eBay but enough to know yep the fees get you.

Its a good price research tool though for sure especially with actual sales searched rather than just what someone thinks it’s worth!
