Both Woolies and Coles do this specifically with Kleenex.
If both woolies and coles do it, then it's more likely that's how the unit pricing is provided by kleenex.
If nothing is on special I always get the 95 packs as for some strange reason they are cheaper per unit than the larger sizes which is the opposite of normal product economics.

Interesting to see the way they are showing the unit costs here, would not surprise me one bit if kleenex was involved somehow.
Bit of quick math solves the issue
I’m confused. Just get the 95 pack for cheaper?
If only there were an easy way to divide by 100.
Op there’s still time to admit you know nothing about production & sales and delete this 😂
Ok
Er what part are we supposed to be outraged over, cos I am finding it far more hilarious than perhaps intended.
Possibly also linked to the per tissue price being applicable to boxes with fewer than 100 tissues, then per 100 for larger boxes. No idea, but that's the thing in common
It didn’t used to be like that, plus the current commission is looking into this as one of Colesworths dodgy pricing tactics regarding unit pricing is a common complaint.

You might be right, though. Still shifty as fuck.
Got to be.  And it would be the same with all the big suppliers.
This isn’t the only example I’ve seen recently. I can’t recall which or where it was but the bulk pre-packaged meat wasn’t cheaper per kg.

In the last 24 years of living in Australia: bulk = cheaper. There are a lot of people older than me with cognitive decline and on a tight budget who trust this to be the fair way.

It’s part of the royal commission yet they still DGAF. It’s quite frustrating and clearly not consumer friendly.
*tissue?
What about the reduction in the thickness / weight / dimensions of each item?  This is not a game that can be won.
Don’t say “a tissue” say “a Scotties!”
Yeah, seems like we’ve still got a toothless system.
