Do yourself a favour and just don't apply. Ex HN employee.
Most likely because they have diversity and inclusion quotas. 

Many companies do this nowadays, even if they say they don’t, and especially for senior positions.
Not sure, but I'm just here to say my obligatory "Fuck you Jerry, you'll only get money out of me if you break into my house and steal it".
Big companies track those kind of stats so they can see how well they're doing on diversity.

They don't actually *care* how they're going on diversity and won't change anything about how they operate for the sake of it, but if they happen to have nice stats it'll give them something to brag about.
NO CANADIANS ALLOWED
Diversity, it's one of the key pillars that underscores a company's ESG rating which determines its investment viability.
I would feel insulted if the interviewer didn't incorporate the fact that I am from a reptilian background and my proud Iguana heritage
Gerry Harvey trying to see if he can possibly pay you any less.
Because Mr Harvey is absolute scum personified in human form. And allows this to permeate to his stores.
It can also be a benefit to have people from a particular back ground if there is a significant population in the area.

Anyone that thinks a minority or ethnic background is an automatic advantage is kidding themselves. It often goes the other way, especially since all Harvey Norman stores are run by franchisees, not corporate.
Diversity hires.

Universities even ask if you're gay or not
data collection
Why does JB HIFI tend to employ people with tattoos?
Given that the sold me two dodgy laptops that Acer admitted were faulty and told me to return to gepps X for a full refund only to have them refuse, and then say they'd send out some gift cards for our "inconveneience" while they sent off the laptops to be "inspected" over 4-6 weeks (which we already knew they'd say fine).

You don't wanna work for these con jobs. They're happy to fleece normal people for $3,000 even when the company has told them not to and to refund them.

That's not even touching when they stole jobkeeper.
Just don't apply....HN is a toxic workplace...I have been told this by so many ex employees..plus ones that still work there...
What a ridiculous list of options. It's missing so many ethnicities with large populations in Australia. Africans, Malaysians, South Americans, Tamils, Scandinavians all go into "Other"....


But of course Britain is thoroughly represented with England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Shocked they didn't throw in Northern Ireland as its own thing.
Probably a good idea to hire people that speak the same languages as the customers in ethnic areas, just my 2c
I’ve been asked about my sexual orientation. Kinda weird question tbh.
More you tick, the higher your possibility of being hired
It legally cannot influence a hiring decision. Often companies say they collect this for statistical reporting and it’s stored separately from the application. But I’m quite dubious on this.
The recruitment system they’re using is set up with the standard overseas options rather than customising it for the Australian audience.
Gerry harvey treats employees like rubbish
This looks like an off the shelf ATS with a Harvey Norman coat of pant slapped on it.

All ATS have some form of demography reporting
Fuck Harvey Norman.
KPI
Gerry Harvey is a piece of shit, so seeing this sort of practice is unsurprising.
the way it's supposed to work is that it feeds into a different system that's not about the people actually hiring individuals, but it's supposed to feed in to metrics so they can see on averages if they are attracting a diverse set of people applying and/or getting the job... that being said don't work there so who knows, but anything else and they risk getting sued.

they definitely should be making it clearer and leaving it in a separate part of the application. that and it's usually always voluntary, you should be able to leave it out.
are you ethnic enough to sell a 2x4 to another ethnic?!?!?!?!?!?!
If it’s a sales position it’s pretty obvious.
It's just for data reporting, it's not used to make a hiring decision. 
DEI quotas.
Diversity hires.
In Australia, a lot of companies need to make quotas to reach different minority quantities, especially if they fulfill government contracts. 
That's illegal in Australia
Lol. You know why
I've applied for Engineering roles with my own profile, excellent Uni grades at UQ, didn't get responses. 

Applied with a fake profile ticking the Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander box, with a fake pass average profile a low ranking Uni (UniSA), got called for an interview within days. 

It's all D&I these days.
Fulfilling their EO requirements.
They may have an affirmative action plan like many other employers
answering the question will result in the thread being locked.
Some law or quota that needs to be met.
It’s all about saying you have diversity, they will report on these things as apparently it means the company is well run and a great place to work and shop.
Not just HN , alot of jobs that I have applied for over the last 10years have asked same thing
Demographics my man.
Pretty sure that’s illegal.
Isn’t this illegal?
Probably so you can tick a box for their stupid diversity quota. That way, their stores hire staff tailor-made for what races and ethnicities are the most prominent in the area.

ESG… created by the UN/WEF
As someone who has done a fair bit of hiring - I go check for cultural taboos before I do the interview.     
  
I'm not going to give away why I do this, because reddit will just train AI on my knowledge and process.

Either way, worthwhile knowing.
DEI

Didn't 
Earn 
It
Have heard this from everyone that's worked there
Not buying anything from them after Gerry refused to give Jobkeeper money back even though they made double in profits.
I was a furniture salesman in HN in early 2010s for a year or so. The management were actual bullies and most of the staff very toxic.
Can further attest to this. Working for HN was one of the worst decisions I've ever made.
Ditto, was fun for a while but you're treated like dirt, no matter what nationality you are.
Agreed as another ex HN employee, they are super scummy and treat staff poorly. Fuck Harvey Norman.
Every time you pay GST on an overseas internet purchase, that's a fee you pay because of Gerry Harvey himself.
Agree. (Also ex employee)
Is it as bad as retrovision?. Ex retrovision employee 
Another just like me
You need to tick a box, so HN can tick a box.
More like to identify the cohort that they can rip off on wages and conditions. When you see cohort concentrations in one particular department or the other then it is a sure sign of wage rip offs. And in general this cohort is predisposed to customer service roles and try and do everything from serving customers in their stores.
This is the answer. Having worked in recruiting it's a bit unfortunate we have to turn down optimal candidates because of their ethnicity or gender to meet a quota but it's in the name of equality so I'm okay with it

Don’t give him ideas.
Or they get another $20m gift from taxpayers.
Or if you have an insurance claim (most insurers use them)
Its for the modern slavery report which has been law for last few years for big business. 
Yes. I am a straight white male with kids. We just had a diversity survey at work, and they are not looking for people like me. They want to m ow how many outliers in our work population exist. But they did not say why.
Codified racism
“you only got this job because you’re black, thats why we pay you 40% under market”?
I always answer 'prefer not to say' but may answer 'bisexual' next time.  I never had sex with men but I watch gay porn sometimes.
That’s not what the information is used for. Hope this helps!
This is not how it works.

This data will be used to analyse whether the job ad is getting a disproportionate number of candidates from a non-diverse background, which may or may not indicate a structural bias in how the advertisements are being constructed or distributed.
Codified bigotry
A mate of mine worked at one of the Big4 banks and 10 years ago he joked that the best way to secure a promotion was to wear a dress to the interview. Today it’s the reality.
Because they apply more. Next closest thing to working in an actual record store.
i think it's more that people with tattoos apply at jb hi-fi. 

it helps their branding in an inadvertent way, i think. More young, more hip, non-conformist, not squares, etc.
Sorry bank, I cant pay my mortgage because all the employers are toxic so I cant work for them

Oh you're taking my house? These banks are so toxic
not surprised.

a lot of people seem to still think australia is an outpost of britain.

what's with including french language in the high school curriculum for so long, as late as the 90s? australia's nowhere near france. But britain is and they used to squabble and sign treaties over colonised territory as imperialists.

australia sits in asia-pacific's backyard, all its neighbours are pac-islander and asian as well as its major economic trading partners.

being bi-lingual or multi-lingual in one of the "local" languages makes more sense.
But this isn't asking about foreign language skills. That's entirely different.
Really? An overseas system adds New Zealander and Samoan?
so they couldn't be bothered shelling out some cash for a customised questionnaire catering to australian applicants?

that's cheap.
Close to it. HN would need to be able to prove that this 'statistical data collection' could never been seen by the people involved in the hiring decision.
Lots of people lie on resumes, but I’m pretty sure ticking the aboriginal or torres strait islander box when you aren’t is one of the few things that you can’t do.
Assuming this is true, things like this do nothing to help Aboriginal people (or other minorities). 

Scholarships, special programs, even extra university places are great initiatives. But lowering of standards should never be on, no matter what.
I’ll tell my Indigenous SO this, who applied for a job he was qualified for and didn’t even get an interview. Shut up with your dog whistling. It’s just not true.
Getting downvotes for speaking truth
hmmm....the stereotype has always been and kind of still is, that anglo-celtic aussies are not hard-working compared with other ethnicities/cultures.
Neither did generations of so called Aussies who got every oppurtunity handed to them. Guess its only discrimination when the pendulum swings the other way.
Like all the straight, white men? Someone please think of the poor, oppressed straight white men!
Same here. I've only ever been told bad things. I've worked with 5 or 6 ex warehouse staff. All report being treated poorly by managers & unsafe work practices.
Harvey World Travel.. the travel professionals..
I stopped when the old scrote petitioned parliament to add gst to purchases under $1000

Absolutely greedy cockwomble
Absolutely.
Gerry gave it all back, no? It was the franchises that didn't?
He did give it back - it was individual franchise owners which didn’t but he doesn’t control them
Thats most places these days unfortunately
who would purchase from *hardly normal* when they are probably the most expensive vendor out there?

also, it's weird to be asking what ethnicity you are. Residency status, i can understand due to potential visa issues.

maybe they're coming at it from a cultural sensitivity angle.
if you have an aussie passport, your nationality is australian.

you mean ethnicity.
Like most franchise stores (not that hn is really a franchise) it depends on the owner/manger
This sounds like absolute nonsense
I think if half of the largest Canadian demographic was unemployed we'd hear about it.
So you're telling me I won't see many white men working anywhere at all if I visit Canada?
> Canada openly and explicitly doesn't hire white men

Maybe you're just incompetent?
>Canada openly and explicitly doesn't hire white men 

yeah nah I think that's a you problem mate
You know America is a continent right? More specifically, Canada being in North America.
That's just market forces at work. Turns out investors think that diverse companies perform better. 
Got an axe to grind? This is neither racism nor bigotry.
I thought the standard was three fifths.
>I never had sex with men

  
*Yet...*
Hey man, half of straight porn is looking at another guy's cock going in
Your orientation isn’t about acts you’ve done anyway. You can be gay and ace.
If there's an 'other' box you should write that in it.
Uh, no, just data reporting. 
Yeah, trans girls are totally transitioning so they can get promoted easily and get the best jobs. That’s definitely the entire reason, and there’s absolutely no disadvantages whatsoever to being trans, like people telling you to off yourself or treating you as a freak or the UK and US having you as public enemy number one! Good grief, perish the thought!

(can you just cut the crap for one second?)
Yeah, righto mate. Try it, why don't you. Report back to us when you're CEO.
Bullshit.
Clearly you're living in a different reality lol
Be interesting if was stats to back that up it's like Bunnings with all the teen girls. I'm assuming it's the balance out all the 40+ year old males 
It's hip to be square.
Why not employ more people with nose rings?
Take a walk flog....
I went to high school in the 2010s and we had the option of French or Japanese. I believe Mandarin and Indonesian are taught in various schools these days too.
It's at the bottom of the picture.
hehe, exactly.

you can look a certain way and not be able to speak the tongue of your parents' motherland.
What? They arent grateful to be lectured on indigenous issues by people who have never suffered a day of discrimination in their lives? I'm shocked. /s
That’s why there are so many Aboriginal Australians in positions of power and excessive wealth. Report back when you know something worth saying on this topic.
I’m not saying white Aussies are the hardest workers, but my co-worker’s culture, which I won’t mention, is certainly the laziest. And if people don’t hire them in the future due to the stereotype of being lazy they only have their culture to blame.
> I stopped when the old scrote petitioned parliament to add gst to purchases under $1000

Well, it now meant that I could still buy shit online shipped to my door cheaper than HN even after paying the GST. Just goes to show how uncompetitive he is.
Thank you for adding  Cockwomble to my vocabulary. Have some gold
Asking someone's ethnicity tells you nothing about their cultural sensitivity.  But it says a lot about that of the hiring company.
And pendants were treated like shit also.

So don't work there.
Just like astrology.
Except for all the Aussies working in the ski fields at Whistler
He coping so hard.
Investors don’t believe that though. There is a positive correlation with ESG scores and company performance, but it’s because only the high performing companies are the ones with enough resources to bother meeting these ESG metrics. Essentially, they’re successful enough to bother doing the side quests, rather than the side quests being the reason for their success.
In my world, any employment decision made based on identity is bigotry. Agree to disagree
Most guys will say that porn is bad when the guy has a small or weird dick, can't keep it hard, is unattractive, overweight, too skinny etc.

But getting them to admit they like looking at large muscular attractive men with nice big hard dicks, is much more difficult.
Well technically... 25% is looking at it as it goes in, while 25% is looking at it as it comes back out.
Yeah I’ve never understood that. I suppose you’re meant to imagine yourself in the guy’s position. Maybe that’s why lesbian stuff (generally with no dicks) is so popular though I don’t know how anyone can watch that without feeling equal parts creepy and crushingly envious to the point where you’re almost crying because you want to be pretty and soft and…ok maybe the last one’s just me.
It's like saying "I'm straight and attracted to women", but still be middle-aged, single, and not have kids. Doesn't make one less straight or more gay.
Or be like Eddie Izzard, a lesbian trapped in a man's body.
Yeah I've got zero to back it up. JB probably just likes standing apart from the squares in Bing Lee and the good guys and Harvey Norman.
Wow that's toxic! Found the Harvey Norman manager
So why ask the top? I could be born in Mexico to British parents but speak fluent Chinese. There is no relevance to know two out of three of those things.
I didn't say that investors think being diverse causes companies to perform better just that they think diverse companies perform better which is what you're saying is the case.


Investors aren't that smart anyway, I doubt most of them understand the distinction between cause and correlation.
This is correct.
I believe she identifies as a woman and preferentially goes by Suzy Izzard now
Found the casual employee😌
Maybe they want to show they are being inclusive. Seems invasive.

Countries vary a lot in their approach. I remember a Melbourne doctor was issued a fine by the Human Rights Commission for asking if a female patient was married. Meanwhile, in Malaysia, even your bank requires you to state name, age, race, religion and gender, just to get a new ATM card. Others won't let women have bank accounts without a male guarantor.
[... also ... identifies as a woman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eddie_Izzard#Personal_life).

Entirely support one's right to do so.

Point is he/she originated the quip.
Nah I quit already, no toxic workplace for me
Cool, I was going to fire you tomorrow😂😂😂😂

Have a good night
