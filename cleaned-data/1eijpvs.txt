She utterly smashed this race and deserved her pole position. If you know her story you’d join me in my tears. Plus an accidental f bomb followed up by two intentional f bombs. Beautiful.
More Gold. 3 in 1 night. Saya absolutely dominated. She raced 10 times and smashed every single one.
Anyone got a link to her post race interview?
Has anyone got a link to the actual race? Was unable to find footage of the event itself.
the casual swearing in the post race interview was the cherry on top
I was crying when they interviewed her brother. 
When 9 interviewed her one her lines

‘I just fu@king went for it’

She and her brother are dead set legends.

They are replaying it every now and then on channel 9, don't worry it was not even a contest she absolutely dominated them.
