Hey people. Clickhost has been acquired by ventraIP. Have no issue with ventraIP service, was with them in the past and they are great. However I moved to Clickhost due to pricing (WAY cheaper and service was surprising just as good). 

So now I’ve been moved back to VentraIP at their pricing. 

Do we have any recommendations of locally hosted companies that are a little more budget friendly?

EDIT: ok contacted ventra, they are holding Clickhost pricing for 3 years. Can’t expect much more than that I suppose.

Crazy how these takeovers screw the customer.
I was hoping for some good suggestions:(
VentraIP are rock solid. If they are maintaining pricing, you're in a good situation.
I’ll repost in 3 years when my price triples :)
Totally agree. Was with them for years prior, rock solid.
