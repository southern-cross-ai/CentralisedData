Porn can definitely have very harmful effects on young people but there is little governments can do to mitigate this that aren't very harmful. Hopefully it just leads to an education program in schools.
Next week: Government officials paid to look at and think about porn.
That's fine, I'll just load up newscomau and have a wank that way; all they ever publish is sex and bikini related stuff.
Ugh! It's been done to death already! Why can't they just reference the mountain of research already available instead of spending our money on pointless wheel reinvention?
Basically impossible to police. Google images, instagram, tiktok.
I’m not entirely sure you need a parliamentary enquiry given the huge amount of academic work around the effects of porn on kids.
Wow. Teens & porn that hasn't been a thing for decades, has it?
House your citizens first and make sure they can afford to *live* before debating religiously motivated and highly divisive morality issues you despicable fucking wankers.
Looking for reasons for Digital ID
Looks like the pearl clutchers are back to have another swipe at porn, and they are saying all the right words to obfuscate the fact that they want to use the government to impose their socially conservative ideology on the rest of us. Real id linked porn tracking anyone?
Those parliamentarians and their staff will be doing extensive research I imagine. 
The inquiry will also look at AI Deepfakes. So it will have some merit.
With the government its never about actually fixing problems or helping victims, its about controlling the masses.

Every time we have an inquiry or royal commission, its always "the government has decided to do nothing for those suffering, and instead is using the evidence to punish and control people under the false pretense of protecting them.
What about the impacts of insecure housing on young people first? When did the government suddenly care about young people now.
How many movies will the committee be watching in order to determine affects, and of course possible solutions?

Politicians may not be the most suitable people to deal with this.

I recall taking part in a Senate Estimates Committee nearly 30 years ago regarding pornographic images on Bulletin Board Systems (BBS). A BBS was the internet before the internet! None of the politicians had suitable technical knowledge, backbone, foresight, or any other qualifications to make appropriate decisions or recommendations.
There is already god knows how many studies on impacts of pornography on people. Why are we wasting tax payer money when research papers exist...
There's more than just "porn" and "not porn".
We're seeing more and more articles about young people feeling pressured to participate in certain sexual acts (such as choking) as they become more common in porn. Regardless of your opinion on porn, that is not a good thing.
wankers
Money to burn !
It is very harmful.

So that means information about its effects and how to manage pornography in life will be woven into education, right?

Or will it just be used to further government control on internet access?
For those who don’t want to wait for the inquiry, the key recommendations will be:

1) digital ID 
2) internet filter controlled by the government.
I hate that they're using this shit as a cudgel because there are real issues at play; I got exposed to internet porn at 10 and I got straight up addicted for *years*. It permanently fucked up my sexuality, and I'm 100% *there* for ***actually addressing the issues***, but this is just 'think of the children' pandering/distractions.
Here comes more censorship
Wont someone think of the children
So housing crisis fixed? Can have a flog now to celebrate?
I can think of a whole bunch of other things to have a parliamentary enquiry on.
Maybe addressing the underlying psychology of sexuality and addiction in school might work?

You know, instead of cramming for ‘results’ which may have very little meaning with AI taking more and more jobs, even technical ones like dentistry (first robotic dental treatment happened recently).

No wait, pearl clutchers will panic about sexualising children whilst the real predators wait for the fresh batch of ignorant kids.
Ah yes. The harmful effects of naughty stuff on the internet. 

Tell me again how we need an intert filter and a digital I'd to access this? 

Also harmful effects. Your state is FULL of pokies and is mostly run a a goon squad of cunts named clubsNSW. Why don't you look at the harmful effects of that!

It's ok, the websites have age verification. I hear they have age verification 👀
What about old people then?
It’s all about black and white education. All of this stuff can be examined through a scientific lense and be age appropriate. 

Education becomes a problem when they bring in activists teaching fringe nonsense instead of tried and tested factual education by professional teachers. Trustworthy information from trustworthy sources. Complete transparency with all parents receiving the materials, too.

The conversations should continue at home, because parents will need to talk through and adjust where needed for their kids.
Ah yes. The real pressing matters. Not the mass layoffs world wide. Not the housing crisis both buying and renting. Not the abysmal levels of inflation by corporate greed. No - teenagers looking up porn on the net. The thing that's been happening since the bloody 90's and even before that via their dad's secret magazine stashes.
(anti) social media is more of an issue than online porn.

I agree some porn is just wrong but I don't believe in kink shaming and don't judge by my standards.
I’m volunteering to watch it all. For science.
Better education is the answer to many, if not most, of society's ills.

However, we tend to see it being defunded and discredited by much of mainstream politics, particularly from fans of increased authoritarianism.
This leads straight to think of the children ID verification for porn. It's the goal.
Yeah, like, who gives a fuck about affordable housing, food, utilities etc etc. let’s look into porn.
Just part of their slimy agenda to introduce a internet age ID licence for their spying program.

Again we have a housing crisis and several more important issue and they put resources into crap like this. It just demonstrates how out of touch politicians are with the realities of life!
“When can we reconvene to talk about your findings?”

“That’s unclear at this time sir. We cannot in all good conscience give a clear and confident answer until we have gone through all of the world’s porn”
They only report the deaths of sexy people.
And sex toy reviews. Haven't seen them review any toys aimed at hetero males yet. 
Are I see you found page 3 of news.com.au
If they stopped holding inquiries they'd have to implement some of the recommendations from all the previous inquiries, which would involve actual work.
They need to create the results they want
Kids today will never know the simple pleasures, like when you saw girls boobs in a magazine that was hidden in the closet of your friends older brother or found scattered in a woodlands. We often had to use our imagination and creativity, it wasn't handed to us on a silver plate.
It's not just teens seeing this stuff, and we at least got boners to the underwear section of clothes catalogues rather then going straight to the hardcore (fetish) stuff on front pages of pornhub at 9 years old.
The difference is it's not the same kind of porn. Decades ago all you could see is Playboy level tit pics. Now it's violent, degrading misogynistic stuff of every imaginable type on the front page of porn hub. 
Well they want that digital I'd. Got to get the plebs on board.
More than just teens, and more than decades.

I'd suggest millenia is probably more accurate.
That’s not how you win elections!!
Governments are capable of more than one thing at a time.
With this and the social media concerns in the headlines, I wouldn’t be surprised if some group introduces a licence to internet once you turn 18
We already have good reasons for Digital ID. This won't move the needle. Especially if it's NSW only. 

If there was a bad result of this, it would be the recommendation to implement a age filter that requires a normal ID digital or not.
A labor government is in so its pretty standard.
Those pearls they're clutching are usually in the form of a necklace. 

I will leave you right there with that thought. Hopefully, it won't ruin your day.
I say just ban online porn. Make it hard enough that the average punter won't bother.


 Don't act like porn is socially liberating. It's mostly some guy spitting on a women and them grunting about how good incest is.


Edit: the people downvoting me need to seriously look at their sexual health. I'm all for free sexuality. But the internet is a cesspool of degenerates.


 Only fans isn't empowering it's disturbing. It's women degrading themselves for money or men "simping" hopelessly after some woman. It's just sad. And porn is a constant stream of incestual taboos, gangbangs and hardcore sex that almost no woman, even if she's into that sort of thing, would ever want done to her on a regular basis. Yet it's the exact thing offered up on page one.


I know I'm right because you have to actively search for sensual, compassionate sex. That should be what we are watching but it's not. The whole thing is upside down.


 Now let's talk about the subtext of racial stereotyping. Because I bet the front page of pornhub has atleast one video with the premise of a little white girl getting fucked hard by a big black man.


Also so many pornstars are the product of child sexual abuse, drug addiction or even just genuine sex trafficking.


Rant over.
I'm going to make a proper Boomer post.

Kids no longer are encouraged to take responsible risks growing up.  They are kept inside, on the electronic baby-sitter and largely coddled.

As a result, they don't learn about risk taking.  So when a TikTok "Challenge" or "Trend" comes along, they don't have the ability to judge for themselves on if it's safe or not, or if it's an OK risk to take or not.
This might actually be a case of kids/teens no longer realising things aren't supposed to be replicated from TV/movies. Except in the past those usually had warnings, but porn/tiktok/YouTube has none of that. So stupid dangerous stunts and trends take off easily.
Oh well if articles from random people say it’s happening it must be.
>to participate in certain sexual acts (such as choking) as they become more common in porn.

Couldn't that just be a case where the taboo of something is lessening?

Consent is way stronger these days.
Fuck me. Teel these kids how to set up a scene and they will be alright.
So what? Genuinely why do people care about a digital ID? I don't know if you've noticed but there's not many people doing anything for their internet security at all. Why would we care if the government sees our mundane search histories?
The priests and pastors sure do... A lot.
Governments are capable of more than one thing at a time.
Governments are capable of more than one thing at a time.
Not when the Australian equivalence of Moms for Liberty movement is growing
I'd get over it. There are numerous Roman pornographic mosaics and ancient Indian temples to sex, we aren't the first civilisation to enjoy pornography and we likely won't be the last.
> Better education is the answer to many, if not most, of society's ills.

It's really not.

As soon as you educate people about one dirty trick, everyone from McDonalds to Meta to SportsBet to Heineken chuck millions of dollars and teams of people with marketing and psychology degrees at the challenge of creating new tricks.

Every fucking moment of every fucking day people are being preyed upon by every multinational with psychological warfare. And you're treating this as if this is normal and inevitable and that the problem is your year three teacher didn't adequately prepare you for this.
Yeah 100%, I typed this message quickly while in a rush so didn't get to elaborate but that is my worry. It also is just ineffective. I know at 15 I downloaded a free VPN to illegally stream movies, if it was needed to watch porn I would have got one sooner.
Culture war is good for pollies, they don't have to do anything just yell at the bogeyman.
> It just demonstrates how out of touch politicians are with the realities of life!

understatement of the century.
I don't understand why there were pornos left in the bush;  I just know that they were.
They’ll also never know the disappointment of the porn mirage which turns out to be a page from a Sunday newspaper supplement
Everyone remembers bush-track porn? I thought it was just me and my friends... 

My one dodgy friend who took it all home, only to show it to other mates with holes all through it.
Yeah I love the way teenagers are meant to just ignore their sex organs entirely while all sexual content is concealed away somehow.
As a consumer of pornography I would say that you have to make an active choice to find the videos that aren't  degrading, so young kids are certainly going to be exposed to extreme videos. I'm by no means denying the influence of misogyny but I've found that this kind of thing is also prevalent with gay pornography. The majority of videos of all porn seem to be things that would hurt more than be enjoyable.
If parents aren't watching what their kids/teens are doing and give them a phone or computer with no blocking on it, that's 0% my problem.
Well I mean if that's what you are into.
How you win what???

Oh, sorry. You wrote elections.

Carry on.
Incorrect. Bob Katter knows that we must put all other issues on hold until we [solve the problem of croc attacks in Far North Queensland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ih1EuMLspY).
Sadly they've repeatedly demonstrated that they're often not.
They are, but that doesn't give a better excuse to use administrative resources on something so stupid.

Even if you could work on a thousand things at once, that wouldn't give an excuse for a government to be caving to the weird anti-porn agenda pushed by ultra-religious think-tanks and lobby groups.
Digitial ID tied to internet usage.
Like the ‘porn licence’ UK want and which China is officially exploring.

I’ve been around long enough to know with certainty this is going to be used as justification for more control. Of course to protect the children from porn, predictors and scams.

Requiring ID to access and be identified on the internet is and always be a terrible idea and one for tyrannical control freaks.

If you want two good reasons, look at our e-safety ministers past actions  and Albo wanting to censor the internet of memes. Not hard to join the dots and see NSW police or fixated persons units abusing this power!
That certainly is a 'boomer' take (repeated ad nauseam since at least the 80s).

Choking is a dangerous act. In no way should it be normalised.

Discussion of consent might be. People actually getting it isn't.

They are very hands on about it too. 🤮
Oh yeah cost of living crisis, they fixed that too?
Idk this one doesn't seem capable of doing just 1 thing
If that is so, then surely increasing and improving education is even more important.

The Australian conservatives (or, really, right-wing, usually Christofascist, radicals) can absolutely fuck right off. Every day of the week ending in "y".
Pornography isn't inherently bad just like sex isn't inherently bad. What's important is the context surrounding it
You surely see the difference between those examples and a device that shows you literally anything whenever you want, right?
It's more the fact pornography is intentionally addictive. Seeing sex is good for us. It's a natural act. But we've sterilised film where you could show the diverse experiences of sex and then created this hyper stimulating industry designed to isolate people and cause addiction.
There's a difference between the pornography you exemplify and contemporary digital pornography.

The fact you used those examples indicates you definitely do not understand the issue.

But, yes, I do agree with the general premise that pornography is as ancient as art and will likely remain until the last artist dies.

Also, I'm unsure what your response has to do with my appeal to better education.

Why should I "get over" that?
You OK? Your response seems very conspiracy minded.

Your assumption that education only happens in schools is quite telling.
Paying it forward.
Porn fairy.
Yeah and it's not just the depraved nature of porn. It's using that taboo along with hyper stimulation to create addiction.
Where in my comment did I say "ban porn for everyone"?  
  
The ease of access to and the type of porn available now compared to the 80s is vastly different.
No, they haven't. Even the most evil governments do multiple things at once.
How does investigating "the impacts of violent and misogynistic pornographic material on mental, emotional and physical health" correspond to a "weird anti-porn agenda"?

>NSW Women's Safety Commissioner Dr Hannah Tonkin said the increasingly young age of exposure was concerning because "pornography often contains harmful messages and representations" that normalise violence against women.

>"This exposure comes at a crucial time in children's lives when they are developing attitudes about gender roles, sex and relationships," Dr Tonkin said.

>"There is an urgent need to improve our understanding of the impacts this is having on attitudes and behaviour, particularly those of boys and young men."
But is it wrong?  And if so, how?
Yeah its fairly easy to have conversations about sites like pornhub as part of sexual education and how it can be harmful, but that's for people specifically looking for porn.

What's hard to educate about now is how blended porn is into social media now and how prevalent the algorithms serve up sexual content to people are. This also doesn't mean full on porn either but also sexually suggestive content. 

It's all over Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Tiktok with content creators gaming algorithms by doing "normal" things that get them promoted in rankings because its not flagged as adult, but doing sexually suggestive things while they do them.

Kids are also incredibly social and are switched on when it comes to net literacy, they know about services like Discord and Telegram which let them form or find private communities hidden from their parents where really are no filters.

It's really a much broader conversation that needs to be had because there is basically no way you can control how porn is now consumed as it's invaded every single corner of the internet.
The Romans also had people publicly fight to the death and kept slaves. I'd rather not base my social choices based off what was acceptable to the Romans.
I don't know if historians have ever reviewed the browsing history of ancient Romans or Indians.
If you think anything I said is conspiratorial, insert something witty here about education.

Edit: apparently /australia decided it likes its capitalist consumerist manipulative addiction-engine hellscape all of a sudden. I guess a new flavour of doritos just dropped.
Well usually trying to combat this leads to requiring IDs to access porn. I'm not exactly about to give pornhub my ID, so it's effectively a ban (in reality, obviously a VPN is the solution)
I've been saying for a long time that fashion and advertising conflates youth and sexiness to a disturbing degree. Search for "sexy woman" and estimate how many of them are teenagers. Search for "pretty girl" and estimate how many of them are in sexualised clothing or poses. The same is true of boys too, to a lesser degree.

It's no wonder that people (kids especially) get confused.
> It's all over Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Tiktok with content creators gaming algorithms by doing "normal" things that get them promoted in rankings because its not flagged as adult, but doing sexually suggestive things while they do them.

Even the front page of news.com.au regularly has photos of the most recent celebrity to go out in transparent clothing, with the only censoring being the nipples.
Yeah, agree there is no easy solution. But is guess it's the same as why ID is required to buy alcohol. Making sure only adults have access to adult products. 


Some anonymous method to confirm age before being able to access porn sites is the solution but I don't know how that would work.
ID can be checked for alcohol without online storage of sensitive data. 

I just think it's not worth risking a data breach.
