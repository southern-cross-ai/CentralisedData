Hi all, I am over the moon to be coming back to Australia for vacation in January. I lived in Perth and Sydney from 2019-2020 and my time was cut short by the pandemic. I spent most of my time in WA and was only in Sydney for about 3mo. That said, I am coming to Syd for Australia Day, and then would love to venture out and explore other parts of the east coast. Iâ€™ve been to Byron Bay and probably will go back but looking for other recommendations of where to visit. I am traveling with a good friend and we both value adventure, good food, nightlife, and just about anything that will give us the authentic, amazing experience down under! 

Any suggestions are appreciated and canâ€™t wait to be back in your lovely country!! ðŸ©µðŸ©µðŸ©µ

You can go to the blue mountains for a day
If you're heading up to Byron, I'd say skip (or at least minimize the time you spend there) the actual town of Byron Bay, and try to explore the Northern Rivers region more generally. Just a truly amazing part of the world once you get out of the Byron Wanker Field.
Do you have the money to go to the reef?Â 
We still have a reef worth looking at?
This comment always comes up and the answer is yes. Some of it is miserable but the reef is still absolutely gorgeous for the most part and still better than most reef experiences you can have around the workd
Just not as good as a decade ago is my experience - but very little is
