Get back to us when Dutton has a properly thought out and costed policy.
What Dutton is arguing for is **highly illegal**. Doesn't this bother the law-and-order voters?
Dutton: Solar energy cost to setup is being pushed onto consumers!  
Dutton: Nuclear energy is the future.

The man is a potato.
Good.
Dutton is such a joke. 

Labour could tell people it's a nice sunny day and he'd come out and rant about how it's actually raining and we only had sunny days until the libs.
Arguing to change the law is highly illegal?

Letâ€™s start arresting the cannabis legalisation team then. 

There are some solid arguments for not pursuing nuclear energy. This is not one of them.
Surely you're not telling me that legality and morality are separate things??
