Paying for legal representation for frivolous defamation litigation is expensive and intimidating.
David and Goliath event right before our eyes.

I wish the youtuber luck and hope honest reviews continue, otherwise consumers suffer.
I don't know what this is about and I'm not clicking the link but it would only threaten reviewers who make false and misleading claims that directly leads to a measurable negative impact for the company being reviewed. Which as far as I'm concerned is a good thing. If the person being sued was honest and accurate they have nothing to worry about.
Said every corporate lawyer ever.

Peace.
The reviewer did make an honest and open review about the products and dcs took it personally - many other tubers are supporting him and finding changes in dcs policies and terms of use on their web which have been backdated.. dcs also does not openly show how they measure product degradation but the reviewer did openly. I believe the dcs web site since got taken down over this.

That's completely *not* how lawfare defamation actions work.  The point is to get you to shut up rather than having to lawyer up and find money for that. Ordinary people have no reason to believe that the legal system will be fair.
