Food at cinemas … a complete rip off.
I remember when I could fill my car for that.
Maccas frozen coke and a quick trip to Coles. Sorted for $5
I mean while the prices now may be higher compared to previous cinema prices, traditionally cinemas have always been ridiculously expensive.
As much I love the popcorn there at the movies, I really try and avoid buying food or drink there.  I take in my own bottle of water and snacks, chips, lollies.

$19 is excess, considering it only cost them less than a $1 each for those drinks.
Just went to the movies with the husband last weekend; 
For 2 adult movie tickets, and one of those share packs (1 popcorn, 2 drinks, 2 ice creams) were like $60+.

This is why we just wait until it’s streaming now 😭

Edit; I asked him and he showed me the receipt and it was $85.
The tickets themselves were $45 for 2 adults.
Do you think cinemas would see an uptick in customers if they dropped prices… and advertised it?
I'd love to buy the cinema food to lean in to the whole experience (especially hot butter popcorn and choc tops) but I can't justify it with the prices.

Do you guys get bag checked? I have a medium sized handbag I take out most often, and for the past few years if I want snacks/drink I've smuggled them in and not been checked once. This is at Event cinemas. Usually the staff doing the ticket checks are about my age or younger and I'm guessing they don't care or would like to do the same.
Should’ve got a large Sprite for only $1 more…
Get your snacks at Coles on the way there !
Plus surcharge
Smuggle that stuff in
Why buy there when you can bring your own??
Forget that. Wouldve gone to the nearest shop instead.
Grab a 2L Coke at the supermarket on the way in.

The popcorn is addictive though. I've made something quite similar at home. I do a big batch of popcorn (ghee+ popcorn kernels in a big stock pot) then mix in a little extra melted ghee and liberally sprinkle it with popcorn salt (https://www.amazon.com.au/G-Fresh-Popcorn-Salt-200-g/dp/B086YZ8GJV). A little tastes nice, but it if you want it to *really* taste like the cinema stuff then you have to over-*over*-salt it.
Isn’t it nice that Colesworth aren’t the villains for once in this thread?
22 years ago I already muggle stuff in or do not consume anything. It's always a ripoff.
Been like that for YEARS.
Which is why you duck to Colesworth before you go, as well as grabbing a sushi/burger/whatever.  We nuke a bag of popcorn in the microwave for the kids before heading out.  

There is a third option to paying exorbitant amounts or going without.
As a former bar tender, I know that the total cost for all of that is about $2 tops.
Bruh

Combo. Combos exist for a reason
Go to a pub and you pay near that.
Your problem is going to a Village. Fuck them, and Hoyts.
geez and i wonder why people have gone back to torrenting.
"But why are cinemas dying? :("
I know food at cinema is a rip off. But that seems excessive. I got a medium popcorn and drink for $8.50 last week.
I never buy food there now. Always stop in at woolies to load up on snacks before hand.
Cinemas should just stick to providing the movies. We can get snacks oirselves.
Insanity. For syrup and water
Crazy hey.
I returned to my 2 local cinemas soon after COVID and have seen them struggle for customers so don't begrudge them food/drink prices. They're cool about me taking in a coffee/slice from nearby.
no popcorn ?!
Whenever I go to the cinema with friends I just buy a 1.25L bottle of soft drink and bring cups and just share the bottle with friends. Cinema's don't care about outside food and drinks anymore so it doesn't make sense to buy drinks from the cinema itself, the only benefit of buying from the cinema is that the drink will be colder.
Yeah. Food and drinks are how they make a lot of their money.  But I wonder, does the price of them put people off buying them?
I haven’t bought food from the cinemas in 20 years, and i’m someone that goes often. It’s always been a rip off.
Streaming services haven’t helped, but man, cinemas don’t make it easy for themselves…
Frozen coke from Macca's all the way
Go to the vending machine near by, voila saved heaps, the teenage kid on minimum wage won’t give a shit
Coles/woolies are currently at old school cinema level rip off, but not current cinema level ripoff
Fuck that
I take my own drink bottle, usually fill it with red. Sometimes add an edible to the mix.


Sometimes need to see the movie again because I can't remember the ending. 
I only buy a choctop and always BYO drinks
The one we go to has a couples deal - 2 drinks plus a large popcorn for $19. Tickets are $13 each. So it's under $50 for a movie date which isn't bad. It's when we take the kids on school holidays that it gets really expensive
I will spend and spend at my local old skool cinema that has a bar for when I go with adults, and proper coffee & popcorn when with the kids.

We rarely go, so when we do, may as well buy a bit of a treat I prefer walking in with a glass of champagne, to sit down and celebrate the going out and pretend I'm living the high life 🤣

ETA; No this isn't a big chain, just the local small cinema that usually charges a whole lot less than the big ones and has local restaurants/take away around too. Easier to spend when you know the significance of having a local.
There's a reason that I carry a large handbag with pockets that can fit bags of lollies,  chips, cans of drinks etc.
I just take a backpack full of goodies now. Fuck that.
What cinemas are you at? I get a large popcorn and 2 drinks (couples combo) for $16. Still a rip off but not as bad.
That’s why I buy my drinks and snacks at the shops first. I’ll buy a large soda drink and put it into a water bottle & then I’ll buy lollies and other snacks from Coles. I’ll just hide it in a bag. It’s way cheaper that way
It use to be $10 for 1 large popcorn and 2 large drinks . Now just look at this mess, best to go home get a VPN and just download with this prices, save your money and buy it yourself from shops
Probably 50c syrup and gas
I’m in my late 20s and even I know you don’t buy drinks or snacks at the movies... Only exception is popcorn because when it’s fresh it’s crack

If you ain’t stuffing a backpack full of snacks, softies and grog, what are you doing?
The size combos are literally cheaper than individual items guys
This is a PSA that bringing outside food into movie theaters in the moral thing to do.
Yeah nah mate. 

Obviously cinemas are up against it when it comes to home much of their box office they have to hand over to distributors for the first weekend or two (sometimes as hig as 90% of ticket proceeds) so need to try to make their cash in other ways. But 10 bucks for sugar water when it's costing like about 10cents per litre to make, that's extortionate. 

They need to bring subscription cinema to aus like they have in Europe. Much cheaper for the audience and more cash to the cinema
Food at the cinema was always a rip off but this is straight highway robbery at this point, no wonder cinemas are going out of business when the price of a drink buys you nearly a month of Netflix.
One month's Streaming + Two 2L Cokes
I must have overslept what year is this 19 dollars for 2 soft drinks
Do you really need to eat or drink to enjoy a movie? The prices are high because they know you MUST have that drink or snack. So fight the temptation, you can live a couple of hours without stuffing your face.
That's why I always bring in my own drink and snacks!
Honestly I think we need to de-normalise snacking in the cinema. It isn’t necessary and can be a distraction. I like to sometimes have an ice cream, but never buy a drink for the sake of my bladder. Don’t make price of snacks be a reason you don’t go to the cinema, you aren’t there for the snacks, you’re there for the movie.
I prefer cineplex - it’s cheaper and doesn’t require a mortgage to visit.
Thank you for the heads-up and reminder for me not to go to the cinemas again.
r/piracy
Haven’t been to the cinemas in ages....I will not be going anytime soon!!!!
It's simply too hard to justify going to the movies when prices are like that.  Very out of touch with customer sentiment.
If you're not going to Woolies or Coles on the way into the cinema, you're doing it wrong. Any place charging $10 for a Coke isn't getting one cent of my money at the candy bar.
I just remembered why I haven’t seen a movie at the cinemas in over two years. Yer, I don’t miss it.
Went to cinemas yesterday with my old man, fucking $31 big ones for two large popcorns and drink.
Enid working the counter at the movie theatre in the movie Ghost World comes to mind.
We used to be diehard cinema goers. We'd pay to watch just about anything. But it got out of hand. And the food prices were insane. Yeah, I know, it's optional. But we liked the whole experience. My missus made the mistake of finally writing an email about it. Their response: piracy hurts us so much, we have to do it. WTF??
Lucky you didn't get a popcorn!
I haven't been to the cinema in years... and don't miss it.  The only reason to go would be for something that 'warrants' the 'experience', like some space opera... or something of a nature film - I remember seeing an 'underwater' movie in 3D (I think) at the IMAX Cinesphere in Toronto, CA, in 2000.  You actually had 'cradling' lounge seats to sit in.. and it might've been $20 for a couple of films.

A movie that just 'tells a story' is really no different to watching the movie on TV (I have no interest in 'big screens' at home)... so there's really no 'draw' for me to see such films at the cinema... 

...and the 'concessions' at the cinemas have always been pure profiteering IMO... and if they complain about patrons bringing in their own bottled water........

It's important to note that while regulations vary by location, many jurisdictions require public establishments like cinemas to provide potable water for patrons.  Given that water from toilet taps is generally not considered safe for drinking, a cinema's policy of prohibiting patrons from bringing in outside water while only offering toilet tap water could potentially be a violation of local health regulations.  As always, though, YMMV...
my local hoyts is heinous for it. popcorn pre boxed in a warmer is dank
Just stop eating and drinking for 2 hours. Then go too a cafe with your friends and talk about the movie. 

If you have no friends, stop off at a bottle shop and get a flagon of something nice.
The prices of the tickets themselves are actually quite reasonable, especially if you have access to a discount club. As a PhD student, I get Hoyts tickets for only $12 through an app.

The food, on the other hand, is outrageous.
… and other people. Eeeew
I can wait an hour or two to eat.
OP took this photo with the phone in his left hand because he paid for the tickets with his right arm. I stopped going to the movies excesses they’re so expensive.
Protip, bring a backpack with snacks and drinks in
You have to remember their costs went from 36c to 48c per liter so it's a reasonable jump. 
We always get free ice water when at the movies…
I dont think Nobu even charge $9 for a sprite
and the cinemas dare to act like **we** betrayed **them**
And I won't be going back
10 dollars for a large? 

I thought 5 dollars was bit much back in the day..
I was a couple wks ago, first time in yrs. Tickets 13$, the the sign at the concessions…popcorn drink chocolate bar, $42cdn.  Fucking lunacy
Has food & drink at the cinemas (mainly the big ones like Hoyts) ever been cheap? I feel like even before the huge inflation and price gouging of the last few years the food & drink was always a rip off.
1000 percent margin
That cost about $0.10 to make
You could get a 24pk of cola cans for that!!
Sneak it in instead.
When did you last go to cinema 1985? It's been like this since at least 2000 onwards
🏴‍☠️🤫
Last week was my first time going to an Australian cinema and I had to pay $35 for a normal ticket I was so shocked LOL.
Why would you ever buy food from there, get a coat with pockets, and buy food from woolies, most don't even bat an eye, the ticket would be way cheaper
Thought that was the ticket prices also thats why you just buy a 1.25L coke from the nearest supermarket and BYO snacks =P
Cost to Village Cinemas, 10c total.
Southbank cinemas in Brissie is cheap as buggery. Seats aren’t very comfortable but $12 for a huge pop corn and 2 big gulp drinks is wild
$19 dollarydoos!?! Tobias!...
This has always been the case though? 

The snack bar was always overpriced so as teens you smuggled stuff in. The cinema didn’t make much out of playing a movie so they needed their cut. Popcorn and post mix drinks kept them alive right?  

I believe it’s even worse for cinemas now as numbers are down but studios charge more to show their films. Someone more educated please correct me I’m wrong.

I don’t go to the cinema often but when I do now it’s not that bad- free membership with a cinema = cheaper tickets, book for the luxe/vip and it’s a solid few hours of entertainment for under $50pp. It costs me about that much for a drink and a light meal where I live.
Obv a different case for a parent taking kids as that adds up but always has?
Like a dollar something cola and lemonade. Less than three bucks at Aldi. Cinema, go fuck yourself.
Take your own food in, it's a total rip off
Just smuggling drinks in and take the empty container with you
Old news
Did you get to buy your tickets online and pay for the privilege? That's always fun.
The venue's cost price for each of those drinks is around 50 cents
The prices for munchies are just too ridiculous these days, leaving you feeling ripped off if you buy anything. My normal procedure is bringing along 2 or 3 cans of bourbon and coke(already in stubby coolers to keep them cold)and a couple of packets of beef jerky. I drive us in and my friend drives home...Makes for a great movie night...
Def should’ve just got the large on the second drink.
Recently dropped a $100 gift card I was given, thought I'd get a couple movies out of it but no, 2 tickets, 2 large drinks and large popcorn and I owed them like 10c.

When I tell you I almost threw up on the spot.... Thank god Deadpool was good, cause I reckon it might be the last film I see in cinemas at those prices.
Just pop a coke and a pack of chips / popcorn / choc from woollies in your bag or a coat pocket - you don't have to pay $25 for stale popcorn and a drink you know
When my fiancée and myself saw deadpool, between he tickets and basic snacks, we spent $62. I understand why I haven't been to a movie theater in a while.
Went to see DP&W.

Great movie, worth watching at the movies. 

But I got the same drinks for the same price. 

My thoughts were "well they sure got me"

Still valued drinking that drink during the movie over the money though
Cheep i say
Just bring your own snacks and drinks, no one has ever asked to check my bag.
Would rather buy one outside and shove it up my ass and then go in
don't forget after your mortgage your house to pay for the food and drinks they're going to ask for a TIP
Me, a German: This is so cheap holy shit...
I've personally never understood why you would go to a cinema and eat ans drink but hey maybe that's just me. I did it as a kid sure but not as an adult.
Not new .

Food prices at cinemas have  been a rip off for as long as I can remember.
I haven't been to cinemas since Avengers: Endgame and looks like It will remain that way for years to come. If that is the price for drinks, what's the price of popcorn?
Op was born yesterday. This has been a thing for years. And I never buy cinema food, except on occasion a chocolate, because you can't get them elsewhere, or back when the lunar drive in was open I'd get hot jam doughnuts or a burger. I can make popcorn at home for super cheap (and not that nasty microwave rubbish).


Just pop into aldi on the way in, grab some lollies or chips. This is on you for being silly enough to pay for it. The prices are up on the screens so you knew ahead of time.

This and streaming are just two reasons these dinosaurs are going out of business
We went to see deadpool with my partner last week 
$40 for 2 tickets 
$2 each for an online booking fee(?????)
$25 for a medium caramel popcorn and a medium drink 

After paying for parking it was nearly $80 for one and a half hours of entertainment.

Suddenly $120 for a 30 hour + ps5 game doesn't sound too bad
And now you’ll continue to not go to the cinema for ages.
what’s stopping you from scooping up ALL your needs from woolies (and dan murphy) on the way ?
I paid $9 for m&ms at the movies last week, plus a bottle of mount franklin water was $8! Highway robbery
Ingredients for a cheap night in: Home-made popcorn, Soda-water & Cordial, some-streaming service, comfy couch and blankets, all under $10

In comparison, $10-20 for popcorn alone, $10-$20 for drinks, $10+ for other nibblies, $20+ for actual movie, crap chairs and cramped leg room (if you’re six foot plus), cold cinema, noisy arseholes, queues and waiting time, fuckloads of ads, etc.

All this for the latest steaming pile of shit out Dodgywood.  Movies are yesterday’s jam.
For anyone in Brisbane, go check out 5 Star Cinemas. 
Cheaper tickets, cheaper drinks & food and better quality!
Looks like a supervillain headquarters.
Cargo pants. You can fit soooooo many snacks and drinks in cargo pants. Even a regular servo is cheaper than that.
You can buy 12 cans of Pepsi on special for that.
The great thing about Aussie cinemas is that lots of them are located near the food court/supermarket.

Yes, I'll be taking in the large bubble tea.
Movie ticket regular popcorn and coke cost me 42 bucks a week ago ridiculous
Insane! Hoyts actively stop you from bringing other food in. Even drinks.
My wife and I received 2x gold class tickets for our birthdays, went to see Deadpool & Wolverine. It cost $6.50 just to book the seats online. I couldn’t believe the price of food, sliders were $33! It was all obnoxiously overpriced. We ordered a pizza and hands down the absolute worst pizza I’ve had inside the last decade at least, rock hard dough slathered in BBQ sauce. 

Crazy to think that our night out to the movies still cost about $60 buying a pizza & a couple of drinks  WITH FREE TICKETS!
It's always been expensive.  Back then it was like $6-7 which is still a rip considering it tasted like water.
This is why I like to bring in food. 🤣🤣
How do they do it so cheap?
As long as you plan it out a bit you can buy this package (I think it needs 24hours to activate) 
And you get 2 tickets, 2 drinks, popcorn and 2 choctops. Still $59 all up but not bad!

Gone are the days where you’d be at the cinemas every second weekend or so. Now it’s a “treat yo self” (only if you’ve budgeted for it)
For a $ more you could have gotten 2 large
I never understand why people pay these prices. You know what you’re in for, check the pricing before you go to the counter.. Coles/woolies beforehand is always the way to go
Cinemas dont make money from selling tickets, selling food and confectionery are what makes $
I feel this post. I’m really wanting to go to see Deadpool, however being surrounded by tweens glued to their phones is a real environment killer.
And this is why I love my local theatres in the mountains!
Never but cinema grub, from the grubs.
Gotta sneak it in your backpack from Coles. That's insane.
Movies have gone to shit and the cinema costs heaps. I’d rather go to blockbuster.
Yeah I took my son to the movies last Saturday night and it cost me more for popcorn and drinks than it did for the actual movie tickets ????
You can get a 2 Lt bottle for $3.50 at supermarket and stick it in backpack!
I don't think I've bought food from the cinema in a decade. Not that colesworth is much cheaper nowadays but it makes a difference.
The problem for cinemas is that shit monopolies like Disney put the squeeze on them like crazy and want an ever bigger share of the ticket price.

So the main product of the cinema barely makes the actual cinema any money, so they have to increase the margins on the other stuff they sell, so drinks and snacks become incredibly expensive.

And it sucks because the problem is some shit corporation in America, that makes going to the cinema all around the world more shit.
I refuse to go now.

I spent $5k on a great home theatre setup for movies and games. I now wait until the movies come to appletv and buy them there in 4K and sit down with a bottle of wine, my wife, snacks and a blanket.
Hanging out for dead pool and wolverine.
Should have got the large sprite. At that price you’d be crazy not to spend the extra buck!
Cinema failed to prepare for streaming, now they are trying to claw every sent from us
Yeah I purchased tickets to see deadpool with a friend a couple days ago and it was $49 for just the tickets. That was just seeing it normally too.
Food at the cinemas has been this expensive for like 20 years
It’s always been expensive to get drinks and food at the cinema.

Tickets haven’t gone up n the last 30 years though.  I Remember paying $15 for an adult ticket at Indooroopilly in the 90’s.  Last time I went to my local cinema it was still $15 with $10 for students/pensioners/kids
Let's be honest here, it's always been this bad. I've never bought food/drinks from the cinema.
There's the weird situation where theatres make very little money on tickets and servos make little money on fuel. So they have to charge like crazy for food. Strange that the thing you actually go there for isn't the earner for the business. Also the industries talk about this as if it's an unfixable problem.
thieving cunts (cinema that is)
That's how cinemas make their money
Two options go to woolies or Cole’s and buy you drinks or snack from there
Plus a hundred bucks to get the movie ticket. I don’t understand why anyone goes to the cinema anymore
Seinfeld - Medium Diet Coke

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAD5dz9-Qg8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pAD5dz9-Qg8)
Sugar fiends gotta pay for their fix. 🙂
And after seeing this, I never will again.
Half the time it’s self service what are you even paying for at that price?
Nothing new about food and drinks being expensive at the cinema.

But if you want to charge me $10 for coke at least give it a generous splash of Wild Turkey.
Biggest rip off going. 😪
Meanwhile at costco 590ml drink with refill and hotdog $1.99.
Theatres make their money off of the food, not the ticket sales. Price gougers are gonna price gouge. Wear a big coat with inner pockets and BYO!
20 year ago, me and friends would go to the supermarket and load up on snacks. 
It's always been over priced to purchase snacks and drinks at the cinema.
They charge this much because people keep paying. Stop, please!
I just spent $72 for two people to see deadpool here in Sydney. Couldn’t get a discount and the only time I could make was “Xtreme screen”. Tell me again why “movies are dying”?
Let's hope a movie and snacks aren't in the CPI basket! Or that could be the reason for interest rates to rise further lol
Yeah cinema drinks went up by like $2-4 depending on cinema in the last year or 2. Popcorn hasn't though
$19 dollaridoos? You can get a really nice spider for that. It's won't bite ya or nothin, and it will keep ya house bug free. If you've got a nice spider in yer house ya don't even need to go to the cinema because you can watch movies at home without being attacked. This is why cinemas are dying, mate.
It’s always seems to be $20 ticket $20 snacks
Funny thing is you can get 2 for one mega popcorn on Uber eats from hoyts deliver to home bring it with you lol
Cinemas don't make much profit on the tickets, some even run at a loss. The profit is made mostly from concessions
Weird how they are going out of business, and no one can stand to be in them..
I used to be embarrassed by my dad sneaking in cans of pop.

Now I'm 33 and do the exact same thing.
Cheap tickets in telco apps. Telstra for Event Cinemas, as that’s what I use -  $16.50 per Vmax screening.

There’s usually a Telstra free M to L combo upgrade as well.
Ughhh, food is expensive at cinemas because that's what earns them money. Ticket sales cover the cost of the movies essentially, they also have to pay rent and wages....believe it or not.


For further info and to understand, look up, 'why is movie theatre food so expensive'.
To be fair, cinema food is their main source of income. They have to pay high percentage royalties to movie studios and producers to be able to show the movie. If they made the tickets more expensive they would still have to pay the same percentage royalties. They make the food expensive to make up for it.
Just watched the *Deadpool* movie with a mate of mine in Germany. He was supposed to grab the tickets, and I was on popcorn and Coke duty. Let's just say, paying 42 euros—about 72 Aussie dollars—almost gave me a mini heart attack. And that’s just for the two of us! Lucky for me, I only hit the cinema about once a decade or so, and the movie wasn't so bad tbh.
I wouldn't even mind the price if it was a good experience, i.e. comfy chairs, nice food, and a no-dickhead policy. The problem for me is that you just get arseholes talking the whole time or on their phones.
I feel like this has been the price for a long time. I went to the cinema for the first time in a long time a few weeks back, and was expecting a lot worse to be honest. Doesn't seem to have changed that much compared to how ridiculous everything else has been rising with inflation. That said, the service was absolutely abysmal, so understaffed, which is stupid considering they know how many people will be there in advance with online ticket booking and all.
Fuck village support the small cinemas
Yeah here in Canada its pretty much the same. And then they cry that "people aren't going to theater anymore" and that the film industry is dying. At these prices... of course it is.  People are struggling with rent all over. movie +drink +snacks is about 4-5 hours of after taxes minimum wage work.   
  
About to romanticize the past here, but movies use to cost under the minimum wage per ticket with snack and drink it was about 1 and a half hour of min wage work. Also none of that internet schedule thing, pick your seat, you had to call for the schedule which was often more of a pain than just showing up. You showed up not knowing what you were going to see; there was at all times 1-2 action movie, 1-2 comedies (often overlapping), one thriller/horror or one scifi or one sci-fi/horror, a rom com. Guaranteed, you showed up not even knowing if you would be seated, not knowing what you were going to watch, you showed up, looked at what was playing and picked a movie right then and there. usually there was the 7oclock showing and 9oclock one.  God damn I used to love going to the movies, it was cheap and pretty much filled your entire evening.
Another day, another r/Australia post being shocked by prices. 

So boring.
Is that all?  
And a piss break (or 2) without being able to pause.  Nah.
I went to the cinemas in town a few days ago, and it cost AU$30 for a ticket, a medium drink, and a cup of lollies. Absolutely insane.
What's the issue? Movies has been substantially more expensive than other options for decades. 

With the ridiculous prices of other things in our day to day life this one, as a luxury. Isn't a surprise.
get smuggling. I enjoyed a burger and a couple beers during deadpool & Wolverine 😂
Just watch the movie at home
Did you had a look at your own salary lately?
Mate, clearly you haven’t been to a movie in ages.

You can fork out $19 for a night out with someone.

It’s not always about the money, but the enjoyment of others.
Ok, don't buy them
If you can afford it - then why not?

  
If not, don't buy it.
Same drinks from a can at home, bulk purchased, less than $2, and that's if they aren't on sale. 

I can't remember the last time I bothered with the movies, just costs too much.
Yeah I get that this is how they make money because they don't make any on the movies themselves but the mark up is just insane. Especially in this day and age where massive TVs and half decent sound systems are common now.
When Disney is taking 80% of the ticket price and then think of the price of that mall real estate. What do you expect them to do?
It always was. Just Marge Simpson it. No one will see you, no one’s there.
It's always been an understood 'this is where the venue makes money'. $20 for a coupla cokes.....dont expect me to cray when I see "Streaming has killed cinemas". No it didnt. $20 can feed the whole family and they dont even get to eat for $20. Not even both Large.....wtf?

Hope ya reading Village. Running outta reason to head out at this rate....
And then some.
Seconds to food at gas stations in Europe
I personally fill up my stanley cup with alcoholic beverages and have a great time! Fully recommend.
Why can’t they just make it more affordable so that more people would actually buy it, Seems like a no brainer
Your car runs on soft drink? Awesome!
Same we leave a Colesworth run to about 15 mins before the movie and get the cold drinks from there (if I haven’t brought my own ice and cold drinks from home)
“Sorry sir we can’t let you in with a Maccas frozen Coke.”

Said no one because there’s never anyone even checking your tickets when you go in.
True. Even as a kid, cinemas scammed you lol
It's how cinemas make money, though. They barely break even on tickets; most of that goes to the studios & distributors.
postmix costs them a lot less than that
At $5 I feel bad for sneaking a drink in. At $10 it makes me feel righteous to do so
I remember working in a supermarket above a Cinemas in a big complex and trying to convince area manager to let us put in a microwave next to the popcorn in the chip aisle to no avail.

Would've sold heaps.

Always had the staff room for when I went though.
I used to love fresh popped popcorn at the movies. Now it’s stale old pre-bagged crap.
Flossys fairy floss sells all the stuff to make movie popcorn
Bring a microwave and plug it into the outlet near a wall and bam, got your own popcorn.
It cost them like 5c to make those drinks.
That's preposterous!

They forgot to charge you credit card surcharge.
Saw  Deadpool with my wife last weekend. 

Large modern comfortable cinema.  Two tickets, plus renewing my yearly membership, a large popcorn, two large frozen drinks and a packet of pods for $60.  

Would have been $10 less if I didn't need to renew the membership.
Compare that to the same amount of time spent at a cocktail bar and the cinema is a cheap night out.
Reading Cinemas did this in Christchurch after the 2011 earthquake. People were too afraid to go to the movies, especially with all the aftershocks. I think the movies were reduced from about $20 to either $8 or $10 for ages. They likely made more money by selling volume rather than having huge margins, so kept that prices low.
I honestly doubt it, most of us have big flat screens and 17.1 (/s) surround sound bars these days with comfy lounges and our own cupboards of snacks, why?
In Sydney there're cinemas with memberships where tickets are around $18 per movie, cheaper on Mon and/or Tues. Get a $1 movie every few times as well.

Cinemas really only make money on the food and drinks, so they fuck you hard there. If you avoid it, it's a great deal.
> if I want snacks/drink I've smuggled them in and not been checked once. 

Is that even a thing? I've *always* brought my own drinks and snacks in and never had anyone tell me not to.
I've never had my bags checked.
My experience of cinemas in Sydney for the last 15+ years is that they don't check bags, because they simply no longer HAVE the policy of not allowing external food and drinks. They have realised long ago they don't need to make up another artificial reason for people to just wait 3 months and watch the movie on their big-ass TV at home with surround sound speakers.
I've never gotten bag checked. Should either bring a bag or a jacket with lots of pockets. I occasionally bring a bottle of coke or bubble tea in there.
They Uber eat Hoyt’s popcorn 2 for 1 buy it there and bring it in they won’t know it’s their own tubs
This is the correct response
No need to smuggle, in most places they don't even ban external food and drinks now. Event Cinemas near me only really cares if you bring alcohol.
You can also buy [proper popcorn salt](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/LLIAAOSwLRpjDMcd/s-l1600.jpg) which tastes like the real thing.
I buy it through Uber eats. 2 for 1 there extreme popcorn
I haven't bought cinema food or drinks since the 1990's - except for the one time I went to the cinema with friends on new year's day and nothing in the shopping centre was open.
You non magically get stuff in? Impressive.
Or Aldi
Paper cup 15 cents.  Product 15 cents. Service fuck all. You’re being generous.
I know! Why would you ever buy them separately?
The only reason cinemas are still dying and not already completely dead is because they overcharge on food and drink. It’s the only way they make any money
Medium combo at Event was $17 this month. 8.50 sounds like something from pre-2010.

(I didn't buy one, I just couldn't bring myself to pay that much. It was more than the ticket to the film).
Maybe the high prices in a cost-of-living crisis is part of the reason in the first place? The cinema historically was a bit of cheap escapism but has slowly been drawn out to cost a family of four more than $100, which is just not tenable for many families right now.
Maybe they would have more customers if the prices were cheaper?

$20 for a ticket and $40 - $80 for the food? May as well buy a 4k projector for $100 and watch at home on a wall with freedom to pause for breaks. Make whatever food I want. Instead of loud customers who laugh so hard they block out some of the dialogue, a comfy couch to lie on.

I begrudge them wholeheartedly.
maybe OP didn't want to take out a second mortgage to afford it
Might I suggest: Cheap red wine + Blue Gatorade = Gatorwine. 

It elevates the cheap wine into something ok, and lets you have a decent-enough-buzz that won't muddle the stinger after the credits.
Those are rookie snacks, you need to boost that up. 

There's a whole red rooster menu that's waiting for you.
>Very out of touch with customer sentiment.

Customer sentiment isn't very relevant if they halved the prices they'd go broke.
I remember they used to pour butter into the popping chamber and it used to explode fresh popcorn into the glass box and then they’d scoop it cup, salt it and serve.  It was cheaper than the expensive shit they offer these days.
Really? That's crazy!
We don’t tip in Aus
> After paying for parking

That's annoyed me a lot the last decade - watching all the westfields just tack that onto the experience.
For $3 more than your soft drinks you can get two premium beers and a bucket of popcorn
Some people want a night out without the kids. Or are on a date. It’s a personal preference.
> I can't remember the last time I bothered with the movies, just costs too much.

Last time I went was when Top Gun Maverick came out and a local sports club did a screening as a fundraiser. Load of fun having a full cinema, but wouldn't bother otherwise.
I went last week because it was my partners birthday. Blew a heap of coin on overpriced popcorn and drink because hey, it's your birthday love lets lash out a bit.

We used to go every 1-2 weeks, had memberships to the local cinema. Hell sometimes we saw 2 movies in one day. Now we need a once-a-year event to justify the money – and even more the time since I had to pick up a third job to stay on top of spiralling bills and groceries.  

This country doesn't feel so "lucky" anymore.
So as someone with a young baby, I’ve been on maternity leave and looking for things to do on a weekday. Baby sessions are $12!!! I’ve been to the movies more times in the last 8 months than I have in the years before that. And as someone with a baby, it’s really not that bad when the other ones cry.
I stock coke and sprite in my bar, generally about 90c a can, sell for 4.50. I'm eternally surprised that people want to buy it.
Going to the movies in 4 hrs to see dead pool . Will go see new aliens too. Always take the opportunity when can and take my dad.
Not same drinks, much better drinks at home because it’s not post-mix shit.
I do remember, I saw Borat. It was too much back then and just got worse.
My local village cinemas does half price Tuesday. $10 tickets so it's only $20 for my partner and I to go. We essentially only see movies on Tuesdays now and consider it a cheap night out.
If you have kids and want to do a cheap activity the kids flix program at village is good, $6 each ticket. I bring popcorn and snacks from home so the whole outing is probably $22 for 3 people. 

And if you’re a Telstra member they have $12 movie tickets at village. Better than paying $28 each.
As someone who stocks a commercial bar with soft drinks from super markets, they are often 97c for coke and coke-owned brands. Kirk's can be al low as 45c per can when on sale. Home brand is also down at 40c or so, though as the name suggests, not many commercial business will stock home-brands.

At 'full price' like you say coke is often still only about $1.40 a can.

The crazy thing is, post mix machines like the cinema use are even cheaper than buying packaged soft drinks.

I get they need to make money and have likely worked out they are better off selling to 5% of the people in the cinema at these prices than 80% of the cinema at much lower ones.
Ever brought a slab of Pepsi in with you?
I go to my local drive in. Tickets are reasonable ($50 for a car). Hotdogs and popcorn don't require a bank loan and I can load the car up at the supermarket before hand
That's exactly why it's so expensive, everyone has huge flat screens and 200.1 surround soundbars, no one go's anymore
I reckon cinemas must be struggling. I only go to the kids flix or Telstra tickets and the cinema is mostly empty.
I had hoped the 20-30 minutes of ads would cover the bills.
The Simpsons Movie was my last trip to the cinema, admittedly Gold class..  now it’s just on big screen at home for movie nights with home made snacks and toilet breaks where the movie stops and waits. Way better !!!
They'd go bankrupt.
That’s dope! Do they let you mix flavours?
thanks for the laugh 🫵😹
I generally chuck a cheap, non cold drink behind stuff in the freezer section, piss fart around the shopping centre and then pick up my super cold, sometimes mildly frozen drink before the movie starts.

Or if I'm at Frangas, a Slurpee and home brand doritos
I haven't been to a cinema in about 15 years. 

Last movie I saw was Scott Pilgrim. 

I remember back then you weren't allowed to bring your own food & drink (and you'd have to sneak it). 

Now I'm curious if they still enforce this rule with the recession and all, I imagine everyone is bringing their own.
Oh, I fully understand that.  If they made their prices on food and drink a reasonable price, then people would buy more.  The last time I looked, those large drinks were huge.  If they stuck with just a small and medium and sold the medium for, say, $5, they'd still be making a profit but would sell way way more.
Ingredients yeah.  In my mind, I was adding in the cost of running, repairs and cleaning of the machines as well as staff.
Many years back I worked in a cinema over the summer - Never did work out how someone smuggled in a family size pizza.
That microwave would have paid for itself in no time.
Sure.  Who doesn't carry their own microwave around.
In ingredients only.  Ingredients aren't the only costs involved.
Sorry I forgot to add the $3.30 booking card fee.
We saw Deadpool as well.  Village Cinemas are an absolute rip off. Smaller Cinemas are the way to go, but living regional the closest non-village cinema is Reading Cinemas and it was still $60+
Just need an earth quake quick smart
Yeah I’d love to see this around Aus. If the prices don’t change you’re not getting anything from me.
Mustn't have been new releases or they would have ended up owing money for every ticket sold.
Mind you I can say that lowering ticket prices often upsets distributors, when Reading had their $1 ticket day about a decade ago Disney were furious and there was pretty tense relations between them, but at the end of the day Disney cant afford to cut ties with any major cinema branch

Reading recently dropped their ticket prices by roughly  20% for a good number of sites, depending on auditorium type, and barely had a 10% increase in numbers. The truth is people dont want to go the movies because even if you have $10 tickets, its still a lot of money for a family in a cost of living crisis, especially food. Why not just wait until it comes out on streaming?
$10 now at a Reading near me. I’ve been every week for the past month.
Good point. Unless you’re itching to see a movie that just came out there’s no reason to go.
I’d definitely buy snacks at the cinema if they were at reasonable prices. Surely they see that?
Once took a tub of ice cream, bowls and spoons in - no one checked us either.
It's not against the rules. There was a law suit some years ago when a diabetic had a hypo. You're not allowed to take in hot food or alcohol. Everything else is fine.
My local Village barely has people checking tickets most of the time.
Actually I've also noticed this but I'm still scarred from being halted by the edgy ticket checker at bevo cinemas a decade ago now.
And the key is to put the flavacol in with the oil before it pops.
That’s pretty shitty. Mine is just a small, town two theatre, independent cinema. You’d think the chain ones would have the clientele to run things cheaper.
😂 excellent suggestion.  My snack game is about to go up a level.
Plenty of more fun cheaper things to do
Like us all, you paid for the fun.  
Worth it.. no. Worth it? Yes.
That's never what "the lucky country" meant. It means we're lucky to have prospered at all because we've had useless leaders and a lazy population.
You are still one of the better off, if you are struggling to pay your mortgage instead of your rent.
I’m sure that wasn’t the only thing that was lashed out 👀
Go see what early childhood programs your local library has. Sometimes story time was my only chance to get out of the house each week.
Once You have a couple kids or your baby is no longer free  the kids flix program is $6 each on Saturdays which is great, and I bring our own popcorn from home.

The right way to make money id say and people fall for it
Costs you 90 cent to purchase, but in time and overheads and all the other bullshit you have to contend with, probs quite a bit more than that. I’d be more interested to know what kind of profit you’d make off a can, all things considered.
Ironically, the post-mix is what they started out as, with the in store version considered the inferior version. How times have changed.
I'm not a Pepsi fan,  I have taken my own drink so I don't have to pay ridiculous markups.
>everyone has huge flat screens and 200.1 surround soundbars, no one go's anymore

\*Looks at his 50" 1080p TV with a decade old home theatre receiver driving 30 year old speakers\*

Apparently I am no longer part of "everyone" anymore...
10+ minutes of those ads are trailers for upcoming films that are organised with the distributor of the film playing to play before hand, its part of the conditions of screening the film. Ever noticed a lot of disney films get marketed with disney films?

The other 5 or so minutes is Val Morgan ads but Val Morgans pay us a certain fee to screen their ads, companies pay Val Morgan for a spot on the ad sheet. We have several films with only one ad and 3 trailers and begin in 10 minutes. We do not make much on ad revenue alone

Box office sales are basically leading losses for candy bar purchases, but I will tell you that everyone at Reading at least is trained to make it as cheap as possible for you. Combine various combos to get it cheaper, yes combos mean more food and generally more money but buying 5 different sized drinks and 1 popcorn is unwise, buy 1 large popcorn and 5 drinks for $36.50 instead of $50+. 

In saying this, I 100% endorse bringing in your own food. I frequently bring in Pods or Maltesers cuz theyre ALWAYS cheaper anywhere else. Reading have no rules on bringing external food in (its generally just hot food not allowed)
No they wouldn’t
The thing is.


The more they increase the price, the less people go. It's a delicate balance. Right now prices are high,, it is far more likely to go bankrupt now than it was prior to raising prices.

Hell... Maccers is crying poor right now, with reduced numbers of people buying fast food as it's nearly 20 bucks for a "large" meal (large in brackets as in reality the meals are tiny, fatty, mess.)
My car only runs on diet.
This is next level. Good for you!
Freaking genius
That's brilliant.
This was my trick in high school.
It was always a written rule of the cinemas but in my whole life I haven’t seen it enforced. It might have been the locations I’ve lived but as long as you’re not waltzing in with the food/packets in your arms I haven’t seen a bag check before
I was told by a worker they don't want you bringing in hot food, mostly cause of the smell. I always bring my own popcorn and a drink in a large handbag. No one has ever asked to look in my bag.
At my Hoyts I go to Cole's or Woolies before hand and bring a big bag of stuff and they don't ever care. As long as you pay for your ticket the workers are happy.
Ain't no teenager stopping me from eating my snacks
Only when overentitled employees are involved ... https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/aug/01/a-woman-brought-her-own-snacks-to-despicable-me-4-then-the-police-arrived
I feel like if it was as simple as lowering the price, then they would probably already be doing that, especially after something like COVID-19 would've completely tanked profits.

I think the practice of decoy pricing is much more effective (where you have a small drink for $9 and a large drink for $10, most people will feel like paying the extra $1 to get better value, even though both are actually a rip off). It doesn't work on everyone, but it must surely work better than just normal priced items otherwise I feel like this decoy pricing practice would've died out long ago.

Just my 2c anyway.
They would have done the analysis and found that, all things considered, pricing their food and drinks higher generates more profits.
Bold of you to assume they clean it at all.
I have always thought that if a cinema did a deal with a pizza place and you could order your pizza to be picked up when you walked into the cinema that I would go see a lot more movies.
People with no drive!
Ours is an independent in a rural city.  Even serves alcohol. 

Pretty much all the screens are the same as the ones Event/Village advertise as their 'massive' extra cost ones.  The city movie experience is really bad.
Wouldn't wish it on anyone!
they where $10 for years with $8 on Tuesdays i think, until like 2 years ago and now their $15, not that bad if you buy your own snacks
Reading is already cheap in Aus. $13 for a ticket is pretty great
There's a massive line at the movies for food & drink though. I don't think there's be enough demand that it's justify normal pricing. It's a laziness tax, most cinemas are veriy close to a supermarket and yet people still pay $10 for a Coke.
Legally, they can reject anything other than (the *exact*) items that they sell on premises. 

Many, many people have attempted to undercut cinemas over the years by opening their own cheaper candy bar business in close proximity. They always fail.
Ah, thanks for this tip! I used to use this with an air popper, but I had already planned on going to a stove top, so I'll implement this for sure. Got a good idea for a ratio or anything? What about a bit before and a bit after? Thanks!
Lol, what would a r/australia post be without someone mentioning this. I think this might be the 50th time this week.
What a load of dramatic garbage. 😂
Speak for yourself!
That's a pretty random assumption
Oh my leave is over now sadly as of this week! But I did take up a lot of story time, swimming lessons, outdoor walks and just hanging out at the local shopping centre hahaha. Anything to leave the house!!
I mean, kind of? The net revenue on soft drinks is pretty poor, like if someone has two cokes and a lemon lime bitters that's 14 bucks (LLBs are 50 cents more because I mix them myself).


If I get a crowd drinking nothing but soft drinks we're not breaking even.
That's intangible and hard to track, I guess. It's mostly just a tax for venue space, really, I'd rather they be drinking a higher value beverage
Rent would a huge part.
No you're really not.
How do you think they make money?
Every cinema on the planet behaves like this. Why?
Pretty much this. No one ever bag checks. Just don't be obvious with your food and you'll be fine.
The other day I saw a guy with a whole bucket of KFC at Deadpool vs Wolverine
cinema saw your 2c and upcharged it $5
Work for a large cinema chain. Can confirm most sites barely break even.
My thinking, wouldn't it be better to sell more at a smaller margin than fewer at a bigger margin.
You do have a point.   In that case, I had better add in the cost of ants too.
Let me go looking for a trolley then to carry it.
Okay, so I’ll just sneak in a drink and a snack. 🥷🏼
You don't have to prove that you are a diabetic. It's very much against the law to deny someone bringing sugar products into any establishment.
The salt is *really* concentrated, so it's not something I would recommend sprinkling on after. Just up the amount you put in if you like it extra salty. 

I eyeball the ratios and have found my sweet spot over the years, it's probably something you just need to experiment with. I do roughly 4 tablespoons of olive oil and 1 (heaping) tablespoon of salt to half a cup of kernels.
Well then everyone needs to stop using it the wrong way so ppl can stop reminding them.
[citation needed](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lucky_Country)
No I'm speaking for the man who wrote the book called "the lucky country" that everyone is referring to when they say this.
I siad "if" - I was not assuming. I obviously don't know which one you are, and didn't want to pry either.
Residuals
I remember as a kid taking snacks in thinking we were being so sneaky and tricking the staff. Now realised they were 15 year olds who couldn’t give less of a shit what we brought in
Yep. I've got 2 kids so I take a backpack with everything ready to go and no one has ever questioned it.
Bad business imo. They need to try something different than the same old shit. Innovate or die.

The good ones do well. Recently a gold class near me has been thriving. They do alcohol, 30-seat cinemas, serve proper food. It's basically a restaurant with a movie. It's expensive as fuck, but they're often packed, especially for new movies.

A different one to me is much smaller, a little basic and run down, but its cheap. Food is more than usual but not the extreme amounts. It goes really well too.
You're definitely not wrong, it makes sense to lower prices *if it improves profit*. But, if you cut your gross profit in half (for example), you have to sell twice as much product just to *maintain* profit.

What I'm saying is that cinemas (which pretty much just sell tickets and food) have surely already analysed ways to improve profit over the many decades that they've been operating with decoy pricing, and if it was as simple as switching to a more reasonable pricing model, that this would've almost certainly have been done.

In other words, it doesn't matter that not everyone buys a drink, what matters is that the drinks that *are* sold are priced to maximise profit.

Disclaimer: I don't own a cinema, or any business. In fact I'm a high school dropout so it's likely I have no clue what I'm talking about.
Why’s that?
It'd be rude not to
Again, it's perfectly legal to disallow food on a private premises. Reasonable accommodations need to be made for health purposes, but an armful of outside snacks clearly exceeds the needs of a diabetic and wouldn't pass a legal litmus test. 

Even loopholes have their limits, and exploitation is typically pretty self evident.
Thanks! I'll use this as my baseline and calibrate to taste! Cheers! :)
My situation is complicated. I'm lucky in some ways and unlucky in others. But I can assure you I didn't get a third job and regularly work 16+ hour days for the fucking joy of it.
I think you worded that in a way which seems to imply that they have a mortgage as opposed to renting. 

The ‘if’ here seems to imply an opinion rather than introducing a conditional cause.
Still a random thing to say. 

There's more to it than just ''mortgage/no mortgage''
What?
We are a fully licensed premises, have a full food and drink menu, and a couple of ‘concept’ cinemas. Like everything else COVID hit the industry very hard, and only a few releases over the past couple years have seen pre-pandemic admissions (not just for us but across the industry as a whole). 

Audiences know that they can wait a few weeks and whatever they want to watch when it hits streaming. We could sell food at a quarter of the price and it still wouldn’t bring enough people through the door.
This person has never managed an account in their life.
This is the answer. I've worked in the world of ticketed events, and concessions pricing is meticulously analysed and optimised based on profitability modelling. 

Higher volume at lower prices sounds logical on paper, but once you factor in actual potential for uplift and COGS, not so much.
Yep. I do not have high hopes for the future of Australia honestly. I am planning to cash out and get out before something big "bursts or snaps" here.
100%. it was a pretty cunty comment tbh
> can wait a few weeks and whatever they want to watch when it hits streaming

Alternatively, people willingly pay to see x movie back in theatres, or to watch x season finale, etc.
yep hahaha what a stupid comment
You live in one of the most prosperous times in history.

Before you feel too bad for yourself, read a history book or two. It’s brutal. Be glad you live now and your biggest plight is rent.

This isn’t to be a dick, it’s to provide you some hope. You actually have it pretty good. Start getting in there and enjoying it.
Where would you go? Obviously not the UK, the US. Northern European countries would be nice but difficult to permanently stay. Same with Japan, Korea. Huge language barriers elsewhere.

Canada?

As an immigrant who has been in Australia 15 years I'm struggling to think of somewhere I would have a better life.
