11:00 pm this was heard while me and my mom were looking into the bush on the border of a horse paddock, whatever that was scared my and made my whole body light (sound at start and end of video) Queensland mackay blacks beach.
It's a cow in distress.
Bovine
cow

Just sounds like a cow 
dude....that's just a cow
It's a bunyip
I hate that I fucking live near MacKay
Blacks Beach Rd - opposite Hancock St, Barber Drive area has a couple of properties - at least a few cattle there

The sound a cow makes, particularly on a quiet night can carry for kilometres

Try this one for similarities - and now imagine it in the dark at distance

It’s obviously a velociraptor
That’s definitely the sound of a drongo. Unmistakable.
here’s hoping
what’s bovine?
just googled it not a big enough bush for them and the bush is right by mangroves and salt pans also near a creek
That or a yowie
yeah it’s weird not sure what it was
i’m African i spell and say it differently
Huh?
You hope the cow is in distress?
it sounded very loud to be a cow and wouldn’t make sense as it’s not near cow paddocks and was very close to me it was right at the border of the bush
Ok then...
