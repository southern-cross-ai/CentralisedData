Another case of discount "specials". 

1x for $3, but with this amazing discount if you get any 3x boxes you'll pay only $9! 


Sigh...

There are multiple varieties covered in this 3 for $9 promo. 

Including the 
Sanitarium So Good Barista Oat Uht Milk 
and
Sanitarium So Good Almond Barista Uht Milk

which are both $4 for a single unit.

I was able to look this up and confirm this on the coles website in about 30 seconds.

There are many varieties covered in this 3 for $9 promo. If you're trying to complain about the cost of living, this ain't it chief.

Also u/OP, you have a choice not to buy it also.
Jesus fucking Christ, enough with these shitposts. Shop elsewhere. Done.
Dear lord, you haven’t uncovered some grand conspiracy. Who cares?
Yes, you can drink soy if you want. I'd recommend oat, but that's just a personal preference.
This is harris farm fruit and veg every single day..... "2 for $8 (or $4 each)"
Bro your karma think of the karma
from working at coles, i can tell you their ticketing system is a nightmare in itself. the price you’re seeing below is the sale price not the actual price. if you trigger print on a normal shelf edge for a product that’s on sale, typically it forces you to just print a sale sticker but on rare occasions it print a a no sale tag with the sale price which is confusing to staff and customers.

woolies is quite far ahead with their stock monitoring paperless e tags which literally automatically are updated by a computer in the store remotely even sales are put out, or the product runs out of stock. very neat.
OP has no understanding that its not the CEO that produces these stickers.


How dare anyone, ever, make a mistake about anything.
I caught that  years ago .
No its illegal. Call your federal minister and watch it all go away.
I am not lawyer and did a business law course 10 years ago. But my feeling is that they are skating pretty close to the wind as far as "misleading and deceptive conduct"

You could put in a complaint with the department of commerce and see if thry agree.

Fines can really add up.
I'm not certain but I believe something advertised as Special must be genuinely on special.
Sigh. Thanks Coles marketing and legal departments. Must suck getting called out all the time. 
That’s the new price then - they make the current price the special, then when it comes off special they’ll replace the back tag with the online price
Thank you!

And if they respond with "but that sub only has 149 subscribers" that is because that number represents how many people actually care about this bullshit.
We really do need to ship these off to another subreddit. What a supermarket is charging isn't really relevant to life in Melbourne.
🤣🤣🤣
>I am not lawyer and did a business law course 10 years ago. But my feeling is that they are skating pretty close to the wind as far as "misleading and deceptive conduct"

Your feeling is wrong. 

Me: a lawyer. 

Also, please don't encourage this fucking nonsense of complaining about anything and everything. It's a $3 carton of milk, which is a discretionary good. You want to buy it? Buy it. If not, move the fuck along.
"source = it came to me in a dream"
it is, manafacturers are the ones who put out sales, they offer stock to coles and woolies at cheaper prices on the condition they put out a sale, otherwise coles and woolies lose money.

this is a simple ticketing error, where the normal
shelf ticket was printed mid sale and due to the shitty and personally outdated ticketing system which results in A LOT of paper wastage and stupid mistakes like this. 

the ticketing system just grabs the current price not the original price, which causes confusing for employees and customers.
To every idiot which down voted me, grow up and use common sense. Also, google stuff!

>It is illegal to advertise special prices and imply substantial savings when, in fact, the goods and services are normally sold at those "special prices".

>Such claims create a belief that savings are possible when they are not and are therefore deceptive and misleading.

Just someone who worked in retail for 8 years and had enough dumb customers to last a lifetime.
No, they are saying that the photo is just of one of the cheap options from the “ANY” 3 deal.

Other options which you could choose from are more than $3 each.

It’s a mix and match deal, but if you pick only the cheap $3 items then that’s on you.
>that is because that number represents how many people actually care about this bullshit.

And that's why capitalism has evolved to a late stage where people just accept it and let companies extort them without as much as a raised eyebrow. are companies even greedy when muppets just hand them money.
What’s Melb got to do with it? This is the Aus sub.
exactly, this is not america.
In the end it is up to the department of commerce to decide whether this is "misleading and deceptive conduct" not me.
Fair, I misread and didn’t get that from it. Overwhelming cynicism got the better of me
My bad. Thought I was in Melbourne subreddit. I could have been in any city sub though as these posts are a plague everywhere.
