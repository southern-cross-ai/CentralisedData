I'm doing a project where we need to associate the Australian states with something.  
My classmates are doing cat breeds, celebrities, anime and so on, and I'm thinking of **elements** like earth, water, fire, air, light, darkness etc. Though I need help figuring it out, like is Queensland a Water state or Victoria? How about Western Australia as Earth?

You guys can get the gist, I want to know other perspectives on this.

Edit: Guys... I'm thinking of ***Avatar: The last Airbender*** **or** ***Ninjago*** elements- Not science! ðŸ˜­

ACT would probably be *Methyl (1R,2R,3S,5S)-3-(benzoyloxy)-8-methyl-8-azabicyclo\[3.2.1\]octane-2-carboxylate*
EARTH, FIRE, WIND, WATER, HEART GOOOO PLANET BY YOUR POWERS COMBINED I AM CAPTAIN PLANET
I wanna say Gold for WA, but Victoria could claim that. Iron is another one for WA. In fact what we could claim a few.
I believe Queensland has more zinc than others.

Is zinc still used as sunscreen? Queensland has a lot of sun.
I thought you meant elements like Gold, iron etc.
So how about t precious materials associated with each state.
Vic is the gold state
WA is iron.
Etc
The G in Ninjago is not capitalised. Please amend this egregious error.
We got different elements here. Earth, Water, Fire etc are boring American elements.

We got Dirt (brown), Goo, Being Loud, Dirt (red), Fish, and my personal favourite, Dirt (sideways).
earth, water, fire, air, light, darkness. OK, then WA would be fire, NSW light, Queensland earth, Tasmania water, NT Darkness
SA is uranium
NSW is carbon.
Why not bending abilities instead of just the elements? NT would be pure fire, WA lava bending out of a combination of fire and earth abilities, Qld as water bending, ...
Tasmania would be a water state - surrounded by it, with lots of rivers and lakes
The board game Spirit Island uses these 8 elements (which is handy as there are 6 states and 2 mainland territories):

Sun, Moon, Fire, Air, Water, Earth, Plant, Animal.

Some are pretty obvious (QLD = Sun) and some may require creativity (ACT = Air - hot air, or all the useless talk). Have fun matching the rest of them up.
Not traditionally an avatar element but I think wood would fit perfectly for Tassy. Wood would lol
Maybe Ice or Snow for ACT, Wind for TAS, Fire or Earth for NT, Metal for WA, Water for QLD, Lightning/Light for VIC/NSW, and Wood for SA (I ran out of ideas for that last one)
Victoria would be ethanol.... Because it's in-solvent
Victoria would be Au. The element the state was built on.
WA is iron, SA is copper, Vic is gold, Tas is lead (birth defects), NSW is shit and Qld is something idk
Qld would probably be best described with gold (au).

It's rich (prosperity) in natural resources and has a mining industry, it's full of sunshine as well.

Wa would probably be iron (fe). Iron ore is a key element in wa and the have 400 years worth of the stuff. It also represents the strength and power of the state even though it is so isolated from the other states.
God I loved that show
WA is the biggest gold producer
Could you imagine a world without zinc?
WA could be asbestos maybe?Â 
Fixed!
Finally! Thank you! ðŸ˜­
NT would like a word.
Thank you!!!
Thank you so much!
Gotta laugh at people trying to associate other states with gold - Victoria's was the only gold rush to rival California's and it's the reason Melbourne was for a time the richest city in the world. (It was also the biggest city in Australia at the time).
Victoria is Gold?

Mate, our state has a Negative value. Maybe something like Lithium because our Government has bipolar.

No offence meant to individuals with Mental Health concerns. I genuinely believe our State Government spends with Mania and then is crippled by depression/recession.
It was specialÂ 
Vic and Qld had gold rushes that helped to bring settlers into the country - WA just sort of relocated them
Maybe 50 years ago

Have you seen [Don Cheadle as Captain Planet?](https://youtu.be/TwJaELXadKo). It's nothing at all like the original... but it's funny.
