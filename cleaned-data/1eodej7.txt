That is a beautifully done, high quality, shit tatoo.
Looks fake
Hmm


It's for the description right there in the tattoo.


Great artwork.


Just trash. The idea. The actual getting it done. Everything
What the fuck
Is it the 90's again with that font?
Looks like Scott Marsh artwork - belongs in r/ATBGE 

I like Ibis' getting recognition but can't help be disappointed when they're slandered as trash/bin chickens. Well.. I guess it's not exactly slander, but they don't deserve all the disrespect they cop.
Your "tattoo" contradicts your username.
Bin chicken Basquiat üëë
Hurtful that they wrote trash on this absolute treasure, beautiful work and beautiful trash birb
Incredible tattoo skills, this thing looks like a sticker.
It is a really nice tattoo though, the colours look awesome üëå
As a foreigner from Oklahoma, what species are your "bin chickens"? We only have "trash pandas" (also known as a [raccoon)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raccoon).
I'm not one for tats (at all), but wow that pops. Good job on the photo real elements too. I am wondering how much this would fade, how long, and how it would look then
This speaks to me
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
You must really love bin chickens. What does it mean to you?
Majestic
Beautifully done and a very original idea, I like it!
This is my favorite thing in the world. Something that is totally not my style or interest, and I fucking love this!
AKA The Australian flamingo
Absolute masterpiece!
That‚Äôs beautiful
I love this.
I love this
This style is sooo ugly
r/ATBGE
I'd have called it...  "trashy". :P
Shit? I‚Äôve seen shit tattoos this is absolutely heinous‚Ä¶ like what in the random graffiti generator adobe cod sticker looking shit is this?

That‚Äôs your fucking leg my guy, not the back window of a 2010 xr6 turbo.
As if that's shit
Nah Chris is legit, he was Perth based now moved to Melbourne. His Instagram has these tattoos going back years. 
A couple of my mates have gotten some from him, they are all this similar style, he's just perfected the art over years.

Yes
2010's was the 80's comeback.


2020's is the 90's.


Next decade will be like 2000's all over again.
Definitely riffing off Scottie‚Äôs Bin Kingz series. Crown and all.
Exactly what I was thinking dudes bit Scott‚Äôs style terribly. Toy shit

These are Ibis birds - AKA. Bloody bignose.


(I adore the trash panda)¬†
Some 'Attenborough' education for you:

Me too.
Must be a devoted follower of Thoth!
Don‚Äôt get it tattooed on you then
Well aren't you a little ray of sunshine.
Nah it's great
the crown looks ace, if it was just that it'd be a banger
He does fantastic work but is so incredibly expensive! You definitely get what you pay for though
Wow it really does look fake, so thanks for the link. 

Personally I think it's all rather ugly. But hey it's not on me and each to their own.
I'm ready for emo to make a comeback
Y2k comeback has been a thing for a few years now
Been that way forever.

Back to the future was a hit cause it dished out 50s nostalgia in the 80s
90s is done, there's already a 00s comeback right now
Do you think I can sell my bucket of dongles from the 2k's to USB connect palm pilots/zip drives/mp3 players or I should just keep holding on to them?
thank you. They're on a list now.
thanks!
also racoons. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Peuy0FE4X8
Agreed! I regret not getting one when his price wasn't through the roof and he hadn't moved to Melbourne. Back when my mates got theirs it was usually only a 3 month waiting list üòÖ
I‚Äôve just started chatting to him about a current idea I‚Äôve got, we haven‚Äôt dived into price yet, still very early in the ‚Äúhere‚Äôs a rough idea I‚Äôve got‚Äù process, but I‚Äôm nervous to find out cost! Love his style though
Legitimately just give it 10 years. Teenagers wear their parents clothes
"blast"? what
$1500 a day. That was 12 months ago when I enquired with him.
Thank you
