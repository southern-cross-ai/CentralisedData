I had one of their batteries in my car (under bonnet) without issue, but it hardly got used (<100 cycles). Have since sold the car so no longer my problem. But everything Stephan did was totally in the right, he tried to follow the issue up with them, he did proper testing, and he exposed that their batteries were actually shit. Fuck DCS, and I hope Stephan gets all this bullshit dropped.
For defamation action to be successful in Australia, they have to prove that the statements were false and that the person or company suffered a loss as a result of the statement.

Many companies will use the same tactics as described to have negative media removed, especially from smaller companies. This is not unique to Australia. Fuck â€˜em all
TLDW Even [arena.gov.au](https://arena.gov.au) agrees
At this point, proving the loss won't be an issue as DCS have now undoubtedly suffered a loss. How much was due to that video and how much is now due to DCS blowing it up is another question.

However, even if that is true, the truth is a defence to defamation.
