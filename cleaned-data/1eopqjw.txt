I mean... good on her for doing.. that... in front of a live crowd but damn that was weird as hell. 
I’m getting major “everyone’s afraid of the t-rex” deadpool vibes from that still.
I watched the gold medal performance on another sub, and it wasn’t particularly spectacular.
It was by no means good but some of the comments on her Instagram are so horrendous I feel really bad for her, I hope she has strong shoulders and a good support system
Olympics:How good are you at this??



Her:
I think she's had enough guys come on...
Isn't that Choda Boy's Hamster style?
Can we stop bullying this woman? Yeah she did bad but look, this is now over the top.
Did she do it for likes/attention, knowing she had no chance?
I think she stole that pose from Demi Lardner’s standup
Did I read that she’s a professor of pop culture moments? I reckon she knew she probably wouldn’t win so just wanted to create her own moment for people to like her to study.
It was mint

The kangaroo thing was great. People are hating but that bit was fun and I'd like to see other Aussie breakers include it in their routines.
Why does anyone actually care about this? It’s kinda funny but I can’t even imagine feeling embarrassed and bullying the shit out of someone over it. Who actually gives a shit?
In absolute fairness, we spend a lot of time telling women to live with the confidence of a mediocre white man and she actually did, so 🤷‍♀️
A pretty accurate representation of Australian woman she did us proud!
I tried to watch some today for context, the whole set up was cringey, no one else I saw looked super different to her in terms of fancy moves.
She was trolling, right?
Pfft. I hope the people whose spot she took to prove some kind of point have their heads together. 

I hope this was a protest.
To be fair she was worse than the Polish footy team. And let me tell you - we are the only nation that is not only offended if someone pokes fun at our national team, we join it. we are the first ones to make mekes about them after any lost game 

There was recently a petition to make volleyball our national sport...
For real, people responding to this by cyberbullying is the real fail. Absolutely gross.
Young, attractive, has a PhD, super fit, happy-go-lucky. She'll be just fine.
Let’s hope she is a follow up to Eddie the Eagle in this.

Yeah I feel for her actually. Fucking up so badly on the big world stage is already bad enough, but now all this relentless bullying - and that is exactly what it is, bullying. People scream to the high heavens about mental health, but don't hesitate for a second in joining in tearing this woman apart online. 

I mean, it's like she's done something evil or unethical to warrant the backlash. She hasn't. She breakdanced badly, that's it.
He said he wasn’t going to do it anymore
I sincerely thought she was trolling. I found it hilarious!
She’s not some victim. She seems to be lapping up the attention that some parts of the media are giving her as “Australia’s first breakdance Olympian”

The fact that she selfishly took the Olympic spot by putting herself up for it when she’s not that good and then single-handedly has managed to make an embarrassment of herself and breakdancing as an Olympic sport, she deserves the mockery.
She said she knew she wasn’t going to be able to compete with the younger athletes in terms of pizazz (or “finishing moves” as they call them in the biz) so was trying to bring a long of her own authentic style and creativity to compensate… Make of that what you will
No, her research is about females place in break dancing and how they feel about it.
How’s she different from Eddie the Eagle?
Do you really think this inspired anyone? The other Australians performance did but her performance set breaking back if anything.
Who is the we in that sentence? Terminally online teenagers and bitter older women?

Those men actually have depression and commit suicide at much higher rates than her demographic, people generally just don't give a fuck. So maybe rethink that utter bullshit you're parroting hey
Yeah the whole event looks like it’s part of a sketch comedy show. 
Even the better ones were boring to watch
I think she just isn't good (comparatively to other dancers). From what I read, she admitted that she wasn't up to the standard of the other athletes, so she went for a quirky routine to try and win that way. 

It does raise a question of how she was selected in the first place if she isn't that great though.
Not at all, she has dissected the very essence of the breaking of dance, and created an interpretive number for the fellow kids.
If she's a good sport and just goes with it she'll be better off. She has gained way more fame than she would had she done a boring routine, she could land commentators roll if her professors job doesn't pay the bills (which I'm sure it does). Understandable if she doesn't take it well though considering she is being ridiculed for her life's passion.
She's not young. She said that's why she tried something different
Exactly the criticism is now getting personal and over the top.
>She breakdanced badly, that's it.

....and embarrassed herself and the entire nation at the same time. This Olympics should be remembered as our most successful campaign ever. Her dreadful performance has a very good chance of derailing that memory.

I don't condone bullying her on her own Instagram page but being critical of an athlete's performance (or lack thereof) is fine in my books. If you're going to claim you're the best in the country at something and then perform shamefully on the world stage, people will call you out for it.
Right, coz I’m sure she had the power to choose who went to the olympics. 

You can’t blame someone for putting their hand up for it. If you want someone to blame, blame whoever it is that actually makes the calls about who gets sent
> She seems to be lapping up the attention

Or, is this just a narrative that folks like you invented to help make yourself feel better for bullyting the fuck out of someone?
They're called power moves
So there was no physically fit person in Australia that could practice for 3 months, then try for all five scoring criteria?
who cares if and how she is different from eddie the eagle?

what a horrid world it would be if people only did the things they were the world best at, instead of the things that they enjoyed.
yes.

I bet there is a 6 year old little girl thinking... the kangaroo hop is a good dance move, what else can I dance like?

there is a PE teacher thinking... a dance battle would be a good way to get my class to move.

a 30+ yo woman is thinking... if she can do that in front of the world, i can go to the dance fitness class at the gym.

not everyone is inspired by greatness.  sometimes, you need to see the full spectrum of skill out there and take a chance on something that is fun and enjoyable.
Yeah agree, I think it’s a flop. It’s an uphill battle to get these more modern, subjectively judged sports accepted by fans of the Olympics, but at the least the BMX and some of the skating are enough of a visual spectacle to arguably justify it. This just did absolutely nothing for me.
> It does raise a question of how she was selected in the first place if she isn't that great though.

Oceania doesn't have a big breaking scene, she was selected because she won at the qualifiers, it's not anything deep or conspiratorial.
Good god what a dramatic comment
We have 18 gold medals, 49 in total. One girl doing poorly isn't going to hurt that, let alone ruin it.
You need to go outside and get some fresh air.

“…embarrassed the entire nation” what a load of absolute rubbish.
A myriad of memes and malicious jokes is not "critical of an athlete's performance" mate. In any capacity.
Yes, however shall you recover.
> ....and embarrassed herself and the entire nation at the same time. This Olympics should be remembered as our most successful campaign ever. Her dreadful performance has a very good chance of derailing that memory.

Who fucking cares?

"I don't condone bullying, except in this case where I'm suddenly ok with it", you need to grow up and get a hobby or something, regular well adjusted people don't behave like this, jfc.
Well, she did kind of have the power to determine whether she went to the Olympics so..
Yep, how the hell is she lapping up the attention? I don't think she's posted anything on SM since the event.
No
No one who was interested and could drug test clean. 
It’s kinda like adding “raving” to the olympics.
Which is exactly what Eddie the Eagle did, only he’s male and from England so lacks our self-excruciating cultural cringe.
1. Breakdancing isn’t a sport and shouldn’t be at the olympics.

2. When it comes to visual spectacle, the gap between women’s and men’s is an ocean. But it still won’t make sense to most people and shouldn’t be at the olympics.
There's an interesting backstory to how breaking got into the Olympics. Apparently, the World DanceSport Federation hijacked breaking - a dance form it had never previously been involved with - because it knew it couldn't get ballroom dancing in (you can't make this stuff up). 

[https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/1ep1pm2/travesty\_how\_the\_olympics\_breaking\_farce\_was/](https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/1ep1pm2/travesty_how_the_olympics_breaking_farce_was/)
I mean there’s a lot of stuff in various definitions about the exertion being “primary” to the sport, and I would argue it’s not in breaking since 4 of the 6 criteria are about artistry moreso than the technical. 

But sure, for the sake of argument I’d even be willing to tentatively give it the label “sport”. Personally I’m more interested in the Olympics part than the sport label part, since that has actual practical implications.
[And yet the guy we sent seems much better](https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/1epdaim/our_olympics_bboy_representative_16_year_old_jeff/). He didn't win, but he did actually look like he knew what he was doing. 

You can see better break dancers in capital cities just dancing with friends, so the fact she qualified does raise questions to how these qualifiers were set up and if they were even advertised. 

As others have said, it was run by a ballroom organisation. Ballroom organisations around the world have been trying to get ballroom into the Olympics for a long time, instead break dancing gets selected. It seems they just didn't care to properly run qualifiers, maybe out of spite.
Laughing from Wisconsin
So you didn't feel at all cringey when watching? You felt proud of that performance?
That's why I said I don't condone that.

Actual critique is absolutely deserved.
There's a difference between bullying, and critiquing a performance. She deserves the critique, not the bullying.
What, so when she was selected, she should have turned it down?
Is ribbon dancing? 
Is dressage? 

Breakdancing doesn't even seem that far off a floor gymnastics routine, just head spins instead of flips
This is what the IOC and big incumbent sports federations do. Same beef with the world sailing folk taking over kayaking, rollerskate federation taking skateboarding, and international gymnastics federation are trying to do the same thing to parkour. All supported by the IOC because it's easier. 
.
Why give a shit? Plenty of Olympians go to the Olympics that aren't actually good at the sport they are in, we don't drag them through the mud.
Mate, have a laugh about it!

It shows we don't have to take ourselves too seriously! That's what she did!

It's been just about the funniest fucking thing that's happened all Olympics - she did the sprinkler and ran around sideways in a circle like Homer Simpson going woopwoopwoopwoopwoop!

Oh, did she bring the noble Olympic Sport of Breaking into disrepute? All the flyest B-Boys and B-Girls acting hard and repping their C-Countries? The Olympic Judges had bucket hats on for fucks' sake!
No, but she had the power to
Except gymnastics doesn’t tolerate anything less than perfect. People don’t make it to a state level if they don’t hit 99% of the tricks. 

Meanwhile skating and this abomination take the ‘at least they tried’ approach.
Dressage absolutely should not be an Olympic sport, total garbage and just rich people wank. 

Gymnastics is fundamentally flawed in my opinion and I would have absolutely no qualms with seeing rhythmic gymnastics particularly fall by the wayside. 

Subjectivity in the outcome is always going to detract heavily from the legitimacy of a sport in my view, but at least in artistic gymnastics or diving I can imagine how you might be able to formalise the process to eliminate human bias and even outright corruption. E.g. we absolutely have the technology to have computer-judged versions of these events where the score is purely calculated by statistical measures such as the angle of deviation between the idealised version of the move/dive vs the actual. 

And even if you don’t actually implement that, I can absolutely imagine being convinced that an expert human eye can be a very good proxy for what you would get if judged by a computer - so that there is actually something objective underneath that is being judged towards, at least in principle.

The breaking has far, far deeper issues than the others, in that “creativity”, “personality”, “musicality” are genuine judging criteria. What are those? Give me a definition of that which isn’t just totally personal opinion. It’s like judging art at the MOMA. 

And it’s not just the *inherent* subjectivity, it’s the fact that are bad criteria, uncorrelated who is the best at the actual athletic feat at hand. Raygun legitimately would’ve lost points for wearing a dorky outfit. The French guy that wiped the floor with J-Attack made a dick joke and would’ve probably been rewarded personality points for it.

How the fuck is that possibly a criterion in a “sport” let alone one at the Olympics? 

People (not you for all I know) love to throw out how we used to have arts in the Olympics (JRR Tolkien even competed as a poet). But the fact is it’s not like the old days anymore. It’s evolved to a display of purely sporting prowess on an international stage. Breaking sticks out like a sore thumb in this context.
I didn’t mention any other events. I’m talking about breakdancing.
Most people don't hate themselves enough to purposely sabotage themselves because others might think poorly of them.
Now it doesn't, you can't expect them to hit the same level in the first couple years of being at the games, look at very old gymnastics routines and it looks like any amateur could do those stunts and I think you'll see the same kind of thing if breaking were to continue.

For skateboarding the single trick shot comp I will admit can be hard to watch with all the misses
>How the fuck is that possibly a criterion in a “sport” let alone one at the Olympics?

There are other sports that have the issues like many of the winter sports (e.g., ski jumping, half pipe, big air etc). The definition of the sport is simply that it requires physical exertion and is competitive, which breaking satisfies.

Whether it should be an Olympic sport is an entire different matter.
Welcome to a word called comparisons?
I think you missed the joke
Breakdancing isn’t a sport and shouldn’t be in the olympics. The fact that other events you don’t deem to be sport are has nothing to do with whether breakdancing should be. 

I understand you’re probably coming at it from an accepting “why not welcome them” angle, I’m coming at it from a “the Olympics has nothing to do with breakdancing and is bad for it, nobody asked for this” angle.
