Unaffordable housing prices poisons every aspect of society and the economy.
Boomers and their politicians pulled the ladder up behind themselves, then have the gall to act surprised when millennials can’t afford to have kids? The worst part is a lot of them are genuinely so stupid they can’t do a simple comparison on income vs housing costs.
Fuck having a baby, can barely financially support myself.
Have they seen the cost of living? Have they seen the lack of childcare placements?

The powers that be want people popping out sprogs, but they don't want to do anything to support them while they raise them to adulthood. 

Provide people with affordable housing, and they might consider starting a family. Affordable, as can be afforded on a single, minimum wage job.
Boomers: Okay, well, nobody needs free education any more.  
Everyone: But why?  
Boomers: Nobody gave us a hand out, we had to work for it. Now, wages are going to stop growing in any meaningful amount for over a decade.  
Everyone: Hold on, how does -  
Boomers: And housing is going to explode and you won't be able to afford it.  
Everyone: But why? Can't we just have the same -  
Boomers: Nope, nobody helped us. We had to fight and claw our way through 17% interest rates to get our houses.  
Everyone: Okay but -  
Boomers: So, both of you are going to have to work, you'll have a huge HECS debt, and your wages will stagnate. Oh, and rents will go insane, we'll allow supermarkets to price gouge, won't curb inflation, won't give you any more renters rights, and allow insane numbers of immigration.  
Everyone: Okay, well, I guess I can't afford children then.  
Boomers: Shocked Pikachu face
Why would we have kids when everything is so expensive, the climate is getting fucked and they keep wanting us to work more.

All the while, we're bombarded by adds for cheap none necessities and we need a break from the grind or we'll scream
If you can bring in a migrant who won't complain about working conditions and wage theft, who needs a baby?
* Baby recession
* Cost of living crisis
* Housing affordability crisis

Gee I can't figure out why people aren't starting families anymore.
I’m trying to save for a home while renting on a single wage. I live on next to nothing and get hit with a tax bill for earning 1800 in interest on my home deposit account which I now understand will never be enough to qualify for a loan. 
But no, sure I’ll pop a few kids out for the good of the country that bends me over every time I try to get ahead..
If only we were all well paid former premiers who could afford to have seven children.
My dick can't get hard while thinking of the dred of cost of living
I love my kids too much to have them.
We have 2 kids. 

The barrier to more children (if we wanted them) is housing and expenses primarily. 

Cant afford rent prices for a 4 bed vs 3 bed

The other barrier is time and expertise. Its hard to raise kids. Its hard af sometimes and i dont have it in me to parent more kids. I dont have any family/friends support so theres no village. I am lucky to have my partner (their dad) so i have it much better than many others doing it alone.
NIMBY be like HAVE KIDS but don't build anything to support said kids this is MY LAND
Good. Just suck it up and adjust the system to one that doesn't rely on ever increasing consumption of the planet
GenX here. I was able to lead a fairly pleasant and fulfilling life because I focused on things other than having babies, and even though I am financially stable today, if I had a child now my whole life would turn upside down. 

I can’t imagine the financially devastating effect it’d have on younger generations who are facing a lot worse financial global conditions.
Currently on maternity leave freaking out about finding child care for my twins that will allow me to go back to work. It’s so stressful.
Nothing to see here.

Government dials up immigration to ensure Australia keeps "growing".

Property market ponzi scheme continues. 

Boomers stay wealthy at the expense of everyone else. 

Living standards decline.

Politicians remain so out of touch that they barely even notice.
I might think about having kids if I actually had any money...
Well they put the price of all groceries up by 50% for no reason other than unchecked greed. No one will want to have kids they can’t feed and can’t house.
We would love to have a second but making ends meet with a wife on maternity leave has proven difficult to say the least.

We also have fertility issues so we would need to shell out 10k+ to do IVF. 

Every single thing in this country is designed to discourage you having kids. Jim Chalmers has the power to change the economic fortunes of Australian parents and parents to be if he wants but instead sooks in the media about the lack of kids.

How is it being encouraged? Not talking baby bonuses but how do you expect people to see bad times and go “yeah better bring someone else into my misery?”

I adore my son and would love more but my passion for having children is not universal and for many people who see children as a possible but not certain concept, they’re getting another reason to be childless because of cost.

Either give the dying boomers everything they want and allow them to negatively gear their slums to the detriment of the population, or fix the inequity in this society so people have the safety net to have kids. It’s not fucking hard if you’re not a selfish greedy cunt.
We may not be a great example, because we have two kids. But when I’ve considered a third (assuming that would be physically possible) the thing that stops me is money and housing. So it’s not just that couples who could go either way don’t have kids, it’s also that even people who are having kids- are having less.


We rent and will be for the foreseeable. I feel guilty that we haven’t been to give our children the stability of their own home, stability we both had growing up.
Any kid born today will face the full cost of our failure to address climate change. Why would you want that for your offspring
I can afford to have kids, but don't want to because of how fucked the climate is going to become.

It's mostly because boomers can't understand how urgent it is to act and stop playing games. Scientists have given us the mechanisms to fix it, but the old fart politicians just fuck around.

No way do I want my kids having to live with the consequences and have a miserable life moving from fire to flood every year
People can't afford to have them and live in a city where a majority of the work is located anymore.
Plenty of people on this earth already, don't know what the fuss is about a slightly lower birth rate ..
The only way to kill late stage capitalism is to starve it. The only way to starve it is to not feed it fuel. Future generation is the fuel.
[deleted]
Yeah look, I can only afford my cat at the present time.
This is something every developed country is going through, we need to rethink our economy on the “infinite” growth model as we’re eventually going to be losing more people than gaining.
This is a reality we have to accept earlier than later.
Everyone is saying the obvious, money. But the real problem is lack of support network and community. Poor and lower social economic people have always had kids, you don't need money for kids, it just makes it way easier. But a lack of family, friends and community support, now we are talking a massive undertaking. It takes a village to raise a child is not just a fancy saying, our modern society has become a toxic environment to grow a family in.
We are pregnant with our second (first passed away) and this will most likely be our only baby. We are in a good place financially, but if we weren't we would have had to give up our want to be parents.
We've already accepted that our child will live with us probably till they're 30, and made sure to buy a house that accommodated that, but again we are lucky to be able to do this. My two sisters have decided not to have kids, and 80% of our friend group are the same.

It's impossible for young people to even live their own lives, let along think about caring for a baby. Throw in the unpredictability of renting and the high rent costs. It's very unattractive to even want to have a baby in this current climate.
No-one wants to have a baby while living in share housing
Aside from rising costs, economy is all over the place and the fact that raising kids is bloody hard work, I think a lot of young peoples priorities have changed in the last decades.   
  
Personally, I want to travel, enjoy the nice things in life, sleep 7 hours at night, and just make the most of what time I have and having kids just gets in the way of all of that.
I’m happily childless. The last thing I’d want is to be worrying about kids all the time.
It was tough when my kids were young, and it must be even worse now.  I've got three, a daughter and twin boys, one's a teenage, the others are becoming teenagers now. 

I looked after them when they were young - I got made redundant, so stopped working.  My partner earned enough to keep us going.  Still had our daughter in care three days a week, Thursday we went to my parents place and Friday was home.  

When I started back at work, the boys went into full time care, we were lucky to get two in the same place, but it was expensive then, God knows what it would be now.  My daughter went into after and before school care.  None of this was cheap, and it wouldn't be now. 

I have no idea what to do to solve this.  It's grim, and not great for the country.
Damn that’s crazy. 

How will sports betting survive when there’s no more minors to market to?
That smug look on the baby's face.

I don't think they know the shit storm they are in for.
Well, that’s one way to have smaller classroom sizes I suppose.
My wife and I (30/31) have a daughter who is nearly three. We’d fuckin LOVE to have another but we can’t work out how to afford it.
I have friends who would love to have a child. But after looking at every option they literally cannot afford it. I can’t imagine how heartbreaking that must be for people who actually want children.
Gee, it's almost as though life is prohibitively expensive for a lot of people, and no one's doing anything about it.
Shock horror, when the greedy boomer cunts hoard everything and property is treated as an investment, and as housing becomes almost impossible to own or rent... People somehow cant afford children.

I know the solution, but it will take a government with ballls.
This was predicted decades ago. Time to adjust to a more sustainable level of population, which means finding better economic models that don't rely on people pumping out babies to prop up business. The creepy pronatliast stuff coming out of silicon valley is freaking me out too. 

Fossil fuelled capitalism isn't conducive to life, not just human life.
Great news!!
Is this really due to not being able to afford having children? Or are there deeper social issues at work? Poverty has never seemed to stop people from popping out babies.
I wonder what else has gone up (hint: house) and down (hint: wages) since the 70s 🤔
Lower birth rate is good. It rather have a world/country with fewer people who have better wellbeing than a world with a huge amount of people struggling for limited supply of resources.
My morgage repayments are 50% of my wage
Another point people don’t bring up is surgery wait times for women’s issues like endo- my friend has it bad and has to wait 3-4 years in the public system to have surgery- but waiting that long will likely cause infertility.
This is just the new normal. Birth rates globally peaked in 1966 and have been falling since. Cost is a more recent  reason why people are having fewer kids, but it's not the main driving factor historically.

Any sensible country would accept this is the new normal and plan to act accordingly, not try and delay the inevitable with mass migration and hope it goes away.
can't imagine anything worse than being pregnant. no thanks lol.
Boomers fucked you guys too huh? -USA
i mean......   **gestures broadly at everything**
kids ? in this fucking economy ?!
Unaffordable housing, cost of living crisis and general disinterest in promoting family friendly policies are big contributors to the declining birth rates. 

However, I always fail to see politicians talking about the fact that women are more educated, more financially secure than ever. Where our great grandmothers and grandmothers had 5-7 children over their lives our generations are having much smaller families and I don't think that's a bad thing.
No one can afford anything. Why would you burden yourself with a kid? If you want to thrive rather than survive, then avoid having kids. People haven’t wisened up to the system and state of affairs.
They don’t care as long as we continue paying for their pension and they can stay living in their multi-million dollar empty nest homes.
Australia doesn't like kids.

They have to educate and feed them.

They can import people at university entrance age and sell them a cheap degree with a side of citizenship.

Which one do you think is more profitable in the short term?

We also get to jam them into an overheated housing market.

Is it good for Australia overall?

Do you think anyone in the last 20 years has cared?
I think the cost of fertility treatment has a factor in this also. It is absolutely bullshit expensive for those who have to go that way.
That doesn’t matter, politicians can always just import new workers to keep us chugging along. Capitalism is great
Geeze you folk are selfish, just give the boomers more grandkids already /s
More people realise that children are a choice, and are better empowered to make that choice for themselves as opposed to succumbing to pressure from family, partners, or what have you.
Is this bad though? Over population is a thing. I say this as someone who has unleashed 2 crotch goblins on the world but I can 100% see why people wouldn't want to have them in this day and age. We're definitely not running out any time soon either.
Good! Let's continue to strike globally.
It's not rocket science. If you make shelter unstable for people they're just not going to have babies.
The government secretly wanting this. They want working age immigrants who will spend big on education. What good does an infant bring the economy for the first 18 years?
I have 2. I want 2 more. But I'm not having 2 more. Can't afford it.
It's almost like systematically undermining the middle class has real repercussions. Colour me surprised!
See, this is what happens when you bring back the mullet.
I bet the dingo’s are pissed.
There is zero incentive to have children in Australia with the increase in COL, exploiting migration, ridiculous house prices, low wages , high childcare fees, high hecs fees😳

Give me one good reason to have kids 

The government doesn’t care they can just import fully grown migrants to subsidise everything 

The Australian lifestyle is dying and I hope someone in Government stops being so tone deaf & realises we have a series problem 🤯🤨💀
Good.

Constant growth is not sustainable in a planet with finite resources.
Live these posts. I'm a 29 year old female who is not going to have children. You would be stupid to have them considering our prospects and current climate in the world. 

Myself and my partner will live out our days as best we can, not dragging another being into this mess
I don't believe that there was a boom during the pandemic. Was there?
These last four years have been a century, huh?
Yep that’s us. Rent just went up another $100 as it did last year. Need some fertility treatment because we waited not knowing what the pandemic will bring now all our money has to go into keeping a roof over our head and wtf do we do now.
Halt immigration till there’s enough housing to home our citizens. Increase tax on the top percentiles and increase minimum wage. Bring back free education and then see what happens. 
Without security or hope for a future people won’t have kids
Why would I have kids when I can't even afford a house to put them in, let alone all the other costs that have super inflated.
No shit?
I honestly believe if we had a Time Machine it would be morally responsible to go back and allow Covid to rid us of the boomers. They have no interest in the wellbeing of their children and grandchildren’s generations so they might as well just fuck off and die out.
How can people afford to have babies these days lol
Quite the unorthodox way to solve the teacher shortage, but it might work
lol I’m 40 and if I want a home that’s not 60-90 mins commute each day I need the purchasing power of two people. A child would probably have banks nope on it.
There are economic reasons why this happening, but we won't fix the problem (if it indeed is a problem) unless a cultural shift happens.

Women are no longer forced to have children... why must we return to that old way of life?
I think there needs to be more support for mothers to be home raising their children. Tax breaks for households with single incomes (such as the option to divide income between both adults in the partnership)  

The government wants women to give birth and then rip them from their arms (and breasts) as they send them straight back into the workforce. No nurturing the bond between parent and child. 

Where is the reward for adults to have children when they never get time to be with them and just become another household expense?
Also not having kids is a valid choice. Doesn’t need to come down to monetary/time reasons. I like sleeping, money and peace too much for kids lol
So basically Australia’s overall birth rate hasn’t changed. People that were going to have a baby just brought it forward during the pandemic.
I’m one and done solely for financial reasons. It’s incredibly depressing for us but it is what it is and I hope one day I can accept it and not regret it.
Until those in charge properly understand the problem, we will only ever see bad solutions
Yeah between rent and rising cost of...everything! I can barely support myself let alone a child. They must be having a laugh if they think we deserve to live in abject poverty to have kids running away. Kids who will most likely go without.
Australia is in a deep per capita recession. 

Government is just lying via mass immigration.
Everything is expensive and rediculous.
Aussie expat here looking to move back to aus but taking a look at the cost of living there, in particular housing, it makes complete sense
Of course Geelong was an outlier. There’s fuck all to do there except fuck.
How much is an apartment and can one person afford it? This is important because of one in the relationship should get injured or sick and unable to work, will the income be able to meet needs?

Funny how conservatives talk about fiscal responsibility yet do nothing to fix the crisis that most people can't be fiscally responsible when 40/hrs a week barley makes ends regardless of what they sacrifice. The western dream..... It's called the dream because you have to be asleep to believe it.
Might be something to do with the 6% mortgage rates and absurd  cost of living...
Life is too expensive .many people can not and maybe will never be able to buy a house . What would be the point to bring a kid to this world ?
WHAT DID THE SUITS THINK WOULD HAPPEN??! They’ll just import more people. It’ll be fine. They’ll get their all important “GROWTH”
What’s the point when you give birth to them only to send them off to childcare when they are a few months old and then go back to work only to earn enough to cover the cost if childcare…
Not to mention the actual cost for some people to actually get pregnant.
Family of mine went through several rounds of IVF, only after the 5th or 6th rounds the docs got them to do some genetic testing. 
Turns out there is a genetic incompatibility between the couple so several thousand essentially wasted while they now explore other treatments, which also costs thousands.
There's also a growing number of people in their 20s and 30s that just don't really want kids , economy aside it's a growing trend. Career and lifestyle, kids are a massive sacrifice.
Maybe part of the reason lies with society now accepting different lifestyles. Like previous generations felt that it was almost mandatory to get married immediately and pop out a couple of kids by the time they were 30. Now people have a choice and many are choosing to say no f...ing way I'm having kids.
Climate denial should be a crime with the penalty of losing all of you and your families assets.
Insert "oh no...well anyway" meme.   
  
Expect the baby recession to continue until housing / renting is fixed. My best mate lives in Sydney and earns $220k and they are still in the same strategy of saving up for a deposit. Yes their borrowing power is $1.5M plus but who in the world would take that kind of loan with that kind of repayment. He was chatting to me about his plans and how, despite the salary, it's impractical to have children while renting because of how shitty tenancy laws are in AU.
While the current cost of living "crisis" has something to do with it, it's a worldwide trend and has a lot to do with how we've changed as well. Women for instance, can work or perhaps have to work and having a kid has a very negative effect on their overall earnings. It's the SAHM's that are about to have the dozen kids per family that was the post war baby boom. Since our economy and standard of living is now tuned to dual income households, hardly anyone could afford to have that many kids. Our standard of care for children has also gone up remarkably. Gone are the days where kids under 10 can walk around without some busy body calling the cops. All of these "musts" have to be paid for and hence people are disincentivized to have kids. Many women are also not interested anymore or under the same pressure. Birth control has given women the freedom. 


So if we want to reverse this trend, we need to address the cost and our attitude as a society. 


No doubt most will soapbox solely on the cost of living when the trend has been happening way before this current situation. Many will accuse boomers of cognitive dissonance too.
Can't afford a 3bdr to have a 2nd kid. Can't afford a 2bdr to renovate to a 3bdr either. So what do you want us to do? Stop catering to the boomers.
The elephant in the room. We might have good swimmers in the pool but in our nuts, not so much ... and stop blaming women for the low fertility rate, it takes two to tango.

(Big thanks to micro-plastics for this. Clap.Clap.Clap...)

The YouTube video below is well worth watching.

# RSNSW Clarke Memorial Lecture 2021

# The changing tide of human populations: an infertility trap

Summary: The world’s population has grown at a frighteningly fast pace since 1800 and is directly responsible for many of the environmental disasters that currently beset our species. Despite the ever-present evidence of overpopulation, the world has witnessed an extremely steep decline in fertility rates that heralds the imminent collapse of population growth and a new era of depopulation. This universal decline in fertility is being driven by increasing prosperity, largely through the mediation of social factors, the most powerful of which are the education of women and an accompanying shift in life’s purpose away from procreation. 

**In addition, it is clear that environmental and lifestyle factors are also having a profound impact on our reproductive competence, particularly in the male, where increasing prosperity is associated with a significant rise in the incidence of testicular cancer and a secular decline in semen quality and testosterone levels.** 

On a different timescale, we should also recognize that increased prosperity greatly reduces the selection pressure on high fertility genes by lowering the rates of infant and childhood mortality. The retention of poor fertility genes within the human population is also being exacerbated by the increased uptake of ART. It is arguable that all of these elements are colluding to drive our species into an infertility trap. If we are to avoid the latter, it will be important to recognise the factors contributing to this phenomenon and adopt the social, political, environmental, and lifestyle changes needed to bring this situation under control.

Having less children is good for climate change. Australia lead the way!
Good. Humans need to stop breeding and polluting this planet.
Hah! I made that choice 20 years ago and I don't regret it for a single fucking minute. Every day society validates my choice. Granted it was partly due to the risk any child I fathered would be playing russian roulette with half the chambers full of horrible genetic disorders that I carry in my fucked up genome, but it wasn't just that.
Sure. I have two kids, I'd love, love a 3rd, I love being a Mum and ive always wanted 3 kids, but there's absolutely no fucking way my partner and I could afford it, we're barely keeping our heads above the water money-wise and I'm basically breaking even with the amount I earn, and the cost of childcare I have to pay in order to go to work. 

Food, mortgage, bills, we have ZERO savings, I feel like we finally somehow get ahead and put some money aside, then we're hit with another interest rate rise, or insane amenities bill, and any savings we could have used towards supporting another baby is gone in one fell swoop.

Shit is too expensive, that's all it boils down to, really.
I mean nature wants us to slow down, who are we to argue with mother nature?
Can't afford it.

Should we just have one an hope for the best because that's what it's starting to feel like lol
If a pandemic birth boom happened how about a 4 day workweek? Like a work-life balance so that people feel inclined to make...life?
Well fucken make shit cheaper.
Inb4 Australia's brain drain
Fantastic news on this front: The fertility rate in all G20 countries is now at or below the replacement rate, with only Saudi Arabia and South Africa meeting replacement! This is clearly not a sign that the average person is struggling in most aspects of their lives, and should not be a wake up call to every single government out there. 

/S
Hope we never have to goto war. Those that are born have nothing to fight for.
Maybe government should lower house prices
yeah, but housing is going up, so all is good
I know two couples in my extended generational friend group with kids that they solely support. Two. And a cousin. Everyone else either doesn’t want them and/or are renting and life is tight as hell already.
congratulations boomers
Because its fucking expensive to live in Australia
It's ironic that the next post on my feed is one about Australians struggling to make end meat.
This is a global crises which requires those in position of power both in government and corporation to place fundamental value in everything bar profits...
You can barely afford living on your own, everything costs over the roof, and buying a home is beyond impossible as a breadwinner even doctors. What the hell were they expecting?
We live in a country that knows it can be great but the powers that be, who will never feel the struggles of the average person, are detached from reality. They already have theirs, landlords already have theirs, a good portion of boomers have theirs, and the people with the money to sway the shape of our country have theirs. I turned 30 recently and feel like I have nothing to show for it, by comparison, my dad was already a homeowner with 3 kids whilst my mum was able to stay home and raise me and my siblings.
It doesn’t take a genius to realize that if you make it very difficult to live, and where religion is on the decline, people will not want to have kids.

Ultimately they don’t give a shit, not just Australia but the theme is global. Extract all the wealth and pull up the ladder.
As shitty as lockdowns were, the social support that swept in, made aspects of life seem hopeful again. Ironically, the economy tanking increased our standard of living.
Time for another war
Just pay us more and let’s move on already. The rich are rich enough.
Worst part is it won’t even effect them. The millennials and Gen Z are the ones that will get shafted. You can bet our pension is going to get effected the population decrease. But they’ll be gone by then.
Of all the things to be unaffordable and make unimaginable wealth off of, it had to be the right to shelter.
I work in healthcare and it is having a significant impact on staffing. Company wants to hire people at market rates, but what do you know, turns out nobody can afford to live nearby at market rates. If we want to hire people above market, then we have to stop bulk billing. So they hire fresh grads who live an hour and a half away who gain experience then quit a few months later because they can't do the commute any more. 

So if you're wondering why bulk billing is disappearing, the answer is also "fucking landlords."
Housing is just what you can see most clearly.


It goes deeper. Rent-seeking/scalping behaviour is the root cause. Corporate raiding is celebrated now as opposed to being seen as a gross perversion of capitalism's aims a mere decade or two ago. Once reliable goods and services falling apart at the seams stems from the same economic mindset. Childcare is starting to become quite an obvious example.
Yet 'unaffordable housing prices' are supposed to be an indicator of a 'strong economy' ?

... and, NO, I can't work it out, EITHER.
[this is literally true](https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-housing-theory-of-everything/)
Take it from teachers, parents that are around are utterly fucking exhausted as it is let alone having more kids.
And stupidly expensive daycare!!! My daughter goes 2 days a week and I’m out $164 per week. Private school is cheaper than fucking daycare.
Seems to be a trend in a lot of developed countries. Always the same reason. We don’t have enough money. Our buying power has been decimated. Always someone complaining about the same thing (immigrants, housing costs, food costs, etc) and not all the little losses the common people have suffered and continue to suffer. Death by 1000 cuts. How long until we all realize this is a global trend and that it needs to change? How long after that until something is done?
It's amazing how this has become a global issue and none wants to fix it in any country
Heck yes and gap widens
And sows the seeds of its own destruction. How much money will the last human on the planet pay the second last human for their house when they are ready to move into a nursing home?
The news can grab a load of this comment right here. The govt screws us and they better fix the cost of living, rent, immigration.
and childcare costs r crazzyyyyy
not every. billionaires doing quite well.
So long as papa and nana be slurping them margies on cruise, it be all worthwhile! I gladly continue to be fleeced for their continued amusement :)
*clutching at pearls* but but we had 17% interest rates
But but 18% interest rates and no furniture or curtains and had to eat cereal for dinner


 (Not even cereal is affordable now)
No one is surprised that younger generations can't afford to have kids. This was the design all along. It is far far cheaper to import fully developed adults than it is to grow them from infants and educate them here.
It's the politicians we need to blame. Each generation plays the game with the rules they're given and it's the government who sets those rules.

The fact that endorsement, kick-backs and lowest tender offers help shape their policy making is bullshit.
I think some of us also realize that kids aren’t a natural progression of life or a measure of adulthood.

The financial thing has given people time to pause and think instead of just going through the motions.

Kids are an essential part of life for SOME people. Not all.

Societies push kids because they need future generations of workers. They just sell it as “oh it’s so fulfilling and gives life meaning and everyone should do it unless they absolutely can’t!” but that’s not the actual agenda.

We’re starting to realize that.

We don’t owe the world any additional people. Raising kids *well* is something that *few* parents actually do.

Many of us can live our best lives and contributing to the planet *without* having children.
[deleted]
Elder millennials are like 40 now and lots have school age kids already - what’s going to be super interesting is seeing how many of Gen Z have kids…
The problem is also that people who cannot afford kids still have them, they just happen to be the least educated and least capable, it's a lose lose situation
Or just too ignorant to agree with what the data says. 

I have said stuff to my boomer parents and their response is often “that can’t be right”.
Heads in the sand.
I completely empathise with your feelings. My wife and I put off having children for a long time until very recent.

Even though I can follow the resentment, I think that not understanding their point of view is extremely divisive shutting down the dialogue, making it "them vs us".

A while ago, I read a paper about the psychological playground boomers have gone through, where they basically grew in an environment where their parents told them the scary boogieman was about to come under them, destroying everything they ever worked for, but instead they found an environment in which they could blindly trust everything because there was little chance to get things wrong.

Our generation is not like that, because our parents/grand parents thought everything in life is easy, because that's what their experience was, and we clashed with their reality, thinking we would be able to achieve something comparable to them, but realising early on the system was set up by them, to benefit them.

This is discussed in detailed in "The Pitch - how baby boomers took their children's future and why they should give it back."

I would highlight recommend to anyone trying to do a change, to build themselves with facts from books and articles to have the dialogue with some of the older generation, because it is possible to get them to understand (not so much empathise).
I mean since the 70s so I guess there was a worse birth recession then which is when boomers were having kids?
Overseas investors from all over the world, too. And the stupid negative gearing that turn housing into investment instead of human rights.
I can barely afford the cost of looking after my cat.
The dream is no longer to have a baby but to become some boomer lady's (sugar)  baby.
My kids childcare centre just jacked their prices up by $35 per day when the tax year rolled over, gave us 1 week notice about it too.... 

I guess they were prepared for the new tax cuts kicking in.

Looking to work a 4 x 9.5 hour week instead and cutting down a care day. It's expensive.
> The powers that be want people popping out sprogs

No they don't. Kids are expensive for the government too. Us not having kids is what they really want. Adult immigrants are far cheaper and they are ready to work as soon as they appear. Kids take at least 15 years from birth until they can start to be enslaved.
Normally you could have expected a reset / market adjustment (aka crash) when the boomers start dying and the market is flooded by their kids cashing in - but the corporates have figured out it’s tax advantageous to park your profit in property and that’s going to stop the crash from happening.
> Nobody gave us a hand out

[David Pope on this](https://x.com/davpope/status/466721265957756928).
I hate it whenever one of them brings up the whole 17% interest rate thing.

Yes. Interest was much higher, but you were paying it on a relative McChicken. 

Also, your savings gained interest at the same rate so just gtfo
I can agree partial on immigration. Country needs quality and skilled working people but opening floodgate to every other joe and and inviting muhammad and 17 children who cheated system and claimed refugee is just too much
The fact that women entering the workforce meant everyone had to work full time to get by rather than everyone only having to work half as much is a huge contributor. I don’t want to have to send a child off to be raised by daycare but I can’t afford to stop working.
Yep, you don't need to educate it for 13 years either at taxpayer expense.

Ready made workforce.
Everyone eventually grows tired of their slave masters
Righttards complaining about white replacement theory when, in reality it's just wage theft and exploitation by the rich.
This certainly seems to be the way things are going.
Plus they make a very convenient scapegoat to deflect people’s rage and bitterness onto. Don’t blame the government for the economy and housing crisis, blame the brown people (but shh don’t ask why they’re here and who brought them).
That's the plot of the documentary 3%, on Netflix.
Anyone else think its weird that we're calling it a 'baby recession', like babies are an economic metric? Just seems messed up hey.
[deleted]
That tax bill sounds really annoying. Sorry to hear.
I wonder if accrued interest is counted as income when applying for a mortgage? HA.
Tax on income on taxed money.

Brilliant right.

Except my tax bill was closer to 5k.

You can put money in your FHSS to offset the interest amount and avoid a tax bill for next year.
Yeah when I was married my partner and I considered a third but the cost would have been too much 
You know its a funny thing, but the one thing that turned me away from organised religion was when I realised all the church subsidised workers were having flocks of 3-5 kids each and they just asked the congregation to be more generous.


Im not just talking the classic pastors kids. We had missionaries we supported, people studying theology on the church dime and coming back from interstate with 3 new kids before graduation.


Meanwhile the people they minister to were on minimum wage and barely getting by. So tone deaf. They asked these people to sacrifice their precious time to help lessen the load by cooking, doing childcare days, etc.
Im in the same boat as you. I'd love a third kid. But we can't afford it. Nor do we have a village nearby. Our only reprieve is daycare 2 days a week, and that in itself is so expensive.
reminds of this story I heard on a podcast talking about how disconnect some are.

older boomer: *its sad, this was a great neighbourhood to raise kids, but we don't see many kids about theses days.* 

younger person: *oh, why do think you don't see many kids about*

older boomer: *oh young family's can't afford to live around here*

Pleasantly surprising to see a response addressing the impossible delusion of [growth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=O133ppiVnWY) not just above water but way up here.
Moving to a country with a declining population sounds like a great way to set up for the future. I hate crowds, play on
Oh you didn’t apply when you were 10 minutes pregnant? What a shame. 

Seriously though, good luck hope you find something.
I was made redundant and also hospitalised for Hyperemesis weeks 17-34 of my pregnancy. I don’t “qualify” for any government support and so am trying to find daycare for my two month old and a job for myself. It’s hell out here.
Have you applied for any places? We applied before ours was even born. If not, do it ASAP... Apply for multiple places.
They are also living with micro plastics and pfas, pfoas, etc in their blood, brains, organs, ya know. They'll likely have cancer before they hit 30.

We're going to fix climate change. But it'll be the generation in 100 years that feels the fix. The rest of us need to ride it out

An economy based on endless growth is unsustainable
It is weird, as someone nearly half a century old, to see everyone smoothly segue from freaking out about overpopulation to freaking out about a declining population.
Aging population needs a younger population to support them.
Childcare subsidies mean fees are 85% rebated for most.
Not to mention, all family and friends typically have to work themselves so there’s no free time for anyone to volunteer to help out sadly.
I'm so sorry for your loss.
World is a fuck, 47619 3916 babies as roommates
I think if you're happy about it you are childfree if you are sad about it you are childless.
I enquired about before and after school care. It's 50 dollars an hour.

I'm 40. Currently have 1 child who's 2. Just got made redundant and was considering a second when the cost of living turned into shit. I don't think we can afford 2 kids on a single income, with rent and electricity prices went up 20%.

Shrinkflation and price of everything has gone through the roof. When a box of oats is 7 dollars and a bag of chips is 5 dollars, i know I will buy the oats. We are cutting back on going out and use the car less cos petrol is expensive. 

Our economy is so screwed.
I find life depressing. Study for 15 years to be able to work for 40+ and still not being able to pay for a house. Why would I have a kid to go through the same rat race
Women now have far higher rates of employment and education and contraception is also more readily available...
The difference is we now have a highly educated population who is still being crippled by the cost of living crisis
[deleted]
It's everything.

https://aifs.gov.au/research/facts-and-figures/births-australia-2023

But the biggest reason from the biggest drop was choice of the women, the article here even states it was the introduction of the contraceptive pill + stagflation that caused the big drop from 3+ to barely 2. 

Then you can see the baby bonus impact in that graph that helped push it and the natural decay despite the global recession did its thing.

> Poverty has never seemed to stop people from popping out babies.

Not sure where you got that from. Economic downturn has pretty much always lowered the birth rate. In every civilisation throughout history birth rates have almost always dropped off during times of hardship relative to a period of prosperity in the same civilisation.
People want to maintain a standard of living and no be poorer than they already are.
This
I can imagine the boomers sitting in their million dollar homes wondering why on earth their kids who can barely pay rent aren’t having kids.
There's no middle class, never was.

The contradictions inherent to a system of owner class vs working class are tightening, that's all.
If you own a house it’s good I suppose
Alongside education, health care, water. It isn't just the petroleum companies fighting against the shift to solar and wind, and battery storage, it's Australia's hot water and electricity companies.
To make the most money you exploit the needs of the people.. not the wants. Capitalizing on anything and everything is legal, apparently. It’s a disgusting system. One that creates the biggest addicts in the world and allows them to make all the decisions.
A lot of questions get asked on why banh mi is so cheap. The real question needs to be why other lunches are so expensive; the answer is that most of them don't own the property the shop operates from. Landlord levy on your lunch.
You could argue that if no-one is willing/able to work for you at a given rate then that cannot honestly be the market rate. It may be what the employers think the rate should be and what it is elsewhere - but surely by definition the market rate is the rate you have to pay to reliably fill vacancies from the market.
It’s so frustrating to watch. I think everyone needs to start writing to their MP. We can’t lose Medicare. 

I can’t believe they are not raising the Medicare rebate enough to keep up with inflation. 

I had this exact same conversation with a nurse a few months ago. People can’t move to take on essential work because of the fricken cost of housing.
The market rates are rigged, always have been.
I work in ECEC. We are severely underpaid and therefore no one wants to work in the profession. But people with children need to work, which means they need us. Hell, we were considered "essential" during COVID, right lol I am unlikely to be affected by a dropping birth rate, but I am not surprised that less people are having children. No one can afford to live with the rising costs of rent and utilities, let alone adding childcare to that as well. My advice to everyone atm is "don't have children, they are expensive and teenagers suck". (I have one left at home, the youngest of 4)
> Rent-seeking/scalping behaviour is the root cause

But isn't that because of lack of housing?
And yet still confident in the market enough to take a loan anyway
Oh my god, I love my dad (and he's not technically a Boomer, I think he's right on the line? He's about to turn 60) but if I have to hear that line about 17% interest rates one more time I'm going to scream. To act like buying a house in the mid-80s is comparable to today is an absolute joke.
My Dad says this to me all the time, and yet still bought a WHOLE 4 bedroom house with a backyard, front yard, enough space for a granny flat, 3 bathrooms, two lounge rooms.  Meanwhile I have to look at one bedroom apartments.
Failing to understand 17% of fuck all is fuck all. My father paid something insulting like $80,000 for his first house, which was a shithole on a massive, central block of land. The thing needed major renovations and after a few decades he sold it for nearly a million dollars. Oh, but he paid 18% interest on it and I only pay 6% or whatever on mine. Nevermind that I paid more than 6× the price of his house for mine. It's so out of touch it's not even funny
No they will say they were battlers
This is true, on a house worth 4 X annual income.
As they say about student loans: they accepted the terms and have no right to complain.

Edit: I should note, I fucking hate this argument. I'm highlighting how the narrative twists to suit them.
On $12.50
>17% interest rates


For about a year. 
Urgh I got into that with my father.in law last week. Could not see the difference.
And the usual pull-up of your boot straps mantra
I'd rather have 17% interest rates on a $100K house than 5% on a $1.2 million one. Boomers don't get that. Interest rates are historically low because the economy will collapse otherwise. Until house prices go down we will never see 17% rates again.
They forget how percentages work
With 17% interest rates in the 80’s. A person with an average income could buy an average home for 30% of their weekly pay.  

Today, a person on an average income, can buy an average home for just 140% of their weekly income.  

Do you see the problem here ? I’d take 17% interest rates any day over what we have now
That was more Gen X than the Boomers. It was real and devastating, but you had to be unlucky: having just bought a home and so having the 17% on the near-full amount of the house's price.  If you were unlucky it took a decade before your head was above water and the house could be sold for what you put into it.


Some people copped it particularly badly. If you were female than the deposit required was double that needed by a male. Around 20% of the house price. Home loans for young single women had only just become available, so there was a rush of Gen X and late Boomer women, paying big deposits, and then the high rates.  (So comments like "Why ddi they enter the market?" are particularly unfair, some women had been saving for twenty years for this opportunity.)



Is it as bad as now?  Now is clearly worse, as so much of the problem is driven by the profit-taking by states and developers  on new housing stock. Whereas that era still had government property at the bottom of the market tethering prices.
Here's a resource I always use against boomers: 

[https://mccrindle.com.au/app/uploads/images/Abelson\_9\_04.pdf](https://mccrindle.com.au/app/uploads/images/Abelson_9_04.pdf) - page 8 (table 1). 

Taking Melbourne as an example, median house prices in 1985 is $75,200 and in 1990 is $131,000. feel free use those numbers and quote them against boomers' "WAAAHHH 17% INTEREST".
🤣🤣🤣
Anyone done the math of what would look like for the lifetime of a loan? 

I got a quote for a $400,000 loan paid back over 30 (entry level properties in my area still go for more than this) on the commbank app recently and the forecast interest alone was $500,000 lmfao
Love that one. 17% of sweet fuck all.
Which would have been the greatest period of time ever for those trying to build a deposit in a high interest savings account for property
Many are too proud to admit the advantages of their time and be honest at risk of their ego being told they had it easier in many ways. Yes things were tough in other ways but let be real here. Yes interest rates were higher but simple maths tells us a higher percentage of a lower amount can still be less than a lower percentage of a higher amount. Not to mention many could have bought the house outright on a few years of an average salary whereas now it's an insurmountable mountain without help, given how much modern day coats eat into our income as well
This is wild to me...I'm a Canadian and sometimes randomly visit other English language subs.

It's the exact same thing here!
I nearly died when I saw a box of Special K for $10. 
Ten dollars to eat cardboard tasting flakes! Cereal is unaffordable, but wheat and grain prices haven’t moved much since the 1970’s
Every time they say that no furniture or curtains or cereal for dinner I smell a fat log of bullshit.
Ok, devil's advocate, in the 70s, 80s, and 90s my parents had old furniture from the 50s that they mostly got for free. My mum says she wants to get rid of some of her furniture and she can't even give it away. We never ate out when I was a child, holidays were car trips to grandma's and my mum made most of my clothes, or actually she made them for my sister and they were passed down to me. They are right that they lived more frugally than we do....

But...

You could do all of these things and still not be able to save for a deposit. Not only can you not save, but prices are going up so quickly that you can't save at the right speed. Even with inflation, you need over 8 times the amount that someone born in 1950 needed to buy their first property.

So that's why you're not getting grandchildren. Hope you like cats.

"No one" is a major stretch. most of them don't think deeply enough about this to see the obvious and predictable result
It's one of those "unintended consequences" that various people use as an excuse not to change the status quo of the economy. Funny how it didn't stop Howard (who kept campaigning on being the "better economic manager") from putting in the CGT discount [that kicked off this mess](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/QAUR628BIS) in late 1999.
Not to mention that immigrants make a very convenient scapegoat to deflect people’s rage and bitterness onto. Don’t blame the government for the economy and housing crisis, blame the brown people (but shh don’t ask why they’re here or who brought them).
not to mention parents leaving the workforce to raise children makes the gdp line go down
Yeah, but they don't want those foreigners either.

People vote in politicians and politicians act in the interests of their constituents.
Your first sentence is correct, the rest isn’t. Their short terms mean that they’re always seeking re-election, not implementing sometimes unpopular policies for the long term good of the nation and the opposition would scare the electorate and they’d never get voted back in. I mean, bill shorten went to an election stating that he’d get rid of negative gearing (an entirely justified sensible policy that axes a non productive tax concession). He was against SCOTT FUCKING MORRISON, and lost. In the game of life, always back self interest. People are selfish and they’ll vote accordingly. Give a government 6 years instead of three and you’ll get better, more meaningful policy - not repeat sugar hits….
Coupled with huge leaps in technology, it feels like our labour has been significantly devalued from the start. We don't really know a world that had fewer people, less competition, less congestion and a very different playbook

doubtful, they're going to spend it on themselves* before their kids have a chance to inherit their money.

*at the very least care home costs. Also https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/1dzj06u/wealthy_aussie_boomer_couple_branded_evil_over/
The boomers are living so long that their kids' inheritances are being sucked up by end of life care.
  
>Normally you could have expected a reset / market adjustment (aka crash) when boomer start dying 

There is always another boomer that can buy two houses to make up for it, or slightly younger boomer/Gen X that can take advantage to buy. So this isn't really a thing. 

An economic collapse causing a real estate crash, wouldn't help either. If you look at countries like Japan and even the US during the GFC, which had market adjustments and crashes. It hasn't resulted in the younger generation increasing home ownership. In fact in Japan, young home ownership has pretty much halved despite the real estate still not having recovered from a crash that occurred over 30 years ago. This is because generally the economic conditions required to cause a crash will disproportionately negatively impact the younger generations than older generations to a point that they arrn't be able to benefit from the reduced real estate prices anyway.   
  
The issue of young people not owning a home runs deeper than just simply 'houses are expensive they should crash so young people can afford them', what needs to be done is housing prices plateau. Which would be done by the government providing less incentives for investments. This will allow the younger generation to catch up when their wages increase.
the only hope is social changes leads to all the tax advantageous to parking money in property being removed along with a increase in public housing.
Didn’t Joe Hockey receive a free higher education and then went on to introduce HECS. As soon as they’re done with a handout they want it stopped. Ladder pulling at its finest.
I'm not blaming women entering the workforce specifically. We doubled the workforce and so productivity and greatly increased consumer potential. The large increase in the workforce probably made workers weaker in negotiating higher wages and we failed to strengthen unions to compensate. We've even weakened unions over the decades. Labor has weakened and become more liberal.
It would have been fine if a similar number of men stayed at home in response. It’s just that in the beginning, there was a strong financial benefit in having two adults working outside the home. As more people catch on and start doing it, the benefit diminishes more and more. Much like college imo.
Step out of line and we'll deport you. So they're compliant as well!
Pretty much everything else is imported, may as well start importing taxpayers, too.
This is what the anti immigration crowd doesn’t understand. Gov claims we need more people (to prop up the tax base) they could easily pay a baby bonus of 20k right now but still won’t have worthy tax payers for 20 years. Pretty sure that’s why their pumping in new people

>We're going to fix climate change.

That is laughable. We are not.
We can't fix climate change, we've already gone well over the point of no return. We can now only reduce the damages that are inevitable. We might be able to start removing CO2 from the atmosphere in the future, but we cannot undo permanent damage done to ecosystems.

> It's 50 dollars an hour.

And there is one staff member per 5 kids, getting barely $30/hour in wages.
As an employed, educated woman who also used contraceptives in her time - none of those things stopped me from having kids.  But what stopped me from having more kids was the lack of support.  Uneducated and unemployed people tend to have more time and more community to support kids.  But then you're creating more uneducated and unemployed because that passes down through generations.  You can have both.  You can have educated and employed women AND more children but what's missing is the community.  Better access to childcare, open schools half an hour earlier, make sure housing is affordable, education is high quality - as parents we want the best for our kids, not the worst.  If all those things happen the birth rate will increase, and the quality of people will too.
I think the point of increased cultural acceptance is often overlooked. Sweden (I think) has some generous support programs and incentives for people to have children. It’s slowed the decline, but still declining. Plenty of people like me where if I had every financial worry removed, I’d still not have children.
LoL.. I don't, it's fucked

We are at the sharp edge of a big event for things to continue the way to maintain social cohesion if basics are ignored and we have worse ahead if we knee jerk further to the right
That. Is. Sobering.

Yep. Retail rents vs owning freeholds would be a world of difference in ability to be competitive. Retail property being rentals exposes them to the same issues as the rest of the economy. The only thing that has held ground in the last 20 odd years is wages which have consistently been below other inflation. It is simply not sustainable.

And could pay it back on one man’s income while his wife pumped out a kid every other year.
Just ask him 17% of what? When my dad says it I always say Ill give you 17 percent of what's in my wallet and you give me 4 percent of what's in you superannuation account.
Next time he does it show him how much his repayment are using an online calculator and ask home much the household income was
My dad is exactly like this too. Also seems to conveniently forget that he got a leg up from his parents, as well.
I had this exact conversation with my dad on the weekend we're trying to buy our first "home". Dad bought his first home (3 bedroom house near the beach) for $40,000. In 1985. The two bedroom unit across the road marketed at "first home buyers" just sold for $920,000. 

I don't know the exact conversion. But 40k then would be around 200k now and that won't buy me half a studio.
Yes. But did you know they had 17% interest rates?! /S
I earn more now than my parents income combined. I'm nowhere near able to afford a 3 bedroom house like they were able to.
I can give you a pretty good argument to make him think twice about his views.

 Im in my mid 40's we bought our 1st house at 21 years of age. Back then we paid $126,000. I cant remember the weekly repayments, but l can tell you that l just had my 1st child, received free tuition to become a nurse, my husband was a 2nd year apprentice, and l was a stay at home Mum for 10 years whilst raising 4 kids. We budgeted, but it was definitely doable. 

Earlier this year, we purchased an investment property.  Same type/size house in the same suburb. 3 bedroom, 1 bathroom weatherboard house in the far east suburb of Melbourne. So basically the sticks. It cost us $800,000, the average price for our area. Our weekly minimum repayments are $1,325!!! 

How can anyone afford to pay weekly repayments of $1,325 for a 3 bedroom weatherboard house? I dont know how many young people earn that much per week and still have enough to pay for anything else. And they most likely have a hecs debt to pay off, something l didnt have or older generations. It's insane and that is why we bought another house, so our now young adult kids can live somewhere independently and pay minimum rent. We charge them $150 each per week, but we still cover the remainder, which is $725 per week. It's seriously crazy.
59 is the cut off for Gen X and yeah there’s an interesting overlap in elder Gen X and younger Boomers when it comes to values and cultural expectations…
My favourite one is neither of my parents finished high school. I got a masters degree and they blame my student loans.
I’ve said before that the deposit for my first apartment was larger than what my parents paid for their first *house*, which was in a nicer suburb. I certainly don’t earn that much more than they did. I can’t imagine what it will look like for kids of the future.
He paid 18% interest for a couple of years at most, too.
That interest rate gets quoted a lot , it lasted for about 3 years then came down fairly drastically
The 17% often quoted was for about 6-12 months before it came back down too.  
Variable rates were 10% by 1995.
Well we didn’t go on fancy holidays or do fun things

My brothers in Christ im 29 and have never left Perth or really done anything fun that’s not free, cheap, or saved up for months for either? Why do they think that’s some major difference between their generation and ours
John Howard is that you?
Yep. Now a house is at least x12 the annual income

The in boomer age the banks would only look at one income now you need both

At 17 percent at 80k borrowed your repayments would be $1151 a month over 25 years 

At 6 percent with 600k borrowed your repayments is $3600 a month over 30 years
That debate is so fucking dumb and selfish, I don’t have a student loan but I know how shit debt is, id be perfectly fine with the government writing everyone’s off, itll do more for the country then a tax concession to Gina fucking Rinehart.
Except student loans are the only massive loan you seem to be able to get as a minor where it’s entirely on you to know the ramifications. Usually other loans have a clear PDS or something like that with payment, interest, etc. laid out (instead of having to find this info yourself) 

I don’t regret my hecs loan, but it definitely is not explained anywhere near as well as it should be. This became particularly apparently when private education institutions were rorting the VET FEE-HELP program.
When the promise is a well paid job you assume you can pay it off, only the jobs are increasingly less well paid. And of course the boomers got their education for free....
Here is some math for you

So say you borrow $600k and your interest rates are a low 6% your loan is for 30 years your repayment would need to be $3598 a month

For boomer loan let’s say you borrow $120k your interest rates are 17% your monthly repayment would need to $1766 for a 25 year loan
17% doing simple interest on a 120k loan is $20.k pa in interest alone

6% on 500k loan is $30k in interest alone
That $10 box of cereal has enough cereal in it for 3 breakfasts.
500 million profit and no tax paid! Think about that when you swallow Special K. Lets not forget the other tax free cult that pays no tax. No politician will even dare to mention their name they are so powerful. This is while Aussies feed them rich and get nothing back! Why would they help ordinary Australians!
My parents always spouted the “we sacrificed, we didn’t go out for coffees and toast” but every photo of them had a cigarette in their hands. It’s like yeh, we changed our vices… and? 

Meanwhile they got their first home (which costs less than what I would need for a deposit) on a 110% loan and have purchased their 5 other properties through equity and they’re worth millions now.
The big one was blasting about having to use wood cable spools as furniture until they could afford a real table. Now a cheap import table set is cheaper than a used cable spool
I ate furniture for dinner :(
Damn.  I never thought of it that way
I know its evil but... that is beneficial
Only one half of that sentence is factual.
Hopefully your landlord approves your plants
You can't 3D print a person. A clone still has to be born and grow from infancy...
At that point you end up with the fictional “enhanced humanity movement” where people are grown in cars and tweaked beyond recognition to fulfill specific roles which sounds an awful lot like eugenics which IMO is highly unethical

no HECS has been thing since before Hockey got into parliment, however he was in the generation that was the last to recieve free uni
HECS was Hawke/Keating

Women have always worked unless they were middle or upper class. All that's changed is that women can get more jobs than they used to, and that they're expected to keep working after marriage and/or children. 

Used to be the bulk of women were either teachers or domestic servants of some kind, but they worked. Shit, even middle class women would work to support their husband's business, if applicable. But half the population didn't sit back and do nothing but pop out babies.
Mmm, delicious wage suppression.
Exactly. It's not the foreigners offshoring the jobs or suppressing wages. It's the people running the corporations, the billionaire funded neoliberal think tanks, the conservative politicians, and the right wing press.


Migrants, foreigners, people who need social welfare, people who are otherwise different or disadvantaged; the people who don't really have that much power, are the scapegoats. 


Don't pay attention to the man behind the curtain. 
Foreigners are always an easy target
There are more of us then there are of them
>Or just the apocalypse, which is inevitable at this point

Alright fellas, what are we thinking.. Nuclear destruction? AI singularity? Maybe a couple of huge CME events? Probably throw in some catastrophic natural disasters for good measure too.
I fear the status quo will remain for decades
Sending you love. ♥
Well said and thanks for sharing.
No, you buy cold water and then buy something to heat it with like an electric system. You then buy electricity to heat the water. You pay three times to run that hot tap.
And companies didn’t do mass lay offs at every bump in the economy.
And a door to door person selling video tape players could get a mortgage.
To be fair, the actual number isn't really the thing that is at issue, the problem really is the ratio that wages/income have grown compared to the expense of things (like houses).  
In the 70's, a house in Sydney would have set you back about 6 years income, these days, you are looking in excess of 16 years.  
If houses were still at an average price of 6 years income, you'd be looking at house prices around 360k, and while a higher interest rate would suck, it wouldn't be anywhere near as crippling as it actually is today.
>I always say Ill give you 17 percent of what's in my wallet and you give me 4 percent of what's in you superannuation account.

I think this needs to be our generations mantra
It was 17,% for less than a year and dropped fast over four years to about 8%
I always offer to buy their house price for the price it was worth when the rates were 17% plus I will pay them the 17% interest. Dead Serious. Strangely, no-one has taken me up on the offer.
I presume he also conveniently forgets that there are advantages to high interest rates too. If you haven't bought yet, you can take advantage of them to grow money fast. My wife's boomer family did that, then bought with cash.
My parents are the first to say young people waste their money and that they've had it worst. Meanwhile my dad had all his cars and servicing paid for by his dad, bailed out from bankruptcy (I believe more than once) by his dad, and now received a massive inheritence after never saving any money he earned himself. Although my dad did buy me a blu ray player once 👍
The Baby Boomer Generation – born 1946-1964. 

Generation X – born 1965-1979. 

Millennials – born 1980-1994. 

Generation Z – born 1995-2012

I an Xennial, nothing in common with Gen X but I’m pretty much a Millenial that got to see Top Gun and Return of the Jedi at the cinemas.
The deposit I have to save for a $400K apartment, *while using a home equity scheme*, is nearly twice as much as what my parents bought their first house for.

I have to save $150K, literally the same amount the bank will loan me. They bought for about $85K.
The other thing that isn’t mentioned is that interest rates were high because inflation and wage growth were also high. You could buy your house at 3x a single income and then after 5-10 years you’d be paid far more just on inflation increases alone. Meanwhile these days you have 6x two incomes with repayments that will still be a significant portion of your income after 10 years…
Cognitive dissonance
Probably the internet. Back then if someone went on a big holiday you only knew about it if you were close to them or bumped in to them at the shops afterwards. Now you see a lot of photos of big holidays, so they assume everyone’s doing it, and don’t realise they’re actually just made aware of it more often.
Also, to be entirely clear, they ABSOLUTELY went on holidays and did fun things. I'm a Gen Xer, and everyone I grew up around did family holidays every year, some expensive and fancy (theme parks, skiing, etc) and some cheap and repetitive (same cabin in the same caravan park for 20 years) but all happened. 

These boomers telling absolute lies about the lifestyle they could afford. And the fact that they spent so much on those things, leading to those things being so expensive that the next generations can't afford them.... 

It's just fuckin gross...
"We didn't go on holidays" but they'll shit on Millennials for buying coffee every day.
Also they definitely did go on holidays. My dad was a full-time teacher. Mum only *sometimes* worked. (When she did, it was only casual or part-time with very low hours).

Yet we went on multiple international trips, multiple interstate trips, and ate at restaurants.

And with that (mostly) teacher income, he could still afford a 3 bedroom, 2 living, etc. giant backyard of a home. Only a 20 Minute drive to the city.

Other friends, who had similar families (featuring one full time provider), had similar experiences. 

My friend on the other hand is a teacher *now*, and rents with friends in a small house. He can't afford that same lifestyle as my dad had.
Mr Sheen would never.
There only plan, that plan is to expand the student loan style government.  NDIS loan, aged care loan, Medicare loan, Newstart loan and on and on it will go. While they gave billions away to multinationals and the Gina's of the billionaire world.

The concept of community, sharing the cost burden over decades of investment is all gone for "handout millionaire  now'ism giving to the rich with no limits" Why do we need  government when all government has come to represent is  getting a job to rob ordinary taxpayers. They do this so that they can give our money away  while penalising us the taxpayers while we get nothing in return for contributing to the community fund that was suppose to build and invest in society. Politicians have just become repugnant thieves hiding behind of the moniker called "government" There is no public interest test anymore, its only the interests of the uber wealthy that matter in Australia these days.
There's also the coercive culture that if you don't get higher education you'll forever be doomed to minimum wage work. Because minimum wage doesn't afford a life anymore.

And there's educational inflation. A workplace ain't gonna train ya, you need to walk into an entry level job with a masters and are expected to hit the ground running.

My degree doesn't earn me the same life that my grandad had as a shopkeep.
Yep.

I'm a good example. I left high school to do trades. Learnt the business owners made the real money, businesses starting with capital borrowed from the parents. The rest of us did heavy, back breaking hours for fuck all.

If I complained, I was told "you should've gotten a degree."

So I got a degree. Stuck staring at a computer, and still hearing the same shit about "we don't have the money to pay you" in spite of telling shareholders they're making a killing. 

If I complain, I am told "you should've gotten into trades."
And the cardboard is thinner and less filling
Not when the recommended serving size is 40g 

Which is less then a single medium egg.
And your kids
Yeah.
It's impressive really, literally anything happens at any point in history and you can just blame the "immigrants"
A slow burn
Micro plastics have been found in every part of the human body + most plastic has a endocrine disruption quality so children of men.

Global insect collapse due to heat + insecticides use = global famine.

Wet bulb event in india/Pakistan/south America/ Asia = economic collapse.

Global Water crisis due to sea level rise and salinity

All roads lead to war and or nuclear holocaust.

Good times ahead.
And the world wasn't on fire
Of course!
But mostly cognitive absence.
Actually I think you’re spot on. People my age I work with definitely go overseas once or twice a year, and are at events and fun things most weekends, but they post it all over social media so in a vacuum it would seem like everyone their age is living like that

Thank god their parents could gift them a deposit so they could do all this and still own homes hey 🙃
Absolutely. I’m gen X and my boomer parents took all 3 kids on a holiday each year, often a cruise to the pacific islands. Dad worked for Aust Post and mum was a casual waitress.
Oh yeah. My Grandma has been ‘on tour’ virtually for the last 40 years (over half her life as she’s not even 80 yet), and my nanna and grandad both ‘retired’ when they were early 50s.

No none of them had/have a lot of money and they’re all in rentals and Homes West, and on pensions, but still, I would consider living a whole life barely working and traveling wherever you want is a pretty good tradeoff still. Meanwhile I have to work virtually 7 days a week just to keep the bills paid while they talk about how hard they had it
Yep, it's their parents who had the hard life of not going anywhere and living on meat and two veg.
Yep, spot on. You explained it way better than I did.

A lot of that generation looks back on those times and retcons how hard they had it. My mum and dad are old gen X but they at least acknowledge that they had a period through their 20s-30s-early40s where they had 4 kids, mostly 1 income (ceiling fixer), and went on holidays camping locally every 2 years, had motorbikes, a house with a pool, both parents smoked etc, modest compared to some but much greater than what I have now with 2 kids and 2 full time incomes
Yeah it’s depressing isn’t it. Even with a comparatively high income, I bring home less than 2x minimum wage earners due to tax + hecs repayments due to sitting right on the edge of a higher payment bracket. 

It’ll be worth it once it’s paid off but it really hampers your start out of uni. 


I don’t claim to know the fix (apart from lowering fees, maybe adjusting payment brackets?), but this doesn’t seem sustainable, and high Ed isn’t a guaranteed smart investment anymore.
My son earned his degree in economics and even though he enjoyed it, the people he worked with were abominable, nasty, selfish, shifty liars ... He got out and is in his third year as a diesel mechanic.. his employer gave up on hiring younger people, they were soft and entitled. My son is 33 and the youngest person working there, when he finishes his apprenticeship (paid for by his employer) he will be earning more than his job in the city. Tradespeople are now highly valued
> There's also the coercive culture that if you don't get higher education you'll forever be doomed to minimum wage work. Because minimum wage doesn't afford a life anymore.

That's a very American line of thinking I can not for the life of me say I've encountered here. Trades are something commonly promoted as a line of work even in school and receive a decent wage too, especially plumbers and electricians.
Dont worry you have cat and dog food as a backup.
Have you seen r/Europe? Probably second worst offender after r/canada_sub
I think we're already on our way!

And at this point, I would welcome an alien invasion. Maybe they will save us from ourselves.
with climate change we will likely still have enough water and farm land on the planet. The problem is that where that water and farm land exists will change from where people currently live which has always led to wars and collapse of nations in history.
Yup.

Wait until you hear about the dozens of inventors of clean energy devices who have either died or disappeared under mysterious circumstances. Their patents are hidden away and suppressed by governments through invention secrecy laws. [Here's a video on it, for anyone interested in learning more.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZRwlYtAMps)
And the lead, so so so much lead.
I went to school in a wealthy area (while not being wealthy myself and living elsewhere) and I can’t get past how luxurious their lives are. It’s mind blowing to me. There’s no way that they aren’t getting help from the bank of mum and dad. 

A girl I went to school with bought a house at 21, and still has enough cash left to spend months of the year at the ski resorts and go on multiple overseas holidays a year. 

Another spends several months of the year every year in Europe, eating out everyday and staying in fancy hotels. 

Others still go to Europe either annually or several times a year like clockwork. They also drive nice cars, wear designer clothes, and go out constantly. They get front row seats at big concerts. 

I just don’t have that kind of money. But I think those of us that don’t just aren’t posting as much, because whilst I definitely know many other people that can’t afford that lifestyle, my social media feeds are absolutely plastered with it. And I mean, good for them! They have money and enjoy it. But I wouldn’t call it remotely normal for my age group.
Jfc, jealous! Gen X here, and I never had a "holiday" in the sense you describe until I was an adult and in a position to pay for it myself. School breaks were spent sitting around in a baking hot house watching television or packed off to Grandma's in another city. At the time, the reason proffered for the massive disparity between what we could afford and the relative luxury enjoyed by our cousins (camping one year, a hired caravan the next) was that we owned our own home. (Which is now worth between $2 and $3 million, so... y'know). The bulk of what's being said in this thread is very much the truth, but yeah, nah, not *everyone* was going on fancy vacays on the regular.
Unfortunately trades aren't always the answer. [I had just complained about in elsewhere in this thread.](https://old.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/1eg6ot5/australia_in_biggest_baby_recession_since_1970s/lfqwwax/)

In short, I've already tried trades. The degree came about in my thirties.

I have friends who are successful like your son, I know it's possible. But I know plenty more that got eaten up and spit out by bosses using kids as cannon fodder. And so many people are completely broken by retirement age, if they live that long.
Oh yeah. Brown man really do be the source of all evil there
We could wait for them to die which could be sooner than they like if no one is looking after them in old age.
Assuming you're being half serious because it's a legit thing. The idea fascinated me when I first encountered it.
> And so many people are completely broken by retirement age, if they live that long.

This is the biggest thing that people neglect to mention when they're harping on about "making more than any office worker", like sure you earn an extra 10-15%, but it's also costing you 100-150% more wear and tear on your body, especially as most workplaces don't follow good practice or adequate PPE which just makes it all the worse.

There's a reason that opioid addiction is absurdly common amongst the trades, before folks get into a trade they should seek out a roofer who has been doing it for 25+ years and spend a day with them and their laundry list of ailments and inabilities to live a regular life anymore. That's not even getting into the straight up toxic culture on most worksites or companies, I've a friend who is a sparky and she was "lucky" that the worst thing that happened to her as an apprentice was her co-workers holding her down while they hammered the metal in her steel toe boots so that it was pressed up against her toes and she had to cut them off else she'd deglove her foot. When that's the "light" treatment, who the fuck would want to sign up for it?
But if you think about, problems exist in this world. You know what else exists? Brown people. 

I don't think I need to connect the dots here. /s
Adequate PPE is a big one.

Panel shop I worked at had a bung air compressor. Which meant we couldn't wear air-fed masks, otherwise we'd be breathing in oil. The boss didn't want to spend money on replacing a compressor that "still worked." So instead we'd be using organic masks, which are no good for stopping isocyanate based paint.

But being the impressionable kid who was working as hard as I could, I tolerated it.

I didn't last long in that career. Inhaling fumes and bog dust all day wasn't fun. All the old fellas had solvent sensitivity, and their brains were effectively Swiss cheese.

And boy, the "tradie culture" is rough. I still experience it today as I work with construction crews, though somewhat insulated since I represent the client. It is changing for the better, slowly. Health and Safety is recognised by workers to be in their favour instead of thinking it's "pussy shit." Bosses will still try to cut corners cause it's costing them money, but are fearful of the legal consequences so can't push too hard. 

Misogyny, racism and homophobia are still enjoyed quietly, knowing they can't say that stuff too loudly anymore, but at least they recognise it as bad behaviour and the younger guys are less tolerant of it.

It came as quite a shock one day, when I first started working a professional role, when I was asked to do something that turned out to be dangerous and was told to stop. I was so accustomed to putting myself in the firing line, to be told to stop for my own wellbeing was peculiar and I just didn't understand. Learned helplessness.
