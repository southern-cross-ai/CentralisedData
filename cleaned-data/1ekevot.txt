I'm currently with HostPlus, but after discovering how lax their procedures are for transferring funds out of accounts, and them ignoring my requests for reassurance that my money is safe, I don't feel comfortable with them holding my super anymore. Does anyone have recommendations for a decently performing fund with at least some checks for moving funds out?

I'm also only interested in established and registered funds, so bitcoin and super high return scammers need not waste their time.

So you are not comfortable with HostPlus, but happy to get recommendation from a random person on the www? Wellâ€¦..
Australian super? Like half the country it seems.
I imagine that OP is trying to field recommendations before then going on to do their due diligence about looking those funds up. Security is an under-advertised feature of Super Funds. What do you do when you're looking for a new service? Ask friends and family and just fall in with what they say? How gauche.
Yep, was waiting for this comment. Obviously I will be doing my own research. I'm looking for recommendations to see what works for other people. I will then take those recommendations and do my own due diligence based on them. Honestly...
