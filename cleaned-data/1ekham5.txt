Kmart ones work fine
[https://www.kmart.com.au/product/2-slice-toaster-white-42663881/](https://www.kmart.com.au/product/2-slice-toaster-white-42663881/) never had one of these bad boys stop working
ive been using Kmarts Anko  $10 toaster for 5yrs now
Another vote for the Kmart toaster here.
 
Bought one probably nearly a decade ago and it's still going, survived share houses and at least 3 moves in that time. After a nuclear war, I imagine the cockroaches would still be able to use it to warm their way through a nuclear winter.
Is it really unreasonable though? Ten years use - $7.50 a year. Is that bad?

Or, yeah - go Anko.
the auspost toaster & kettle lol
I'm using the $7.50 Kmart one. Doing a better job than my previous $100+ "smart toaster". Only issue with it is the slots are quite narrow, so thick fancy bread doesn't fit.
I got a Smeg one for Christmas a few years ago. It is not better than a Kmart one.
If you want a name brand head over to Amazon, Kambrook there for $39 I just saw. Ebay or Kmart has that $10 one, I've owned 2 of them, the first one burnt out but it lasted easily 2-years.
A good bit of advice is never buy Breville stuff at full price, they go on sale pretty regularly, whether that's on their website or at other stores.
Have had [this bad boy](https://www.bigw.com.au/product/contempo-4-slice-toaster-stainless-steel/p/209336) from Big W for 3 years and it's worked a charm.
Find a great Aunty or someone really old and offer them $20 and a new anko toaster for their old Sunbeam one that has the soft down and up. /s
Have an old breville automatic toaster, doesnâ€™t seem they make them anymore, hope it doesnâ€™t die.
I hate my Kmart long slice one, it only toasts 3/4 of a slice so I have to rotate it
Aldi.
Who buys direct from the manufacturers website. It's always the most expensive option.Â 
Hope you donâ€™t need a kettle as well ðŸ’¸ðŸ’¸
Kmart
I bought one from Kmart for 7$ about three weeks ago.
Just to add to the chorus.


Our Breville toaster sucks badly.
We returned the first one.
The second one is almost as bad.
Anything more than a bees giblets causes incineration of toasty item.


Our previous Kmart one was much better.
(Former retail employee here) Always look around. at least half the time you can find it elsewhere for much cheaper. I remember selling that toaster for $34ish most of the time when you account for the retailers website pricing. 

And as others have said, Anko is a good brand to look at, especially for its price.
I've recently been tempted by the Dualitt and Rowlett super expensive ones. I think my current one is a Kmart one. It toasts unevenly and nearly max setting is needed for toasting ordinary industrial bread.
I've had my cheap Kmart one for over 3 years now.

For $75 I expect a toaster to give me buttered toast if I give it flour, yeast and a cow.
Kmart's pretty good for a lot of things, honestly. Maybe not as good as fancy expensive name brand stuff, but I trust them a lot more than whatever comes up on Amazon.
My work kitchen has one. It works and it keeps working despite being used much more often than the average home toaster is but it toasts unevenly and has since it was new. You have to half toast bread then flip it around to get both sides toasted the same amount.
Yep, I have has 2 fancy ones since my Kmart one and the lifespan is no different.
I got a Kmart kettle and toaster a couple of years ago when we renovated our kitchen. They still look really nice, nothingâ€™s damaged or peeled. Like new. 

My mother in law got an expensive set when she renovated her kitchen. Within 6 months, the black (paint?) was peeling off, parts of it where the steam comes out was bubbling and they looked shabby. She takes a great deal of care of her things as do I. 

Years ago, you would buy the more expensive things if you wanted them to last a lot longer. These days, theyâ€™re just the same or worse in some cases.
Sure it still toasts after 5 years. But it will not take large slices of bread and crumpets don't toast well in it but as you said it still works and won't die. unfortunately.
Smeg is the ultimate "lipstick on a pig" brand.
My granma's toaster has sides that fold down, no up and down. And bakelite handles.
You mean this one?

I've had one 10+ years. Love that there are no levers and the 'lift and look' button.
i have a russell hobbs toaster that does the same thing. fucking infuriating.
But damn, that pig looks fine!
Lipstick and smeg do not work well together in a sentence
Looks like it, except mine is a red colour. I should have guessed they were for sale online. Mine has been great, but I bought it from myers years ago and paid a bit less.
I have a Russell Hobbs toaster, it's coming up on 15 years and toasts evenly. I don't care so much for brand names as things doing what they are supposed to do. I didn't mention my toaster brand because in 15 years quality can change and all I care about is toasters toasting evenly, fitting larger bread and letting me raise the lever enough to get crumpets out without being in danger of burning fingers without needing to resort to plastic ended tongs. My toaster does that but it doesn't mean a new Russell Hobbs toaster will. I don't rate Breville like I used to because quality has declined and a $10 toaster that toasts badly but lasts is better than a more expensive toaster that toasts better and breaks. Which is why my work has an Anko toaster, we might have to faff about with flipping bread but it works for ages and is cost effective.
I got my smeg on her lipstick.
I wouldn't buy it from Breville direct. You can get the same one for $25 less on Amazon and I imagine they would go even cheaper at places like JB on sale.

I also have the red one. Seems like only the silver is sold now.
Wow great to meet you mate, may you continue to enjoy your toast. I even bought a kambrook kettle in the same colour.
