Headline: electrocuted

Reporter: "has reportedly suffered an electric shock"

Lol, I wonder if this is click bait or whoever wrote the headline genuinely doesn't know the meaning of electrocuted. Maybe it's click bait feining as ignorance
[ELECTROCUTE | English meaning - Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/electrocute)

Electrocute means to kill someone by causing electricity to flow through their body.

to send electricity through someone’s body, causing death
They missed the obvious headline:

Firefighter shocked during new Sydney metro final evacuation drill
Rest in peace
He dead?
Opening a train door? Jeez.
The average punter doesn't know the difference, and yes, I agree it's annoying.
Electrocution means injury OR death due to electric shock, so it's not incorrect technically.


In reality it sounds more severe to say electrocution so I imagine that's why they said it.
Makes sense - I safely copied the title of the video given that posting under a different headline may result in mod action as its vaguely political.
I hate 7 news as much as the next person, but isn’t this pedantic?
Oxford Dictionary says "***injure*** *or kill (someone) by electric shock.*"
A less exaggerated article states: 

>A firefighter has suffered a minor electric shock during a simulated emergency evacuation of the Metro station at Barangaroo in Sydney.

No.
Depends on the dictionary. I just did a quick google and many say “to kill or severely injure”
Sydney Morning Herald quotes the incident report as saying he got a "minor electric shock" and that an ambulance was only called as a precaution per exercise procedures, so it's not pedantic to say 7 News is being very clickbaity here.
Not if you're in the industry. If you work in electro technology that headline means they died.

That might be the lay definition but my guess is it's not legal.


My dad is an electrical safety inspector. They use the term eletrocution exclusively for fatal electric shocks.
Dictionaries are descriptive, not prescriptive. They report how the word is being used by the public, and they change definitions as the stupid people and the Americans mangle the correct meanings.
There needs to be at least a significant injury for proper use of the word, which is derived from 'electro execution'.
Not according to the cambridge dictionary
It's originally a portmanteau of electric and execute so the original meaning is pretty clear. Language evolves though so I wouldn't say it's incorrect to use it for "severely injure".
….isn’t that being electrocuted?

He needs to contact the dictionaries then.
If, as you say, dictionaries are a reflection of society's use of a word, then doesn't that mean anyone who argues against the dictionary definition is just a pedant?
From the title, it sounds like he died - electrocution is generally death (electric execution = electrocution), electric shock is non lethal.
So the dictionary definition is to "injure or kill (someone) by electric shock". Doesn't sound like there was injury or death? It definitely shouldn't have happened but I would think this sounds more like static electricity.
They’ll be shocked to discover this error, I’m sure.
No.

Is it pedantic to point out that "literally" and "virtually" are antonyms, yet Americans have started using them as synonyms and that makes the word "literally" literally unusable to convey information in its correct context?
Yes and no.  They could be trying to persuade others to harm the language less often.
No it's not injure, it's kill
