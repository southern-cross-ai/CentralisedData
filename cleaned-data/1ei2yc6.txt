Never heard of a lawnmower related death being notified at 0340 before.

The one time I was pretty sure the husband didn’t do it from reading media reports was the lady who was missing from Ballarat.
Is the “there is no suggestion the husband brutally murdered his wife” in news articles the new way for journalists to signal “he definitely murdered his wife” to readers and avoid contempt and defamation matters?

Seeing it everywhere now.
It is a bit early for speculation but I hope it isn't DV related. Either way, that poor woman and her family.
There was a story earlier this year regarding a man using a thrasher/mower who killed his wife. It happened in Logan QLD and I assumed not remembering the details that this was the same. Sadly not.
Sounds like what happened to the spinal tap drummer
While it may seem strange that someone was on a ride on mower at 3 am,  plenty of people have taken a drunken 3 am mower ride before. Especially out in the sticks. Could be the case, maybe not but don't count it out
Toowoomba? I think we can all guess who the culprit is.

All bad humour aside, this is genuinely tragic.
There was a case around the area where a guy was mowing a sloped area, and his wife was weeding at the bottom, and he lost control and it rolled down the slope onto her, but that one was declared an accident (and I think the people that knew them also agreed it seemed a total tragedy as they got along really well).

This case is very different, as nobody is mowing in the pitch dark with almost freezing temperatures.
Sounds possible that the incident occurred earlier and was, for some reason, only discovered in the middle of the night?
No - that would be 

*Police have revealed they had previously attended a property*  

and

*He confirmed officers had previously attended the Thomas Road property in July 2023 and "there was some action that was taken"*
It's factually correct. Journalists aren't supposed to speculate, and at this point the police haven't said that he is the focus of their inquiry.
> Police have revealed they had previously attended a property in Queensland's Lockyer Valley where a woman died in a suspicious incident involving a ride-on lawn mower.

I'd say that was the bigger giveaway, if that's the case.
But is assisting police with inquiries and there are not searching for any one else
He didnt brutally murder his wife, the lawnmower he was holding did
Used to be a journo. Your sarcasm detector is in excellent condition.
Her job would put her in contact with a few likely suspects too I imagine
The opposite, I think.

After Alex Jones lost a billion dollar lawsuit for suggesting the Parkland parents had faked their kids deaths - resulting in an army of nutjobs harrassing them for years - news outlets are being super careful about what they suggest, lest they raise their own army of nutjobs.
Police had attended the property for DV twice already. Police look after their Defence bros.
A middle aged woman is not the prime demographic for drunken 3am shenanigans.
More likely a violent attack at his hands that he then tried to use another means to conceal.  Men are so bloody boring when it comes to murdering their partners.
I live next door to a mower/chainsaw shop. The father of the owner has one arm. Turns out he was riding his ride-on mower, mowing his sloped lawn like he had done thousands of times. Lost concentration and the mower tipped over, trapping his leg. Freeing his leg meant his arm got chopped up. Stihl reckons he made the right choice.
>This case is very different, as nobody is mowing in the pitch dark with almost freezing temperatures.

The article says they don't know the time of death. It's a big property, it's possible she died mowing during the day and was just not found until 3am.
Is labelling it as 'brutally' emotive enough to raise doubt with the reader?
I think the journo knew what they were doing.
Statistically it almost always is the partner.
To be fair the cops might have tried and been told they can't do shit to them, could go either way, some cops are awesome, some are cunts.
Anything any of us say is pure speculation
Case closed, the Reddit detectives have solved it
>Men are so bloody boring when it comes to murdering their partners.


Sorry we're not creative enough for you. 
Haha low key pun, I’d probably choose arm over leg though.
After hearing some of these stories, I’ve decided I’m NEVER owning a lawn mower. I’ll just hire someone’s goat, seems less risky.
seriously, an ex-gf's deere old dad had injuries from rollovers fortunately neither time was _that_ bad, but he almost lost a limb and had nerve damage that took years to heal.
Nice punchline haha
I bet he yelled so much it made him Huskvana.
Bravo
I see what you did there...
Stihl….hahahahah
Husband in the Defence Force? (Channel 10). Could he have returned home late and looked for her?
Person who has worked in a newsroom chiming in here:

There really shouldn’t be any adjective here at all. It should be much clearer: “the ABC is not suggested xyz murdered his wife.” 

In any form. Brutally, sneakily, cheekily, absurdly
Given it is Australian media, it would usually say ‘tragically’. That word is so overused in Au. I find reading the Australian news unbearable at this point (Australian no longer in Australia having to be spoon fed what I should think).
You’re right. But that isn’t really enough for journalists to go jumping to conclusions.
You know what a pol officer should do if higher ups tell them not to follow the law? Report them to the regulatory board. All cops are cunts who don’t do this.
Nonsense. It’s is a suspicious death and police had attended property twice before for DV. You all will defend your bros until the end but a girl wears a fucking skirt and she’s definitely inviting being raped.
Is anyone claiming otherwise?
Dominant arm though?
Goats eat everything except the lawn lol.

Honestly, I wish Australia would push back against the whole lawn culture and let nature do its thing.    viola and dichondra are amazing in shady and semi shaded areas that grass struggles with.  Mix petunias in with them for a bit of colour and it looks way better than turf.
You’re kidding
Butt
Was he a John Deere old dad tho? 


 I'll show myself out....
\*adverb 🤓
Tragically unreadable.
Completely agree!
It's not the higher ups in the police force that's necessarily the problem, it's often the courts and the laws themselves. If they are told there isn't enough of a case/evidence to do anything, then that isn't the policies fault.
If it makes you feel better, I also don’t like lawn culture either. Especially in Australia where water wastage is drilled into us. 

The only real reason I’d want it is for any potential pets/small kids I’d have and even then, there’s alternatives I’d seriously look at if/when it ever comes up.
Ewe joker!
a real Claas act, luckily able to Fendt for himself in that instance

i think we've harvested enough puns
lol yes. Oops.
Tragically unprecedented; the double banger.
This really gets my goat!
