I was doing a documentary about the local firefighters in charge of Teahupo’o and we met those two very friendly officers. 
In full uniform too they're there to make sure there are no rogue waves ;-)

Ah, the olympic surfing events are at tahiti,so the 2  cops are there   to boost security.
Why can’t they surf in France ?
Damn, I'm really sorry that happened to you. Unpleasant surprises are the worst.
