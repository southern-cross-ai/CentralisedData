Jess's post race interview was great too. 

What a fantastic ambassador for Australia. 

Well done and may she have much more success in her career
Just watched her studio interview on Ch9, a happy and humble gorgeous human being, a proper role model.
👍 🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺🇦🇺
Australia's first middle distance medal since 68!
Just watched, spot on. She's a great ambassador. What a legend, an an absolute beast on the track!

I run recreationally, watching these elite gazelle people absolutely smash it is a huge treat. Different type of human.
Yeah everything just switched on for her at the very right time thats for sure
