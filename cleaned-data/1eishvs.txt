Some things should never be made. It smells like ass and tastes even worse.
Twisties are not unique to Australia.
These are freaking amazing crushed and used as a fried chicken coating. Family loved it, made awesome wraps and school lunches.
I remember when SamBoys had the extra flavour packets and the chicken had a dog breath garlic option. Was a long time back but that shit was good
These were pretty disappointing.
I read it as spicy prawn and was both horrified and intrigued.
nah this one hits. i love the flavour because it was spicy.
There’s a lot of shitty flavor experiments to shit on, but this isn’t one of them.
No it doesn't.
Godammit, now I have to go buy some.
Those are amazing. They taste exactly like spicy ramen.

These are delicious. Glad you don’t like them. All the more for me
Show me another country that would make meat pie flavored chips. They were terrible, but it was certainly an original idea to flavour chips like something brought from a servo hot box at 3am.
It’s a novelty flavour. They would NEVER keep this as a regular flavour. They do chicken and cheese and that’s generally it.  They do this weird shit sometimes so people go “I wonder what that tastes like” and buy one. Even you talking about how terrible you think they taste is a form of marketing that they planned on - although I’m not suggesting they are intended to taste bad.
Chicken salt enters the room
They aren’t? I know there are similar products in NZ, parts of SEA and Europe, but they definitely vary in flavour, texture, shape, and name to what’ll you’ll find here.
Atomic Tomato flavor 4 lyfe
The BBQ just had a sachet of fucking chilli powder. Don't touch your face after eating those, my eye hurt for hours. 
Funny shaped prawn crackers?
They were reduced to clear in Coles near me last week, got to say they were pretty good. Had a decent punch.
Eh. That's my bad for a shitty caption. But spicy ramen and twisties is probably a worse flavour combination than their Donut King period.
Not sure about the flavour but yes the name is different, they are called fonzies in Italy.
With all the nostalgia sales that go on I can’t believe they never tried this again
They are awful. They simply taste like “hot”. I can deal with spice but they have no other redeemable quality and just taste like spicy cardboard.

It seems everyone has quite strong opinions one way or another on these. 

Vegemite twisties were the best ever.
Im with you, twisties are not great at special flavours
AAAAaaaayyyyyy 👍👍
And they tasted nothing like Twisties, I bought some. bleh
