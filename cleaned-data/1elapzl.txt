Can remember CB,  Parramatta, Mosman, Bondi, Penrith, Frankston, and the capital citiws off the top of my head. Want to know all of them. Based on places only, editions such as the Carlton AFL doesn't count
[Cairns](https://www.jbhifi.com.au/products/monopoly-cairns-board-game) checking in.

Edit: I knew it existed but I've never actually seen the board before. Green Island and Fitzroy Island are only $60 each. F'n bargain.
Lol Frankston.

Ballarat has one https://winningmoves.com.au/games/buxton-ballarat-monopoly/
I have the [Newcastle](https://winningmoves.com.au/product/newcastle-monopoly/) edition here somewhere.
Mount Isa, middle of nowhere, had lots of friends who had it growing up
Geelong
Port Macquarie
I know Perth also has its own edition.. they have/had one on display at the Perth libraryâ€¦
The Eyre Peninusla region also recently got one.
So basically everywhere? Seems monopoly is the Taylor Swift of board games
I have the Port Pirie (South Australia) version.
Margret River edition is being finalised and will be for sale in a couple of months.
I hope one of the pieces is a crocodile
This is the most Camden post I've ever seen.
Funkytown, represent!
Ha, that would be cool, but [disappointingly, no.](https://www.jbhifi.com.au/cdn/shop/products/660094-Product-2-I-638331749066823237.jpg)
The rural Australia edition had a kookaburra, kangaroo, meat pie, barbie, surfer and cricket bat. 

Disappointed they don't do any special piece for these editions.
