3 dollar hash brown my f\*n arse, not surprised at all
Im not turning away from \*fast food\* it's simply going to better options. My favorite local Cafe's chicken burger is 10x better and only costs $2 more than a quarter pounder, a combo with drink and chips ends up almost the same as a McDonalds combo meal. If Im going to splurge on junk food, im going to go for quality, and support local.
Lol, not turning away from fast food, recognising that for the price of shitty maccas where they can't even put a burger together or give you a complete order can be better spent on actual burgers, made by a small business, or a filling meal like Chinese, Indian, or proper pizza/pasta.

For our family of 6, maccas costs $100. We can get better value spending $120 going to the local **all you can eat** buffet restaurant. 

Maccas is purely for road trips where that's the only thing on offer at the freeway servo.
McDonalds hasn't just jacked up prices from inflation. Last time this was mentioned in this sub, someone posted some numbers showing that macca's had increased prices 40% in the past few years, and 100% over the past decade. This isn't an 'inflation' problem, this is a 'macca's feeling out what the max they can charge is' problem. Even if they now drop their prices 10%, they're still making far more than they were before.
Unless you're getting some sort of deal through the app, it's hella expensive for the quality and quantity. You may as well get something from a cafe or restaurant if you're dining out.
It's as expensive as an actual proper restaurant now, so there's no real reason to get fast food.
Maccas is ridiculously expensive now. Used to be where you’d go for a cheap feed.
I kinda struggle to understand how Maccas stays in business these days. The last few times I've been Its been over $30 for 2 meals and the quality was abysmal, I avoid it as much as possible.

I was pleasantly surprised trying Carls Jr recently and while it cost the same the food was much better IMO.
I am not turning away from fast food. I am turning away from BAD food.
the price went up, the food size and quality went down, no no-brainer to no longer go there. absolute bullshit.
Good.
Big Mac is now the same size as a cheeseburger 20 years ago. It’s a joke. Prices are way up and size and quality is down. I will never buy from McDonald’s again.
I went to McDonald's last week - $4.50 for a fucking cheeseburger.

Never again.
It's not just the price (which is too high), it's that the portions are shrinking and the food simply isn't filling, satisfying, or flavourful anymore. Their fries have tasted like cardboard for years, for example.
I'm not avoiding takeout. I am avoiding Maccas as there isn't value for money. 

For the same amount I would spend at Maccas for my family I can get a Chinese or Indian from the small place down the street, or a local pizza place that gives leftovers for the next day. 

Maccas just isn't worth it for what you get anymore.
Shrinkflation weary...
Why do they subtly keep blaming inflation, it's fucking pathetic it's monopolies screwing us every which way they can and politicians sitting on their hands doing nothing with a weak as piss ACCC so their corpo buds can get away with anything.

ITS PRICE GOUGING ACROSS THE BOARD MFERS
Going to McDonald's used to be dependable. You got a dependable level of hygiene, known quality food, cheap, quick service. 

Now you get dirty stores, horrible slow ordering experience with self service screens that don’t work so need to find a screen that does, then out of paper receipts so forget order number, constantly prompted do you want to upsize, upgrade, add items, multiple prompts making the process slow compared to how it was, going to the counter, giving your order. 

Price has increased for the same low quality meal. Cheap low quality is acceptable, expensive low quality, just go else where.
The burgers are tiny now almost comical. The fillet of fish is the size of a fish finger .
I don't understand how the article can justify saying that $12 for a small combo meal is "inexpensive".

Sure, it's cheaper than other options, as they say, but compared to the cost of making a meal at home with ingredients you buy, it's stupidly expensive.
Yeah...inflation. not the prices rising 130% in the last 10 years.
It's not inflation,  it's price gouging. They got greedy, I would wager if they put their prices down, no one else would be able to compete and the volume of sales would shoot up, I would say.
cue the old man spouting 'in my day!', but seriously, I'm in my 40s now. I had friends who worked at MacDonald's and my younger brother worked there in the 90s. they've always exploited younger workers for cheap labour, that's not new. but they tended to train them well, and push them hard. MacDonald's back then was a good thing to have on a resume. it usually meant that you could hustle, you could work under pressure,  and you could take an order and work as a team member. 

I don't know how or when this changed, but the kids they have now tend to be fucking useless. worse than that, most of THOSE kids couldn't even begin to give a shit that they're not doing their jobs properly. I see them now fucking around in the back, using phones, literally hands in pockets, leaning against benches when there are lines of customers hanging out the door. 

the waiting spaces for the drive through used to be an emergency measure for extremely busy periods, and it was pretty rare that you'd be asked to use one at all. now though, EVERY FUCKING TIME. even after peak hours, when the restaurant is empty. 

the only thing I'll concede to these 'workers' is that they now have the order kiosks, and the online Ubereats/menulog orders to deal with too. but that doesn't explain away the blowout in the wait times. 

It's just not worth the stress to me anymore, to sit in a drive through for up to 20 minutes, to eat the slop they serve.
I can get better food for the same price or cheaper from a local cafe. Why would I go to maccas?
I for one love to see this
I can go to Short order, Flipside, Grilld or a quality joint for those prices. 

Only thing McDonald’s is good for is a late night drive through coffee.
Quarter pounder buns are now the same diameter as the Big Mac buns and when you get a quarter pounder the meat is hanging off the edges looks like you’re getting a great deal but it is shrunk. shrinkage is a real problem
I'm all on board for "Good, fast, cheap... Pick two". But when it's neither good nor cheap, yep. Fuck off.
My local pub does a $16 lunch for a cheeseburger fries and drink, why on earth would I pay similar price at maccas when it's rubbish.
Things would improve for them, a little, perhaps, if the food served looked like the food on offer in their advertising and menus. 

E.g. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LK5k2CLgwG8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LK5k2CLgwG8)
$6.50 for a large coke, get fucked.
After the McMopp incident over the fries... Never felt the desire to ever go back.
The only thing Maccas has going for it now is drive through. 

The food has always been low quality (although the fries used to be better before the switch to vegetable oil) but it used to be cheap enough to make up for it. Now that the prices have gone up, they are competing with a whole different class of takeaway.

If I have a choice of Maccas or an independent takeaway for around the same price, I'm choosing the independent takeaway every time as the food will be better and probably healthier and more filling.
-cost too much

-takes too long

-orders are wrong 50% of the time

how is macca's a "fastfood" option when fast food is cheap, quick and convenient
It's a stretch to call it food honestly. You get fuck all for your money.
Last time I went to Macca's it was $5 for a medium coke. Screw that.
$7.60 for *six nuggets*? My local chippie will give me an entire battered fish for that.
It is no longer fast or cheap or good.
Used to get a bacon and egg McMuffin now and again, but like everything at Maccas they are poor value.

We make them at home now.  It’s a fun lesson for the kids to work out how much it would cost to buy from Maccas vs our homemade versions (which are of course better)
Who knew that charging more for garbage food was not good business practice
No only expensive but service is abysmal for in-store. Machines are always out of receipt paper, restaurants are always dirty inside, bins are over flowing, can never get service at the counter without waiting patiently for 10mins until some staff notices you. On top of that, orders take forever and finding extra serviettes or straws are impossible.
I can't say anymore about the food than what's been said but an area that has really dropped off since the pandemic is the cleanliness of their restaurants.  McDonalds traditionally has always been a good choice for a break on a road trip because the food is of a known quality and the toilets are usually clean.   The last couple of times I went to a McDonalds, the tables were putrid, the toilets were feral and almost as by way of an explaination, they had 'Now Hiring!!' signs plastered everywhere. Yeah, nah. I'll see what else is around.
Costs about $40 to get 2 combos delivered. For less I could get 2 large pizzas at $33 from a local place, 2 Chinese dishes (enough to share plus leftovers), a flame grilled chicken with delicious garlic sauce and flatbread, countless other burgers and not to mention the amount of stuff you can buy (okay maybe not as much nowadays) at a supermarket for $40. Kebabs, pies... Everything. Shit, really hungry now!
Maccas might be fast food, but it’s not *cheap* fast food and definitely not appetising fast food. For the same price as a large Big Mac meal deal, you can get a dish and a drink at any one of hundreds of Thai takeaways, chicken shops etc. OK sure, you have to get out of your car, but it’s better quality food and tastier with it.
Well yeah, what did they expect? They charge a fortune and it's luck of the draw if you'll get food that's actually hot or fresh. The last time I felt like Maccas, I tried that new meal deal. The chicken and cheese burger was all hard and stale, including the bun. My guess is that it was sitting in some kind of warmer for too long. And the chips are usually soggy, lukewarm and oversalted. Not worth it.
Partly it's inflation but their restaurants are very dirty now and service is slow. They got lazy and they got greedy, that's not a great combination.
I own a fish and chip shop and we’ve been cranking.and burger sales are really good.so I’m going to assume maccas is crap fro the price.
My kid and I stopped in at Macca's for breakfast the other day.  For how much I paid I might as well have gone to an actual sit -down breakfast place.  Fast food just isn't worth it anymore for the cost and the food is better elsewhere.


For me, drop the wannabe fancy stuff, go back to the basics at affordable pricing.  That's what MacDonalds was about.
Food has gone up 46%.

Inflation hasn't gone up this much. Too much piss taking is now coming back to bite you.

https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/research-topics/agricultural-outlook/livestock-prices#falling-livestock-prices-reflect-higher-animal-supply

>Saleyard prices for cattle, sheep and lambs have fallen significantly over the last year due to a combination of higher livestock turn-off and lower buyer demand in saleyards (Figure 1.1). These changes in supply and demand dynamics have been driven by both the expectation and onset of drier seasonal conditions, which have reduced pasture growth and increased the incentive for livestock turn-off as feed becomes relatively more expensive. This has increased the supply of animals in saleyards, placing downward pressure on saleyard prices. Drier seasonal conditions have also reduced restocker demand, lowering demand for cattle, sheep and lambs.

So meat is cheaper but prices are at an all-time high. Go fuck yourselves.
Jacked up prices ✔

Drop Quality of food. ✔

"Why aren't we making as much monies now??"

It's almost like continued enshittification of their product drives people away from buying it... Who'da thought it?
Boycotts work!
It feels like I get more for less at other fast food outlets. There are no combo’s at maccas that make me feel like I’m getting a good deal. 

So if I wanted junk food and there was a maccas in front of me, I’m thinking; shit food, shit quantity, reeally expensive. 

Nah I’m going somewhere else
F*ck em they've forgotten their place.
McDonald’s has always exploited the ‘just how crap can we make it and people will still buy’ ratio. I think they’ve jumped right over the line now. It’s not even that cheap an option anymore, and the quality and general service has plummeted. Much better value, quality and hospitality at your neighborhood cafe or fish and chipper. Let’s support our independent local businesses and put an end to these multinational vultures for good.
For me, it's not about the cost - it's the value.  I fully appreciate that others are doing it tough.

But Maccas is getting expensive.  And it's crap.

I don't mind paying $20 for a good meal.  But not for maccas.
They've just cut down their menu too much for it to be worth it. No McOz, no McFeast and no more Deli choices means they have nothing  appealing apart from a double quarter pounder which chicken patties instead of meat 
They are pricing themselves out of business, nothing to do with inflation. It was once an economic meal to get the kids, Now you get better quality more filling meals at the fish 'n chips shop for the same or cheaper price.
Prices went up,  serving sizes went down.  What did they expect?
When I’m paying as much for a Maccas meal as I am for a burger at my local pub I will always pick the pub
Turning away from price gouging corporations
I truly hope that soon we are going to hear about the heartbreak stories from Franchise Maccas owners of how hard they are doing because of COL, why they need to raise prices blah blah.

How their target demographic has dropped so less clientele blah blah

Oh please allow some of these greed filled fucks to die off peacefully without us hearing the strangulation noises!
Shrinkflation, shit taste and overpriced for mediocre burgers = the decline of McDonalds. There is zero value for the money spent and and it just can't compete in terms of quality and taste. I'd rather head to Hungry Jacks, or, even better, a good corner shop where the taste is better even if the price is comparable (or better).
Best thing I read in a while was a post stating that Takeout has gone from a Convinience to a Luxury. Now it's into luxury territory there's more competition for that shrinking available money so quality is more important than they've had to concern themselves with in a long time.
Lol, I gave up on Maccas a while ago due to the prices being inversely proportional to quality, quantity and value.
Makes cheap food, sells it expensively, wonders why people are turning away
Burgers get smaller, quality goes way down and the prices go up. There is just no incentive to go there anymore
I'm not turning away from fast food, I'm turning away from McDonald's specifically. I don't want to fund genocide and even if that wasn't a problem, the prices are high and the food is bad. Local cafes >>>>>>>>
And their soggy fries
Local chicken chop does large chips, snitzel wrap and a drink for $16.50.  
All fresh, tasty and filling.

What does a McChicken combo cost these days?
I'm staying away and won't be returning out of pricing spite. Refuse to buy from any company that charges premiums for no reason.  Used to love MDs. Haven't been in years and won't go again. 
I’d rather a kebab.
McDonalds food is low quality and service is slow. I can call up my local take away place and go pick it up just as quickly for similar cost but much better quality and more quantity. 

McDonald’s market was cheap fast food. They don’t offer this anymore. So obviously customers will explore other options.
Cheap food, that's 'okay, I guess?' Is red rooster or food court chinese or sushi, kebabs etc. Maccas actually fully leaned into the fact that they think they're a restaurant. Absolutely delusional. Stay in your lane.
 My kids yesterday got two happy meals and I was out 25 dollars. WTAF
Good.  Let’s hope the old school corner store can make a comeback in a modern format.
$23 for a medium Angus meal and 6 nuggets?
Yeah nah.
Was a matter of time. Let’s face it, the big 2 supermarkets would be in deep shit too if we didn’t suffer under their duopoly.
Why would anyone willingly eat this shit ? Stop buying, problem solved
Yeah, massive ripoff these days. The local chicken shop offers triple the portion size for less & it's fresher.

I think they forgot that they sell low end fast food for a cheap price.
It's shit food and now its expensive shit food.

Why would I get anything from there if i had literally any other choice?
Once a cheeseburger went over $5 I stopped going.
McDonald’s has a lot of competition. If people feel like they're getting better value elsewhere, they'll go for it.
When they charge something like $4-5 for a chicken and cheese, they can fuck right off the greedy cunts
Prices getting bigger. Portions getting smaller.

The quarter pounder is tiny compared to what it was twenty years ago. So is the Big Mac.
Maccas used to be crap food, that was cheap and fast.  
  
Now it's still crap food, but neither cheap nor fast.  The price is comparable to getting a real burger or wrap at a cafe of fish and chip shop - so why would you get maccas instead?  And it's not much faster, if at all.  

Part of that is apparently because they're only making things on order and not just making burgers ready to go - but you can also see that it's in their training and processes.  They used to be well trained and seemed to have decent processes.  Now, if you watch them, the staff are so inefficient.  A whole lot of wandering around, doing things in an inefficient order and repeatedly checking in the same bag to see what's in there.  

So, the food is expensive, the processes have gone to shit making them really inefficient at the same time they're doing everything to discourage counter ordering (I don't mind, but there are still demographics who prefer the face-to-face ordering).  

Sometimes I also wonder if the menu has become overly complex with too many items.  
  
They got greedy, and they're paying the price, but I'm sure that management would blame everybody but themselves.
Going to a good diner costs less
Franchise issues and people taking profit at multiple levels drains capital needed for a quality product, and our wages. 

Another onterclass and intergenerational issue. 

Symptom of the death of society through greed and failure to innovate.
When you cost as much as the local greasy spoon why bother. The service isn't even that fast anymore.
Maccas downfall started when they raised their prices to something that its not. Maccas has always been cheap slop food. And hard to find a clean table there these days
McDonald’s is bad food at just below average prices. You can spend $18 in a meal at McDonald’s or you can go to another burger place that makes fresh, well made burgers + fries + a can of coke for  about $20. It’s not as “fast” but it’s so much better and it hardly costs much more!
Who can afford to eat out? I can barely afford cheap and nasty groceries let alone pay through the ear for the crap that fastfood outlets call food these days.
What is the point of maccas when it costs the same as a hsp and is less filling and satisfying. I'll go with the hsp every time
If I feel like McDonald's I just uber an actual good meal from a supermarket.


McD is not cheap of convenient anymore.


I did get a big mac last week but it's the first one for 6+ months and I usto have that sort of fast food once a fortnight or maybe even once a week
Not surprised. Food quality is laughable & expecting people to be okay with waiting for over 10 minutes consistently for such crappy food is even worse.
A big aspect of this is that McDonalds is like Coke. They have 100% saturated the market. Everyone who wants to eat at McDonald's will eat there. Given the coffee bar aspect(invented by the Australian part of the company actually), they have also expanded to more types of food/drink. But they were effectively at their maximum range. So the only way to expand profits was to increase margins. Which is to increase prices.

Once upon a time, this was fine. Because they were the dominant and "best" burgers. But now they compete against other players and other players have easily won the quality space. 5 guys etc in the US and people like Grill'd (the company are trash, but the food is decent) who are now where you go if you want a burger and want a good burger, you aren't going to Macca's.

So they now compete on ease (they are the only game if you want chips delivered at 2am) and price. So price increases directly hurt sales.
Orange juice that is actually sugary orange cordial “drink” was the last time I went there….  Race to the bottom while they design and market the place like it’s some modernist restaurant… jokers

They should take a page from in and out in the USA. Make fast food burgers. Good ones. That’s it. No bullshit.
They partner with delivery apps and drive branded cars with the mcdonalds logo, but when they make a mistake packing your order you have to chase up a refund with the delivery company, even though they're in sealed bags.

That and the app reliance put me off, if they cost 50% with codes you can use almost all of the time then it's not a sale, those are the regular prices.
Who do you want to die first; you or Maccas?

Ultimately, I pick Maccas to go first because I've never made burgers for people, shrunk the size of them without saying, lied about it when confronted and then said 'oh it's just your memory you crazy bogans, nothing's changed except maybe you, you've gotten worse up yours and oh btw they cost more now (farts).'
McDonald’s is a real estate company first and restaurant second, why would they care about restaurant losses when their real estate portfolio is going through the roof.
I've been going to more independent traditional fish n chips and pizza shops nothing trendy better tasting and much better pricing
Local Mexican restaurant near me has double the food, double the freshness and quality for the same price. Haven't been to McDonald's in almost a year. Probably won't go back.
Not inflation weary but more-so "poor quality weary"
Maccas these days is terrible value and the stores are a mess. Why would I pay $15+ for a meal when I can goto my local and get something better for only $1 more…
Better of with a pub schnitty chips and salad same price
McDonalds is literally last resort food for me since the price increases. My local one is also just shit quality, chips are cold half the time, other half hte time the drinks don't even have ice in them.
in Singapore, i spent 50 bucks for family of 4 meal, ridiculous.
Good, they deserve this for their absolutely ridiculous prices. Why would I pay $14 for a burger from MCDONALDS???
They only stay in business because the food is the same all over the world. And when you're hungry, you know exactly what the burger is going to taste like, even if it is shit. 


It's convenience food now, certainly not fast food. 
Can they even be defined as "fast food" anymore? I thought it meant cheap and quickly delivered.   
They're neither.
Boycott forever
When the pickles are thicker than the meat patties you can forget it.
Saw this same article about the US recently. Same with Starbucks. 

One of my teachers in HS just before the 2008 Recession talked about certain stocks that were generally recession-proof. Fast food was one of them. She said something to the effect of, "you know shit's fucked when people stop eating fast food"
I hadn't bought Macca's in YEARS because the quality is so awful. Yesterday I was on my way to work after a PT session and was desperate for a coffee. Foolishly, I stopped at Macca's (Erindale in Canberra for anyone who is interested) and ordered a skim flat white.

I think it was literally dish water. I couldn't believe how awful it was.
This isn't people running because they can't afford it. McDonald's used to be okay despite the food being average, the reason for their success is because the food was fast and cheap, neither of which is now true. 

2 large meals are approaching $40 and for that price you can go to a nicer restaurant or even your local, family run burger shop. 

McDonalds seem to think that their food is better than shit, which it isn't. They have really ridden this inflation train.
Not only did they increase prices they started skimping e.g. no hot fudge under large sundaes (when they introduced the new smaller paper containers that could hide it), also no sugar in iced coffees (even though you pay for it), and finally the dollop of sauce on burgers (cheeseburgers are dry as fuck)… I mainly stopped because the above kept happening, but some of these prices I’m seeing in the comments are ridiculous. Why would we come back if we are just feeling ripped off each time?
Suck it pricks. That’s what you get for being greedy.
Good, they’re an absolute rort now. I hope they continue to lose sales the greedy bastards.
What a surprise. Im not from US, so I dont know how are your prices. But here having one shitty burger, bunch of fries and some drink that is half water and half colored sugar costs more than good lunch in nice restaurant. And the waiting times are far from "fast". Why would I go there?
This thread should be pinned. Let’s all make a concerted effort never to eat McDonald’s again. 

You know it’s bad for you, you know there are better options. Get a kebab/souva/pizza/fish and chip whatever from your local independent. 

Fuck big business and fuck Ronald McDonald. Send him back to the states
Nobody wants to pay that sort of money to eat in a pee-pee soaked heckhole
I am sure it has nothing to do with people boycotting the genocide support company. I am sure those two coinciding with one another is a coincidence.
bro fuck this, what if our whole generation just said fuck you to big corporations 

we can still eat fast food but we get it from local places. fuck mcdonald’s and all the big chains
i stopped because of their support for idf.
I exploit the $1 coffee maccas app vouchers. Have like 10 throw away accounts that I randomly check during the week.
I used to buy it at work becuase it made financial sense. I stopped when it started to cost me more money.
Is anyone surprised? Shit tier food made by poorly paid teenagers who DGAF and sold for the same as what the more "expensive" takeaway places offer, if not more. Plus, I feel like their service standards are circling the drain. Have been three times this year, and on all three occasions i had to wait for 20-30 mins in store for a single large Big Mac meal, on the third time I opted for the tantrum and a refund instead of waiting after 30 mins. I support my local kebab shop that opened earlier in the year. The owner is a legend.  I regret not supporting him sooner!
There are never enough staff so wait times are longer - it’s not “fast” food any more, the dining areas are constantly filthy and the burgers are tiny now. 
And I want a full slice of cheese in my filet of fish.
Great f you mcD
Understandable, we get these weird dynamics where the price of junk food goes up more than luxury food.
I stupidly want a banana thick shake cause I got sucked into the marketing, a medium was $5.70, fuck off I'll go to the local takeaway and get one
I’m still eating fast food, just eating the burger meal from my local that is fucking quality for close to the same price.
https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56b7d45ef8baf3f19077ea4a/t/65b0b37b35d8ee23b0bb27e2/1706079102977/24012024.jpg

So at the a local pub I can get a wagyu or chicken burger for $10, butter chicken or massaman curry for $14. Chef made and better than the crap at McDonalds and cheaper. Plus you can get a beer or watch tv.
Because its fkn expensive now.
Yeah but they know legions of mouth-breathers will still waddle up and buy it.
Seems to be a global trend. Lots of americans complaining about the same thing (and Starbucks also having issues)
When it costs $50(or close enough to it) for 2 meals these days its no wonder people aren't spending money on shit take out foods.
Their food is dogshit and they ask a premium for it. Wake up and remember who you are, you clown.
Remember when Maccas had those cringe advertisements when someone would leave a tip because they mistook it for an expensive restaurant?  
I'd believe it nowadays, because the fucking price is about the fucking same.
Pretty sure the CEO came out the other day and acknowledged they were too expensive but hey we’re profitable so good luck. 🤞
Their food used to be somewhat cheap but shit.

Now Their food is still shit, but more expensive and shrinking in size.
I haven't had hot or salted chips from McDonald's in over a year, their standards are falling and their prices are increasing.
They don’t turn away from fast food, they just go where there is better value, big difference.
Good. Quality is worse or about the same. Prices gone up like crazy. Hjs are consistently better across the board  for their menu... but still

You can get better quality food from a smaller takeaway places for a similar price or less... and it doesn't go to a soulless Corp.

When you cut quality, raise prices, and depend on a burnt through horde of low motivated cheap teenage staff. You get what you deserve.
I used to get McDonald’s twice a week on my way home from work as a quick meal. The prices have skyrocketed so now I go there maybe once a month now. I’m not paying $13 for a crappy quarter pounder meal when that same crappy quarter pounder meal was $8 a couple of years ago.
Noticed KFC and maccas prices have gone up over 15% in the last couple of years meanwhile I can actually get a cheaper and most of the time better fast meal from hungry jacks or spend a few extra dollars and get something better
Maccas was better when it was a cheap and kid friendly space, they made it into an expensive, corporate experience.
Everything has shrunk and the prices have gone up.

Makes it extremely not worth it.
Maccas forgot they already used the great Angus fancy burger experiment to jack up their prices sneakily before winding the whole thing back, then tried hitting us again post pandemic. 

McDonald’s is now priced above what I consider to be McDonalds place in the market.
I think it’s also the fact McDonalds has jacked up their prices, especially compared to how much the goods cost. I’d rather go to KFC if I’m getting fast food. To get enough food to feel satisfied it costs significantly less
Mqcca's forgot they're garbage food and tried charging restaurant pricing with the shrinkflation.

Macca's can fuck right off. I'll take a kebab and chips over their shit any day.
Junkfood at restaurant prices
People have most of their fast food delivered. Nobody is ordering Maccas.
the amount of workers equates to the amount of present customers. Yagoona maccas, I swear to God, is run by one woman past 11pm.
Maybe its the awful swill they call "burgers" and the stupid price they charge.
Got two quick hash browns at the airport today from Macca's - $2.75 each! I can get a potato cakes at my local train station for $1.50 and it's a lot bigger.

Edit - also, Macca's don't do a veggie burger any more (and when they did do a plant-based obe it was shite). HJs plant-based burger is pretty damn good.
Fuck McDonalds. Tasteless unhealthy garbage. Finally people are realising it’s not worth it.
Good
It’s not just inflation, they serve shitty food even by fast food standards.
Shame, sucks to suck Maccas.
I guess there’s a positive to inflation then. McDonald’s food is trash, I think you could eat trash and it would be more nutritious tbh
Good
I asked for the bad news
Fix the ice cream machine and I’ll go back
Growing up it was 4.95 for a medium meal and I think 1 dollar more for a large. They can gf'd
No shit, it costs me as much to eat at McDonald's now, as it did to eat at the pub 5 years ago. 

Sure the pub has also gone up, but McDonalds has a HARD value limit, and they've well exceeded it.
I suppose it also doesn’t help that the food is, well, fucken disgusting? Just guessing here?
Maccas used to be cheap and nasty now it’s only half of those things
I read somewhere that McDonald’s have increased their prices 40% in the last five years
I don't buy mcdonalds anymore because their prices don't reflect the quality of the food.
People commenting about nuggies in the air fryer but can somebody tell me where to buy the best sweet & sour sauce to go with them otherwise I’ll be a slave to fast food joints forever.
McDonald’s is expensive. I can go to cafe63 and get a cheaper better meal.
Every single time I drive past a McDonalds I wonder how they’re still in operation. They’re not cheap, they’re not good, and they’re not fast. Hungry Jacks burgers AND chips are better. I can get an actual meal for the same price, and I never feel full after a Maccas burger and chips. They don’t even have the fun nostalgic aspect anymore since they took away most of the epic play areas and stopped catering to kids as much.
Not inflation, it's greed. Stop saying it's inflation. It's been greed the whole time.
I think they forgot that the food is REALLY bad and it HAS to be CHEAP
Someone needs to send this thread to head office. Everything spoken on here is so true.
Speaking of overpriced food chains; let's see your sales Subway. They also are way overpriced with quality and size shrinking.
I used to treat myself to breakfast at McDonald's once a week. I just got a McGriddle and a soda. Over the course of just a couple years, that order went from about $5 to $8, and it keeps going up, It's just too much to spend on something so little, and I should be eating something healthier anyway.
Last time I ate it I spent $15 on a sad burger meal and was hungry 20 minutes after it. 

Shit but not cheap enough to warrant it being shit.
Its also so dystopian in there with ordering machines. Go in there place an order on a screen, hope noone takes your order by mistake while standing around not talking to anyone. I liked when someone took your order and knew who to give it to
I still like McDonalds, the problem is they fucked up and prioritized short term profit for their cute little shareholders instead of a sustainable business model long term. The desire to constantly push profits higher and higher quarter over quarter just to profit more for shareholders is the problem. The objective should be to be profitable so everyone gets something, not increase profits every quarter without scaling the business larger. When you're McDonalds, you're kind of at a point where you just need to maintain things. Prioritize efficiency and even finding wins to boost quality without increasing cost. 

The whole reason McDonalds was successful was because it was cheap, fast, and good. As time went on, to be cheaper, they sacrificed good, and we were okay with that because it was even cheaper and we could embrace shitty food for a good price. Now shitty food for an expensive price tag? Fuck off. Do you think we're dumb pieces of shit? Know your place you dumb mother fuckers. You have a shitty product that people are okay with being shitty. They aren't okay with it if it costs as much as a high quality burger with freshly made fries and fresh ingredients with a great atmosphere, no fear of getting accosted by a homeless drug user, and good customer service. Figure your shit out you fuckin' dipshits and lower your prices.
It's not inflation, it's gouging, they're doing this all over the world.

It's like what $17 (CAD) here in Canada for a big mac meal...  I'd rather eat a steak at that price.
McDonald’s sales are falling because there are way better options at the same price point. Why would I pay $20 for a shitty burger when I could go up the street to an independent restaurant and get something ten times better at roughly the same price point? McDonald’s worked when it was cheap but now it’s just disappointing.
I go there to buy soft serves for my dog as a treat sometimes, maaaaybe chicken nuggets if I'm drunk/high.. otherwise it's garbage tbh (like most fast food tbf)
Too much money for 15% less meat in my burger. When I’m still hungry after dropping nearly $17.00 there’s a serious problem. Burger King hasn’t done any trickery with the size of their burger and I never leave there hungry for less than the same meal from The Clown Corporation
The only fast food I buy was Breakfast Jacks. 

They were 99 cents a coupla months ago.

They're $3.50 now.

That'd be a no for me, dawg.
Nothing beats home cooking
There's just no reason to go to Maccas anymore when the price is just as expensive as real food and the taste is worse.
Working man food my ass
It is a bit of money for average  and unhealthy food. 

It is also annoying when choosing to dine in, and then having to eat out of a paper bag on a grubby table. If they don't want to clean plastic trays they should at least provide a suitable cardboard alternative like KFC or maybe just be attentive to cleaning tables.
havent been to maccas in years but what is the current rate for something like a large big mac meal?

ubereats has it at around $16-17 for me but that just cannot be real
The whole point of competition is that people should've stopped buying these overpriced foods and buy other shit. Can't believe it took until now sales fell because priced were so high.
You can still get reasonable prices using the app but for a place that probably gets a lot of spur of the minute/drive through, it's too expensive now.
I’d rather pay an extra couple of bucks and go to grilld and eat a real burger and chips that dont bend.
Well no shit. 

I could get a pie and a coffee from 7 eleven for like $8, and that some fancy breakfast.
I'm struggling to afford *real* food
Good
U will be a lot healthier if u dont consume that crap
Unhealthy, mediocre taste the only thing it had going for it was low price and convenience and its now cheaper to just go buy a real meal from a restaurant than go to maccas lol
I know its a tired trope, but the last 3 times I've ordered a mustard sauce with my quarter pounder meal, I haven't got it. first time I checked at the window, and got given it. last 2 times was drive round to the parking bay and I forgot.

Yeah its only sauce, yeah they pay the kids bugger all and its a somewhat first-world problem, but when you get Maccas that's no longer cheap, no longer fast, often cold when you get it, tastes fairly bad unless its hot (rarely), is bad for you, and you get shortchanged on your order more often than not, then why would you?
I'm sure the staff will be happy. Everytime I went theyd be annoyed I'd be making them work. I felt like I had to beg them to serve me. 

Shit food and service. Big surprise. Inflation doesn't have anything to do with it.
It's absolute crap that isn't even cheap anymore which used to be the main drawcard. Save yourself the colon cancer and high cholesterol and eat elsewhere
Support local
Well yeah, the best thing about McDonald's was that you could get a lot of food for cheap, people weren't going there for the quality.
Bring back the Ribwich!
The problem is that Macca’s expects to make the same margins now as last year or the year before, with an increase in margin were possible… AND they expect sales to grow by 5% each year.

With inflation, ALL of their costs are going up, every single one. And they are still expected, by both licensees and Shareholders to keep hitting the 5% sales growth, and at least maintain the margins.

Think about it. Every single thing in a maccas store is squashed down and optimised into oblivion. It is an optimisation machine to print money, not a food store.

When every single cog in the cost side increases, but you cannot allow the margins to fall, you’re really fucked. Prices have to rise, and will hit your biggest audience (the lower social demographic) who eat there twice a week. (That’s an actual stat, not made up).

They should sink and burn, but they won’t. Because people will still keep going back because of the familiarity, they just won’t be going back as often. So prices need to cover that as well as the increased costs.
Also it’s expensive and poorly made.
I pretty much only get maccas now when there's a decent deal, like $5 for a medium meal or something, or $1 burgers.


Any other time it's straight up not worth it (in terms of cost, quality, or waiting time)
$5 for 3 McNuggets still makes me internally curse
I was shocked when I saw they’d gone up to $3! I’ll buy a bag and eat them at home.
$4.20 for a small coke? Get F*cked!
Breakfast menu now is even more ridiculous.  For less money I could get a BanhMi or even a Pho that really fills you up and is healthy. But to be the ham cheese and tomato  sandwich's are stupid prices in cafes as well. The whole takeaway food market in Australia is cooked.
Yeah, a massive global corporation like them has huge purchasing power and could buy hash browns, for example, at very low cost. They're just taking the piss with their prices.
Coupled with items shrinking in size
$3.15 at my local.
Yeah it’s like 25 cents worth of potato, maybe 10 cents of oil to fry it, and less than a dollar of employee wage to serve them up. 3 dollars per on an item where most folks buy at least a couple is daylight robbery.
Yeah. Maccas has priced themselves into the ‘good burger’ range, without the good burger… anything. Maccas was great when it was the cheap & nasty option… now it’s just nasty.
Yup! Sometimes local places are even cheaper and give you more food, too. McDonalds *should* be able to compete based on price because they have economies of scale on their side. They just don't want to because they can get away with charging more.
Hell, even within the fast food realm there are better options than maccas. Last time I checked hungry jacks still has a true “loose change” menu with I think $3.50 for a chicken burger, and kfc, while still pricey, is infinitely better than maccas. Apart from breakfast menu I wouldn’t choose maccas over any other fast food option
We have a local take away shop that does a traditional burger with *the lot* for 10 bucks... A bland double quarter pounder is like... 13-15 bucks just for the burger now?
Yeah there’s a smashed burger place near me that’s one of the best in Sydney. Cost $12 for a double stacked burger that tastes amazing and is massive. Why would I pay the same price for the crap they make at McDonalds?
yup exactly what I do now! I see fast food as a treat so want decent damn food!
I went to a cafe yesterday, I spent about what I would at Maccas, I got a Caesar salad so large I couldn’t finish it, and the nicest coffee I’ve had in a long while. It was such a great meal, way better than an old burger and cold fries.
Unfortunately the two giant 24/7 McDonald's in Launceston, both greatly expanded during Covid, have eliminated most competitors.  

The seppo fast food blight has not only made our citizens obese, pasty and sick, they have polarised our food outlets between 'rich' and 'poor'.
Exactly.  Skip the 2nd morning coffee, and pay a few dollars more for a better quality burger at the fisho or pub. McDonalds is garbage.
This 100%, $60 for a family chips, chicken, gravy and slaw from my local, miles better than maccas, and feeds us for days.
> Im not turning away from *fast food* it's simply going to better options.

This.

My local takeaway is $12 for a chicken burger, chips and a can of drink. It's a slab of real chicken (breaded) and you're stuffed full afterwards.
Yeah I can see that… fast food prices are so high, might as well go somewhere nicer. Paying $15 for cardboard just seems excessive 
I’m fucking done with it too, family of 4 cost $60 (we don’t get full meals for the kids, they’re still young), they missed the sauce from the happy meal as well as the extra sauce I ordered and paid for.

The kicker was I ate a leftover nugget from my daughter’s meal, and it was fucking stale as. Like hours old stale.

I was so pissed, we don’t do the takeout often, and it’s meant to be a treat for the kids. They only get away with it as we all drive through and don’t notice all the fuck ups until we get home.
Car fridge. Jaycar has some for under $200 this week. Waters, soft drinks, make up your favourite sandwiches the night before. Yes, all very old-school but you save a fortune. 

24 pack of 500 mL waters under $10 almost anywhere, watched someone pay $4.50 at the servo for one. Ugh.
> Maccas is purely for road trips where that's the only thing on offer at the freeway servo.

I'd occasionally (every couple of months) eat Maccas as a guilty treat, but after a few visits where it was just *shit* I swore off it. That was January of this year, I haven't been back.

And you're spot on: aside from road trips where there's zero other options I'll continue to avoid it.
Add to it shrinkflation. I’ve never been to a maccas where they’ve actually filled the chips packet and the burgers are much smaller than before.
Companies seeing what price they can 'get away with' is the way of the world now.  
Its not about giving customers value for money.  
Most companies that started with 1 or 2 people, sold out, are now run by boards etc. or are bought by private equity firms.
The story itself says the price of a Big Mac has increased 40% since 2019.
Covid taught the business masses how much an apathetic customer can take.

There's a lot of apathetic people out there....
Yeah I think the explosion of people ordering on Uber eats/other delivery platform where prices are marked up 30% gave them the idea of also raising in store prices a shitload

Gladly people have had enough of massively overpaying for cheap shit food
More like 283%, a soft serve was 30c now it’s what, $1.15
They'll offer "promotions" (through the app) for a few months then drop them once the heat is gone.
Access to pricing information via the internet has made it far easier for companies to know what their competitors are charging. And then raise it to match them..
Absolutely. Couple of grey beef patties in sweetened bread rolls with deep fried potato sticks, or a Pad See Ew for half the cost? No brainer. Go to your favourite ethnic restaurant .
For all the fast food chains, the app prices are the real prices. The standard prices are obscenely high and can't really be justified compared to a Cafe or local business. 

The apps have tricks though. Hungry jacks often have breakfast ones that are 1 item short of a meal. Macca's sometimes have ones where you need to spend 10 or 15 to get a saving, but you can be tricked into buying a bigger meal to get the benefit. KFC tend to be far more selective. Many franchises don't honour the app prices at all, and alot of the app deals end at 4pm.
I don’t have to use the app to buy something. Also Knowing that I can get the Burger for $3 taints the price selection every other time. The deal once a month vs $6.90 every other time I’ll just buy it once a month or possibly not at all because it’s impossible to think that deal up when I’m actually desperate/lazy enough want the food.
Pretty much. I only go if there’s a deal worth getting in the app. Paying full price is a slap in the face every other time.
It's not about giving the consumer choice. It's about MacDonald's double dipping. They attack your wallet but also sell off your information. Never. Get. These. Apps. You're fooling yourself. These companies aren't trying to help you.
That's just it. $15 for a meal? I can get a steak and chips from the pub for that. I just cook my food now and bring it to work.
And half the time you have to wait 20 minutes in the parking bay because they’re also cheaping out on staff. So convenience isn’t even a selling point either anymore. I was stuck in the drive thru for an hour at Maccas last week (it was a drive thru with only one lane, and people were behind me, so I was literally stuck).
I have a story to tell you about Carls Jr..
They stay in business because their real business is real estate. The franchisees make most of the money from the food, the body corporate makes money off of thr franchisee lease and fees.
Through its coffee. Go past any Macca's between 5-630am and you see the drive thru packed with tradies getting coffee
The brand mostly
By being the only place you can get food from after 9 p.m. When I'm going to a concert, I don't really feel like having dinner at 5:30 p.m. and post-show Maccas is the only option.
Tired of ultra processed crap being 70% of the supermarket shelves and food
The nuggets are inedible now. I couldn't believe how bad they are. It's like they made a chicken sponge material 

Chucking some frozen tempura nuggets in the airfryer makes way superior nuggets.

Just need to find a good sweet and sour sauce
Should rename it the Below Average Sized Mac
I think maybe a lot longer than 20 years ago, it’s been the same size my entire life. Remember 20 years ago was 2004.
Don't look at the cost of the drinks then,.

A large coke that costs them all of about $0.50 (and that's being generous) they're selling for like $4.50
$10.90 for a 6 nugget happy meal with a toy made out of card board
Yeah the restaurants are always filthy
I can get a good takeaway near work in the city for $12. Dumplings, karaege, banh mi, rice and pork etc etc. All much much more substantial than a dinky little small combo meal that's designed to make you even more hungry in an hour.
I used to budget $3-$4 a meal at my last job. $12 was a whole days food budget for me. Sure my food was boring, but it was filling and fairly nutritious. 


Even though I'm back into a higher paying job, I only get maccas when I'm desperate and need something fast (once a month max). Anything else I would rather grab a pack of croissants from supermarket and eat them instead.
10 years ago, $12 got me 2 Sausage egg muffins, 2 bacon and egg muffin and 2 hashbrowns. 12$ for a single meal IS expensive for what it used to be.
Err, Grilld is getting pretty overpriced too right now.
Super disappointed in grilld the last time I was there, $30 for burger fries and a drink for mediocre quality
And you can do a Michael Douglas in Falling Down.
…what
Even the kids are calling it plastic now. They still ask for it sometimes,  but recently discovered that our local kebab joint does great burgers that are cheaper and chips that are actually crunchy.  

Bonus is I can get a gozleme for myself too, and it's a small family run place that benefits, not a multi-national chain.
They're 6.30 now, that's a fucked price
"Lean Optimisation", its really good at upsetting staff, unions, and customers, but it makes shareholders really happy. Basically flip your whole empire into running like you're barely solvent, squeezing every cent you can, and then wonder why your drop in quality hasn't resulted in increased profits. Its popular because a bunch of specific metrics that investors love go up, even if your actual revenue-profit split doesn't really change, which is sort of the point: "We're not making as much money as we'd like to, but look at all these really abstract metrics increasing every quarter. Smart investors like yourselves know that its more than just profits, you are a smart investor aren't you?".
Could you elaborate on why buying from Maccas would be supporting genocide?
I did 10 years ago. Kids still demand it for special occasions. Even then I buy for the kids. I don't eat any of it and I don't buy anything for me.
I'd also make the argument that during COVID there was also a massive explosion of local burger joints (especially here in WA). The pure quality is what does it for me. Macca's is overrated
Uh.. you know your maccas
Exactly!
After years of being disappointed with the taste, it was finally staff tat made me stop going. Walked in and there was one guy wiping up, who told me to order off a giant iPad. The one thing I felt Maccas had going for it was giving (shitty) entry level work experience to kids. Once they got to cheap to even hire staff, I was out. Plus why pay to serve myself?

Same reason I recently noped out of supermarkets.
My dude, i thought i was the only one who bought soft serves for dog treats. Glad to know I'm not the only tragic out there!
I thought the local fish and chip shop charging 1 dollar per nug was outrageous, but I kept on buying them because the kids said they're far superior to maccas ones.
Going to tell them to go nuts for Friday take out now!
You can get 20 of the little fuckers for $11.95 on promo or 24 for $14.60 off promo.
Really? It's literally $12 for 24 nuggets. Their pricing structure is fucked
Damm you're better off getting a happy meal for an extra 1.50$.
what the actual fuck
24 for $9.95 is good though
I don't eat them and I know its not the same but you can get a box of about 20 nuggets from Aldi for $2.59!
That's crazy. Got three nuggies, a whopper jr and small chips for $5 at hungrys today.
The nuggets taste so bad now days anyway, I had one from a friend hoping it would taste like nuggets from my childhood...

It was so bland and not crispy
they use McCains hashbrowns.

it's listed on their website under the McDonalds Australia suppliers page. 

you can buy a bag of McCain's hashbrowns for $5.
Some years ago when I was in the army, the mess manager installed a coke post-mix machine. I asked her if she was going to start looking after us and better and her response was, no, the post-mix coke was 5c per glass cheaper than the Cottees cordial.
I make my own sausage and egg mcmuffins now. Costs less than $20 to get eggs, sausage mince, sliced cheese and a bag of English muffins, and I can make 6 huge ones to freeze for later.


Those same 6 mcmuffins would cost close to $40 from maccas now, and they're both smaller and taste worse.
they use McCains hashbrowns.


it's listed on their website


you can buy a bag of McCain's hashbrowns for $5.
Most insane thing is that the farmers who grew the potato gets about 20 cents out of the 3 dollars they charge for the hash brown
Yep.

And the stores are filthy. 

And it's not fast food anymore. I miss when they used to have the burger pre-made and you could be in and out. 

Now everyone does their order online or at the kiosk and you have no idea how many orders are ahead of you, and how long you'll have to wait.
Also it's supposed to be the fast option. But you're now waiting with delivery drivers collecting huge orders. Not even fast anymore either
Macca's was always running on the value proposition, not the quality one. They have forgotten this.
Prior to 2020 I'd always be impressed with maccas cleanliness and professionalism of staff. That's gone out the window now. The dine in experience has turned to shit as they seem to preference delivery and drive thru.
30 years ago the burgers didn't look like they were put together by hamsters on crack
Maccas beef burgers are honestly disgusting lol, 5mm patty
The only reason I get maccas is when I’m long distance driving. It’s quick and somewhat consistent across restaurants. There’s also few places to get food at 1am unless I want a crappy petrol station pie
McDonalds used to be perfectly acceptable though, the little cheeseburgers were great, a couple of Big Macs hit the spot, the McDLT was the best thing they ever did, its a death of a thousand cuts, they shrink and cut corners and etc etc, and what you are left with is a Stabilized Food Product resembling the food it used to be.
This is the thing I can never understand about big companies.
They must be making so much money as it is but they try so hard to make more and more and squeeze as much as they can to the point it just gets ridiculous
Yeah this. If I want a fast food burger I go to Hungry Jack's now. The burgers are bigger/actually filling, have a variety of taste, and have plenty of sauce (seriously what's with Maccas skimping on sauce and serving dry burgers lately?).

Some of this might be specific to the Maccas and HJs in my area but it's certainly been my experience at least.
> and kfc, while still pricey, is infinitely better than maccas

KFC can be better than maccas, but it can also be infinitely worse. 

Some stores are terrible, and even at the same store the quality can vary between visits. 

While Maccas' peak isn't as good, they are far more consistent in their quality.
And there's Oporto, where the food actually has flavour, unlike last time we got Jacks...
Yeah, I paid $9.40 for a quarter chicken and chips, everything cooked fresh from my local charcoal chicken. Who do they think they're fooling with these prices?
Come on, name names.
This sounds impossible. Please tell us where it is.
Look at the big brain on Bret
Recently cracked the shits with maccas and swore off it a couple months ago. Sick of getting burgers that look like they've been put together by blind people throwing ingredients across the room to hear if it'll land in the fkn box. Then they touch it all up with messy gloves full of fat and grease/mayo. 

Haven't missed it at all. I can get a full meal - burger with the lot + chips and 600ml drink for around $15 down the road at a local lunch bar and it's a shit tonne better quality than the slop maccas has ever served up (even on a 'good' day).
I am currently owed 3 big macs, 2 large fries, 2 happy meals, one large sprite and 1 large thickshake from my local maccas for missing items in either drive-thru or delivery orders over a few months... they actually have a list of customers to come and get their food that's missing. That's how shit they are. They know it's shit. After disappointment so many times the kids hate it too.
This pissed me off more than anything. I can understand inflation but shrinking them at the same time is just taking the piss. 

When a Big Mac is barely bigger than a cheeseburger you know that’s fucked.
I had carls jnr yesterday (because pity party) and I ordered a double patty burger for my partner, thinking it would be like a big mac. The thing had a massive diameter compared to big mac. 
My Big Mac patties were literally see through.

As in so thin, some places had holes.  Literally.
That bc there a no tap policy on the box fill.
It's an insult. Like fair enough they have to charge a lot more than the base cost of the food to cover all of their other expenses, but those fries don't cost them shit. They're saving a few cents by skimping on them.
If the chips aren't full and piping hot, ask for a replacement. I've never been refused.
They have scientists trying to come up with new technology to make the burgers in a Big Mac thinner.
Recently bought a "large" sundae... "pathetic" was strangely the word that came to mind. To my mind, a large soft-serve ice-cream cup should look and feel something like the size of a can of coke in the hand. What I got was more like the size of those plastic cups given out for the water cooler in a waiting room. I don't know whether it's the shrinkflation that frustrates me, or whether it's the misuse of the English language because, like, I would have no idea what to call a size smaller or a size bigger, but I simply can't imagine them called, respectfully, medium or extra large.
Maccas fries shrinkflation has nothing on KFC large chip shrinkflation.

Have not had KFC in years and was literally shocked at the pathetically thing Large chip box.
The last two times I went there the chips were maybe halfway full. I was so cranky about it, but the good news is it inspired me to find out where I can get a really good burger and chips near me for the same price.
You're unfortunately VERY correct. With so many companies being owned by shareholders, they're incentivised to pump up costs whilst their expenditure barely increases. Because they need to keep the board and the shareholders happy. 

So they've gotta minimize expenses and maximize profit. Customers be damned. They're the disgusting poors who'll buy their product, no matter what, right? 

It's not like the cost of every single facet of living being increased could cause customers to cut out non-vital services. Right? Just keep forcing up prices. Our company is the only one that exists and matters.
This is the problem with the way businesses are structured in 2024. "Innovation" isn't new products or services, or cheaper ways of doing business. It's maximising extracting wealth from customers without providing anything else. It's adding a recurring fee to every step of a value chain, increasing the price of items while shrinking their size and quality. It's "giving discounts" that are still well above inflation to people in return for harvesting their user data.
Raising display pricing is in line with the many other businesses forcing customers into loyalty apps. It’s a way of offering a “discount” (in reality a slightly less overcharged price point) in return for cheaper direct marketing access and lucrative data selling opportunities. See also FlyBuys, Everyday Rewards and so on. We’re so close to Prime-like subscriptions from absolutely every aspect of our consumption where we’re expected to “pay to pay less”.
A succulent Chinese meal?
People shouldn't have to use an app to buy a hamburger without getting ripped off, though.
The app from both KFC and Maccas allow you to order the 4PM ending deals at any time after that.  But yeah the app deals are the only time we ever get the stuff, used to be great when Maccas had the family boxes in the app and you could combine it with the 40% off offers which ended up great deals but now they took the boxes off the app so you can't stack deals.
Fuck, didn’t know that. I don’t use the app. I’m a programmer, not against apps or technology, but it needs to provide an actual benefit.

Why the fuck do I need to stop what I’m doing to tap an order into my phone when I can just say “Medium Quarter Pounder meal” at drive thru?
[deleted]
Let me fucking know where
The only place I know of that does steaks for $15 is the most trash mushy roast beefy T-bone steaks at a pub no less.
With fast food, you get two of the following: fast, good and cheap.

Maccas doesn’t even seem to be hitting one.
im guessing its not a good one
It's safe in QLD, thankfully.
Macca's coffee is fkn toilet water
why would anyone get a maccas coffee when 7/11 has objectively better coffee! it was even better when it was $1.
I think it actually costs them 0.02 cents or something like that.  Its very very cheap for them.
Small coke - $4.35

Medium coke - $5.35

Large coke - $5.85
The McDonalds manager recently caught on video drying a mop head under the fry station heater. Ie holding the mop over the fries ready to be served.
Initially I stopped buying Macca's when they announced that they were [providing free food](https://x.com/McDonaldsIL/status/1714642542124241149) to IDF soldiers and then [bought out all the Israeli locations after backlash.](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/05/israel-boycott-mcdonalds-will-buy-all-225-restaurants-from-franchise.html) They still operate in Israel, so I think the buyout was an empty gesture at best. When Russia invaded Ukraine [they temporarily closed](https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-mcdonalds-closes-restaurants/31743326.html) then permanently shut down.  Also, profits dropped this quarter, so it feels as though voting with my wallet was the right choice. 
on her birthdays she gets a happy meal sometimes (without onions), absolutely loves it haha

but that's all maccas is... dog food.

for the price it is now, I'd rather go to a local restaurant/burger joint, significantly better quality and supporting local for a few dollars more.
Get some from the freezer section of the supermarket. Same mechanically reclaimed meat product, only takes a few mins to cook.
My local has onion rings 80c each or 4 for $2.50 because in truth they want to sell the whole onion in one go
They’re not wrong; the nugs from the chippy ARE much better!
So sad to see "take away" is now "take out" on an Australian sub. Y'all making me sad.
You can still get 24 nuggets for $12 from Maccas.
I’m in the States at the moment - I just checked and the Maccas up the street is A$23.70 for 20 nuggets. WTF?

(I’ve had Maccas once in the past 10 years, I had no idea it had gotten so $$$!)
Gods I wish I could still eat 20 of them. I tap out around 4 or 5 nowadays
Promo? Oh you mean when they've got too many and they're about to go off.
It's 24 for $11.95.
10c hash brown, $2.90 for the culinary experience.
You can also get the McNuggets 2nds at the Steggles factory outlets. A bag of 30 nugs was $5 from memory?
Thank youuuuu! I crave them all the time after the gym so this'll be good for my wallet.
Where do you get sausage mince? I've tried to make my own with pork mince but it wasn't very good.
$5.80 for 750g of the suckers at Woolworths. Of course frying them in oil will add to the cost, but even so. It's an insane mark up for very little value add or effort saved.
> And it's not fast food anymore. I miss when they used to have the burger pre-made and you could be in and out.

I'm an ex McDonalds employee from many years ago, now we have the worst of every world. Waiting for food that was cooked 15 mins ago and getting the chips that sat there since you ordered. I actually wouldn't mind waiting if anything was fresh. KFC I regret after I eat it, these days I regret McDonalds when I get my order.

None of the principles of Ray Kroc's McDonalds exist today.
That's all due to running with the absolute bare minimum staff needed. I can't go anymore because I get rage at it taking 20 minutes to get nuggets and chips at drive thru. I understand its not the fault of the 15 year olds there so I just don't go.
I went to one and ordered through the app, they said it would be ready in 5 minutes. I get the notification that it’s ready 10 minutes after I took the order. Still had to wait an additional 20 minutes, totaling 30 minutes. A 25 minute difference than estimated? For just 20 nuggets? 

Nah. I’m going somewhere else if I’m waiting 30 minutes for lukewarm, stale nuggets and 3 sauces maximum.
That's what pisses me off the most, once upon a time you knew that places like KFC and Maccas weren't great food, but it was quick and cheap, now you'll be waiting and pay extra anyway, why bother.
I know right?  Give me the trays behind the counter full of ready to go cooked burgers so they can have mine in a bag and handed to me in 10 seconds.  

How is it better to have to use an app or a stupid kiosk or wait forever in a drive thru?

Why would I even go to McDonald’s now?  It’s not fast and it’s not convenient.  So what is it?
The kiosks are covered in greasy fingerprints and the people that work there don't wear gloves.
> I miss when they used to have the burger pre-made and you could be in and out.

Yeah they took the Hungry Jacks point of difference but it isn't the same. Maccas has been doing this for quite awhile.
I worked there many years ago now and I can tell you the reason they have pre-made burgers ready to go any time is because the managers continuously refresh the timers on the meat. Once it is cooked it is supposed to go into some metal containers but only for up to an hour or around that (I forget specifics). But anyway the managers would come along every 30-60 minutes and simply refresh the timers on them rather than throwing the meat out like they were supposed to.

On one hand it saves meat from getting wasted on the other hand it can't be healthy otherwise it wouldn't be regulation to get rid of them.
That's capitalism for you. The expectation is that a "successful" company will make more money year over year, but how do you do that if you're McDonalds and you already have about as much market saturation as possible? So many companies destroy the success they have because they're not satisfied simply to make a healthy profit.
Blame Jack Welch, no seriously, blame him, he was an evil piece of shit that inspired or outright invented many of the corporate practices that have made our lives worse.

Stack ranking? Him. Shifting income around to meet 'targets'? Him. Selling off profitable businesses to bump share prices a tiny bit only to cost them more money in the long term? Him. Outsourcing? Him. Offshoring? Him.

The impact that vile person had on the world is just staggering. He shifted things from corporations being able sustainable long term growth and profit into "NUMBER GO UP! SHARE PRICE!" mind-set where it doesn't matter if a choice you make will kill your company in five years so long as it gives you a stock market bump today.
Their ultimate double whopper is as good as any gourmet burger around the place, and it's a hell of a lot cheaper at $13 or so.  Most of the time that thing takes me from starving to chockers.
My only objection to HJs is that they can be real slow
Oh my gosh I thought it was just me and bad luck with the super dry burgers lately!
McFucked actually
The thing that pisses me off on top of that is the gaslighting. 

"Our products are still the same size and quality they always have been."  

Get fucked they are.
Well meat on a Big Mac has always been 2/10th of a pound in meat, which is the most expensive part.
And they're pulling out of Australia
That’s probably more about the store not cleaning the grill properly or changing out old Teflon’s causing the meat to stick and tear when cooked.
Yes, the capitalist mindset is profits over everything.

George Costanza 'we're living in a society!'
Yes, the whole system is corrupt.
Indeed sir. Are you waiting to receive my limp penis?
I don't.


I just stopped buying from McDonald's, KFC, etc years ago. 


They ceased being a cheap meal.


If I'm on a road trip and there is literally no other option, maybe, MAYBE. 


but I'm old now, so who knows.
Woolies taking their shot with this via "members pricing"
You can read the code at drive thru and order that way. It seems like the only decent deal you can get. It’s annoying that you can’t do it directly through the app though. We also upgrade the burgers and it still works out way cheaper than individual meals. Not that we have it often as the price just isn’t worth it anymore.
my local does lunch deals for $15 -  $18 for steak and chips. Norton's has $23 steak and chips and schooner every day. Of course it's subsidised by pokies money...
A pub near me does a huge schnitzel with chips, salad AND a pint for $20. $22 for the parmi deal.
Steak night you can still find deals like this
Went belly up 2 days ago.
It can be hit and miss, one near me is always piss, two others near me is drinkable (helps to get an extra shot to mask the crap milk a bit more). 

Not a ton of options at 5am though if you're going somewhere (and I struggle to make my own coffee at 5am lol)
It's that or Muzz Buzz if you want a coffee so early while also wanting to stay in the ute. 


At least Macca's have moved on from filter coffee 
tbh I've had far worse. It's not great, but not terrible. Try hungry jacks coffee...
That's only been a thing for a decade. Macca's has had way longer to build brand loyalty 
cause at 7/11 you have to get out of the car.
The majority of the price is the cup you put it in.

Seriously. The actual drink costs like $0.03, and the cup probably costs around $0.10 to $0.15.

Which is why they're happy to give you free refills.
Shows how often I actually go to chew-and-spew.

My figures are way out of date!
Get fuuuuuucked. I didn’t hear of this. As if we need another reason to boycott those cunts. Who even needs a dry mop wtf
I've been looking for an excuse to purchase a deep fryer!
Thank you friend!

Edit: have a lot of replies suggesting an air fryer.........No, I'm not a communist!
Reading “reclaimed meat” made me throw up a little and never want nuggets again…
Tempura seconds from Inghams factory store used to be $25 for 5kg.

They are where maccas gets them.
You can get proper chicken breast ones pretty cheap too
[deleted]
Ugh, you're right!
In my defence I lived in the states for over a decade.

Also ,LOL and Y'all!!!
Holy shit!
Where abouts? $6usd in San Francisco, one of the highest COL areas in the country.
Burger King were doing 10nugs for $2 here for a while too.
Nothing will make you homesick faster than eating American fast food. It’s sooo shit compared to its Aussie equivalents.
I have a 16yo rugby and soccer playing son. He can sit down with a box and the contents will be gone in a couple of minutes.
Depending where and at what time, it can also be a cultural experience
Do they deep fry them? If they do, then part of it is not fucking around with deep-frying at home.
You joke but it probably isn't that far from the truth.  $2.90 from say, $20 minimum wage is like 8 minutes of time. Fry time, serving, and clearing the bin.


That said, any decent restaurants are packaging meals and using the whole docket as their metric, not individual item RRPs
Give that man a medal 🥇 I have the exact same issue
Woolies has it. Should be in the same section as the mince. Comes in a little plastic "tube" similar to polony.
they used to be $3.90 before they hiked the price up.




for years I used to have them as a staple in my freezer and buy 1 bag every 2nd week.


it had been the $3.90 price for 5 years and then 18 months ago shot up in price.. 


now all frozen bagged potato products are in the $5.50 price. 


I don't buy them as often now. 
Well said
Same here, but if you remember back in the pre-made days, there was a lot of wastage. Burgers could only sit for 15-20 mins before being thrown out, hence the swapping of timers to keep em going.
Lean Optimization; make a profit by running your business like its about to collapse, then wonder why no one wants your product when everyone else is responsive to demand.
Going *in* the store is the worst experience I think you could find at any possible venue. Using the self ordering terminals is like getting lost at IKEA. When you finally get to the payment screen the machines have always run out of paper and the number only shows for a second so of course I miss it, or your payment doesn’t go through and it says “pay at the counter.” You go to the relic of a former customer service counter and stand there watching staff kinda run around in a frantic fashion while also ignoring you. Get further ignored for 10 minutes until you kinda just say out loud “the machine said I have to come here. Do you have my order?” Some 15 year old says, “no, not until it’s paid.” You leave the store feeling annoyed, frazzled, a bit guilty for bothering the staff but also like you’ve been fucked over with a $23 bag of shit and the fries stink the car out but it’s better than eating in store.
Yep it's legitimately quicker to go to a local cafe or burger joint and get a takeaway order and you might spend $5 more in total
I went on a Friday night a couple of months ago (forgetting it was Friday) and there were so many people there it almost kicked off. I've sworn many times never to go back and after the recent visit, I really am never going back. Took at least 30 mins to get food and there were 2 supposed 'security guards' there being total pricks to the general public. One of them nearly started a fight with a member of the public (twice as big as he was) and I'd decided if did kick off and both guards started on the public guy, I was going to help him out and deck them (they were both pricks to me as well)... I'm a super chilled dude and it takes a lot to piss me off but that afternoon in McDonalds i was fucking raging... Last time I set foot in that place.
The fast food places in the town I live in are like a revolving door. You never see the same employee twice.
> work there don't wear gloves.

Subway is pretty much the only hospo joint in Australia that uses gloves. Gloves are far more unsanitary as it gives the illusion that your hands are always clean.
I will 100% die on that hill. The ultimate double whopper is absolutely elite. Huge burger and cheaper than any of the “gourmet” garbage from maccas.
There fries are much more superior too, instead of greasy noodles they give you at macca's
And not only them. HJs, KFC, Nandos, etc all fucking do it. 

Just like we get in trouble with undersized fish, KFC and Nandos should be questioned on why their chooks are consistently undersized.
Kicked right in the mc nuggets mate
Only outside of QLD. Existing QLD stores are a different franchise agreement and are untouched. 

QLD seems to be consistently the place where these things thrive and survive.
Not doubting that happens but the patties themselves were genuinely very thin, thinner than I remember.

It’s as though they forgot that meat shrinks a little as it cooks.
Numbers go up = good. 

That's literally all that matters to them.
Not in SA thankfully.
Nothing like deep fried reclaimed chicken. Power to you, mate.
Inghams Tempura nuggets, air frier. Ten minutes. Come out crispy.
Do it. You won't look back. Chips just how you like them. Make your own fried chicken. Fish. Brussel sprouts. All the nibbles you see in the freezer at the supermarket, much better fried than baked. We have a Tefal Oleoclean, works very well.

The thing will pay for itself in less than six months. Just have some discipline :)
Air fryer is boss for cheap nuggs and better for fat intake too. Especially good for kids.
If you've already got a dutch oven you can use it to deep fry.
An air fryer is just a small convection oven. I don't care how many people argue the case, it is not even remotely as good as a deep fryer. It's a bullshit tiny oven, that just happens to cook a bit faster. /rant
Go the air fryer, healthier and not that much slower.
A deep fryer is legitimately a money saving investment.

Can do junk food at home for a fraction of the cost and very fresh.

Chips, nuggets, dim sims, chicken strips, chicken Kiev, potato cakes, Mars bars, Asian dumpling things. 

Probably not a good idea to use it every night but ours definitely gets a work out. Probably saves electricity compared to an oven. Great in summer because it's only on for a little bit so won't heat the house like a oven.
I just use a saucepan with oil in it on the stove, then use coffee filters and pour the oil back into a jar for next time. The oil lasts at least 2 weeks/ 3 fry ups.
Just roast em in the oven.

But I grabbed one of these w few years back 

https://www.kmart.co.nz/product/3l-deep-fryer-with-timer-42336426/

Always workerd a treat.
It's meat that would otherwise be wasted when chicken is stripped. The meat that the knives don't reach would otherwise be discarded so they put the bones etc into a machine that literally shakes the rest of the meat off the bones. This is shaped, compressed, crumbed and frozen. 

So funny - ages ago Jamie Oliver did a cooking for kids special. He showed them the reclaimed meat method, like you all the kids going "urgh, gross, yuck!". Then he made some from nice fillets, good breading fresh egg etc. All the kids still went for the reclaimed meat ones.
Or just crumb your own fresh breast fillet :)
My 6 year olds record was 17. Not the best parenting but was impressive to watch.
I had a mate back in the day that would always order 7+ cheeseburgers and a Sunday. He would stack them into a tower then smash the lot. Skinny fella too.
And they'll come flying out his arse a few minutes after that
Really should reference them when you quote a prime minister, Scott Morrison’s most endearing story is sacred.
Air fryer!!!
If u brush with oil and air fry it's literally the same shit tbh
I airfry hashbrowns and they come up awesome.
Yeah but they ain't spending a whole 8 minutes on only the one hash brown even when considering that. Even if the total of all steps to make and serve the hash brown takes 8 minutes they're usually cooking the hash browns in batches or serving them as part of a meal, and the bins get changed when they've got dozens of customers meal remnants in them rather than just after the one little wrapper.

Might also be worth noting that McDonalds yearly profit jumped up significantly around 2021 and this fall leaves the final number well above those figures too, it's just the typical corporate hysteria that happens whenever line go down.
That was the skill, right? And even then, cook any burger from scratch in about 4mins, 10-1 in about 2mins and the fries were probably still fresh by the time you got your burger. You could serve someone buying a large meal in under 30secs. Completely different game - I actually loved it as a kid, there was a lot of skill involved to doing things as fast as humanly possible - safely - and presentably. Easily 9 out of 10 meals at McDonalds I am dissatisfied with. If you've worked there for any length of time, you know how old the food is by look and feel alone.
And blame the staff for the resultant inefficiency
Every store smells like shit too. I have no idea why people go there or eat the food.  I understood when it was 50c cheeseburgers and 2 can dine for  $6.99, but I don’t understand that shit anymore.  It’s gross, you feel gross when you’re in there, it looks and smells gross in there, and you feel gross after you eat there.  How much addictive chemicals do they put in this shit that people look past all the standard “don’t eat here” warnings from your body, and yet, still eat there?
Holy shit the thing with the terminals is so true....
If there's no paper, instead of holding the number up on the screen for a little bit longer....no... We'll flash it up for a microsecond...

Tell the staff that machine is ran out of paper and they just look at you like "we don't care" and heaven forbid you ask them what your order number was...........

I'm looking at you South Launceston McDonald's and every other McDonald's ever........
Ten mins for a feed when you call ahead at the local fish and chips and a 5 min walk and sit down and eat without any dramas compared to s potential 20+ min wait in your car at a drive through 5 deep. I'm all good to walk!
It's because they are actually Quail
I'm lovin it
They are put in poor areas... 3 in Ipswich
Honestly your memory is lying to you. There have been very little tweaks to the burgers over the years. The Patties haven’t changed. Small burgers are 10 to a pound, quarters are 4 to a pound of beef. 

The chips… well some stores are just shit at quality control.
It's just a matter of time. There is a critical mass on these businesses. You can't close 20 stores and still be just as profitable at the remaining 25.
Or QLD apparently.
I said deep fryer, I'm not looking for any fancied up and "healthy" way of cooking nugs.
Oh it's getting done my Good redditor!
Yeah, I’ve cooked kids in them before. They come out crispy, but still juicy.
Yep, done that but have to monitor the temp, adjust the flame etc etc.

Deep fryer is set and forget
Thank you!!!!
The sole use for aerosole olive oil is to oil the food instead of the implement.

Nuggets or nugé as I call em are food technologized to be cooked in oil of some sort. Dunno the specific starch/bread/glue ratio but a spray of (qualify) oil on the breading, then airfryer gives me best results. Crisp outside, decent browning, same time and temp as any other (160C) standard airbake. Just flip em 2/3 of the way thru. 

Dammit I hate these things. Just flatten, shape, then bread some chicken and shallow fry it in oil/butter mix for healthier three digit ingredient-free equivalent food. Season the breading to taste. Magic easy food you can sauce up for yourself how you like or give plain to ketchup dippers. All 👍
It’s super convenient though, and frozen shit you buy at the supermarket is already pretty drenched in oil so for all intents and purposes it fries them.

Similar to how Arnott’s shapes are “Baked not fried”, but of course they coat them in oil before baking so they still taste fried.
I'd never heard that phrase before so wikipediad it, and now I see eating nuggets as as akin to composting.
Nah, as long as it's not all the time. My boys are skinny but super active and can eat whatever they want. We just make sure 2-3 meals they have are packed with vegies. My son will eat 6-7 pieces of KFC and then something like 2 oranges and an apple.
I mean, cheese burgers are fucking tiny though.
Ha! The kid started developing a taste for KFC's Zinger boxes until he starting what he told me felt like white hot liquid out of this arsehole.
Air fryers are good, but they're just portable ovens.
Don’t even need oil tbh 

And they’re always freaking perfect with that nice scrape with a knife sound on the outside
Its all about shuffling a bunch of numbers, laying off workers and then in July showing a bunch of graphs of weird numbers that are almost entirely divorced from revenue and expenses, going up.
> It's because they are actually Quail

No wonder I was still hungry after eating a 9 piece chicken box from KFC for lunch, and I've totally given up on Nandos since their whole chook is a light meal at best.
Yup, and statistically those in lower socioeconomic areas spend more on take out and fast food than those in higher socioeconomic areas. There’s a reason you see fast food in poor suburbs and fancy cafes in rich suburbs. Different demographics and spending habits.
> Small burgers are 10 to a pound, quarters are 4 to a pound of beef. 

The weight can stay the same, but the content can vary wildly.
I wouldn't really call an air fryer particularly healthy haha. Just quicker, crispier and easier then a regular oven
They are still very unhealthy, even if done in an airfryer. There's just less clean up.
Deep frying at home isn’t cheap or practical.
Make sure you rinse them really well first though. Who knows where those little grubs have been.
It's all in the timing.
And over $5 each now
Didn't need details about your kid's messy BMs but I accept responsibility for bringing it up
Ovens are good, but they're just portable furnaces.
Different kind of oven though… they’re an impingement oven instead of a convection oven. That’s where the air fryer magic is.
Look, we all agree they're unhealthy,  no one's disputing that. Cooking them seems to be the part everyone's getting hung up on.
I say cook it the way you want.


NUGS FOREVER!!!!!!!
But it's delicious.
Furnaces are good, but they're just portable forest fires.
Forest fires are good, but they are just stored up solar energy.
