I woke up this morning to see $129 charged from Dick Smith. Looking at reviews, it looks like this has happened to a lot of people. On their site they are charging $129 for some subscription member service which i did not sign up to. Is this legal?

Dick Smith/Kogan often adds 'FIRST' membership as a 14-day free trial when you make a purchase. Then it's on you to opt out. It's incredibly misleading and in my opinion a borderline unfair contract. Have to make sure you haven't accepted that free trial when you're checking out.
It happened to me through Kogan FIRST. They make it so confusing with ads, windows, colourful logos and tick boxes everywhere I forgot to cancel, they charged me. Contact them via email and explain how mad you are, that you think its downright robbery (they're getting kicks from this) they should refund you.

They refunded me.
This happened to me a little while ago and I found out then that it’s a very common problem with Kogan / Dicksmith. I complained to Kogan about it more than once to try and get my money back. Luckily the transaction was made through PayPal, so I lodged a dispute with them and got my money back.
Just request a refund and say you never ordered the membership.  I have done this and was refunded.

They know it’s predatory behaviour and won’t deny requests.  They are banking that most won’t ask for the refund
Nope. 

Don't know why people still order junk from Dick Smith when everyone knows it's just a Kogan front.
This will be implicit consent for something you'd signed up to that includes a trial. It's allowable by law because they make it known upfront, but you might overlook the text -- many, many people do; just about anything with a free trial is an implicit consent contract.
Are you sure you didn't buy from them and subscribe to get free postage and didn't realise what you were doing?
Thanks for this reminder to cancel my Kogan First membership. Found it completely pointless post-Covid
Yes 🤦🏽‍♂️
Its owned by Kogan, is only online, and sells the same stuff AFAIK.  
Why not just buy from Kogan?
I got caught with this on Kogan. I left a furious review and they refunded
Never shopped there, but Kogan just seems as dodgy as fuck whenever I've googled for things. Half their shit seems to be reseller marketplace.
Omg thanks for letting me know. Ugh now I’m trying to get a refund. What a disgusting operation. How is this legal!?

Yep. I can barely afford rent so I'm still trying to recover from it 🙃 Nothing I can do either, it's on me for not checking my junk box for the ambiguous email that suggested the First bullshit was about to come out.
Fell for it via Kogan. Canceled it straight away
“Has anyone else become a victim of the dick”

(Crowd raises hands)

“. . . Smith scam”

(Crowd lowers hands)
It’s a shame that good old dick smiths name gets dragged through the mud now because he sold the business.
Would recommend anyone having this issue report it to ACCC, they don’t resolve individual disputes, but if it’s a recurring behaviour that might be in breach of the law then they will investigate and pursue action which should disincentivise future behaviour.
Happened to me. 

I threatened to do a chargeback through my bank and report them to the ACCC - got my money back.
Fitbit does the same.
On checkout you were given the option to enrol in their subscription to get discount+free shipping+credit, or pay more for an item. If you subsequently decline the subscription, it nags you again a second time with a full screen page.

On both of these screens, the 14-day free trial and $129/yr fee are mentioned as well as a prompt that you're agreeing to the T&Cs.

While it's clearly predatory and designed specifically so that you forget to cancel, particularly without a monthly option, 'scam' is a bit of a stretch for what is essentially an annual benefits/discount subscription like eBay Plus, Prime, OnePass, Uber One etc.

Best you can do is ask nicely for a refund.
Thank you so much for posting this. I thought I’d been hacked or something - I had no memory of signing up for anything.
Dicks everywhere…😳
Horrible. Especially in this economy
Dick Smith still operating???
Same. I sent a disgruntled email saying I was very disappointed and got a refund. Don't know what would have happened if I hadn't spotted it on the first occurrence.
i hope you raised a refund request
Kogan did this to my wife (on MY credit card 🤔). I'm lucky I caught it, I usually don't monitor the statement on a regular basis. Fortunately they refunded the full amount once she contacted them, the possibility of which isn't mentioned in the fine print. So my advice to anyone similarly afflicted would be to ring up and play nice for as long as it takes to get your $$ back, then unload afterwards (because it is pretty borderline practice for a big company)
Yeah i sold my shares in kogan... they can die now.
Happened to me too. Kogan who i guess is also DS, has a 14 day change your mind policy on the membership. I can't remember the link i used to refund it, but there are heaps of help on Google as so many people have been caught out.
Also make a compliant via your state’s commission. NSW Fair Trading for example. 

On their website site there is also template email you can send to Dick Smith when you contact them asking for refund. 

As you as you mention you will/have made a complaint about them to the commission- they will refund you promptly
I was this morning and wouldn't have known why if not for this post and the comments. This is shady practices at best and illegal at worst.
I shall be calling the ombudsman on Monday and encourage others to do the same. It's not OK they get away with this. The more who complain the quicker they'll be investigated and stopped.
Tell them how they took money without permission or authorisation and about the difficulties in contacting them to complain.
Rant over but grrrrrr for good measure.
This is called a 'Dark Pattern' in online user experience and they're very dishonest. They are usually borderline legal but with a good legal rep you could probably take them down for this. I'm sorry you've gone through this.
Credit Card?  then bounce it.
Someone needs to make this predatory shit illegal! These options should default to OFF until the user opts to turn them on
They know it too, I get charged, called them up and cracked the shits. They refunded an cancelled immediately without any challenge.
Wow that's fucked and it's also ridiculous that it costs way more than prime (79 if you pay annually). What a ridiculous scam
They also don’t allow you to opt out, There’s a website link that leads nowhere. Dick Smith also went defunct in 2016, being bought by Kogan. All round fishy business.
On the plus side, I got free delivery then cancelled the free trial, then the next time I ordered something it let me do the free trial again, so...
I cancelled mine immediately after buying a steam deck from Kogan and never used Kogan since
Yeah, when you start looking for dark patterns on websites and go down the rabbit hole, it's crazy how much of this predatory shit you find going on.
Most subscriptions work like that. I refuse to have any.
I am normally a very calm person but urge to kill rising!
Definitely sounds like deceptive and misleading conduct, wish them the best of luck with the fine they'll get from ACCC.
Amazon did the same with prime, you can contest or and they should give it back (as long as you haven't 'used' it, ie bought something else and got membership rates for it)
> they're getting kicks from this

They literally own it, it's straight up free money for them.
Just do a chargeback, you'll have no trouble at all for an online subscription that you didn't want. TBH I'm amazed they're getting away with this as both Visa and MasterCard have very strict rules around online subscriptions that must be followed if you want to keep accepting payments. 

If they get enough chargebacks then they'll get cut off from the CC networks.
This is why you use paypal for everything online.
We did this too on a work account and it was months later when we requested the refund and they were still like ‘yep no worries’ and we got the refund.

I was expecting to have to argue with them but to my surprise it was fairly painless.
cos good old Dick is an Aussie Battler and a legend of a bloke.

/s
Yeah, almost certain they did. From the comments here it seems like it's somewhat hidden and hard to catch though. Super dodgy.
Or better yet, don’t buy from Kogan
That's the first one. You have to click through 3-5 more without making a mistake.
If you have to give your credit/debit card number for a "free" trial, its best to steer clear. They'll make the cancellation process labyrinthine, almost impossible to navigate, and you'll wind up on the hook for a year's subscription.
You can contact them in their website  to get the refund. Takes a bit of faffing around on their website to find it. I think you need to sign in and go to purchased items then dispute it.

They stung me recently for the same thing, the worst thing about is, it’s an annual charge so if you don’t fix it, they get you again next year.
That's his problem. You weigh that up when you sell your name. 🎻🎻🎻🎻🎻🎻🎻
Dick dragged himself through the mud before he even sold it.

Looking back i was also unknowingly charged $99 last year from Dick Smith after purchasing a $30 product, then they upped the membership fee to $129 this year without my consent. Looking back an email was sent that ended in my junk mail notifying the extra $30. Very dishonest business practice that has been covered [here](https://www.choice.com.au/shonky-awards/hall-of-shame/shonkys-2023/kogan-first-subscription#:~:text=For%20%2499%20a%20year%2C%20Kogan,to%20shipping%20options%20at%20checkout)
It's just a scammy tactic by Kogan to use a name that's been around for 50 years
Akigan have been doing this for years & Choice even investigated them. I'm shocked (but I suppose noylt surprised) that they're still at it.
Wouldn't work, OP didn't untick the box. Any refund is goodwill. You could probably argue in court that having it selected as the default is unethical, but it's been around for decades and decades now, so either no one has or no one will.
Pretty sure it is illegal. It is selling without consent..which in turn is what is called Unfair Business Practices..

Australian Consumer Law...

But I am at a guess there will be legal proceedings following this...
No option is picked. You have to either opt in or opt out.
Yip, I agree I love prime. $79 a year for all those movies and streaming, expedited free shipping at Amazon. It’s great value.
I've purchased via the Kogan app very recently and you can disable at the checkout , and it adds delivery fees on.

You can also cancel FIRST via the accounts screen very easily.
I looked for AC units online for an older friend. Then I kept getting ads or notifications for AC units which was annoying. I attempted to unsubscribe but it said I had to go to their website. 

Did that, still get notifications for AC units.
Kicks doesn't always been kickbacks, which is a different word.

Kicks, can also mean having a ball, "they're getting a kick out of it though "
They’re complying with what the CC providers like Mastercard and Visa require, that’s probably why. I’m sure they’re smart enough to know that, given they’re an online-only retailer operating for almost 20 years.
No, paypal is not a bank. They do NOT operate under financial laws, rules or guidelines. Paypal only wants to be nice so you spend money with them again but i tell you now. Paypal have a long history of being assholes and keeping money because they say so. Do not trust paypal.
It’s a total scam.  They just add it to every order, hope you don’t notice and rely on that 5/10 people won’t ask for a refund
IMO it's pretty obvious.

Just go click on something and have a look. I just clicked on a TV and it asked me do I want to save $20 with Kogan First.

[This is what I see](https://imgur.com/a/odAdamR):

**\* Save an extra $20.00 with\***

* Save **$20.00** on Non-Member Price
* Earn **$7.98** Rewards Credit
* **FREE 14 day trial.** Kogan FIRST will be charged $129/ year automatically after free trial, cancel anytime \*By proceeding with Kogan FIRST membership, I agree to the [Kogan FIRST T&Cs](https://www.kogan.com/au/kogan-first-terms-conditions/).

\* **Proceed without FIRST member savings**

You MUST click one of those two options before continuing. Yes the information about the 14 day trial is in smaller writing but it is legible and present within the check box.

People just want to save money and it doesn't register that it's a subscription. Yes it's predatory, and they so it because they know people will go for the discount without understanding what they are clicking on. But the information is provided. 

Edit: [here's a screen grab of the Dick Smith version](https://imgur.com/a/gfi0Hra).
Yeah my wife did the same thing. 
They just do it to catch people out and hope they don't ask for a refund. 
They also lost the package that was sent out and just did a refund instead of resending.
Its not hidden but on the NZ site where I got it from they made out it was a monthly amount but it was bought a year at a time upfront.
Well if you must, may as well be the real company, not the brand name of a defunct company. 🙂
I ended up needing something from there today, I had that and a second screen offering it again.

I've paid through PayPal so I'll see if it has secretly signed me up.
Well in this case you have to give your credit card number because you're purchasing something, not for the trial thing.
Really? I could have sworn he was still pretty well respected in the 70s and early 80s when he sold it. Even now the controversy about him still seems to all be about him suggesting we keep immigration at sustainable levels for our infrastructure and development to keep up with, way before 2/3 of the population seemed to start saying maybe we should have been doing that all along.
He sold it in the early 1980's.
Just reading his wiki after this comment as I had no opinion on him, but always known the name growing up,  and see nothing stands out to me on a negative way from it.  What makes you think other wise?

I just checked the book of legal and it said that you are allowed to go full Karen without actually being labelled as a Karen in an instance like this
**Dick Smith/Kogan often adds 'FIRST' membership as a 14-day free trial when you make a purchase. Then it's on you to opt out.**

  
Are you saying this is false?
Prime is so worth it
It’s easy to opt out, but you have to realise it’s been opted in automatically first
It is not easy to opt out.  

My experience was; You can’t opt out on a mobile device.  They pull a clever trick where the membership cancellation page is an image not hyperlinks so you can not navigate to the next step.  
If you attempt to cancel membership via desktop, the cancel membership link generates a 404 error.  If you try to remove your credit card details they send an email saying they have other credit card details I file that they will use. They took the money off another credit card I have (how ?).  After many, many hours I managed to get someone on the phone after emailing persistently. In fairness they refunded me the membership fee.  But the process was NOT easy.
Basically any businesses related to Ruslan Kogan are cancer. Stay away
Most likely getting getting notifications. Search for 'turn off notifications [browser name]'.

Like 'turn off notifications chrome'.
Ah, my bad, I've very rarely head it used that way.
And use a credit card, where you get actual legal protections.
Emergency order a phone for wife before trip. They send it to NZ, we got some headphones. Had to send back, await them to check it then send out the phone. We had a rep handling stuff for us. His only job was to apologise. He had no ability to do *anything*. After the approval happened, he just went online and ordered the phone through the site and the order sat pending for 2 days. I rang up and asked him to give it priority at the wharehouse or whatever and get that shit shipped. "Sorry, I have no power to do anything". Useless company, never will touch again.

Wife had to take my phone and I downgraded to a 5 year old phone for 2 weeks.
You actively need to choose an option. It wont let you advance without choosing to subscribe or not subscribe. 

So lying wont work.
Chargeback likely to be rejected by the vendor; option presented, left unchanged. You don't have to like it, but it is what it is. It'd take a court challenge as to its ethical implications to do anything about it because legally, at least of right now, it's A-OK. First time I ever learnt of these was back in 2006, so they've been around quite a long time now, probably even longer. I bet it was a thing when magazine subscriptions were still normal too.
The hell are you on about?????
[Yes. I tried it.](https://imgur.com/a/gfi0Hra)

You'll see that neither button is selected. That is, you actively need to choose one to continue. 

You can go try it yourself.
Except for now you have to pay 3.99 more to not have as many commercials.   Paying the 43.99 doesn't end all commercials,  just some.  
Bastards.
Bad bot
That is true
Are you talking about the mobile website? The app absolutely lets you and doesn't in any way try to hide the functionality.

Probably haven't bothered developing the mobile site becaus people would primarily use the app? (not defending bad practices just thinking that makes sense)
I'm not familiar with the relevant legislation, and if this does not contravene legislation, it should. Any adds on's on top of the original transaction should be opt in, not opt out. 

Otherwise, every retailer will add in ridiculous charges hoping people forget to opt out of it which is a terrible and misleading experience for shoppers.
[deleted]
When someone actually scams you you're entitled to demand to see the manager.
That looks pretty straight forward. Not sure how anyone could miss that.
Yeah that’s still a pretty awful dark pattern. Someone distracted or in a hurry could easily
miss that.
They are opt in, you are given 2 options to opt in during the purchase process.
They do have proof though, their IT team will be able to see that it didn't occur. That's the thing that so many people don't realise -- my business has it too: we can see the form you've started submitting but have not yet submit; it's similar to how when you connect to a company's Live Chat service, they can see what you're typing as you type it, rather than after you send it. I would personally refund it if it's recent enough, but I'd have no obligation to and my company would probably dispute the chargeback.
Ok thank you for speaking like a human being. Not a cryptic teenager
They don't. I think most people are blinded by the discount and don't read the fine print. Then get angry when they get hot 14 days later.
Sure but my point was that you aren't opted in automatically.
My bad, sorry.
[deleted]
Come out from under your rock every so often and you might be less confused next time.
You're welcome boomer
Imagine being like this 😆
It's not fine print, it's literally in their face.
Yeah but it almost certainly wasn't and the company will almost certainly dispute for that amount of $ because it's a greater value than the chargeback fee.

>*They're not filming your screen as you do this transaction.*

No, but they can see it (at least my company). How? Nfi, not in IT, but they can and I've had to rely on them for this info quite a few times. "Nope, it was unticked on first attempt. Reload from same IP, remained ticked during the second event" People just need to take some personal responsibility for their fuck ups. I mean yeah, go seek your refund, no reason not to at least try.

There should be a draft like the army but for retail, billing and customer service positions so that people can learn this lol.
Giving them the benefit of the doubt they didn't bother reading the slightly smaller writing.
