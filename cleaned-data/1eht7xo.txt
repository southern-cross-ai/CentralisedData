I started working at universities prior to John Howard's election in the mid-90s and have observed all the changes since. International students have always been there, but the problems we see today go far beyond just that. The university culture we see today is strongly tied to decades of governments trying to shape them into for-profit training colleges and generators of commercial research. At the same time they discouraged academic work that doesn't fit in with the right wing world view, and of course as another poster pointed out they saw COVID as a good opportunity to punish them further.

An older view of publicly funded universities was that they were essentially socialist enterprises. Their value lay not solely in education or training, but also enrichment of people and society. That requires being able to accept the idea that performance indicators be more than purely financial and often hard to quantify. Until we are able to break free of the neoliberal ideology that dominates economic thinking by all major political parties in Australia, any solutions to unviersities' current problems will only temporarily address the symptoms, not the causes.
Don‚Äôt forget that Universities were **specifically excluded** from Covid job keeper related funding. There was deep slashing and burning required to keep them afloat. Massive layoffs and redundancies sector wide. Much of this not reported because Universities have very concentrated short term contract and casual staff policies. It‚Äôs almost like the (Liberal) government was trying to kill them. It‚Äôs no wonder that they are struggling now, especially since student numbers have failed to bounce back to pre-Covid numbers, and anti-immigrant policies are making australia a less attractive educational destination.
Gov: Universities, you‚Äôve got to learn to stand on your own two feet, can‚Äôt have you relying on handouts.

Unis: Ok‚Ä¶ well, international students are cashed up, we‚Äôll use them for funding.

Gov: No! I didn‚Äôt mean that! Find some other source of money ‚Ä¶ like um‚Ä¶
Thegovernment needs to increase funding for universities. They've put restricted how much they can charge yet limit funding so they then to international students.¬†


Our government prefers to give tax cuts to the rich and by submarines but who'll skimp on education. Absolute joke.
People who were saying this 20 years ago- "No fucking shit."
This isn't really a new revelation.  Was an issue (though less of one) back in the 90s when I was at uni.
Now I‚Äôm an immigrant to this beautiful country, but I have to ask, at some point didn‚Äôt Aussies get free educations from unis? Or am I mixing that up with something else.
Everything in this article is spot on. Especially the bit about a lack of support. No meaningful language support for students whatsoever. Yes, IELTS requirements are high, but there‚Äôs a difference between doing well on ielts and reading hundreds of pages of academic material a week, or writing a 3500 word research paper.  Universities have neglected their duty of care.  A student who cheats must take responsibility for their actions, but the universities need to take responsibility for creating an environment that drives students to cheating. Finally, the federal government needs to take responsibility for chronically underfunding universities.

I love having international students, but they should be here because they are outstanding students, not because ‚Äògive us money‚Äô.  It‚Äôs unfair to the students, many of whom are not equipped to succeed and unfair to teaching staff who are presented with a very stratified student cohort (in terms of academic ability).

There‚Äôs so much wrong with this sector it‚Äôs difficult to know where to start. All i can say for certain is that education programs are being starved at my institution. The quality and range of offerings now, compared with 15 years ago is depressing to contemplate. Yet nobody‚Äîand I mean that literally, *nobody*‚Äîin positions of authority cares. People who bring it up are dismissed as cranks‚Ä¶.  

The only good side to the current situation is that they‚Äôll probably piss away a lot more money on voluntary redundancies so I can make my escape.
This is by design when the Liberal party under John Howard pulled funding from Universities. They were told they would simply have to increase full fee paying places which means mostly international students. All these issues were predicted and it wasn't even shocking that this would happen.
No shit? Could we have an investigation into university fees as well while we're at it?
This isn't a surprise to anyone. You can't cut funding to universities, thereby forcing them to look at private sources of revenue (of which international students would obviously bring the most per student), and then do a shocked pikachu face when they start admitting a ton of international students.
There's a 4 corners doc about this on YouTube. Called cash cows or something. It's a few years old, but still relevant I guess.
If we really want to be the clever country we could fund Universities and students properly.   Otherwise we're just a flash rat with a gold tooth.
Adelaide uni is something like 60% international students. They pay more, they spend more and the uni loves them more ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
It is a spiral of doom. The government said to the Unis "You must make money without us" so the Unis went to the rich international students, enrolled way more than they should, leading to massive strain on public services, not to mention half of them can't speak English (I'm a current (domestic) university student at a sandstone university, can attest to this), which pushes away domestic students, which allows the universities to enrol more internationals, and so on and so forth. I've had 2 friends from highschool transfer overseas already. Anyway, then, when the Liberals inevitably get back into power as they always do thanks to the Murdoch Press, they'll point to the universities and say "Look! The universities aren't supporting domestic students" (Despite this whole thing starting with the government) and further cut government funding, leading to more international students, and then in 15 years when Labor get in again they'll pretend to do something about it but won't really do anything. Damn you Bob Hawke, Damn you Scott Morrison.
heaven forbid this moronic government taxes the fossil fuel industry
If only there was a way of counting international students as an export for the Australian economy and a net contributor to state revenue....
what? just now?
This has been an issue for decades and neither political parties want this to change. Honestly, I think change has to come from the universities themselves. 

The challenge is that so much of a university's revenue comes from international students. With my little interaction with executives, they really want to market themselves to internationals first and then domestics. 

I understand why the universities love international students, but this is a house of cards.
I mean, to be fair, most of the courses they offer are really just a back door way to get permanent residency‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.and writing another cheque to the government‚Ä¶
It‚Äôs well known universities make most of their money over international students
100% fine if it funds cheap/free education for citizens. But it doesn‚Äôt.
It's not only that - there is a culture that these universities also mark these international students easier and they are below the language, literacy and numeracy of Australians. To the point that most of them should be failing, but they aren't. Yet, they have no issues failing domestic students.

They should be audited to see if the international student actually meets the benchmark. If not, that is discriminatory.

I bet they wouldn't even get close to being a LLN 2.
It's a feature, not a bug.
Those are some very quiet alarm bells. Been ringing for the pasts 25 years as far as I am aware.
Bring back Gough.
These new rules are going to completely destroy the ELICOS industry in this country. This government is moronic.
Should make it clear that the ratio of domestic-international students is not the problem. I've been to several Australian and overseas institutions where ratios were close to 50:50 and the value to student experience that the diversity and inclusion creates is amazing.

In saying this, most of the overseas institutions didn't treat International enrolments differently to domestic enrolments. Many institutions also had scholarships for internationals.

The problem we have in Australia is the lack of interest in our university institutions by both Government as well as from the private sector.

When will Australian Political and Business leaders realise that one of the biggest differences between us and the rest of the G20 is how we value our university graduates and educational institutions (and ensure institutions retain its core values.)
Sounds like this house of cards needs to topple over, and be slowly rebuilt with more solid foundations.
It's ok to have international students and to make money. 

But the government should mandate some proportion of spots for Australians either as full or part scholarships. 

So the international students should be funding our education not making shareholders or owners wealthier.
They dug their hole, now they need to face the consequences.
That bell has only been ringing for 10 years or so. It turned them into a massive lobby group to govt to keep their supply of that sweet cash. Like many things that used to provide an overall good for society, its been mutilated by corporate greed.
What I don't get about this is that with all the stories about international students receiving passing marks despite not having the English language ability to understand their teachers and educational materials, what happens when they start working in the industries their degrees are meant to qualify them for? 

It doesn't seem that there are lots of stories about high numbers of employees fucking up in various industries because they turn out not to have the qualifications expected on hire and this being specifically due to how international students are basically just cash cows for Australian universities.

Is it that after getting their degrees they don't have any intention of staying and working in Australia, they just needed the piece of paper from a "prestigious" western University and they go back and work somewhere they're proficient in the language?
Pretty poor alarm bell if it's been sounded for 20 years and there had been no action.

Unless University's have continued to build their whole business model around international students and then will ask the government to bail them out
A lot of the wealthier universities have diversified their investment portfolios and have assets in the form of property and resources. They've also pivoted towards building connections with industry. The downside of this is that our scientific research is occurring more within the context of for-profit institutions who care more about meeting market demand than solving problems. 

But the quality of our higher education will likely decline as universities respond by cutting back on their most important resource: academics. Regional universities are also in trouble, which means the students they service will either have to switch to online or move to a city.
I graduated high school in 07.  Why does it start around that time?
Why are we fucked tho? It‚Äôll just be time to consolidate and have fewer universities.
One of the problems is that the 'education' part of universities is trying to do double duty - both traditional enrichment, and a tradeschool for knowledge workers. Both are valuable to society, but they're not the same thing, and forcing universities to be both ends up degrading both.
Oh wow you've definitely seen some shit go down if you started before Howard days.
Truthfully I've never completely recovered economically from that exclusion. Myself and most of my colleagues were made redundant early on as there was no Job Keeper available. 

A couple of us have recovered, but for the majority (there were 20 in my department) we're all earning less money than before with more debt and stress from the experience. A couple of my friends had their marriages breakdown from the sudden loss of income coupled with an inability to find work whilst everyone was locked down.
> Don‚Äôt forget that Universities were specifically excluded from Covid job keeper related funding

That kind of downplays it to be honest. They changed the proposed jobkeeper 2-3 times specifically to exclude universities. The LNP were doing everything they could to hurt Aus Uni's.
I was doing my Phd during that slash and burn. New buildings were going up with new equipment and labs and just nobody in them to do work anymore because of all the layoffs. By the time I left, everyone else in my lab had either quit their phd/courses or been laid off, and the uni was scrambling to hire a new person to take over an empty space.

Not only that, but because they slashed the workers, everyone else had to pick up that slack which has lead to rolling burnout for academics. In IT where I was, people were fleeing for industry positions causing a huge amount of additional turnover and loss of expertise.

Dumbest decision every by the government to exclude unis in that, Morrison was really trying to kill universities at that point because they were daring to say his 'let it burn' policies were wrong.
 But to be fair to any government. They all created the smelly dead cat education market, governments, institutions, students and the student landlords.

 This education market  handed out crooked degrees that attracted students like flies to a 10 day old dead rotting cat. They came because they all knew that they could buy degree regardless if they were stupid and spoke no English. 

The governments and institutions saw how the private institutions made millions selling courses in hairdressing and becoming a chef while these students were out working illegally while paying stupid fees. 

These institutions wanted the money and success and built education around this flawed crooked private institution  model of corruption.

 Now the world, the parents of these students and their countries governments know that Australia was just ripping them off with poor quality education that is of no real benefit  to their countries.

 We were returning useless and incompetent students that nobody wants and they are  not prepared to pay for. Yep we shot ourselves in the foot  and mouth very well with this greed. 

Now we orchestrating the same on the Australian people with the "buy a trade certificate for a fee" and letting these incompetent and corrupt people onto consumers rather than training people in proper TAFE colleges.

Good governance from a 1st world country that boasts constantly that we punch above our weight. Now we know the truth, we did not aspire towards building a Oxford, Harvard and MIT level education system that was in the top 30 in the world. We built our education system on a foundation of quicksand, corruption and poor standards. We did this  to be in the bottom 100  of the most incompetent and corrupt educational  institutions in the world.

 No decent entry tests, no proper English language tests no standards of entry at any level! Just ask the students of these countries what their university entrance standards are like and then you should  hardly  be surprised when they flock here to buy a degree.

As usual everything buggered up because of privatisation and letting market forces run the agenda. Much like everything else in Australia that's stuffed up by governments and their privatisation and market forces agendas. Just look at the NDIS, Newstart, public housing, housing, healthcare etc etc screwed one by one by this same greedy stupidity.
They‚Äôre socialising the losses by not housing them. Would be like a privately owned rubbish tip that just dumps all the rubbish in Sydney harbour
This is literally the problem and solution, it's so frustrating to get borderline xenophobic threads complaining about international students and greedy universities when it was a lack/withdrawal of government funding that forced public universities to turn into the predatory business model we see today. 

We put so little funding into research and development it's honestly shameful.
Not saying correlation is causation but there is graph of international students numbers and the massively increase when the government cut research funding around 2010/11. 

The fact that Aus punches above it weight in research but funding continues to get plus no option to go overseas to get commercialised is a massive problem.
The business model of a university is broken. Both my parents work for a university so I understand how fucked they are. They scam domestic and international students but over charging them and subtly promise them they will get a job.

UWA used to have a prestigious reputation. Curtin is a degree factory.

Government funding is the last things these companies need for their current model. They need a realistic slap in the face and a change from a capitalistic enterprise to what unis were like pre 2012.
Exactly, imagine the shock of realisation that fee for service approach to education has a down side. Could see this coming for decades and its not going to get better.
Yes we did. All the politicians who have been making these decisions to attack universities over the past few decades received free degrees, or at the very least cheap degrees.
They did somewhere around the 1970's to the 1980's but only about 10% of the population ever got degrees at that time, the other 90% didn't benefit at all as they never went to university.
apologies for the semi-incoherent wall of text, but its just so infuriating
Yeah, because all of the Aussies want to be tradies and make a ton of money rather than study at University. Education seems to have little value here.
But it does subsidise the cost of educating citizens. Because for decades, Federal governments have not given enough funding to do so.
Not even close. In fact, many of my international students work a lot harder than Australian born who think they can simply slide through by taking vacations, missing lectures and whining about exams. My international students are so grateful to be here and to be able to study tech related courses to tale back to their countries. Wonder why Australia has so many breaches and tech failures‚Ä¶
This is exactly what happens right now
It's primarily young people once again who will face the consequences of a weakened higher education sector. 

Poor housing, poor education, poor job market. It's becoming a war on youth.
Universities didn‚Äôt dig this hole. They were told 30 years ago that the government would no longer pay for the education of domestic students. To stay afloat, universities needed to find a way to pay for the domestic students they are forced to take. International students subsidise domestic students. And this is before we even consider doing research where Australia is ranked somewhere in the mid 60s for amount of $ invested in research per capita. This is a country that would rather spend more money per person on an Olympic medal than on having an educated population
The government (primarily conservative governments) were the ones doing all the digging, though, by constantly slashing funding.


Now, considering tertiary educated people are statistically less likely to vote conservative, can we think of any reason why conservative governments might try to tank the university industry? Hmmmmmm.
International students are needed because the government does not (even closely) fund domestic students or research - the government only provides about 30-50% of the real cost of a domestic student. Universities LOSE money on domestic students who are therefore subsidised by internationals. If the government adequately funded universities over the last 30 years there would be no need for international students at all.
They wouldn‚Äôt have to go this route if the govt didn‚Äôt push em there. Gradual decline in funding under various govts, mainly liberal govts and most recently by scomo, has forced unis to rely on intl students. If intl students are rejected at a high level, domestic fees will go up. Which will lead to a gradual decline in CSP and HECS. 

Idk why govts abandoned the domestic for the foreign. Foreign talent was needed and is needed by any country that‚Äôs set on improving and growing but there are other ways to do it. Pimping out the education sector shouldn‚Äôt have been the primary focus. 

Let‚Äôs hope they can fix the system.
That's exactly what's happened. Though I think tax funding has decreased over the years too.
No one asking government to bail them out.  International student education makes huge $ for Australian society.  Do not at all get the demonisation of international students
Piece of black tape over check engine light - fixed.
We don't listen to alarm bells even when its existential, let alone for something like this. Our reaction to the climate alarm bells is one example, doesn't matter how loud the impending doom.
How else can they afford to pay the VC's more than the prime minister and many corporate execs...
Which reduces the qualified pool of teachers, at which point demand will far exceed supply, pushing costs up. Genius.
> A couple of us have recovered, but for the majority (there were 20 in my department) we're all earning less money than before with more debt and stress from the experience. A couple of my friends had their marriages breakdown from the sudden loss of income coupled with an inability to find work whilst everyone was locked down.

It's amazing how many people didn't understand. "Why don't you just get jobkeeper like everyone else?" "because I can't university jobs werent included", "well you must have that wrong, you need to go and get jobkeeper". Really annoying.
Upvoting for sympathy. What a shitshow.
I have to disagree that the education offered was and is of poor quality. It is still high quality .

  
An international student can become highly educated if they want, if they are motivated, they need to make sure they have language skills and if they don't study their arse off coming up to standard. They need to do the work.

The problem lies where students don't want to do the work yet feel entitled to pass and the unis cave to pressure.
What are you talking about? Universities are 1000% cashing in on student housing. It‚Äôs a huge money earner. They can‚Äôt build enough of the stuff. It‚Äôs the NIMBYs who don‚Äôt want them to. 

https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/unsw-at-war-with-nida-and-locals-over-greedy-housing-plan-20240528-p5jhg1.html
I love the natural end point to this analogy that international students are a waste product / rubbish that are dumped on society. The reality is that there is a huge economic benefit to hosting international students, not just for the uni but more broadly. Beyond that, how many other industries do we expect to house their international workers or customers? Unis already do this way more than other businesses.
Just double the fees for students and halve the intake. They‚Äôll still come
I work in this space. It's not correlation. It's direct result of cutting research funding which the big unis rely on as another funding stream. A lot of researchers are also lecturers.
> The fact that Aus punches above it weight in research

Do you have a qualitative measure for this, using modern data (i.e. not "we invented wifi")?

Quantitative rankings (number of research outputs, papers generated) for research output are trivially easy to abuse, and are systematically abused in a self-feeding loop because it's tied to research funding.
Pre 2012 they had a lot more funding from the government. Lack of funding is what made them crank the international student dial up to 11
There doesn‚Äôt seem to be an effective feedback mechanism where the declining reputation of our major universities would make less people attend.
That's not my experience at university. Some students couldn't speak or write in English and still passed.

Good thing your uni is ethical.
What is the system? Is it a ratio and do Australian students get subsidies?
You are spot on.
Blame the Howard government for really dismantling proper university funding.
Yes thats my point. Thats the business model which has been created. If international students weren't looked at like cash cows and didn't have massive financial benefits, university's would look diffferent. They would need to improve business practices, innovate their couses, partner with industry leaders, work on transition to workplaces, have grad program pathways etc etc.
Too much funding  goes to overseas PhD students.

It's much easier for an international student to get into a PhD program than a local one. 

We should be training local PhDs.
Yeah, that's pretty well said and all, but I'm still gonna have to laugh hard at the idea unis wouldn't bother with lucrative international students if they were adequately funded. That's probably the most naive bullshit I've heard all day.
> No one asking government to bail them out. 

Only because none have got to the point of actually needing a bail out yet. The Tasmanian Treasurer has already said he expects the Commonwealth Government to bail out the University of Tasmania if it is needed.

edit: spelling

https://theutaspapers.com/treasurer-says-commonwealth-would-bail-out-utas-ferguson-flounders-in-legco/
I agree, I think having a reputation for high quality education is a good thing, and being able to export it to the world is surely only a good thing for the Australian economy.

I think there‚Äôs a couple of reasons for the demonisation:

1. There‚Äôs a perception that some international students get a ‚Äòfree pass‚Äô because of the reliance on their fees, i.e graduating the degree despite not being able to communicate sufficiently in English, or despite obviously cheating, being given leniency domestic students would not be afforded.

2. More focus on international students means less focus (resources, places, scholarships) for domestic students.

3. Probably some racism.

I think the first one is fair, and we would do better to put resources into stamping this out than bailing them out or abandoning international students.

I‚Äôm not convinced the second is real, and perhaps the opposite is true, since they are funding so much. But at first glance, it‚Äôs hard to look at a course running at capacity with a lot of international students and not think there could be more places for domestic students if the university wasn‚Äôt so focussed on the international students.
Because it turns higher education into a Ponzi scheme - universities bend over backwards to make sure poor performing international students pass and get what they paid for.
My comment was pretty simplistic, I was kind of hoping to get more thoughts beyond ‚Äúwe‚Äôre fucked‚Äù. We need to do something with the model, because the degree factory model isn‚Äôt really working
I think the notion of poor education is that the result is of a poor standard because we let fee paying students get credits or passing grades for the quality of assessments that would be failed by help/hecs students. 

When I went to uni I was always crammed into a group project with some very nice Asian students who formed their own clique and spoke very little English and it was insufferable not because of where they were from but because it was impossible to nearly complete the assessments to any sort of standard or quality. 

And you would see those same students getting passing grades for little to no work. 

I quit uni in my last year because the pressure was just too much to carry 4 international students without any support. But the university still called me and said look if you get it done then we can pass you even if it‚Äôs late. I just flat out refused and quit. I didn‚Äôt care that I had wasted 20k on hecs. I just needed to get out of there for risk of self harm.
No they don‚Äôt. Out if the 750,000 students they house under 100,000. I can use another analogy that it‚Äôs like opening up a nuclear power plant and dumping the waste into the ocean. Is that better?
No that's not how it works. The fees are already extremely high for a degree. The unis have an obligation to students to provide high quality education that will provide jobs. They also dangle the possiblity of citizenship. But they're using and abusing them.
I know in the stem cell field where I did my PhD it's basically USA, Japan then Aus.

Medical research in general also med device field. But they are all commercial by American companies. It's why they have a big presence here. Like cook medical.
Researchers have a measure called a h-index. It's based on outputs + citations essentially. I'm not sure how that's collated at a whole of university level but I imagine the world ranking numbers are based on this.
Government provides somewhere between 25-50% of the real cost of a domestic student place. Students pay hecs/help that pays that debt (partly) back to the government. None of that money goes directly to the universities. Government tells universities how many domestic places must be provided per degree therefore ensuring universities lose money. International students pay a premium that ultimately subsidises domestic student places AND provides additional funds for research purposes
And everything else
There‚Äôs a point where we should start blaming the voters for not demanding change but I guess the media doesn‚Äôt set this narrative and do its job apart from a random story every now and then so they can point to it and say ‚Äúsee we covered it‚Äù while focusing on red herrings and culture wars.
This is interesting because the authors of Project 25, supposedly Trumps agenda in the USA, are looking to get the government out of education altogether, close their Education Dept etc. I couldn't figure out why until you said this. Now I see the goal is to remove the public interest so private interests can provide education for profit. Keating started the fire sale on our assets but Howard sold our common good, our ethical standards and possibly a big chunk of our nations soul.
THIS üëÜI was at UNSW when Howard did this, in the face a lot of protests. Its amazing how many major problems his Govt has now created.

All the shit you mentioned is already being done at my uni. There‚Äôs a real limit to it, however as a lot of what we do is pretty straightforward. It‚Äôs a dedicated teacher working with motivated students. Unless we start using BP branded textbooks in earth science classes and the like, i don‚Äôt see what more we can do. We‚Äôre long, long past the days when we were cutting ‚Äòfat‚Äô. We‚Äôre cutting limbs now.

If you‚Äôre interested in facts and figures regarding the decline in government funding for unis you can have a read at

https://australiainstitute.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Public-attitudes-on-education-FINAL.pdf

The bullet points at the start give a good sense of how grim things have become.

I started teaching at an aussie uni about 18 years ago, and it is night and day. The mood now reminds me of the desperation of a business right before it goes into administration. Full professors being assigned to tutorials outside their fields because they can‚Äôt pay for a casual academic to take it. Classes being cancelled by the *score*.  It‚Äôs a massively inefficient, desperate reallocation of resources because without it we can‚Äôt keep the lights on.

The university system was built on the premise of robust government support. We can move away from that system if that‚Äôs what people want (i think it would be a terrible idea), but in that case you‚Äôd have to free unis to charge what they want and to regulate student places as they want.  As it stands unis have control over none of those things yet are expected to make do‚Äîbut don‚Äôt recruit too many foreign students in the process.
Yep and we‚Äôd be like the USA where degrees cost $100,000
There has been significant curriculum reforms at all G08s to do this exact thing
PhD positions should be internationally competitive. PhD students take  on the face-to-face teaching load (not lecturing, but seminars, grading, TA work etc) and you need good people for that. Not to mention that PhD students are usually the ones executing on research. Its much more of a job than being a regular student.
bullshit champ.

if that were the case, why wasn't there stacks of international students at aussie unis when they WERE funded adequately by the government?

This is 100% the fault of the Howard govt, and future govts that have continued to underfund the uni sector.

> In the early days of his prime ministership, John Howard shared with some a private view about universities: don‚Äôt spend money on them, the people there don‚Äôt vote for us.
Hahahahaha - you really think universities want the hassle of building accomodation for them? Ok champ. Weren‚Äôt too many international students where I am 30 years ago - in fact zero
I think the issue of whether it really is an 'export' industry needs to be addressed as well. As soon as the government changes Visa conditions  to ensure that international students are coming here to study and nothing else the enrollment figures drop and Universities start moaning.  
A lot come here to study as it's a pathway to permanent residency. This is fine if they find work in areas where we need them (aged care for instance) but there are a lot who end up doing cleaning, uber driving, working in supermarkets etc for low wages but with software engineering degrees and I don't think they help the country as a whole.  
There is a bit of a social contract with the Australian Public where immigration is based on specific middle-class skill shortages and is not meant to displace workers at the bottom of our society for either jobs or housing. This social contract has been broken and most people know it now. For some people this will lead to racism but on the whole Australians are pretty tolerant - they are very happy with our Multicultural society but not so happy with the volume of migrants coming in every year.
Would love to offer more places to domestic students in areas of workforce need, but the government has capped funding and now said if you offer places over this limit they will take the money off the unis.
Data doesn‚Äôt back that up.  International students fail at a higher rate than domestic.
It breaks my heart what has happened to unis here, they used to be worthy of national pride. I have wanted to do some subjects if not degrees and I just don't think I can get the education I want, the faculty is well known as having been subverted by politics. 

  
Looks like internet and american courses for me.
Citation needed.
But they do neither of those things? Over 60% of post graduates aren‚Äôt in jobs from their degree 3 years after finishing. Both parties are at fault here especially if students are cheating
It's part of one section of the [Times Higher Education ](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings) rankings - THE use 18 factors across "teaching (the learning environment); research environment (volume, income and reputation);¬†research quality (the outputs of research); industry (knowledge transfer) and international outlook (staff, students and research)."
Is there the possibility to expand international students and domestic students funded by them?
He was Australia's Thatcher/Reagan.
Doesnt trump want to get rid of obama care aswell ?
At my uni the research and technical staff (at least in my department) have been cut to the bone but the uni keeps finding money for extra centralised admin staff, campus expansion (why buy more land when some of your departments have halved in size?), building works that are completely unnecessary or that cost twice the usual market rate etc.
Unfortunately some still do.

That being said, better funded uni's would equate to better trained graduates which would create more competent staff.

There's a reason the US (among other financial reasons) has some of the world leading science and engineering it does. We don't prize professionalism inside of education like they do in the US and by extension the EU.
The government still influences domestic cost of degrees and can still do so preventing the $100,000 degrees.
Keep funding the same, but achieve this by limited placements  It would mean entry into university would be competitive, not just everyone with a pulse can attend and study anything

Funding could also come at the sacraficeof funding the 33% of graduates completing a degree in a field without jobs. Where are 1000s of sport scientists working each year after graduation?Do we need hundreds of marine biologist, what's the labour market like for degree qualified Ancient World studies. Are thousands of forensic scientists needed for the <10 jobs. Is there demand for degree qualified creative writers. Etc. Governments could fund useful degrees at the sacrifice of useless degrees.
At least they would be worth something then.

There are too many graduates these says. A degree is no longer a signifier of elite status.

If they cost $100k, then at least they would go back to being a symbol of elite status and a guarantee of a good job.

As it stands now, degrees are worth as much as toilet paper because everyone has one.
Yep but its a lot easier to get into a PhD program as an international student in Australia then a domestic student.

And that shouldn't be the case. The whole point of intl fees to subside research should be actually beneficial and about developing domestically.
More than 400,000 inter¬≠national students have been forced into the private rental market as Australia‚Äôs biggest unis take $9bn a year in fees and fail to provide enough places to live.

A Chinese student in Sydney is paying $300 a week for a room in a share house where the landlord bans the tenants from using airconditioning. Picture: John Feder
Australia‚Äôs biggest universities are failing to provide 80 per cent of their foreign students with guaranteed housing, despite taking in $9bn a year in tuition fees.

Universities have built enough dorm rooms to accommodate only 40,000 students nationally ‚Äì a fraction of the 205,000 inter¬≠national students they have ¬≠enrolled to study in Australia this year, while private training colleges have failed to provide any accommodation, even though they have accepted 149,000 foreign students this year.

So 400,000 at uni plus 149,000 at colleges so at a minimum 550,000 are in the private rental market
Not really - it‚Äôs obvious that Australian universities do not own/facilitate enough housing stock to house 750k students. Are you really arguing they do?
I agree with you, they're failing hard. So is the government.
Not under the governments plan, which is effectively to maintain domestic places (or increase them) while reducing international student places AND not covering the funding shortfall the universities will thus experience. What will happen is that academics will be made redundant and lose their jobs further reducing the student experience. Right now - universities ARE capped on the number of internationals. The university I am at is mandated by its governing body that it cannot have internationals be more than a certain % of the total student cohort. In the past, when the government has increased domestic places, the university could commensurately increase international places to cover the shortfall, but under the new legislation this won‚Äôt be possible
Maybe. But we're talking about the privatisation and profits of education here.


But fwiw, Howard made cuts to medical, too, and our public hospitals have been staggering on ever since. E.g. ramping started with Howard.
This is falling into the trap of using career outcomes as the only meaningful metric for evaluating the value of education. I think that the social good extends a long way beyond the balance sheet. Obviously there is a balance to be struck, but your solution leaps to the far end of the spectrum.
These are random extracts of text that anyone could make up. Who is providing these numbers? what data is being used to generate them?
Why do you keep quoting numbers that you either do not understand or are wrong?

I agree, unis need to do more in regards student housing.  Private English schools and RTOs provide housing for a very high percentage of their students (in the case of English schools, I believe the numbers in in excess of 85%), through either purpose built student accommodation or through homestay.

The largest lessees of PBSA such as Scape or Student1 are actually English schools and RTOs.
Where does this 750k number come from?
Yes sorry, that was the point of the statement, to indicate that reforms could be done. Obviously somewhere in the middle would be best. Im not saying the exploration and pursuit of arts isn't important, i'm saying that the government doesn't need to fund tens of thousands of degrees in this space. Having 1 in 3 graduates costing $10,000s not gaining employment isn't great, and using international students to fund this is possibly exploitative.

A balance won't ever be struck with the current funding and business model
