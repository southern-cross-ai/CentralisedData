This sub and regular participants here are regularly labelled as un-Australian; let's find out how un-Australian!   

You don't like Vegemite? You'd rather eat a vegetable pie or dog-food than a Bunnings sausages? Don't know what a Chiko Roll is? Drink your own piss rather than VB or XXXX? Don't think it's fun to shit-can everyone around you? Don't know who won the sportsball competitions on the weekend? Can't change a tyre? Perhaps you ride a bike to work? Or you simply hate memes?

How else have you failed to conform? Let us know how un-Australian you are!

I ignore all sportsball and I don't remember ever having eaten a chiko roll.
I have no idea who won Sportsball, or who was competing, or what competitors there are.

I think Melbourne's coffee is no better than anywhere else.
