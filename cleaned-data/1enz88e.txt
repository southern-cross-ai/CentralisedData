Anz on the same website telling us they'd never ask for our personal information then going and requesting personal information....
i have lost count of how many times my actual (macquarie and cua) bank has called me and asked me for my id and sec questions and then when i explain to them they are following scammers script, they either argue they arent scammers or i can call them back and when i ask them whats it about as i dont have an hour to wait on call waiting they tell me they cant tell me, so i call them back, wait an hour and its some BS. they really are all effing awful
Wtf is wrong with the ABC we are paying them too much if they have time to waste with this nothing story. 

Bank complies with anti money laundering laws and ABC interviews a couple of people and writes an article about it, having to fill 24 hours of airwaves was a mistake.
It’s unreal, isn’t it? The banks need better legislation applied. We had a bank once which supplied customers with a service, but it’s been privatised so now were trapped with this.
The article is about banks requiring people to update their personal details in a safe manner. Some customers are confused about the process.

It's good to inform people about that process; which this article does.
