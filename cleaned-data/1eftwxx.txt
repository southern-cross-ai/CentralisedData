Sorted by total medals?
The whole world does it the Google way, except USA when they're losing that way.

Did the same thing during the last Olympics
If you look at the population of the US vs Australia, the US would have had 1.6 medals with our population. 
Aus is kicking ass.
USA always put themselves on top. (Or which ever is higher)
Once they get more gold they revert back to who has most gold.
There‚Äôs always jokes every olympics about it
USA - 50 bronze medals
Other country - 49 gold medals
USA - We're winning!
Remember USA has the most athletes competing.
The Sydney Morning Herald did that sort of thing a couple of Olympics back. Australia wasn‚Äôt getting many golds but New Zealand was doing well and already had more than them. 
The Herald had the medal rankings on their front page and for some reason had put Australia and New Zealand medals combined so it looked like Australia was in the Top 10. Boy did that change fast the moment Australia started getting some golds. All of a sudden Australia‚Äôs was its own country again.
Unfortunately Canada does it that way as well (scroll down): https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics

And from memory the US always does it this way, not just when it beneficial to their ranking. Probably figure they will get close to the most medals so it will always have them near top of the ranking
This isn't new, the US media have been ranking on total medal count for decades, even when they were getting smashed by the USSR and even East Germany.

Officially the IOC don't provide rankings by country, it is prohibited by the charter, but every other country and media organisation ranks by "gold first".
I've always liked to think of it as gold is worth 3, silver 2 and bronze 1.

It is silly and misleading not to be categorized by gold, though. What can you expect from our media and political systems? The truth hardly matters to journalists and politicians. Just click, votes and donor.

I'm American, and to state again, the way we project it is silly. Be the best, by being the best, that's the attitude we should have towards it.
We can break the illusion that America is still great or all hell will break loose.
Gold medals count. That is all.
Personally I think they should give medals a point system to assign ladder ranks like gold=3, silver=2, bronze=1 which would be a fairly distribution on performance but I guess that still won‚Äôt stop certain countries just sorting by what they have the most of
True story of Olympic success, medals per capital, all games not including current.....

https://www.statista.com/statistics/1102056/summer-olympics-average-medals-per-capita-since-1892/
I'd like to think gold medal is more important given that USA have more representative in the competition than everyone else. The number of total medals does not really reflect the case.
I came in third! In the world! Ray deal with it you lost.
They like to score themselves by total medal tally. 
The rest of the world knows silver and bronze are runner-up medals. The leaderboard is ranked by number of wins (1st place, Gold medal), not the number of times you almost won but didn't.
Lhs is by gold (ties split by silver, then by bronze), rhs is by total medals. Neither is inherently better or worse.

You see dozens of versions of the same post every olympics
Actually, total medal count in week 1 is probably not a bad indicator of standard ranking after week 2.

Medal tallies early on don't mean much. 

I say that as an unAmerican.
You sorted by total medals bro
Eh, everyone knows the Olympics, like every other global sport competition, is about p[atriotism and one-upmanship, not the sports](https://x.com/zhang_heqing/status/1817909714250076514). A few days ago we were hooting about how we were no.1, even though we all knew that was temporary. I don't see anything wrong with this. Yes it's a bit odd, but totally in line with how you'd expect Americans to see things.

And they ARE no. 1 in terms of medals, and a silver or bronze still counts for more than not getting a medal at all.
We don't come third
I always thought the standard was most gold first and then by total medal count. Maybe I've just been looking at Wikipedia tables too long
No wonder trump claimed the election was rigged
I'm guessing the insinuation here is that one is biased because of the sort, but you can just pick whatever sort you want. I think the Google one sticks to # of Golds sorted descending and doesn't let you change. So the issue is with Google...?

But reading the comments it seems to be on the default sort? I mean other US News outlets have Gold defaulted, but is the total number of medals not important? The site is consistent in Beijing 2022, where Golds would put US higher. 

Seems like selective anger if you ask me...
By this logic they could win the 100m sprint by having two Americans finish 2nd and 3rd.¬†
Greatest country on earth! /s
But we has da most medals, we numba 1
Odd really since "2nd place is only the first to come last" is so 'Mercan.
I remember in 2016(?) some Australian channel insisted on showing the combined medals of Aus/NZ... until, of course, Australia had more medals to count than NZ, then it went back to Aus and NZ lmao
Sepos are such sooks.
Merican exceptionalism. They don't even use the metric system, not surprising they can't order the medal tally like every other country.
Wtf is with all the Americans downvoting on this subreddit?
Always cute to see the US media manipulate the results to show they‚Äôre winning when they clearly aren‚Äôt.
It‚Äôs pretty cringe how many commenters here think USA Today speaks for Americans. It‚Äôs a garbage company that no one takes seriously
Remember the Americas cup in yathing how they challenge everthing so they win
Quantity not quality
Aussies have elite mentality, no bronze for us.. you either go for gold or die trying üòÇ
Looks like one goes by metals and the other goes by medals.
There was an American mathematician on triple j that has a formula he proposed. That puts Australia on top.

His algorithm takes into account the population density as well as likelihood of a person from a certain nation winning a medal
Welcome to coverage of every Olympics since 2004? The US do this all the time
Are we even surprised America do it this way? More overall medals means they are better.
The total column looks like it was clicked to sort by that?
The most important thing is we are beating the yanks
They use the imperial medal tally in USA, not the metric.
In 4 more years you won‚Äôt need a tally, Beautiful Christians!
Everyone knows the only legitimate way to score is medals per capita. Courtesy of Chat GPT:

https://imgur.com/a/j2oVGmU

Netherlands?! Fuck.

Edit: Australia #1 per capita on gold medals instead of total medal count.
america thinking theyre the best yet again i hate america so much
I thought the whole point was to win gold, and China and Japan certainly deserved their wins.
silver metal just means you;re first looser, and the bronz is the 2cond looser XD
 Now do it per capita, yanks
That weird country will always twist reality to make itself look like number one. Facts don't matter
I think it should be a points system. Gold = 6pts, Silver = 3pts, Bronze = 1point
‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt they ignore all medals, other than gold, to make MY country look better???‚Äù
Bro, in the USA, I go to google, an American company, and look up ‚ÄúOlympic medal tally‚Äù, shows the score by total golds.
Gold first is the traditional way of sorting the count.
This is a great way to introduce interpreting data differently to a class.
Oof, how'd that work out.?
America media can‚Äôt help themselves .. USA has to be first
USA is an entire country with an ego as fragile as glass.
The US is a bit "special". They can't just use the same ranking as everyone else. They need someone to sit them down, pat them on the back, make them a nice cuppa and make up a special fake ranking just to make them feel useful.
All winning the most medals, of any colour, means is that you're competing in the most events. It's not a level playing field.
Wow. Look at all those 3rd places the USA got. Amazing
US should sort it: Silver, Gold, Bronze‚Ä¶

Like their date format.
Guess gold and bronze are equal and ppl wanna get bronze instead of gold
Why are yall so obsessed with us
lolol. US propaganda.
Americans know there are other countries!?üò≥
The US always has to be on top, after all, they're the "World Champions" in all of their domestic sporting competitions ü§¶
It‚Äôs the US, they like doing things their way lol. After all they‚Äôre still the only ones to use Fahrenheit too üòÇ
I‚Äôve always thought it was a bit unfair only going by golds won. But you can‚Äôt go by total either. The medals need to be weighted so gold is worth more points.
Damn why are aussies so obsessed with America? Don't you guys have other things to focus on?
Sweet, another post on an Australian sub about that country on the other side of the world that we all pretend we don't give a shit about.
Nothing gives me more pleasure than telling an American they aren't number 1.
My god they are an embarrassing nation of children.
They do the same with golf , the accepted standard is that if two players are on the same score , the player who has played the most holes sits in the higher position on the leaderboard, unless of course that person is American, then their name is at the top regardless of the amount of holes played üôÑ
I‚Äôm so proud of Australia, for a small little country we sure have great athletes
The USA ego is so delicate.
USA only has 3 gold medals, why would they be on top?
USA USA USA today
It‚Äôs so cringe.
Most golds with silver / bronze only as tiebreakers vs. ranking by total medal count. These two rivaling ways of sorting the medals table are as old as time, this isn't news.
Until track and field when they will have the most gold then conveniently will switch haha.
Is this kinda how we always go on about how good we are doing on a per capita basis? But we don‚Äôt talk about per athlete or by spending etc .
Medals to GDP or population would be more interesting
American here. Everything we see is sorted with us in 5th or 6th. Also just a general vibe that we kinda want someone to knock us down a bit it feels like. Some competition would be welcomed. Love Olympic season! Greatest tradition in world history!
No surprise I mean look how they write the date, month/day/year
https://i.redd.it/0j7mcjjy5ofd1.jpeg
I get what you‚Äôre saying, but can literally just sort it by gold, silver or bronze if you wanted also
A fairer way would be to award 3 points for a gold, 2 for silver & one for bronze, and arrange the order of the table by total points.

As an Aussie I prefer the table on the left though üòÄ
...and Hong Kong is listed separately from China
2nd place is just 1st in a long line of losers‚Ä¶ (this is a joke for those that will jump on and berate me) ü§£
The kind of shit team America always accuse North Korea of doing
Better than china, they add Hong Kong and Taiwan to theirs, that‚Äôs how they ‚Äúwon‚Äù the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.
USA is tied with France as 1st LOSER!
That‚Äôs because Americans which make up the majority of the reader base of an American news outlet are obviously going to be most interested in their own country and would complain if it was hard to see their own athletes‚Äô stats for the exact same reason you‚Äôre complaining here
Imagine winning 26 medals but only 4 gold

USA r frauds
Considering they‚Äôre the largest team, USA Today have gone with the Easy difficulty
America has always been quantity not quality.
This happens every time
Imagine being the best at coming 3rd
Remindme! 12 days
Pretty analogous for the opinion the US has of itself. 'Greatest Country in the World'.
Hey, we all know the Olympic Games are all about competing and it doesn‚Äôt matter about the medal count, right?
As soon as the Yanks stopped winning gold they decided that the leader board should be based on total medals. Arseholes always think they‚Äôre number one.
Is eg coming Third 15 times better than 1st 10 times?

Nah.
They do this every time
Not to be unpatriotic but I do think silver and bronze medals are downplayed far too much, considering the tremendous performances they often represent. So I prefer the "total medals" ranking because it  acknowledges these achievements in a way I think is fairer and more inclusive.
You‚Äôd think there‚Äôd be a points system; some thing like:

Gold: 5 points | Silver: 3 points | Bronze: 1 point
You kind of want them to believe they are always number 1. Otherwise their fragile egos will want to spread more freedom and democracy.
it literally says "total medals" though?
They do it every time - we got the most , we da best ü§£ü§£ü§£
Bravi Australia, it‚Äôs good to see that it‚Äôs hard staying on top. Big respect from American. (üî•üî•üî•ü¶Öü¶Öü¶Öü¶Öü¶Öüá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üá∫üá∏üó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏è)
This happens every year and could really be avoided if the IOC just made one standard ranking that is what's used worldwide. Not sure why they don't.
We all know it's glorious gold, so so silver and shameful bronze
Like the great Ricki Bobbi said ‚Äúif you‚Äôre not first, you‚Äôre last‚Äù.
What you think this is new? What‚Äôs the rent like under that rock you live under, any vacancies?
the only thing that matters is how 'Olympics' ranks...

[https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/medals](https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/medals)
Ranking is always done as per highest number of Gold, then silver and Bronze and so on, not based on total number of medals. USA Today needs to reuse the google API than reinventing their one version of it.
The Americans will rank it that way until they have more golds then they'll change.
CCP 4 LYFE
Hahahaha how embarrassing for them
All about the golds
The Google way is how the medals have always been tallied.
When you send 600 athletes you're bound to get the most medals.
why is this in this sub?
USA today, should change their name to USA Every Fucking Time
I personally prefer the entire tally. 

It's treating all medals the same, not just gold medals first. But all of them regardless of importance, eventually the American Empire will gain the most gold count and most overall count.

So it doesn't exactly matter but just interpretations of it.
And you can safely bet that if the tally on the right didn't get them to number 1, they'd count the medals awarded to each member of the team events "Hey, we won the relay, there's another 4 medals we count! Ooh, we won the basketball. There's another 7 medals!" and so on.
Doesn‚Äôt really matter the USA will win most gold anyway they always do
Every olympics. Not our fault the yanks are mediocre ü§£
Eee EsA ¬≥
the CCP has this one in the bag already, they've got the best doping program bar none.
Gotta love, S.Korea, Canada, Italy & HK ‚Ä¶ just carrying on without the format drama üí™üèºüçª
Is this American politics gutter language 
I wonder how you treat foreign governments
They always like being first but I can remember when the USA represented it as most gold medals. That was before the rest of the world caught up!!
Don't attribute malice to things that can be attributed to stupidity.

(Stupidity belonging to some product manager somewhere)
IIRC this is one of the causes of the Cate Campbell comments referring to Americans as sore losers.
Ermmm what the sigma
The salt, the hatred I can almost taste it in the comments.
Totally just the USA doing what they do. 

World Series Baseball is an example.

Anyone know how they are doing in the shooting at the Olympics‚Ä¶..you know guns and all and the what ever Amendment ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÑ
A lil bit unrelated but I‚Äôm absolutely liking what I see right now as a guy from HK. Our city straight up holding it down with the big boys on the medal table!
Just like everything about the US. Quantity over quality. More food even though it‚Äôs shit. Big coffee from Starbucks even though it‚Äôs shit. Big cars even though they‚Äôre shit.
America doesn‚Äôt like it when they‚Äôre losing.
Like they say, Second place us the start of the losers ‚Ä¶.
The US not happy with their performance? They really don‚Äôt like being #1
Google is in metric, USA Today is in imperial.
What's wrong with it? The chart on the left is ranked by most gold medal and on the right is ranked by most total medal acquired.. it's two different charts.. so it's not wrong..
The world uses the equivalent of the Olympic Metric system. The US use the "I win" imperial system.
Haha I remember the Sydney Olympics the USA couldn‚Äôt accept or couldn‚Äôt understand we were ahead in time (like Sydney GMT +10 and say LA is -7) so when an event was on at 1pm on Wednesday in Sydney it was still the day before in America (like 8pm Tuesday) So I heard they said we were a week behind. Completely blows my mind at either the stupidity of that given one rotation is one day ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è or the arrogance (not the right word but we‚Äôre going with it) they couldn‚Äôt accept they are behind the rest of the world. Funny America
Take the red pill
I like Google more
Anyway that USA can make it look like they are winning
[deleted]
Australia also does this
Google? The American search engine?
Wow USAToday must have a specific audience they cater too. I wonder who
It‚Äôs probably a point total ( EG ü•â = 1 point ü•à =10 points ü•á = 100 points ) and the US had the highest total
The fact that it almost cuts off China, it just looks to me like it shows the US and France at the top even if you scroll. Makes sense as it‚Äôs the host county and American‚Äôs are going to want to see their own placement.
Why are people just latching on to this? The tally has always been by total medals or golds? US media has literally always reported it both ways. You can sort it by specific athlete too, is that a conspiracy somehow?
Search up total Olympic gold medals by country in history and get back to us.
[removed]
In the end gold that matters. Google is part of US propagandist anyway.!
I mean why not use both metrics? Are silver and bronze worth jack shit nowadays? Also that website allows you to change the metric to either gold or most metals. You just have it on the setting that lets you push your narrative
Lmao. Silly USA. Golds are more valuable than silvers and bronzes smh.
I'd be interested in seeing how many athletes each country sends to the Olympics. Also, apparently the American drug testing agency says that there is a doping problem in American sports.
Simples- Google uses the metric system, the US uses the Imperial system. Metric recognises the atomic weight of the metal involved, imperial measures the number of medals overall.
familiar judicious square crown aloof illegal narrow psychotic important mourn

3 points for gold 2 for silver 1 for bronze solves this nonsense
All American media ranks by medal total to make it look like there ‚Äúwinning‚Äù where the offical count goes by gold in the event of a tie then silver and then again if needed bronze. 

America just don‚Äôt cope well with being not the best.
Australia should rank them as a proportion of total medals as gold, we would be in second behind hong kong XD
Yes, the US is the best at being 1st and 2nd loser.
A minor difference, get over it
Hmmmm, y'all check the updated medal lists? Awfully quiet here all of a sudden....
Quality > Quantity
The rest of the world ranks by gold . Seppos rank by quantity  as is their way .
[deleted]
Go Aussie!!
What‚Äôs the count at now ?
Google records the best country by the highest total of gold, while the USA is sorted by the highest amount of medals :P
This aged quite well
And in a scenario where the US had the most golds but not the most number you sure as hell they'd be using the tally on the left
All their news outlets have this as default / headline medal count
American media has sorted this way for decades.  It guarantees them top position.
I mean it's a medal Tally. They are all arbitrary no matter how they are sorted. Tallies kind of miss the point of the Olympics by ignoring the performance and and spirit of friendly competition aspects of the games. The true achievements of athletes do not show up. Instead a tally is simply a reflection of the raw financial power a country invests into competitive sport and the industrial complex the country has built in producing athletes. There is a reason mid sized countries like France and Australia do disproportionately well in tallies, and it's essentially just investment. Look at large countries like USA and Brazil. Brazil produces amazing sports people, especially footballers, but they don't invest like the USA does in preparing Olympic athletes. China, the most populous country did terribly at the Olympics a couple of decades ago, but to spread soft power have massively ramped up spending and it shows, they try and stack most events, to show up USA. 

Medal tallies are just an international pissing contest and the piss is money. And gold silver bronze is just now much change you get for your dollars.



Edit: Medal Tallies shit on those countries that don't have an AIS equivalent or spare taxpayer money to blast at middle upper class athletes that have grown up being supported in the sport by their coach/athlete parents, college sports scholarships, public sports funding for facilities etc. 

They hypocrisy in these comments where everyone wants to shit on America for the way they count medals... What is the point in boasting about medals? Have we become as selfish boastful and petty as we accuse American society of being? USA has entered 590 athletes into the Olympics, they will statistically get the most medals. Australia has entered 460 athletes, yet we have a tiny fraction of the money or population of the US. Australia is the world's biggest culprit when it comes to stacking our olympic chances relative to our size, that's not a bad thing but keep it in mind before you start rubbing it in the face of Kenya or khazakstan...Seriously Australian redditors pull your bloody heads in. Where'd the being a good sport and fair go go? All I'm seeing is jealous haters complaining about a count.
Sorting by total medals is flawed as you're considering bronze to be just as good as gold or silver.
And if you click on the gold medal it sorts by gold. They‚Äôve done this for years.
In Australia we only count the medals in week 1 then when the swimming finishes in week 2, we ignore the medal table all together
Not the whole world.  [Some outlets](https://x.com/euronews/status/1817883133137805329) have decided to bend the definition of "country".
The North Korea of the western world.
Always gives me a giggle, and it's something I always specifically look up each time.
You should see what China does, they add Hong Kong and Taiwan medals to their count despite the fact they compete as independent countries.
Must suck to have the US in mind so much that you care about how results are ranked.
https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/summer/medals
Massaging the numbers in this way is an effective strategy to stay at the top, if you have the largest team.
They do it every olympics.
Why stop there? Let‚Äôs go government sports funding per capital per medal while we‚Äôre at it.
Swimming. We always dominate the first week, but drop off a bit after that. From memory, historically the best performing countries per head of capita are Hungary, Finland, and NZ. Bahamas too if you're willing to include really small countries. Aus is usually in the top 10 though. If you include Winter Olympics too, then Finland, Sweden, and Norway are absolute monsters per head of capita.

There's probably some sort of correlation to be drawn between most medals per head of capita, and govt spending on social programs.
Why look at population, what about number of contestants?
Per capital but minimum 5 gold. Australia number 1
But all your medals are from one sport‚Ä¶. Not much diversity or fun in that.
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs how that works. Just cause there is more people doesn‚Äôt mean they will be more competitors. It‚Äôs still the same
Literally every single Olympics
How soon we forget
I mean really the total medals tally is the most fair because it actually treats all Silver and Bronze medalists like they actually exist. 

For some countries getting a silver or bronze medal is big achievement. Like Japan in the 400m relay in against Jamaica (and Usain bolt). They were ecstatic just to get a bronze because an asian team getting a spot on the podium had never happened (and is rare in most sprint events).
I don't think they revert. Are you sure they don't just stick with the same method the whole way?
Total medals and gold only are both stupid. 5 bronze shouldnt beat 4 golds and 1 gold shouldnt beat 5 bronze in terms of measuring a countrys athletic accomplishment.

But FYI if you fairly point system weighted it 3-2-1 Gold Silver Bronze, we still beat Australia 33-23 going off these medal countsüòÇ

This whole sub is throwing a baby fit over TWO golds while drowning in the other two lmao. As if we're not about to crush in that department in the near future too.
Naw USA usually get the most medals overall and Golds and Silvers and Bronze the two past ones USA has the most in both categories. (Idk why people act like Australia has more medals then USA or ever led)
US election gerrymandering method In use.
‚ÄúWe have the best losers‚Ä¶‚Äù
Good ole American maths
Brother give it like 2 weeks and will have the most gold.
In a week we‚Äôll have more golds than every other country anyways. Plus total medals
I feel like it should be a point system where Gold=3, Silver=2, and Bronze=1.

So USA would have 34points,
France 34 points
China 30 points
Japan 26 points
Australia 23 points,
South Korea 23 points
etc

Any ties (aka US and France) would be whoever has more Golds
Skill issue  to be honest. India and China have more people why can‚Äôt they get more qualifiers? Also just wait until track and field
Also remember that they sent athletes based on skill, not population
Actually, if you then click on the word 'Medal' it takes you to a dedicated medal count page that let's you choose how to sort. These 2 ways, plus alphabetical. Typical Canadian compromise ;) üá®üá¶
People bring this up every Olympic just to shit on the US during the 1st few days.
>Officially the IOC don‚Äôt provide rankings by country, it is prohibited by the charter, but every other country and media organisation ranks by ‚Äùgold first‚Äù.

The medal table on Olympics.com sorts by gold. If they didn‚Äôt wanna suggest a ranking they‚Äôd do well to remove the ranking numbers from that table at the very least‚Ä¶ 

Or just do it like you‚Äôd assume beaureaucratic NGOs would and just provide a table with countries listed according to alphabetical order in French only, non-sortable.
Weighted would definitely be better than just sorting by gold. If country A has 1 gold and country B has 15 silver I think it‚Äôs safe to say that country B performed better
Yep, the 3-2-1 points system seems a fairer reflection of performance to me. Alternatively 5-3-1 points system that puts more emphasis on winning gold, or winning silver over bronze also seem reasonable to me.
Are you serious? Have you never been on Reddit before? All this place does is talk about how shitty America is.
So why do they bother giving out silver and bronze?
Lol right? If you click the medals it sorts by medals. This is just a nice way to view it for data nerds like me.
> we were hooting about how we were no.1, even though we all knew that was temporary

.... You read that seriously?
No it‚Äôs still ridiculous, as understood by the rest of the world
No Australia is the greatest /s
It‚Äôs a fucking graph, you can sort it.
This same shit happened 4 years ago by the end America had both the most medals and the most gold. Yalls inferiority complex is crazy
It's almost all news outlets though. I've seen NBC, Wesh, New York Times etc post the same "medal tally". I think CNN is the only one I've seen post the real tally. It seems the majority post the fake one.
Looks like it
Wow you are bitter
3rd in the world is really...bad? Yeah, they suck!
let's do it by the total value of the precious metals in each medal.
Tell them they haven't won a war since 1945 and watch them lose their shit.
Because they have the most medals, so unlike the offical list that goes by golds, this site is choosing to go by the number of all medals
I mean only sort of. I‚Äôd be more than 50% more happy for a gold than a silver. And I‚Äôd be about 50% happier with a silver than a bronze. 

It would be better if it were 8 for gold, 4 for silver 3 for bronze.
Why is it that India doesn‚Äôt do the same exactly?
That did not happen üòÇ
Nah yeah. Golds for bragging rights, Silver > Bronze to split ties
You might want to check the updated rankings, where is the US and where is Australia?
lol what? Say that again?
lol üòÖ say that again?
Update?
Yeah, only the US does this and it's so that they're on top in the early days.  The rest of the world goes by the official, most gold, method.  It doesn't really make that much difference in the end anyways because by the end the US almost always has the most gold too.  It's just that it takes until the field events in the 2nd week kick in that they take over.
For the previous 3 summer Olympics the U.S. have ended up winning the most medals overall *and* the most gold medals, so in the end it likely won't make a difference.
Give it a couple of days.  We'll see where you're at.
Did you click on the medal tally on the right? There's that "I've explicitly sorted by this category in particular" arrow going down from it.

(Seriously, people, take things with a pinch of salt. It's bad enough with friendlyjordies sprouting his CIA conspiracy theories to the millions on YouTube, but Reddit is supposed to be decently intelligent.)
They used the same metrics for previous Olympic results. You can literally see it on their website. Even in those where the USA doesn't brutally mog everyone else.
the US media has always done this, and they often win the most golds (well 2012, 2016, 2020 olympics, but China pipped them at its home games in 2008). It gives equal weight to any medal, I can't believe people think this is bad.
It will be like that in the end anyway
first i checked don't do it

I think that's the point of the OP....it's an 'Mercan thing.  

The rest of the world seems to rank by gold.  But then, so do some of the Mercan sources.
They didn't when I was young, if the did USSR would be on top.¬†
Happy Cake Day
There also isn't a proportional amount of medals per sport, sports like Swimming a single swimmer can walk away with multiple Gold medals, but you could have the 15 greatest Field Hockey players in the world and only walk away with 1 gold medal.
Nobody is shitting on Kenya or Kazakhstan. And most people are aware of the correlation between sporting output and; population, access, wealth and investment, and sporting culture. That was a pure uneccesary extrapolation based on nothing other than the fact it's fun to wind up the Yanks.

Furthermore, things may be arbitrary, but some things are more arbitrary than others. For instance the ancient Olympics didn't even have the concept of second or third place. Somebody won an event and that was it. Based on that the gold tally makes it simpler to follow a collation of event outcomes, whereas the total only tells you who is featuring a lot orbiting the winner.
You do realise how competitive Americans in general are right?
If you sort by total golds, then you're saying that a country with 1 gold and no other medals is doing as well as a country with 50 silver and 50 bronze.

That's flawed as well. So then you can try to figure out more complex methods, but people would argue about all of them.

The NYT did an interesting graphic showing where the US might rank under different systems.

Sorting by gold is also kinda flawed
Wait - the olympics is 2 weeks long?
There's more to the Olympics than the swimming pool?
Definitely this. We just screenshot the tally at the end of the swimming but before the athletes, and pretend the tally stays that way.
I‚Äôll allow cycling too.
Was surprised to see you guys took 4th in  women‚Äôs rugby.  Behind 2 countries that don‚Äôt even have professional leagues for either sex.
Lovely. We should just group all countries under 'Earth' to make everyone happy.
Earth is still in the lead.

(Medals by planet):
 
>Earth - 175

>Mercury - 0 

>Venus    - 0

> Ceres - 0

>Mars      - 0

>Jupiter - 0

>Saturn - 0

>Neptune - 0

> Pluto - 0

> Haumae - 0

> Makemake - 0

> Eris - 0
Hilarious. Love that they lump independent EU countries but not non-independent, wholly controlled countries like China/Hong Kong.
For a moment I thought they grouped Taiwan, Hong Kong and China into one. But no. It got even more ridiculous‚Ä¶
Alright now show APAC pure domination.
Why don't they count Asia Pacific? That will be China, Japan, and Australia.
eu must be joking
Where'd ~~the UK~~ Great Britain go?
To be fair there are very different reasons for that though and they're not even closely related. 

The US do it out of pure ego, they believe they're the best and anyone who tells them otherwise is wrong, so media outlets are forced to do things in ways that please the American public, like saying they're "winning" the Olympics in creative ways. 

China has been fighting for HK and Taiwan to be considered part of China for years now, and it's completely unrelated to anything to do with the Olympics and the reason they add HK and Taiwan medals to their tally is because the Chinese government considers both to be part of the people's republic of China.
Touched a nerve hey? 

Just an observation that this was in the news during Tokyo.
Medals by GDP per capita?
That ignores all the flow on benefits of having a population that has a well funded sports programme. I imagine it pays for itself in health cost savings alone. 

Australia doesn't spend the money for the medals. The medals are a by-product of a well funded sports programme.
It costs Australia 29.4M AUD, and the USA 25.6M USD per gold medal. Concerted, that‚Äôs 20.8M for Aus. We win, but not by much.
> There's probably some sort of correlation to be drawn between most medals per head of capita, and govt spending on social programs.

I speculate that the countries that do better per capita have better rights and freedoms and wealth for women, which allow women the time to pursue top level sport if they choose.
Jamaica are the per capita gods
Jamaica does pretty well
>There's probably some sort of correlation to be drawn between most medals per head of capita, and govt spending on social programs.


Any country that can just pay athletes to be athletes is simply going to better than a country that can't. A country's wealth is a factor, but what it chooses to do with that wealth is something else. A country can spend a lot on social programs and little on elite sports development for example, and they won't do as well as a poorer country which spends a lot on elite sports development.¬†
"There's probably some sort of correlation to be drawn between most medals per head of capita, and govt spending on social programs"

If by "social programs" you mean elite sports funding, then yes.  The US, as a particularly salient example, is quite fond of slashing spending on social programs that benefit millions of people but maintaining world-leading facilities to train the 0.001% of the population who have exceptional athletic talent.

I get what you are saying, and I agree that silver and bronze should be celebrated, but silver and bronze do still exist on the left. With equal gold the country with the most silver places higher.
Gold is the biggest achievement, so it's count goes first. Nobody ever said silver and bronze are failures. Look at AUS and GBR above... Who would ever think that 2/5/3 is a better outing than 5/4/0?

There would be unrealistic outliers, like 0/10/10 being ranked behind a 1/0/0 but using gold as the primary determinant makes most sense and is done by pretty much everyone except the US.
What's the purpose of three medal system then?  What is the purpose of podium having different height?  Might as well just give the same medal to all medalists and stand on a flat podium following your logic.
Realistically it should be something like 3 points for gold, 2 points for silver and 1 point for bronze. But the standard is still gold first, and it obviously regardless in any system should have a heavier weighting.
At what point do you go for gold then if all medals are equal? There has to be something that gives otherwise it is just a participation medal. Gold is better than the other two and should showcase it imo but it doesn‚Äôt mean the other two are worthless and meaningless.
Are we just going to pretend that 4th place finishers don't exist?

The fair system would be every entrant gets 1 point. Cause they are all trying their bestest and super stars and special.

Even if you don't finish or get DQed you still get your point.

Now you might think this is unfair to people who were really close to qualifying or simply forgot to be good at a sport, and you're right. Everyone on earth should get 1 point.

This way we can simply sort the tally by population. Which just so happens to improve the US position currently.
It isn't fair because it also treats bronze and silver as being as important as gold. The gold rankings do not ignore silvers and bronze altogether since no of silver and no of bronze are used to break ties in no of gold.
I‚Äôm American. If you ain‚Äôt first your last. Most Gold medals should be the decider.
MOGA!
Math.¬†
Ha! That is awesome! You've made me a happy redditor!
So Afganist√°n is winning?
Wait until track and field starts‚Ä¶.US always rakes in the medals
I know, reddit talks shit about America, meanwhile in real life most blokes are actually cool with it
if 2 countries have 5 golds who wins?

that's why they give out silver and bronzes to sort our ties.
Canada does the same thing.
When I search medal count for NYT, I get two charts: one showing most total medals and one showing most golds.
Baby you lost a war to birds. Twice. please be quiet.
Not true, Queensland newspapers have had a medal tally of us vs rest of Aus before because especially the first few days we had all the swimming medals. I‚Äôm sure there are lots of cases of medal tallies being represented differently for lots of reasons
So why do it then?
Haha  Fox Sports rank by medal and CNN by golds.
CNN must have received backlash, they were showing the tally by medals won in the first few days, they seem to have changed it now.
That's definitely OP's point, and they're reiterating it. But it's not true that all American media does it that way.
The person you replied to *is* the OP
To be fair "changed it decades ago" could still be after the soviet union collapsed
Week 2 on channel 9 will be all repeats of women swimming during Week 1.
Apparently there are also "winter olympics" or something.
Next they are gonna tell me there is some sort of winter Olympics! 

(As an Aussie, I genuinely didn't know there was a winter Olympics until my 20s)
That doesn't sound right I thought the only difference between the summer and winter Olympics was the pool was frozen so Bradbury had to run on the pool.
Absolutely!  The womens beach volleyball and womens field hockey! True athleticism and talent üòâ
It's rugby 7s. USA usually gets a college track star, and teach them how to catch. Then chuck them on the wing. You can win that game with just speed.
Plus while Australia has had success with rugby union. Rugby league is the more popular code of rugby here. Two different games. 
Laurie Daley, who once captained the Australian rugby leauge team said.
Rugby leauge is a simple game, for simple people.
Rugby union is a complex game ... for wankers.
Probably the easiest way to summarise Australians view on rugby
We‚Äôre number one! We‚Äôre number one!
USA today have the following:

> USA - 20

> Mercury - 0

> Venus - 0

> Ceres - 0

> Mars - 0

> Jupiter - 0

> Saturn - 0

> Neptune - 0

> Pluto - 0

> Haumae - 0

> Makemake - 0

> Eris - 0
I would love to see versions of the table that pits trading and security groups against each other.  AUKUS and "The Quad" are both beating the EU.
Btw, what you said [also did happen](https://www.businessinsider.com/china-claims-olympic-medal-table-victory-over-usa-altered-count-2021-8)
APAC Member Countries (that I can travel on my APAC Business Visa):
 
Australia, New Zealand, China, Thailand, Indonesia, Japan, Vietnam, Brunei, South Korea, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Vietnam, Chile, Mexico, Peru.
Surely the equivalent would be APAC or ASEAN.
>they believe they're the best and anyone who tells them otherwise is wrong, so media outlets are forced to do things in ways that please the American public

This is such a chronicly online take. Outside of the most out of touch nationalist you will struggle to find people who will honestly say with no nuance, 'Yeah American is number one at everything, we're the best!' And it's not like out of touch nationalist is something America has a monopoly on.

The ease at which some of you swallow sensationalized news and videos online and use it to form your entire view of a country you have very clearly never even been to is kind of mind-blowing.
How about by just GDP?
I think their point was how much is each medal costing the tax payer
>That ignores all the flow on benefits of having a population that has a well funded sports programme.


A well funded sports programme and an elite sports programme are two different things. We spend a lot on elite sports, and the flow on effects of *that* are a lot more nebulous. Australia is a very obese country comparative to the rest of the world.¬†
And how does that work out per capita?
Yeah that's a good point. A male/female breakdown would probably show exactly that.
3 years since Tokyo 2020
Terminally online people don‚Äôt really go outside.
They're not trying to pass that off as the official tally.  Get out of here.
Americans are not great at measuring things the way the rest of the world does.
American exceptionalism. It‚Äôs a way of life and it is to be protected at all cost
\*clears throat\*

USA! USA! USA! USA!

...That's the general reasoning.
Because they didn‚Äôt win the most gold in Beijing and had to come out on top haha
shocked? :P
Fox is odd one out then. It‚Äôs common place to sort the tally by number of golds.¬†
Shush!! The 80‚Äôs were only a few years ago.
The USSR was why I wasn't committing to longer than "decades ago".  I remember the Berlin Wall coming down, but I don't remember how a country on the other side of the world formatted Olympics medal tables pre-Internet.
yeah but they only have ever had one event and it was that ice skating race that some dude won when everyone fell over
They're not held in friendly time zones for us much
Can't watch women's beach volleyball. I can not bring myself to support something that feels so much like sexploitation. Why do the women have to wear bikini thongs while the males wear board shorts and shirts?
Make the male athletes wear budgie smugglers for beach volleyball. That would at least be fair. I would still not watch the sexualised volleyball though.
Big-Endian vs Little Endian.
All around hilarious. Olympic level shenanigans
Idk, that's not really my experience. I've found even very progressive and globally minded Americans have some intense American exceptionalist mindsets. Sure it's not as cartoonist as you describe, thinking they're literally the best at everything, but the idea that America is literally different and special seems pretty totally saturated throughout the America  population, outside of real political radicals
Yeah that‚Äôs true. Especially when you consider how much soft power Olympics glory is worth for nation states.
Australia, $13.65 USD per capita, USA $3.06 per.  
So let‚Äôs just ignore that, mmmmmkay?
It‚Äôs the imperial medal system
I thought perhaps it's because most Americans would struggle to work their way through the list of countries to find the USA?
Because that's the official IOC way of doing it.
I even heard there's some sort of "Commoners Wealth Games" or something. Sounds the Squid Game to me. Very suspicious.
They have options. The women who play choose to wear bikinis because the less fabric the less sand can get trapped. Apparently, comfort is more important than modesty
I'm not sure I should be happy that I recognise that reference
Your experience is the internet and you projecting your own insecurity

Most Americans don‚Äôt consider their heritage to be American and don‚Äôt really do patriotism outside of the Olympics or 4th of July, if you think otherwise you haven‚Äôt actually been to America. We‚Äôre tired of internet Australians projecting whatever weird bullshit about us their British overlords pound into their heads about us through media or whatever else.

The US is an immigrant society, not a monoculture. There is no racial element to being American. The fact that you are talking about Americans like they exist on the same ethnic paradigm as Aussies and Brits shows you have no fucking idea what you‚Äôre talking about.
Or just assume that the data was incorrect.
I'm gonna support women in sport by completely tuning out of their matches because I can't accept that they made an adult decision to wear beachwear for a sport traditionally played on the beach.
I'm not talking about the internet, I mean in real life as well. I have met many Americans - many of whom I like and respect a lot and who are broad minded people with intelligent things to say about the world. They don't have to be rah rah patriotic to buy into American excpetionalism on some level, in fact I'm specifically talking about people who AREN'T overt ultra nationalists, those people exist in every country.
Mostly Americans are unaware of it but they seem to have a fundamental belief in the narrative of American excpetionalism that differs from how most people view their nations. At least this is in my experience. I will just ignore the weird childish comment about "British overlords" or whatever as if I'm not capable of making an observation of the world by myself.

And I don't know what your last comment is even supposed to be because Australia and the UK are also ethnically diverse countries, and my comment was not related to race or ethnicity at all.
Also curious - if I'm projecting my insecurity, what am I supposed to be insecure about? Fwiw I don't consider Americans to be particularly insecure
Imagine that. Women with choices choose clothing other women find objectionable.
