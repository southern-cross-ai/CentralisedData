Heh - didn't expect to see a pic from tuggers. Grew up right on the edge of Kambah a few hundred metres from here.

It ain't much but it's home.
Some of the canals in Surfers Paradise are lined like this. Emerald Lakes has a European style line of flats along the lake. Sanctuary Cove/ hope island.
Not without the jet skis.
Looks like the opening scene of a natural disaster documentary.
surfers paradise has similar canals.
Yes, this reminds me of [Huis Ten Bosch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huis_Ten_Bosch_%28theme_park%29), a Dutch theme park in Japan!
Nope .. Tuggers is a very "special" place.
Have they fixed the blue-green algae problem yet?
No but who would ever wanna go there?
I usually see this in my bedroom when I or my partner tuggamydong
It was the faecal bacteria.
It's got a good Bunnings.
Could be flood. Could be zombies. Could be locusts.
