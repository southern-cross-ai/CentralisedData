Now go find a story that isn't a desperate beat-up.
Wah wah, I can't see why you're calling it a desperate beat-up unless you're a rusted on Labor supporter. It's not a bad article (and often these ABC analysis articles are bad). The excitement of 2022 contrasted with the imminent voice failure in 2023 and now the aftermath in 2024 is an interesting angle.
