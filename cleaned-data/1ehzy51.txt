According to the ads this is the point at which a genie should arrive and magically refill them for you.
Couldn't finish the packet, what a rookie.
They are also pretty expensive now, which makes me really sad.
Welcome and enjoy our national dish
Just remember “it all goes to the hips”
I feel a TimTam Slam coming on with that last one. Nothing better than a good coffee and a TimTam Slam.
They used to be far better.
Check the expiry date. Apparently any after December 2024 use a worse recipe.
Stopped eating them when they doubled in price.
"Family pack", "party pack", obesity pack.
If they're not 100% made from authentic Australian families, then I don't want them. Soylant Green TimTams, mmm yum!
Contains palm oil + lots of sugar
I have always loved Australia from afar, mad max, Steve Irwin, rainbow lorikeets etc … but yall are always so negative smh
Yeah older Tim Tam's were yum, these new sugar filled hard Tim Tim's suck.
Hahaha really. Honesty is not negative. Some examples of Aussie negativity would be appreciated rather than sweeping generalised statements.
Sadly true but in this case my observation relates to a recent manufacturing change resulting in a sweeter, less chocolately product. Grab older packs while you can.

Like your nick. Our local loris turn up and scold us whenever we fail to fill their feeder.
I work in an aviary with 70, they are great birds, and yes, they all have a different personality/temperament and they’ll recognize you. Great birds! Was just messing btw, sending good vibes ~
No worries.  

Mind those beaks, there's no such thing as an affectionate nibble from those hellfairies.
