I’m currently applying for university to hopefully start in 2025 (currently in Y12), and will likely be staying away from home for the first time depending on where I get in. If I do end up staying on or around campus it will be at Charles-Sturt (Bathurst), or Southern-Cross (Lismore). I was wondering if any recent or current students who stayed on campus (at these schools or others) can offer insight as to whether or not it’s worth it?
I hear the Bathurst campus is good because most students are staying away from home making the ‘vibe’ different in my dads words. 
I worked at CSU at Bathurst. Lots of students head home to Sydney at weekends so campus gets pretty quiet. The on campus accommodation is pretty new but is in an area of the campus where there are snakes sighted pretty regularly.
I’m living at home in sydney right now which was one of the reasons I want to live on campus at Charles Sturt. It’s only about a 3 hour drive back so it’s not like I’m living interstate anyway.
