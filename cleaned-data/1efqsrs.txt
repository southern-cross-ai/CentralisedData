Just wondering if anyone knows if you can study online at an Aussie uni while living overseas? I’ve been in NZ now for a few years but looking at potentially going back to studying. Just weighing up nz vs Aus uni’s. Cheers.

You can. But only certain courses from some universities. Things like Open University exists - where most of the learning is done online. Depends on what you are planning to study.
Why pay huge amounts of money for online when [EdX](https://www.edx.org/) and others do it for free?
