Was Tasmania settled by teenagers?
Missed Cockburn, WA
No mention of Yorkeys Knob or Bing Bong.
Worst place names? These are the best.
Ah yes, censor chinaman, but not any of the other names of this list.
What's a hill you're willing to die on? Bullshit Hill, SA
I looked up Wanka Road QLD on Google Maps, and it seems just one person lives there.
What about Iron Knob, South Australia?
Missing the COC (Canberra Outlet Centre) on Iron Knob Street in the ACT.
Rooty Hill, NSW where are you?
I fact checked a random sample of items from the list because I was so gobsmacked. ALL WERE GENUINE. UNBELIEVABLE!
Should we get beers tonight? “*Nar Nar Goon*” Another classic.
There’s also a Dookie in Victoria
I'm 62 years old with the sense of homour and dirty mind of a 12 year old. I laughed at all of them.
Sad that Burrumbuttock missed the cut.
Huh, no, blackbutt how strange.

A area just south of dapto (than again naming conventions around that area are hilarious, Heh Koonawarra or Kanahooka as the former might raise an eyebrow sounding like something else while the latter sounds like the start of a sentence).
Burnt Pussy is quite the sight to behold
Ernst Wanke rd - Pakenham
Make sure you stop in to visit the home of the Redcliffe Dolphins, Dick "Tosser" Turner Stadium.
Pensioners bush holy fuck 🤣🤣🤣 this isn't real
Forgot niggerhead rock
Missed off Koolyakobbing !
Dicky beach?
Worst???
Dunedoo, NSW
Some well named Local Government Areas in NSW too. My favourites are Bogan and Bland
Bong Bong Road in Dapto, NSW… although I’m sure plenty of ppl would say it’s actually a good name!
Best* place names.
What happened to Humpty Doo, NT. And I forgot about Blackbutt, QLD aswell
On the way to Ballarat, driving south, is Mt Blowhard.
I've got some tittybong merch I bought in Quambatook
The one town that has always fucking irritated me is in the Northern Rivers of NSW.

Mooball.

Now, the name is fucking stupid but the townsfolk double down on this. They decorate the town with a theme of cows. Makes sense right? There are a lot of cattle farms around, even though most of the area is devoted to sugarcane.

My problem though, is those cattle farms are all beef breeds. Mooball paints everything like Holstein-Friesians (the classic black and white cows for dairy).

It's a small irritation but also fuck all of you :(
Are these places with postcodes or locality names?   
Missing.   

Tumbledown Dick Hill.   

Mount Mee.  
Mount Meharry.
You can get from Dirty Dick Creek to Cock Wash, but it might take awhile.
Read up the origins of Goodna.

Hopping Dicks Creek is located in Limpinwood. They are close to Blue knob.
Bumbang Island just north of Robinvale isn't there but definitely should be.

You missed yorkies knob, qld, which holds an annual 'the festival at the knob'
Alight here for Balls Head
Spanker Knob, VIC
Darawank- NSW didn't make the list
You forgot Cockburn, WA

Yorkies knob’s missing. And a heap of others
Iron Knob in SA

There’s Black Charlie’s Opening (in Tasmania). There’s no way to impart this info that isn’t wrong.
Bogan Gate is pretty special, aptly named.
lol stay classy, Australia.
How did Yorkeys Knob not make the list?
Are these all actually legit? Because that is gold, proud Aussie moment lol
The Google reviews of these places are an absolute gold mine
Out of everything on the list the one word you CANNOT say is Chinaman
The Canadian band Arrogant Worms did a version of this [about the towns of Newfoundland](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CbLoTHQjves)
Why do we have a town with an asterisk in it's name?
What about delicate nobby….. NSW
I love 🇦🇺. My place to be 🙌🤣🤎
What's the worst of those
Is Chinaman offensive?
Dog Hole Rd near Broadwater Vic
Booby Island sounds like a riot.
Dick Ward Drive in Fannie Bay NT?

Big dick bore would be an elite porn star name
You could give your say here, too [https://urbanpoll.com/polls/australia-worst-place-names-poll-9z66duhj](https://urbanpoll.com/polls/australia-worst-place-names-poll-9z66duhj)
Lmao tittybong
And Humpybong
What about Useless Loop?
Missed one. Pakenham Upper, Vic
You forgot Cockburn in WA (suburb pronounced co-burn) and Dick Ward Drive, Fanny Bay in NT
Forgetting Obum Obum Qld
Used to live near Fernberg road in Brissie...it was renamed to Furburger Road ....well? Close enough! 😁🤣
There's also Eromanga, which in Japanese means p*rn comic (erotic manga)
This list was seemingly compiled by a teenager.
They always miss Watanobbi
im just surprised two rocks WA didnt end up on the list, though its quite sedate. Also cockburn WA
Ernst Wanke Road always get a laugh when driving in south east Melbourne.
Tittybong represent!
Pour one out for Useless Loop in WAs far north
I live next Bones Knob on the Atherton Tablelands
Shame you can't actually get to Bald Knob (I've tried)

I've been to a few of these for selfies, along with a few others that aren't on this list.

Also, there are actual a group of Islands in the Intercourse group
Worst names?? These are our best!!!
Missed Upper Swan, WA
Pakenham Upper?
Iron knob SA
Commenting so I can return for the lulz.
What about Cockburn or Koolyanobbing and why censor Chinamans Knob, bloody pathetic.
Upper Swan in WA has always been a fave
What about  'Pakenham Upper'??
Iron Knob, SA doesn't get a mention?
We also have Cockburn in WA
For real, I'd thought I'd heard the worst of the worst and yet here I am learning about a town called "Guys Dirty Hole, TAS".....




It really can't be THAT difficult to change your towns name right? It's not like these are major capital cities or anything.
Yes, but it had a cool name before it was called Tasmania, it was called “van demons land” or some shit like that
They left off “Dr Dicks Drive” too
This has been going on for a LONG time.

Theres a mountain behind Mullumbimby called Mt Chincogan. Chincogan is a bundjalung word meaning "huge erect cock".
It was nearly re-named Batmania, after John Batman....

Edit - I was close, but also totally wrong. See comments below!
Most people would pronounce it co-burn but I made sure I really emphasised the cock and burn
Also the Cockburn on the NSW/SA border
Or Poowong.
Or Humpybong!
Iron Knob
Woodenbong!
Bung Bong
For real, who wouldn’t want to visit Booby Island ? Or Hooker Park?
I blew out about this. Also that they missed Chinaman's Beach in Agnes Water, Qld, considering it is so bad it needed censoring. 

Also missed Condong and Moo Ball.
Hey watch the language pal! Kids could be reading this.
The chinaman is not the issue here, dude.
There's a Linger and Die Hill in NSW.
Makes sense 🤷🏼‍♂️
The street sign had been stolen so many times in the past that it's now been set in stone by the local council.
otherwise it would be wankas road
Welcome to Wanka Road. Population: You and this wanker
Iron Knob is also a town in South Australia.
Good times at the Rooty Hill RSL
And they are only the tip of the iceberg, roadtripping around especially in rural areas really makes you second guess roadsigns
Are these all tiny towns?  Imagine all the rejected application forms!
Yep, dookie ag college has copped a lot of flack due to their name
I have to admit I did the same
Kanahooka dapto? Yes, but they charge extra.
I was just in blackbutt, how could I forget that
I've heard the smell is even worse
Dick tosser….ahahahaahah 😂
I've heard the area is a bit grey
Isn’t that a Steve Earle song
Or n*gger creek
I'd say best, but that's a matter of opinion
Meaning there are worser
100 percent
Funnily enough I have a Mt blowhard roadsign in the shed
These are real places with real postcodes
Especially if you go through Guys Dirty Hole.
Do you mean Goodna?
I was wondering when this would come up
Yes, all legit
It's a strange place to draw the line
It's just not cricket
Whoever collated the list thought Chinaman was offensive than other things on the list
Same reason we have an its with an apostrophe in its centre?
The comments are better than the original post
You can save posts.
The censorship is very confusing
Maybe that's the renamed version, used to be worse...
The town got tired of the jokes in 2052 and changed the name to Guys Brown Hole
Ahhhh so they're just respecting the traditional land holders with these English rude names?
I thought that was Melbourne?
Used to know a kid whose surname was Cockshell, and their family insisted it was Co-shell.

Nup. I know how letters work. It's Cock Shell. A shell for cocks.
I still emphasise the Cock and Burn. Been living here for 10 years hahaha
lol I do the same 😂
Pakenham Upper.
Dog Hole Rd Vic
going to agnes in a few weeks  
may have to check out that beach
What part is?
"That one guy is the wanka" - The council
The iron knob itself is gone though. Long ago mined for steel.
I'm going there tomorrow just to take a photo
That's interesting
And the foliage is quite sparse.
I’m going to hell for laughing so hard at this! 🤣🤣
This comment section’s wildin
And lets not forget the N-word Stadium

https://peakvisor.com/peak/tumbledown-dick-hill.html
Yup. Southerner mistake. Corrected. Thanks.
That’s amazing
cr*cket
Oh, yes... I used an ownership apostrophe in the wrong place
Good news everyone!
It was. There was (until 2019) the Division of Batman (Federal) in the northern suburbs of Melbourne. It was replaced by the Division of Cooper, named for William Cooper, an Aboriginal political activist. The reason Batman's name was removed was largely due to his role as a mass murderer of Tasmanian Aboriginal people.
I'll add it to the list of facts I overly confidently half remembered 😅
I died at "I know how letters work"!!
"It's *BOUQUET*" - Mrs Bucket
Resident since 2016, a woman in her mid-50s and I insist on pronouncing it Cock Burn. May I never grow up.
Pakenham Inn?
Donny, you're out of your element!
Well, the top is lopped off, but it is still knobby. And the town still exists.
Censored one but not the other??
It was a different time, and now a lot of the places are now having their names changed
That indigenous meaning behind Goodna was a reason they changed the name of the Christian school there to Westside Christian College. It was always an insult used against it.
There's Batman Ave near the city and people always add a "C" in front of ave on the sign!
> May I never grow up.

You have to get old - you don't have to grow up
If it's going in then you must have pooed wrong.
Its always full
