The title makes it sound like the dead driver was deliberately left in the vehicle for days. But reading the article, it seems the vehicle was just not discovered for some days after it crashed.
Very shit title.  Is this what happens when Perth Now gets their news from somewhere other than /r/perth?
Which is one reason why we need to read more than just the title.
Hey now, the titles they use for the stories from Reddit are shitty too!
You mean the title that you changed from the article?
