Any suggestions for Magnesium Glycinate supplements? 

I've some accross an Aussie company called Honor Health and they seem okay. But there's so many options online it's confusing. 

Any feedback or suggestions would be amazing!

What are the symptoms you're hoping to alleviate with a magnesium supplement, OP? 

I know a hot bath with Epsom salts (Magnesium sulfate) does wonders for relaxing muscles!
I got some gummies from Amazon US with my Prime membership. Arrived pretty quick.
Haha definitely not on meth
I have a muscle movement disorder, insomnia etc...
I just get powder form from iherb
I use Honour Health for both Magnesium Glycinate and their Vitamin D3 tablets. They arrive pretty quickly, they have never arrived off, damaged, or tampered with, and their email marketing isn't excessive. 


I'm just a regular person (I don't work in health at all), but I'd recommend them.
What op is talking about is a magnesium salt that is able to cross the blood brain barrier (not very well but it does).

I take it to offset the physical side effects of amphetamine. For me there is a slight but noticeable alleviation of body tension. 

It is also a mild NMDA antagonist (same as ketamine/nitrous oxide). Very mild in this regard, but dissociatives are said to help avoid tolerance build-up to many types of drugs. Ketamine is currently being researched to slow tolerance build-up to opiates.

Anecdotally people say it keeps amphetamine(s) tolerance in check.

On top of this it retains the effects of other forms of magnesium. I will make a capsule with ~400mg. Too much can upset your stomach a bit. No need for more than one dose a day.

This guy meths!
Was that a link to my double post? I've deleted it now, I just had an error message when it posted (something about a null value) and figured it didn't post so I didn't check back. (If it isn't, then idk where your link goes, the phone app may still be giving me odd errors).
This guy has adhd lol
Yeah, it was just a way of letting you know you double posted.
Thanks for letting me know (not sarcasm, I appreciate ya, it's embarrassing to double post haha)
