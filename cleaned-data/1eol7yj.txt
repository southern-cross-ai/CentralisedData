I thought “oh she’s not too bad here” then realised that was her competitor who went first.
Am I missing something? That looks worse that the shit we did as 13 year olds, after the movie 'Breakdance' came out and we all listened to 'Rock steady Crew'.
All the talk is about how cringey Raygun's performance was, but I honestly have to ask... how the fuck is this even an Olympic sport?
Ambitious, nutritious, delicious, delirious
Oh no she’s been protesting for awhile now
Yeah pretty bad
I can find better dancers walking down swanston street.
I love that none of us actually 'know' what breakdancing moves are, but we know which ones to expect because of TV and movies. I like that I can't tell if raygun is taking this incredibly seriously or not seriously at all.
Is this a new Chris Lilley character? Send Jonah Takalua in the men's category
She really likes the floor.
She said in an interview (paraphrased) that she knew she couldn't compete on physicality so she went for artistry instead. At a global competition for *athletic prowess*.

In every other 'artistic sport' you have to have the physicality and then your artistry is what gets you over the edge. It's like saying "I can't hit a home run, so I'm just going to pick up the ball and walk around the diamond with it in my pocket!".

That's not how this works. That's not how ANY of this works.
What a fucking terrible olympic sport
Am I incorrect in saying they're all bad?
She’s so much better in this video than what she did at the Olympics. Not good but better.
what the heck went on here? i always thought australians prided themselves in being very direct.

not one person thought to say to this person - this isnt for you.

or were they all afraid of being accused of mansplaining break dancing?
And then we find out she did it as a dare and she becomes legend
Honestly, how did she slip through the cracks ? There would be 9 year olds who could do better.
I watched the men's tonight. It made zero sense. Everytime you thought you saw a clear winner... They lost. It's fucking stupid.
Judging by what she has said in interviews what she did at the Olympics was a creative decision to do something unique that nobody else has done. I wonder if in normal breakdancing contests they encourage that type of creativity and that's how she got as far as she did.
Did she organise the event or something?
She has a PhD in breakdancing…
I’m obsessed with her, she’s my hero. Winner of the gold in my heart. If Raygun can get up there and do her thing, what can’t I do? National icon imo
This is still pretty bad. I’m appalled
This is so embarrassing.
So she was just as bad then as she is now? 😂
Still a lot of wiggling around on the floor though.
Which is it guys?

She got in cause she was white and privileged, or was it the woke agenda?

Or is it just that she won the olympic qualifier and women breaking  talent is completely non existent in oceania.
“Look what I can do!”
Why do I feel like France was short 1 female competitor to make the Olympics 50/50 male female split...
I noticed alot of posts about this 'breakdancer' are being removed by admin in Australia. I understand why but it is futile at this point. 
How is this a sport?
She put in the work, got to the Olympics and got up there knowing she wasn’t the best and represented as best she could. 

If people thought they were better they should have stood the fuck up but they didn’t. 

Step the fuck up Australia and support her and if you think you are better then step the fuck up yourself.
Raygun is awesome. The dance is harder than alot of people think. I am proud she did what she did. Her moves are super original. 

Also, if you think you can do better, please do. I’m in Perth, come to the breakdance session and join in. We are looking for new people and would love anyone wanting to practice and learn. Or if you think you dont need to practice to be better than our countries best? Then all the more power to you. You can rep us, and with training beat other countries best.
Lmaooooo same 
Yes it is, have to wonder where this event took place. Can easily see it in some out of the way place so only those with $$$ attended…
Watch her other video..
[deleted]
The old, out of touch idiots at the IOC and the organisers of the Paris games were scrambling for something that might interest young people, since the Olympics are stuggling to stay relevant to young people. 

Safe to say that Breakdancing isn't coming back for 2028 in LA, where the LA organisers have chosen Baseball, Softball, Twenty20 Cricket, Flag American Football, Lacrosse, and Squash as the sports they get to add with the privilege they get as organizers. Australia obviously aren't going to bring it back for 2032 either, we have real sports that we can add to benefit ourselves. 

This was almost certainly a one-time experiment that is unlikely to ever return.
They dropped Karate for this...
It's absolutely valid as a sport, the problem is who's running the show, and making decisions. BOTY, Red Bull, etc. are examples of this working on a similar competitive metric, but the absence of cultural leaders and contributors (not to mention the absence of BLACK PEOPLE to guide the cultural aspects!) make this seem like a lost cause, when it should have been a slam dunk. I'm grievously disappointed in the execution of this debacle, in equal measure to my amusement with this individual's oblivious audacity.
When done right, it's pretty impressive. Requires quite a lot of athleticism. No problems with having it in the Olympics imo. Just send a proper athlete next time...
It's just like rhythmic gymnastics
It's so silly because it's not even a current trendy type of dancing anymore. It would be like creating a category for Disco dancing.
Why is it less of a sport than rhythmic gymnastics? Breakdancing can be seriously athletic and demanding at high levels.
As opposed to rhythmic gymnastics? Or synchronised swimming? Etc.
[deleted]
They brought it back
She got up, on centre stage to an audience size she has probably never seen, and gave it a crack. It didn't work out for her unfortunately.
After watching hip-hop dancing for the last decade I picked it up last year. It's incredibly fun, but also a lot more difficult than it appears. 

Coming from a desk job you have to spend a lot of time rewiring your brain so that you can control your hands and feet at the same time. Even things that look simple are actually hard to pull off and make look good.

Some of the stuff Ray Gun did is significantly difficult in practice, especially when you're timing it to the beat.

Unfortunately her style feels extremely experimental, wild and weird, and with her performance at the Olympics there was almost a Vaudeville/Slap Stick feeling to her performance. 

So while there's probably some appeal to those looking for something fresh in the scene. The general public is rightfully scratching their heads going... Is this breaking?

In saying that, she was also the weakest dancer of the pool phase by far. Her moves felt sluggish in comparison to others, and there was an arrogance to her stage presence when not performing.

That all said, the rest of the pool stages were super fun imo.  Looking forward to the gents tonight.
I walked into the loungeroom when her "set" was on and genuinely thought she was having a medical episode...  

But I don't know anything about breaking.
>That she knew she couldn't compete on physicality so she went for artistry instead. At a global competition for athletic prowess.


In one of the sports that literally awards many points for artistry

"judges score the battles on six criteria - **creativity**, **personality**, technique, variety, **performativity** and **musicality**." - the Olympics website 

Technique is just one of 6




>That's not how this works. That's not how ANY of this works.

You should actually look up how this works before confidently declaring that's not how it works
No. Some of these B Girls are insanely good.  The problem is the coverage is wrong. The music should be louder than the idiot commentators. Only one knows what she is talking about and you are missing the vibe of the music with the dancing. It's disappointing coverage
Molly, who Dr. RAYGUN defeated in the final to get her Olympic spot was wayyyyyyyy better.

The whole thing is a bit odd.
It's like watching that movie... Set it up or step it up or something.... cringey af.
At least the Olympic judges did… she got zero points in three rounds. I don’t really see how that promotes breaking in Australia, but I’m not the one with a PhD in the subject
Conspiracy theory here: She has a doctorate in cultural studies. She has seen the online movement of going viral.

Aus doesn't have a big scene of breakdancers. 
She knew her style was not going to cut the cake.
She took an opportunity, now the whole world knows who she is. Yes maybe for bad reasons, but it's not for full retard reasons.

If she makes bank on it, bloody oath she played the long game.
Apparently you lose points for repeating moves, and a lot of the guys who were landing genuinely difficult moves were also losing points for repeating them.
Practically, IMO.


The Olympic qualifying competition was partly run by a ballroom dancing organisation DanceSport which she was heavily associated with and it had no real connection to breaking at that time.


The time of the registration documents *creation* was 2.5 months before closing - so how long they really gave people to register (which required membership, etc) was questionable.


If you look into that side of things there's a bit of controversy about how she managed to qualify above others - even in reviewing her past performances she mostly scored poorly.
Never in my life would I imagine hearing that. Its like having a PhD in running, so u Usain Bolt? Nah Im just really good at knowing how to run and whats around it. But even then a good PhD in running (without the least bit of running prowress) can at least be a coach or a sideline performance advisor for real runners. Imo breaking is just too young for this and anyone who claim to have expertise in the thing should be down the mud of breaking seriously, not "on papers".
Its embarrassing that 1) *its broadcasted* 2) its the best the entirety of oceania can come up with 3) the broadcasters think its *good*
she isnt reading this
100% agree. No one has any shit to say about that one girl in winter Olympics that barely knew how to ski and only got in because she competed in enough events doing the most basic routine relying on others to drop out. All I see are videos praising her ingenuity. But breakdance bad and your whole life is over.
She’s not gonna let you hit it
Normally I’d agree but the girl who won skateboarding for Australia is genuinely quite good at it.
Been skateboarding since the mid 90s and this is just nonsense. I can promise you aren’t seeing kids at your local at Yuto Horigome and Nyjah Huston level of style and consistency. Both Arisa and Keegan in the park event representing AUS were doing insanely complex runs
Idk, Olympic skateboarding was pretty impressive.
Nah, all those skateboarders are top level, especially the guys. You might see similar tricks at the skatepark at home but most of the guys at the Olympics consistently stick them. Surfing is the same.
No the fuck you don’t.
Reckon they’ll let us add AFL for a bit of statpadding?
I'm not a fan of it myself, but judging by its popularity these days I would have thought e-sports would be a better choice to attract younger viewers. But I suspect a lot of people would probably argue it isn't a "real sport".
People are getting uppity about breakdancing need to apply their same standards to artistic swimming and dressage.  That chick was an embarrassment but other girls are flipping though the air and doing headstands that I would say is as impressive as the tumbling events.
>Flag American Football

Lololol

How many countries play this?
I just watched the men’s finals and it was so fun. The dancers were having a great time. The performances were great. The stands were packed. If we can have horse dancing then I reckon breaking is a great addition to the Olympics.
Add to that, breaking is apparently quite popular in France
Twenty20 would be solid fun for a lot of people
Real sports? Breaking takes true athleticism and requires skill so its a sport. I think "Raygun" did the sport a disservice but its 100% a sport

Cambridge defines a sport as "a game, competition, or activity needing physical effort and skill that is played or done according to rules, for enjoyment and/or as a job"
[deleted]
oooft ok now I'm offended
Worst comparison in history
synchronised swimming is fucking hardcore.
Rhythmic gymnasts have amazing athleticism
Have you actually watched rhythmic gymnastics? Or synchronised swimming? The fitness of the athletes and their ability to precisely execute difficult flexibility and hand-eye coordination tasks is out of this world.

If anything deserves to be in the Olympics, it's those two.
Quite right. Never understood the point of those two either. They strike me as artforms, not sports.
That's a shame. I was hoping to see Raygun 2: Electric Boogaloo at the next Olympics.
Yes and no. The host can nominate up to 6 optional sports to include in the program, in addition to the however many core sports they have to have. These are often lobbied to the host by the sports representative body. The host nominates and the IOC approves whatever. If they're a success they eventually get added to the core program, likely at the expense of another. So yeah, its for this games only but the same could have been said for baseball and softball in the last Olympics.
That’s cool and all but how was she considered the person best suited to represent our country in that event?
The bigger issue with her performance (and others in the event) is b-boy/girl-ing is hugely rooted in Hiphop culture, and not commercial Hiphop, but the grimey graffiti and gang infested streets of NY in the 1970s HipHop. These people are mostly dance students, not breakers. 

At its heart it is a dance style that encompasses one part of what Hiphop use to represent before it became just another music genre. That is DJing, emceeing, graffiti and breaking. 

Breaking was the Hiphop dance that represented typical “street” concepts like beef, style, and infamy, but it did it with dance moves the same way emcees did it with a mic, djs with turntables and writers with spray paint. 

She looks like a cornball because she probably hasn’t ever been in the culture so to speak, she just watches it in movies and is emulating. That’s not to say you have to be a “street-person” to be good at these things but the “style” usually comes with being part of the culture over many years. 

Good breakers have attitude, but are smooth with it. Up-Rock and Down-Rock for example have different uses in breaking, they were used to get in the face of rivals and flick their hats off, pull a face like they stink or to break up their flow with your own (better) moves. It was competitive, not in a sporting sense but like rival gangs, and individuals with egos and reputations on the line. None of those elements are on show here so it just looks like a middle age white woman taking the piss
This is the correct assessment. People calling her a "mockery" are wrong and have no idea what breaking is and what constitutes good. She was clearly outclassed and looked like she was leaning heavily into a character that looked like it fell flat. But anyone saying "I could this" is coping. But I've learned that sometimes people have bad showings and are still working to find themselves. Lil G from Red Bull bc one 2008 to 2009 was like watching a brand new dancer. It isn't that he magically got good in that 1 year. He just didn't really have his identity and looked nervous in 2008.
Any knowledge of breakdancing I have is limited to what pop culture tells me it is, so it's cool to hear from someone who does it. 
It all seems very performative, but the younger competitors seem more at home with their style rather than presenting what they think is 'attitude'. I like seeing the breakers but I think by virtue of being in the Olympics, it has to be largely sanitized 
Did you even READ what I said?

If you dive into a synchronised swimming pool and you do everything that your primary school aged mermaid dreams tells you is pretty but you do none of the technicals, you will loose.

If you ride your horse out into the dressage ring and do a fantastic rendition of a rodeo barrel race, *you will loose*. 

Because for every technical you don't bother performing, every other performer has one locked and loaded then they add artistry to what they're doing to make themselves stand out. 

And yes, I am confident in my opinion, very much so. Because I competed at the national level for an artistic sport when I was young, and watched people win because they performed perfect graded technicals *alongside* their artistry is how they won. Not their amazing artistry buffered by a less than stellar attempt at their technicals. Or not even attempting those technicals.

I say again. That's *not* how this works. That's not how any of this works.

She got zero to 18 for every. Single. Attempt. That means that not only was her 'artistry' bonk, if she'd at least performed some base-level technicals that were relatively easy but solidly performed, she would have at least scored one point.

She did not.

*Your* confidence on artistry just as relevant than technicals is totally flawed because she didn't *score a single point in any of her rounds* *for any of the 'artistic' portions either.*

None for creativity. None for personality. None for technique. None for variety. None for  performativity, and none for musicality.

Zero. 

She went to an athletic competition and tried to play off not being up to snuff for 'I thought I'd at least show off my creativity, because I knew I couldn't compete on *the things that make this activity an actual athletic sport*". 

No ma'am. That's now what the Olympics is for.
Maybe it's a reverse-psychology type of thing? Kids see her performance and think "I can do better than that!" so they sign up to the local breakdancing class without realising they've been inspired by her in a way!
You know I kinda agree with you. I think she genuinely tried. But also genuinely did memeworthy moves, to get more attention to breakdancing in Australia (as her paper she wrote was about). 

I also think the moves looked better in her head than what ended up transpiring
I have another theory: She’s approached by the AOC to help find a suitable candidate to represent Aus. She gets too caught up with her doctorate and forgets about the AOC’s request. They follow up, asking for a shortlist of dancers, she doesn’t have one. She lies and says no one’s good enough. Panic ensues all around. In a moment of desperation, she volunteers herself. Heads to qualifiers. Heads to Paris. Ends up performing the RaygunnaRoo. End.
Yeah I heard that. The "commentators" weren't saying a thing. They were also confused it sounded
You wouldn't imagine it, because it also isn't true.
Here in the US, the commentators were pretty silent and diplomatic about her moves when she was dancing. They mentioned that she was a professor. I think I heard one compliment about a move she did, but other than that they didn’t really discuss her much.
She was such a laughing stock and embarrassment they literally changed the rules to never have that happen again and she's been called out on being a cashed up yuppie who lived out a random rich white dream as she could afford the constant travel. You are really forgetting that incident.
I think in this case it’s the fact that she supposedly has a PhD in break dancing(?) and teaches at Macquarie University about it(?) + also the fact that she obviously prides herself on her breaking. She’s being very serious about it, but sadly it’s not reflected in her execution (at least according to the general public’s perception of what good breaking is) making this different to the skier story. 

On the other hand, I think the skier story feels more funny and relatable - like we’re laughing with the skier that she found a loophole. Like she did a dare and took it all the way. I think that’s why lots of people are hoping Raygun is also in on a long-running joke/dare.
Wrong. They changed the rules of the sport as a result of the skier you mentioned.
Is that the only reason you would show respect to someone? If you think it will help you have sex with them?
I used to watch a bit of X games and Tony hawk etc which was 50 times more impressive. You can't tell me that the people who competed in that couldn't blitz these courses consistently and way more impressively.
If the Americans managed to get Flag Gridiron in, who knows what could get in
There is an Olympics-run event starting in 2025, although separate from the actual Olympics. The problem is that there's a lot of structural differences between esports and "real sports," even if you ignore the lack of physicality which seems to be a requirement for most Olympic events.

Everything about the game is necessarily in the hands of a company with its own profit motives. This means that a perfectly valid business decision (such as, say, choosing whether or not to open a server in a given region) is going to have profound effects on the competitive integrity of the game. You don't have that kind of conflict of interest in any traditional sport.
The problem with e-sports is it's not a unified thing, no matter what game you pick to represent it, you're going to exclude a lot of people no matter what. Really e-sports is better off how it currently is as each game that has had a long running e-sports scene has a very unique history and community.

Also to actually attract the top teams of some games you would have to be offering a pretty large amount of money as prizes, like for example the top level Dota 2 tournaments can have prize pools in the millions
Probably cos it’s not
is it less of a sport than dressage ? lol
e-sports are real sports just like chess is a board-sport and poker is a card-sport.


Edit: /s
E-sports aren't even that popular with young people other than east Asian countries. When people watch other people play games it's usually for their personality.
Imo the core of what makes competitive sport a "real sport" is the ability of the best to make good decisions and execute their skills to a higher level than anyone else.

Haven't heard a good argument as to why esports aren't real sports but things like chess and even archery/shooting are - they all come down to decision making and skill execution, just like any other sport.
Artistic swimmers are throwing people into the air from a treading water position. They’ve seriously increased the difficulty of what they’re doing and do a lot of it while not breathing. 

(I think breaking could have been great but I don’t think the structure of the competition worked as well as they would have liked)
Hey lay off artistic swimming! Those women are beasts. They train 8-10 hrs a day in the pool and can push their teammates into a backflip while upside down underwater. Artistic swimming is cold af 
Presumably that's why they picked it, easy golds for the home country to farm
Immigrant communities in most wealthy nations. America kinda sucks so many of them gtfo whenever they can.

But the correct answers will be USA, Canada, Mexico, American Samoa and Germany with NFL players being released to play for home countries while australia, uk and the like will send a team of pudgy dual citizen accountants who will be absolutely stoked to play at the olympics.
I agree, I watched the men's and women's finals and really enjoyed it.
It's already gone dude
Not really, both where short lived dance fades now mostly referenced in pop culture as a joke. Neither are appropriate for the Olympics.
I know. Why is breakdancing not deserving? I'm sure at one time when sync swimming was introduced people were having the same conversation.
Never said it didn't. Why is breakdancing not deserving then?
Obviously the best breakdancers do too.
What you just described also applies to breakdancing
Not knocking any of these disciplines. I guess my awkward point was all these things are subjective and take incredible skill, strength and conditioning to be at the level they are at. All of them do. I was just trying to draw comparisons as to why anybody would question why one is more deserving than another.
You do realise Arts were in the Olympics before right?
That's how I feel about break dancing. I have no issues with break dancing competitions,  but how is it a sport?
The question is not "can a pigeon play chest", the question is, "Who put the pigeon on the chess board?""
She did the work of going to all the comps to qualify her.
In another post, someone said in sports like these that it's hard to get funding a lot of really good competitors, and they don't have the financial backing to be able to compete on a circuit.
When you are the only person bothering to practice it in the entire country its easy to get picked
After all this discussion, still the most likely argument I've seen is the drug test.
She is a university intellectual specializing in break dancing culture. So she should know the context but was just average with her moves because she's in her 30s. 
She knew she couldn't compete physically so went all in on creativity and it fell flat.
wtf
That’s a whole lot of text for someone that’s missing the point
That’s not how scoring works in breaking. She didn’t “score zero”. The judges just chose the other bgirl. There is no scoring, the judge just chooses which one is better, in their opinion.
Honestly her performance was the best thing I've seen all day. Tears in my eyes.
They held a qualifier, you can go and watch it on YouTube. There were 15 girls and about 40 boys competing.
I'm not forgetting it I'm telling you what I've been seeing online about her in the past couple of months.
Given that Keegan Palmer (the Men's Park Gold Medalist) has literally won the X Games the past two years in a row, no the people who compete in the X Games can't blitz him.

You know what Tony Hawk got famous for? Being the first person to land the 900. You know what Arisa Trew (the Women's Park Gold Medalist) was famous for before winning Gold? Being the first woman to land the 900 (and the 720 in competition).

You're talking out your ass.
Americans dont even like flag football though as a spectator sport. There are a long of people especially young ones that play flag football but its a bit like putting wiffle ball or cornhole on tv.
Wed rather watch cricket or beach soccer or even handball or something. Flag football is to football like sandlot 2 is to sandlot.
Also the list of games they are playing is... uh... kinda rubbish compared to most eSports leagues.
To be fair MLB and NBA are big businesses as well.
Also we struggle to maintain integrity in traditional sports, good luck keeping it clean when the entire arena is 1's and 0's.
How is that any different to other sports? Everyone that plays a sport that isn't in the Olympics is excluded.

Is the IOC shelling out money to get LeBron James or Kevin Durant to play?
The horsies definitely have a bit more grace than Raygun but idk about the riders.
Yes?
What you describe is a game, not a sport. A sport inherently requires athletic prowess or physical ability. 
They're asking you to apply the same judgment. They're not saying artistic swimming is bad. Reading comprehension is a good skill.
We actually have a surprising amount of nfl players...of course, they aren't jumping from nrl and then raping so don't get any coverage... They are actually good at the game.  But that doesn't help with flag football
There was an [article](https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl-premiership/olympics-flag-football-australian-team-nrl-afl-netball-who-can-play-what-are-the-rules-2028-olympics-sports-los-angeles/news-story/2487637cae4f88709444c44b921b6baa) saying gridiron Australias plan was to send AFL/W NRL/W and Super Netball players over. If so, we would probably do quite well.
I reckon Australia and UK will be ok, new rules but we have plenty of afl/nrl players who should be able to pick it up quickly
There is zero chance NFL players are used.
Actual breakfasting might have been ok . The 2023 thing that made my eyes bleed was a long way from breakdancing as was the current vid of Ray going around now . That shit is just some abomination.
As I said in a different comment, breakdancing is great and no reason why it can't be in the Olympics. Just send good competitors next time...
It's a physical contest which has a winner as determined by rules. What other definition is there?

I also don't think it should be at the Olympics but it's hard to discredit this and credit rhythmic gymnastics etc.
>The question is not "can a pigeon pay chest"


Honestly that was never going to be the question either way
Building on that when you watch her dance occasionally she will do things that whilst not particularly impressive do require fitness and at least a little practice. Not to get super political but this really feels like one of those times when a middling white person with a bit of money achieves massive success. Like she tried it once did well for someone who had never done it, got a taste for it and failed upwards from there.
Didn’t look like there was much practice involved to me
There’s an article explaining the organisation who ran the qualifications. They usually do ballroom dancing, but when they found out that wouldn’t be in the Olympics they recruited “breakers”, got certified by IOC and held their own qualifications.
That’s kind of my point, she is a dance student not a breaker. Her age is only limiting because Olympic viewers seem to think breaking is just dancing with some acrobatics/gymnastics. There’s plenty of videos on YouTube of OGs in their 50s and 60s who still can do real pop locking and up rocking with style cause they were actual breakers in their youth. 

Her moves were average because it was interpretive dance, not breakdancing. 

A lot of people who train in traditional dance try to emulate the style through “Hiphop” dance classes, some of these people are super athletic and very talented but they never seem to understand that breaking was created for rival crews to battle on the dance floor instead of fighting each other. The same way graffiti writers paint over each other on a wall and rappers try to verbally assault each other in freestyle rap battles. It was a display of “I’m/We’re the best” for a group of poor minorities living in bad neighbourhoods who had nothing else in their lives.

Breaking is a part of real Hiphop culture and it’s very difficult to bottle and dilute what makes it special, such that it can be presented to the masses in an Olympic format.
That's a glib reply from someone who read my point and ignored it.
Wrong. At least, at the Olympic level.

# [Breaking judging criteria](https://olympics.com/en/news/breaking-breakdancing-rules-format-moves)

A minimum of three or more uneven number of judges score the battles on six criteria - **creativity**, **personality**, **technique**, **variety**, **performativity** and **musicality**.

Each parameter has different weightage in a battle, with technique, performativity and creativity constituting 60 per cent of the total score while variety, musicality and personality make up the remaining 40 per cent.

The judges submit their votes after each round and the breaker with the highest points is declared the winner.

Raygun scored zeros in all three of her rounds. Because there is an official scoring system based off percentages and she bombed out in every category.
The only reason it’s flag is so NFL players can participate the owners would never allow them to play contact in risk of getting injured for the season
3x3 half court Basketball is in the olympics for a similar reason I think, somebody at the IOC thinks it's really important to include sports that more closely mimic the way people play these games in their free time, as if there's no influence of logistics or practicality in terms of why it can look like that
Well, in their defense, I've found articles saying they're trying to bring actual esports titles to the 2025 iteration. But yeah, that old list was just them trying to replicate olympics sports digitally which is pretty fucking stupid.
Esports at the top level is much cleaner than olympic sports...
>How is that any different to other sports?

>The problem with e-sports is it's not a unified thing, no matter what game you pick to represent it, you're going to exclude a lot of people

It's because esports would be a single event at the Olympics. Which game would you choose for that single event? 

It would be like choosing sport itself as a category. Which sport?
11 ex afl players who all hold the same position of punter does not a team make.

Although the massive Jordan from western sydney is likely to be australias captain for pure name recognition.
https://www.nfl.com/news/tyreek-hill-other-nfl-players-could-play-flag-football-in-2028-olympics

It's up to players union to determine if they can.
>Actual breakfasting might have been ok 

This conversation is about whether actual breakdancing should be in the Olympics
So you didn’t watch the Olympic breakdancing? Got it, shut up then.
>As I said in a different comment, breakdancing is great and no reason why it can't be in the Olympics.

So then why did you jump into a conversation on whether breakdancing should be in the olympics. Redditors seem to be incapable of following simple conversations.


Person 1: why is breakdancing in the Olympics 

Person 2: other creative sports like synchronised swimming are, so it fits 

You: but synchronised swimming requires FITNESS
True true
That’s exactly what I was thinking. There is absolutely no way a 30-something your old white lady is the best female breakdancer in Australia. Hearing her talk about the “culture” of it as a uni lecturer is super cringe, like she thinks she’s just discovered this “cool” underground subculture where these people just, like, express themselves through dance like whoa.
>Not to get super political but this really feels like one of those times when a middling white person with a bit of money achieves massive success.  

From the abstract of her paper I got the sense that this sort of thing was what was being argued against. Which leant me towards it being a piss-take to make a point

ETA: Either a piss-take or showing how much talent would easily be missed by institutionalising breaking like this
I think she practices 2-3 hours a day?
Yep, sorry, I wasn't arguing against you, more supportimg your point. Just added the uni detail.
What they are saying is that is is a ‘who is better’ grading. Only one of them can get a point from each of the judges. In the first rounds, it’s not unusual if the best dancer wins over every judge. That outcome is what is meant to happen if you get a really good athlete from a country where breaking emerged, against a country like Australia where the breaking culture is so much smaller and our competitions are at an amateur level.
I imagine it'd be more like having "Archery" at the Olympics then only having one format instead of traditional, compound, indoor, field, 3D etc.

Oh wait, that's how it is already.
What about Daniel faalele and Adam gotsis? And its flag football, punter would probably be fine with someone who can throw it as its just running no tackling...
I guess it was easy to be on her high horse until the opportunity for fame and glory presented itself to her.
Well dare I say she just may not be naturally talented at it then if that’s her after practising 2-3 hours a day
No worries mate, I’m not disagreeing with you either. 

Just providing some more context as someone who’s been a part of HipHop culture in AUS for a few decades.
Yes, they do have 'you get that point vs. you get that point'. Who gets that single point for each metric is judged on the 60%/40% rules, and are an *outcome* of the 60/40 metric.   
The 'this person vs. that person' isn't the score. The score that they achieve via the 60/40 metric is.   
Then they just say 'This person won that round' by giving them one point instead of explaining what each item in the 60/40 split scored for them.

Regardless of them trying to shoe-horn a street sport scoring system into accepted Olympic level points scoring systems (like gymnastics, synchronised swimming, equestrian events etc) she scored zero points. She didn't win a single aspect of any of the matches she competed in.

The confusion here seems to be the attempted conversion of a street sport to an Olympic level grading system. It's a hybrid of scoring in traditional sports, with mashing the street scoring version over the top to make it seem like it's following street rules when it simply isn't.

Ultimately, it doesn't matter. She didn't score a single point. Not one. She had nine opportunities per 2 round competition, in three competitions, to score even one 'You did better than the other person'. Fifty four opportunities to get a higher score than one of her competitors.

She got none. It doesn't matter whether the points are expressed as "you get a vote for being better on this category" or "you achieved a 34.9% on that category and the other person got a 42.8%".

She wasn't the better competitor in any aspect in any of her competitions. If she were at least base level athletically competitive she should statistically have at least scored ONE point. 

But again, back to my original point. She knew she couldn't. So why was she even there?
> What about Daniel faalele and Adam gotsis?

Cause i as a non follower of the sport only know the massive Jordan from western sydney. But i guess we have 3 players and 11 punters ready to go.
I like to have a little faith and go to lack of self-awareness before rocketing down the scale straight to selfish
Thanks for your comments. I've been interested to know what people in the scene thought of this performance.  
From the few that I've seen, the consensus seems to be that this performance missed the mark and wasn't even in the realm of breaking.
she was still the winner of the oceania breaking championship. so either the competition was weak as well or the judges gave her too much credit for artistry.
4 punters, which gives us a team as i think flag football is 7 aside
