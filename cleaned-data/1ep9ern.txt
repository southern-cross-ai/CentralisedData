I'm heading to the UK next week and was thinking of buying something to sell back here in Australia for a good profit. I’m looking to spend under $10,000. Any suggestions on what would sell well?

It’s 2024, pretty much have access to everything bud.
hahaha I knew scalpers were greedy bastards but at least they knew what to buy and when to sell.
When you add the tax you'll need to pay to import it, is it really worth it?

Working Amiga computer systems. A niche market, but they sold very well in UK and are generally cheaper to get hold of there. They sell for a lot more here but people do buy them. 

DYOR though.
Honestly? Antique woodworking tools.

Problem is that they're heavy.

If you have weight space for a Norris infill hand plane, they sell for a lot more here.
Geniune burberry trenchcoats. Check the factory outlets.
Bit of work involved but you could check factory stores of high end UK brands and on-sell. Eg Church's shoes, John Smedley etc. No idea if that sells here though.

Years ago a mate asked me to get him one of the Breitling's that had an EPIRB built into it. They weren't selling them in Australia. The thing was around $33000. Crazy days...I felt like a rock star buying that watch
Can buy them here :)


Usually the reject shop have them.


Even some of the colesworths sometimes

I second this, hope you get caught
