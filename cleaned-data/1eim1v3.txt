Rewarded whether they perform or not. Proof again that most CEOs in Australia are vastly overpaid.
*On 25 July 2024, six days before the bankruptcy procedure began, the Board of Rex notified the ASX that it had upgraded the CEO’s employment agreement. Previously, the CEO Neville Howell was entitled to 5 weeks’ notice. The Board changed 5 weeks; notice to 12 months’ notice. They also added that the CEO would be immediately terminated and receive a payment in lieu of 12 months’ notice if something significant happened to degrade the CEO’s position, for example, entering voluntary administration in six days’ time.*
For Fuck Sake... What drugs were board members and the CEO on when they voted for this.

They must have know what was coming, yet they chose to line the pockets of their fucking CEO.

Sounds fucking dodgy and demands an investigation and appropriate punishment.
Neville and Lim Kim Hai are scumbags and sociopaths, always have been. No surprises they have looked after themselves only. (Ex employee)
Nothing to see here, move along....
The remaining employees can probably best hope there is a fraction of what they are owed left to pay them, especially after administration fees. 

This is like the captain abandoning ship first, without telling anyone. Also he filled the life boat with valuables.
Sounds like a complete coincidence to me. 

Right? … Right?
