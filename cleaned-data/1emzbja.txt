For a country that has such a small population, Australia consistently gets more Olympic medals than most other countries.

If you take into account the total medals/population ratio, it ranks as more than twice as successful as any other country, including USA and China.

But then if you only count gold medals, this success rate increases even more.

Any ideas as to why Australia is so successful?
We have a big sporting culture where lots of kids play multiple sports from a young age. The main reason is our swimming. Basically every child learns to swim here and even small towns have a pool so swimming as a sport is very accessible.
People here play sports because they think it’s fun not because it’s the only way they can get an education
Australia's sports culture is strong, with early access to athletics and tons of support for athletes. Plus, the warm climate means outdoor training year-round. That definitely gives them an edge!
We have Vegemite. That's our secret.
True Aussie GIRT is how.

But also after we failed to get any gold medals at Montreal 1976, the Australian Government formed the Australian Institute of Sport with the purpose of winning more gold.
We support women's sport. We 'allow' women to participate in any sport of their choosing if there is a women's league. 
A lot of countries don't. Most of our medals are won by our ladies.
Sports heaps sick aye
Money. The government spends a shitload of money on sport. 
Australia is currently eighth in medals per capita.

Not sure. ( I am writing this after dropping off my son for Soccer training, he had swim squad a bit earlier)
We're having our Hot Girt Summer in Paris.
Sports culture. Weather that lets you play sport all year outside. We spend a shit load on sports.
I think it's because our top sporting codes (NRL, AFL, cricket)  pay well, but not that well, and therefore don't suck all the talented athletes away from Olympic Sports. 

Contrast that with Europe and the US where there is so much more money available in soccer, NFL, basketball etc.
A steady diet of Weet-Bix, Vegemite and Tim Tams. Food of champions.
Less exciting if you include the Winter Olympics: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table
Sports culture. Kids play sports but also are encouraged to play sports by the general attitude from society. Unlike say being good at science.
Money. Sports people are paid a  good wage to train and perform.
Forget population to medal ratios and  take into account money spent per athlete, then we are probably not far off the US or China. Not sure how much they spend but we are close to $1million per athlete.
Sorry, just finished with my son’s footy training, what was the question?
I moved from the UK as a kid and was picked on relentlessly until they found out I could run... after that life got easy.
Everyone alive in Australia swims better than the sharks, wrestles better than crocodiles and runs faster than a brown snake.
We never used to have this level of success. It’s only been in the last couple of Olympic Games where we have had an equal number of female competitors that we have had higher success. 
2/3 of our overall medal count was achieved by our female athletes.
We have a strong sports swimming culture. There are lots of medals available in that sport - there is no 200m skip in athletics for example -  and the developing world doesn’t have the resources - pools, coaches etc - to compete. 

That’s it.
Got that dog in us frfr
Also social norms. It is expected that every child does swimming lessons until they can swim. Kids have swimming lessons at school. It is also expected that kids do sports after school. I’m assuming this is not the case in other countries where parents are just trying to survive.
We also have strong talent identification programs. Working out who can get from good to great and supporting those athletes.
People talk about our culture of playing sports but that isn't good enough to produce world champions because your question is about elite athletes. 

To produce them, essentially it comes down to the amount of money and science a nation is willing to put into when players are identified with potential. 

I can't find the article but i read a few years ago when a swimmer is identified and put into the ais programme, from youth until Olympics, i vaguely recall it costing the taxpayer something like 10 million dollars?
Cause we need to to out run, swim, dance and flippy dip the wildlife
We invest in sports.  For example, the Australian Institute of Sport. All those scholarships,  high performance coaches,  nutritional plans, sport psychologists for high performance mindsets, physios. 
Sending athletes to complete in all the world championship's. Sports is also in the news everyday.
A lot of public and private investment in sport; despite all the feel good stories, getting people onto Olympic podiums is at least a 7-figure exercise once you account for everything that goes into people. 

Investment in women’s sport in particular. For many countries women are a total afterthought, so it’s not a great surprise that Australia’s success is driven by women’s performance, especially in swimming which had so many medal events.
Funding
Learning to swim is strongly encouraged from an early age. Drownings are usually tourists or new Australians who haven't yet learned how to swim. Kids who enjoy swimming laps are encouraged to do it more, and can end up competing at a state level. 

Athletics are part of school sports days, we all get a bit of training for track and field at school. The kids who are good at it often go on to compete at a state level, and may end up with a scholarship to a sports academy. 

We've got sports academies. 

Some kids ride bikes to school. And we've got the tour downunder, so it gives people a taste for competitive cycling. 

Lots of youth sports, kids who are good get noticed. 

And as others are noting, womens sports are a thing here.
Swim lessons instead of active shooter drills
Per capita investment in sports is far higher than most countries. Other governments simply have better places to spend their money.
We have to keep fit to escape from all the drop bears. If we didn't have drop bears, our population would be 10 times the size. The drop bears also weed out all of the slow, fat, unfit and unco cunts from our gene pool, so the surviving population are super fit bastards. We also like rooting, so the offspring of all of these fit buggers are obviously going to be sporting champions. It it simple "survival of the fittest" evolutionary principles.
Mainly because they replace academic subjects in schools with sports and arty ones
Maybe a lot of people here plays sports, and their culture is good
We have hunger game style events where you need to survive the drop bears. It’s amazing what some fight or flight can do for you.
Everyone in Australia pretty much has access to sport, when some of the overpopulated countries don't
Compare medals by government funding to sport and you'll see the answer. Nit necessarily a bad thing if it gets kids active but we do have pretty expensive medals.
I'll let Mr. Krabs answer this 1
'we' care more about sports than other things like the arts. it starts in places like schools (kids in sports teams get more leniency on absences than the literal sick and disabled kids) and goes all the way up to government pissing money on it or making terrible choices for it (Aus Open going ahead during covid while we were in lockdown)
China has less per head of population because sport is not encouraged among kids. The Chinese education system is highly competitive and demands hours of homework every day of the year, and from a young age.

I live in China and my kids are in the local school system (rather than at an International school). They have a "sport" lesson every day, except its not what we would call sport --- basically either running laps or skipping rope. A couple of my Aussie mates were teaching PE at private high schools and amazed that 13 year old kids had no basic ball skills, apart from a few boys who played basketball.

The ultra-high competition, huge school workload and no emphasis on any kinds of practical skills is one of the main reasons we're heading back to Australia this year. I don't want my kids finishing school and not knowing how to do anything apart from rote learning to pass tests.
Probably because our young women have access to more sports from an early age than most other countries.  And sporting success is a part of our cultural identity. 

Australia thrives on "being an underdog" against particularly the UK and this probably stems from the fact we started as a nation of rejects and criminals so it's been embedded in our bloodline to prove we're better than others.

If you look at Australia's medal tally, over 50% has been won by women.  It's likely simply a case of girls here having access to similar amounts of sporting activities as boys, instead of being forcibly kept at home? Just my thoughts.

Also, look at the very environment of Australia.  Tell me it isn't an outdoorsy person's wonderland.  Athletes naturally have outstanding natural resoueces at their disposal to hone their crafts in.
Medicare? We can afford to enjoy sports, break an arm every now and then, and not be financially ruined by it.
We happen to do extremely well in the one discipline where there are, by a wide margin, the most medals on offer.
We have a huge sporting culture, and a lot of money is invested into creating elite athletes.
We have good weather that allows us to spend a lot of time outdoors playing team sports, cycling, running, swimming, surfing, skateboarding, you name it. Even in the coldest places, we don't get the freezing temperatures or volume of snow that northern hemisphere countries get.
Learning to swim in Australia is a must, and everyone learns from an early age.
We have a healthy participation in sport. Unlike India, seriously my Indian co-worker could not get his head around why I go for a run some nights, as if I were a child running around a playground.
If we start losing in swimming, we'll be down bottom, tbh. 😁
We grow up either swimming away from sharks or running away from snakes.  Jumping away from spiders and hurling various objects at aggressive kangaroos.  We’re naturals.
> For a country that has such a small population, Australia consistently gets more Olympic medals than most other countries.


Money for one...

Our culture prioritises sporting achievements, which means there's reasonable money in it (in that athletes can earn a reasonable $$ doing it for a living), so that then gives us resources to develop and cultivate athletes from a young age with world class facilities. 

Culture is part of it, but that's driven by $$, it's a symbiotic thing.

We have a developed economy, a high standard of living, nutrition and reasonable social safety nets - so children can participate in sports almost full time from a very young age. 

Look at the sports we are good at and the ones we aren't. 


And success begets success. Having strong athletes in one area (e.g. swimming) gets more $$ towards Swimming programs so you get better coaches, better facilities to develop newer generations of swimmers and so on and so on.

Also consider geography.. This is summer olympics. We can train year round. We are lousy at the Winter Olympics, except for sports that don't require a big mountain (e.g. we do ok at half pipe, ski cross, aerials) and countries that are amazing at Winter olympics have snow on the ground, proximity to big mountains to do that from a young age. Australian's learning to swim as part of primary school is certainly a huge contributor towards being good as a kid, so good as a teen, so great in Olympics.
Because we can be that good!!!
Everything everyone else said. But also, migration. We import athletes. 

Private schools will buy (aka provide a scholarship) for entire football teams of elite promising athletes from the pacific islands. 

Being a promising athlete and having endorsement from your sporting club can enhance your permanent visa and citizenship applications. 

In October last year there was a news article about how three athletes from Russia, South Africa and the US had their Australian citizenship fast tracked ahead of the Paris Olympics. 

They are not all born and bred Australians that’s for sure. 
Success in competitive sport is a HUGE national obsession. Sport heroes are the best loved and admired. A rich country with absolutely amazing resources, parks, ovals, children's sports leagues etc. In short the govt fully supports the publics live of sports
It’s about priorities and investment. In the summer Olympics it’s really about swimming - which has always been culturally relevant and receives significant private funding.

A similar sized country in terms of population and GDP, Spain, seemingly underperforms in Olympic medals. But they currently have the best football team (along with Argentina) and the best tennis player in the world. Because that’s where they put their focus.

Serbia is a small country with the best basketballer ITW and the tennis GOAT.
Canada and Norway do really well in winter sports.

Does that mean Australia is better or worse at sport than Spain or Serbia or Norway or Canada?

I know this possibly goes against the Australian exceptionalism narrative though…
Because our whole country is obsessed with sports of almost every kind from childhood up and in every school. It's just everywhere. big money behind it too
Were fair dinkum you beaut battlers, built tough in Australia for Aussie conditions.
Because we are Aussies!

We are the underdogs at the bottom of the world, yet we put great emphasis on fitness, health, winning, and more. Our climate also allows for near year round sport.

Our high achievers are held in the highest esteem and respected. Who in Australia doesn't know the name Dawn Fraser, Raelene Boyle, Jack Brabham, Evonne  Goolagong, and the list goes on.

Every generation is inspired by the greats of aussie sport and we strive to achieve on the world stage.
Traditionally Australian children grew up in houses with backyards.


Our apartment future should fix that
Because we spend more on sports then we do on housing and social services for those who need it
Sport is our National obsession. You’ll think I’m exaggerating if I say that beating puppies with a stick is more socially acceptable that not liking sport. But I’m not.
The trick is, don't succumb to the woke mind virus and have half your athletes become trans women who are excluded. As an Aussie trans woman, I can assure you that too many people in the USA, China, India, etc have succumbed to our woke mind virus and so you have fewer athletes available to win medals. Aussies don't tolerate that shit, so more people are available to win medals. It's really, that simple. 

Or, maybe it has to do with psychological, physical, political, economic, and social privileges and inequalities but I'm just a trans woman so clearly it's my fault.
Also sports grounds everywhere
We're showing it isn't just swimming this time though. Off the top of my head, we swept the skating park, had 2 on the podium in the womens high jump, dominated the womens white water stuff, won the womens BMX racing, podium in womens BMX tricks (we've won the mens previously), won the womens pole vault convincingly, won a mens team cycling event (I think with a WR?), got a bronze in womens skeet shooting. We're in with a great shot of at least medaling in womens beach volleyball too.

It's been nuts how varied our medal wins have been this time. But also, it's mostly our ladies doing it.
Swimming is sport where lots of medals are available and Aus does well in it. It also places a lot more emphasis on sport than many countries.  Also is a wealthy country and invests heavily for sporting success.
Damn so true. 

Bring in the backyard cricket my whole entire childhood.
And Weetbix and Milo

Yeah people overlook this. It's not just this one institute, each state has their own as well. But as a nation we have a lot of investment in high performance sport and sport science. 

For example, we built replicas of the skatepark for the Tokyo games and the Paris games, so our skaters and freestyle BMX athletes could practice on exact replicas.
Yes, we’re girt by sea!
We started investing in sport as a “science” a decade or two before other countries. If you look at our medal tallies in the 90s it was even more out of whack compared to other countries.
Girt or grit? Or both?
And we are a rich country. Dunno why anyone is surprised that we do well. People saying “culture” neglect that it is our wealth that affords us the freedom and resource to have the “culture” in the first place
Money alone is not enough though.  Singapore promises $1,000,000 to any athlete who can get a gold medal, but they've had to pay that out exactly once (Schooling, the guy who beats Phelps in the butterfly, but who also trained entirely in the USA), and in both Tokyo and now Paris they're likely to have exactly zero medallists, gold or otherwise.
4th in Gold per capita.
Yeah, the countries with 1 feel more like outliers than insightful data.
Is your son the Energiser rabbit?
There's actually an argument that most of our would be talented track stars end up in rugby instead
Nutrigrain mate...
There's a reason for that though.
I mean, there’s only so much 3 mountains with snow for 3 months can do for us.
Yep, we have a large team we take, similar to USA and China in size even though our population is tiny compared. We spend more to get them there.
We’re killing it this year, but we’ve sent a small town worth of contestants. 

I’d be more interested in seeing the data for medals by competitors sent. Alas, not interested enough to google it.
Are we "close to $1mil per athlete" really though? Did you and your mates down at the local bowlo come up with that figure?

Australia increased its elite sportsperson (including disable elite asthletes) funding by 50% this year so that it now has funding of 489AUD mil over 2 years.

So that means prior to this year it was about AUD150mil per year.

[https://www.pm.gov.au/media/gold-medal-investment-our-elite-athletes](https://www.pm.gov.au/media/gold-medal-investment-our-elite-athletes)
Its funny that - the onlyh reason that I found out I could run faster than everyone else was that I needed to outrun the bullies. Australia has a rotten culture for that and is pretty tokenistic in its reforms.
That's some of it. But we've won 18 gold medals. 7 of them came swimming. 

There are 37 medals available in swimming. There are 48 in track and field even without the 200m skip. So a country that is good at track and field has even more opportunity for medals.
And where did you get this figure and how did you make the comparison?

Forget for the moment your snarky little comment about other governments having better places to spernd their money and see the facts.

Australian government spends 0.7% of total expenditure on sport

"[Total expenditure for recreation and culture](https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id%3A%22library%2Fbudget%2F2020_07%22) in 2020–21, as shown in Table 1, is estimated to be $4.4 billion, which represents approximately 0.7 per cent of the Australian Government’s total expenditure of $670.3 billion (p. 6-7)."

[https://www.aph.gov.au/About\_Parliament/Parliamentary\_Departments/Parliamentary\_Library/pubs/rp/BudgetReview202021/MediaArtsSportsRecreation](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/BudgetReview202021/MediaArtsSportsRecreation)

Compared to European Federal governments, this is just below average and about the same as Portugal or Slovenia.

[https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=File:General\_government\_expenditure\_on\_recreational\_and\_sporting\_services,\_2021\_and\_2022\_(%25\_of\_total\_expenditure).png](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?title=File:General_government_expenditure_on_recreational_and_sporting_services,_2021_and_2022_(%25_of_total_expenditure).png)
Read the comments; exceptionalism doesn't appear to be the main narrative here.
Dan, I'm sorry, but that is one of the most stupid comments I have read so far. And lazy, since I can sit here on the other side of the world and prove you wrong without even getting off my fat ass.

  
Your Federal government spends about $AUD500 mil over 2 years (an increase of 50% from last year) on elites sportsmen and women. Thats $AUD250 nil per annum.

[https://www.aph.gov.au/About\_Parliament/Parliamentary\_Departments/Parliamentary\_Library/pubs/rp/BudgetReview202021/MediaArtsSportsRecreation](https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/BudgetReview202021/MediaArtsSportsRecreation)



It spends $3.8 bil per year (recurrent) on social housing alone The State governments spend a similar amount each year. So that is over $AUD7 bil per annum. Add to that the $AUD 212 bil the government spends annually on welfare services and payments, you get around $AUD220 billion on social housing and welfare programs. 

The the Australian government spends less than 0.1% on elite sports than social housing and welfare.

(see refs below).

So stop talking out your ass and go and get yourself a job mate.



Australian Government funding for services under the NHHA and related agreements was **$3.8 billion in 2022‑23** (refer to table GA. 1 in the Housing and Homelessness Sector Overview). State and territory government capital (non‑recurrent) expenditure for social housing was $3.5 billion in 2022‑23 (table 18A. 1).

In 2021–22, government spending on welfare services and payments was **$212.4 billion**. The Australian Government funded most of this amount (88% or $186.2 billion), with the remaining 12% funded by state and territory governments.Jul 5, 2024

This isn't a joke, I have several facilities within walking distance,  ovals, cricket nets, tennis courts, basketball courts and outdoor gyms. Plus the beach, it's a short drive, but why drive when you can ride, the weather is pretty good most of the time. Not to mention we are freaks for sports, everyone I know or work with follows multiple sports in a big way. 
Also, from an outsiders observation, I’ve been led to believe that y’all have to fight daily to survive against the elements, nature, and wildlife.
When i moved here I was shocked at the amount of Skate Parks! Even in towns in the middle of the desert. Same with all the cricket grounds, baskketball courts and all in schools?!?! Like in France we were lucky to be allowed a football during recess!
We spend that money because of our culture though. We value it enough to spend money on it. Plenty of countries don't
> Money alone is not enough though.

in general, australians are richer than singaporeans. The prospect of a sporting career is higher here than there, and even if there's a promise to pay, the opportunity cost of trying out a sporting career is more costly in singapore than here. After all, even if you end up not getting anywhere, you can fall back onto the dole. There's a life safety net in australia. Im not sure such exists in singapore, for example - not many countries have as generous a safety net.

Not to mention culturally, asians tend to view celebrity/entertainment (which is what sports is) as less viable a career path than the stock standard STEM route. So only the truly wealthy will invest in their kid's sports career, unlike in australia.
Athletes need the money before they win, not afterwards. Getting to the Olympics requires a huge amount of time spent training, traveling, and competing, not to mention access to facilities, equipment, coaching etc. No one is going to make decisions based on the longshot chances of winning gold.
Money alone is it. We front load all the money with institutes of sports and pathways into them from early teen years via well funded youth sport programs with top notch coaches and sport scientists. Highly effective vs. dangling a million dollars in the air and hoping for the best. 
If you like. There's still NZ Jamaica, Croatia ahead of Aus.
Swimming is a sport. Soccer is recreational. 

I had a teacher tell me that once.
I'd believe it - NRL players have power legs. And that's both the men's and women's - you can't tell me that Jaime Chapman couldn't be a champion 100m sprinter after those 90m tries in the women's state of origin!
Ironman food
We are not very girt by snow
There's a reason basically every winter olympian grew up in Victoria or New South Wales like 10m from the snow.
However we also qualified in 2x Basketball, 2x Water Polo, 2x Hockey, 2x Rugby 7s, 1x football teams so that’s a huge contingent of the team.
This year the results in the top 5 would have been pretty much the same - give or take

[https://eu.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/07/26/country-most-athletes-2024-paris-olympics/74411159007/](https://eu.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2024/07/26/country-most-athletes-2024-paris-olympics/74411159007/)
 450 athletes competing and we just upped the funding to 489million
Much more competition in athletics. Other than colonial settlers in Southern Africa, there is a whole continent that doesn’t compete in swimming events.
We should all be world class boxers and wrestlers, what with the amount of kangaroos we need to beat down every day before one will submit to carrying us to work.
Yeah pretty much every town will have a sports centre and it forms a significant part of the social network.  It's funded by both government grants and the local ratepayers.

Kids in towns are bored and become destructive if you don't give them something to do. Spending a few hundred thousand on a skate park is cheaper than fixing all of the graffiti and vandalism.
Probs depends heavily on each local council but for sure there's generally a good amount of access to this kinda stuff. SE suburbs of Melb have always had decent options in my lifetime.
Aye, I feel like those three definitely punch above their weight!
She'd make a lot more money being Olympic 100m champion than an WNRL player, so no.
The shotgun approach. Just keep firing an athlete at a each event, and eventually we’ll win a few 😂
Does that factor the paralympic squad? Or the people who were second or third in trials but missed out because of quotas? That money covers all athletes, not just those who make the olympics, so it's a bit of a disingenuous claim.
Swimming medals were won by 19 different countries at this Olympics. So far it's only 20 different countries in track and field. (Including Australia) Probably won't change much because it's being dominated by the USA.

As I said before, swimming is not the only reason we're so high on the medal tally. We got 7 gold, the USA got 8, France got 4. We compete in everything except volleyball and handball and we pick up medals all over the place. No other country our size is doing that.
