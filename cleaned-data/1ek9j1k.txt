> The real reason for the drop in profits was a change in company policy that meant a smaller share of the money spent on Big Macs stayed in the country.

>McDonald’s royalty fees, which redirect profits overseas, went up by 29 per cent that year — more than 10 times faster than its sales did.

This article is well worth a read.
>We tried asking the company itself. A McDonald’s Australia spokesperson said its prices were “reflective of the trading environments they’re operating in”.

As is every vendor-set price everywhere. What a nothingburger statement.
Best part about 'royalty' fees (profit) is that the money is essentially leaving our shores tax free...
Maccas prices have gone up and their service is plummeted. Trying to eat in the restaurant is a terrible experience, nearly impossible to get someone to serve or even acknowledge you at the counter, the ordering machines always out of paper, restaurant is dirty, bins are overflowing with rubbish, napkins and straws are kept locked away. 

All they care about is drive through.
Greed. Next question!
Corporate greed.
Greed and profit. Trying to find the maximum amount that the 'average' consumer will pay for something. It's the primary driving force behind the cost of living crisis. Same goes for Woolies and Coles, real estate/rental companies, insurance providers and financial institutions. The system is gamed against the working population.

McDonalds sales are falling which likely tells you they'll have to start meeting customers closer to the price point they can afford.


Operationally they also have a lot of work to do, their restaurants are filthy and there is trash left everywhere. They do not look like a model in well managed businesses to me which is a departure from historic precedent.
Nothing else but greed.

Even going to a burger truck or small business, prices have skyrockets, but at least it tastes like something and not plastic like maccas
Lol so many here didn't even read the article.

My question: why DIDN'T the inquiry look at profits being moved overseas and only looked at domestic? Seems to me sheer stupidity only focusing in one area. Unless, let me guess, politics and looking good for multinational donors eh?
I checked McDonald's profits over the last 10 years and 2023 was their highest by far
Corporations, notoriously driven by factors other than greed /s
I’d say it’s corporate greed, but it’s also the absolute fuckwits willing to pay. 
greed
I like that people just treated the headline as a question to answer rather than actually reading the article.
There must be some really awkward meetings in Maccas boardrooms if prices have increased that much and they are **still** making less profit worldwide, yikes.
Read an [interesting article](https://economistwritingeveryday.com/2024/04/10/grocery-inflation-is-under-control-fast-food-prices-arent/) on this recently that shows just how much they are gouging us.
Burger does not equal Maccas
GREED.
They are losing money in the US, have to make it back somehow.
Burgers are simply a discretionary consumable. If the trend ever develops to reject fast food as being unhip or naff, these chains could be broken.
People continually buying them when they raise prices and shrink portions. The world got along just fine before there were burger joints everywhere,the world will get along just fine if they go out of business. Body fat indexes will also shrink and people will be a lot healthier.
Australians will pay anything for anything and just shrug.🤷‍♂️ That’s the “trading environment there’re operating in”. Everyone else everywhere seems to know this but not Australians. Even Mexican cartels know this.
McDonalds prices have gone way up and the size and quality have gone way down. I will never buy from McDonalds again.
Price gouging.
Greed.
Out of country royalty and management fees to transfer wealth offshore should be taxed at 50%
Greed as always
Thanks to the 2 big supermarket chains....who want "consumers" to save...😂😂(Still makes me laugh)
Have driven up the prices of meat as producers need to make money somewhere. 

Feed has gone up in price, fuel prices have gone up, council rates have gone up, interest rates have gone up all these overheads are a major reason why the price of meat has sky rocketed in the last 3 years..

Source: Family member of producers..
Greed, somewhere along the line.
Businesses are free to set their prices. Consumers are free to choose where they spend their money. 

I have not bought anything from McD due to their (IMO) BS prices.
Corporate greed. Who would have thought.
It's certainly not the quality that is making the price rise that's for sure.
Eat at your local small take away. Where the burgers are generally tastier and better made
$4.20 for a small coke? Get F*cked.
Time to rename every mcdonalds to mcjacks and tell the yanks to go fuck themselves. It's crazy the amount of money shoveled out of Australia for zero in return no wonder the cost of living is so crazy.
The best part about McDonald’s going up in price is now I can go to a local burger shop and their prices are actually kind of reasonable
It’s got to the point where a cafe down the road from me offers a cheaper bacon and egg roll than Maccas does now, what a weird time we live in.
For me maccas, for the price and the serving size isn’t worth it anymore.
Lack of appreciation for better food is what drives up  Macdonalds' burger prices.

Macdonalds food is very bland. There are better things to buy with your money. Get out more and look around you for better-tasting food which costs no more and even less than the Macdonalds rip-offs.

Shh. Don't tell anybody, it's a secret, but there is lots of good, tasty, cheap food at local markets.
Audi prices.

(I googled what kind of car do mcdonald's franchise owners drive and hit a reddit thread)

Edit: I know that the franchise owners do not set the prices. This is not a serious answer
Only time I've entered Maccas in 50odd years is for a piss or to meet the other party in a Gumtree deal. The smell is never attractive.
Support local shops. Better burgers and similar price. Plus the money stays in australia
Can we just go back to the cheap pie warmer burgers and filter coffee. The burgers were actually warm and the coffee was actually what you ordered rather than whatever milk was in the steamer last.
The people who have been out priced out of the housing market are now pricing out the over leveraged out of the burger market
Everything is expensive; business pass cost onto customers. Sometimes it works; if youre set up in an area where people will pay $15 for 1 burger and nothing else

Sometimes it closes your business because you dont understand your customer demographic or competition.
I just spent $22 on a bacon cheeseburger with a handful of fries, in Michigan.

Currency is losing value, wages are going up and there is a tip factor, welcome to the future, everyone hates it.
Capitalism. Charge the market what it can bear
Its probably difficult for a lot of people but THE only way is to stop buying their crap 

Just try not buying Maccas.
Never eat there, don’t care
Just don't eat there, problem solved
Maccas used to be a cheap but consistent budget friendly easy food option. Then it became less cheap and lower quality. Now it is overpriced garbage operating out of dirty joyless chains with grumpy staff.

Fuck MacDonald's. Let's just stop using these horrible wastes of high street and roadside real-estate. Local places are always better quality. Local chains have stronger regulatory controls and don't have offshore royalties.

Together we can wipe out the money grabbing shitshows that are MacDonald's and all their ilk.
Meanwhile, McDonald’s earnings are massively down. 🤔
Blows my mind how often it'll be absolutely filthy inside.  Stop cheaping out on the staff FFS.
People will to keep paying more and more. Burger restaurants charging $25-$30 so then McDonald’s thinks increasing their rubbish by a dollar that customers will still think it’s cheap.
I ended my 20 year boycott of maccas about 5 years ago and bought a big mac on their charity fund raising day.

I am now about 5 years into my second boycott.

Did Maccas also receive advice from PWC?

Inquiring minds want to know...
Most of the article is pretty pointless. Costs have gone up, revenue has gone up, but we've got no idea what the change in profit actually is because McDonald's siphons the profits off shore.
Taxation without big Mac quality increas is theft
Translation: While inflation is rampant, we're pushing prices as high as we possibly can before there is any fallout. 
Coincidentally, McNothingburger is their latest budget menu item. In a first for Maccas, it looks exactly like the picture on the menu.
They towed the inflation in from another environment after their fronts fell off
There should be a flat 30% tax on all royalty fees or "loans" from overseas by business.
the australia group sales (revenue) is well over two billion in 2023 yet they pay only 100m in tax and ship 750m offshore to low tax jurisdictions then into the pocket of mainly US shareholders. They engineer the royalty as close to taking the piss as possible.
Like "transfer pricing".
Hungry Macs
I'm just happy to find the part of the thread where people actually read the article.
lol. have you been through drive through lately? I remember when the waiting bays were for the rare times that you had to wait more than a couple of minutes. I get directed to wait EVERY SINGLE TIME now. even when there's no other customers. 

the priority has become Ubereats/menulog for some inexplicable reason.
Stop giving them your hard earned money ffs
Back to its origins of a take away burger joint.
Don't forget the incessant alarms and beeping making it sound like you are in an operating theatre with someone flatlining on the table. Also their food has gotten even worse than it ever was, a bacon and egg mcmuffin is now tiny and the "bacon" is more like thin shaved ham.
Look, we’ve had numerous threads repeating this, it’s become old and tiresome. The article is worth reading for various reasons, including that it is not repeating the same obvious points people bang on about endlessly on here.
Sounds like my experience at the Tacoma McDonalds on Saturday.
The food is awful, why even go there
Yep, it's a shit show. I do my very best not to eat at McDonalds for this reason.
Can’t remember a time when I’ve had chips that aren’t cold. Are they required to give you fresh chips if you ask for “fresh chips”? Never bothered to do it but I’ve heard other people doing it.

I do enjoy the taste of Maccas, its unique but it is junk food. It's high calorie but it doesn't fill me up.

It used to not bother me so much when I was spending under 10 bucks for a meal, but these days I'm just going to my local fish & chip shop or chicken shop instead of Maccas, it crossed a price point where I just can't justify the value anymore for something that is basically a snack.
Why do people posting comments like yours feel the need to repeat the same thing endlessly?
The free trade agreement John Howard negotiated with the US is coming back to bite us in the arse.
Yet they are claiming there has been a huge fall in profits now?
Sales down, but the price increase means profits still high
The reason people are commenting 'greed' is because no one needed this article's gratuitous narrative to know the true answer to its premise.

The ABC could have published an actual investigation into IP royalty fees and blatant corporate greed but instead they put out a piece that's all premise no punch.

When you're publishing content related to the worst climate of corporate greed the world has seen to date and you fail to use the term greed even once, you're not doing good work.

But sad, really.
And as long as a significant portion of the population continue buying them, Maccas will continue to jack up prices. 

The sad thing is, Australian consumers CAN vote with their feet when they put their minds to it - Starbucks pulled out of Australian years ago because people chose their local café over chain store coffee (they're now back, but selling to tourists).
I make my own smash burgers at home and they are better than anything I’ll ever get out. Four burgers for the price of a packet of mince, cheese slices and rolls. No fucking way am I paying more for Maccas excuse for a “burger”. Yuck.
> Get out more and look around


This is what keeps people going back to McDonald's. It's always the same and convenient. Too much work to find better places and a risk that it might suck.
I understand your point, but when I’m half drunk and take that first bite into my Big Mac after I put half my chips on the burger I feel like I’m appreciating it pretty hard.
Read the article, become informed, instead of repeating the same old.
Just spend your money somewhere else. Profit or lack of it is the only thing corporations care about
Let's nationalise maccas
7-11 in Japan is owned by 7i Holdings which became so profitable they acquired global 7-11 brand.  That drove up their profits further because they essentially recycled the franchise fees. 

 Then the brought a bank, insurance company and a supermarket chain among other things so 7-11s became almost a kieretsu, and it's amazing what you can do on their ATM's

That's the pathway if there is one

I worked at GS Tokyo at the time and we were involved in the deal, it is not as hard to finance  as you'd think.
Russia did it (kind of)
And stop calling it food.
Like the Russians did?
Like Russia did? Except Macca’s left not kicked out.
How stupid, just support your local burger joint... they make better burgers.

If you read the abc article.  
Costs went up. But then came back down. But big macs kept increasing.  
Only thing that kept going up is the % going overseas
Omg I bought one last week, it was literally two patties on bun w some iceberg lettuce, for almost $14. Never again maccas.
Mmmmm... nothing.
You just make royalties not deductible.
We already do on Royalties. But the rate is reduced for certain countries. Since we have a double tax agreement with the USA, the tax on royalties paid to the USA is 5%.
If we made royalties not detuctable this issue goes away.

What are the pros and cons to this?
Can you explain this in more detail? Just curious.
[deleted]
The others talking about the common tropes like service etc stuff are just npcs.
It’s a metrics thing. If they think you’ll wait any more than 15 or so seconds at the window, they will park you, because they are measured very tightly on how long it takes between your order getting finalised and how quickly you drive away from the last window. 

Parking you lets the people behind move up, and if their order is 2 large cokes they are gone in 5 seconds and the metrics look better. They don’t care if parking you means you wait 5 minutes longer, the metrics machine gave them a big thumbs up so their managers are happy.
Getting parked when there's noone behind you shits me to absolute tears. It's pretty clear it's trying to fudge metrics for head office, but what's the point of the metrics if they don't paint the proper picture and they piss off all your customers.
Half the time, so many people are parked in the waiting bays that the drive thru queue can't go anywhere.
>the priority has become Ubereats/menulog for some inexplicable reason

Oh no it has not 😅

Source: used to be ubereats driver. Never again
Wife and I never use drive through, I can’t even remember the last time I used one. We always stop and go inside whatever restaurant we are at and eat inside, which usually always on road trips. We never use UberEats or any other delivery service. So the rare time we stop at Maccas is always in the restaurant but I have noticed a line of Uber drivers waiting impatiently for their delivery orders.
I'd imagine volume is the reason if its being prioritised. $ is all that matters
That's the difference between making a profit and profiteering. What we are looking at here is pandemic profiteering, pure and simple.
So collusion and greed. Gotcha!
It's fine, and no I don't even own the unit I am living in, let alone properties.
I used to enjoy a Big Mac now and then. The cost and the size have driven me away. No more Big Macs for me.
My local chippy has a minimum $5 for chips. If I order that by myself, I end up giving some to my birds. For our family of 3 we get $10. 

The McDonald’s website wants me to download an app to see the price of their fries, lol, but I’m going to go out on a limb and assume that $5 worth wouldn’t be a lot.
Because it's easier than thinking.
Alright, lets look at it from a different perspective. 

I don't actually fault some of these big businesses. If people are willing to pay a 'convenience tax' and pay more than they should, then if profits go up, a business will take advantage of it. I get it, Maccas is beyond massive, but it's all about profits at the end of the day. About 10-15 mins from my house, there's a Gloria Jeans drive through. The lines on this thing are beyond ridiculous, it actually clogs up traffic on the main road. Same premise, people are will to wait in these lines and pay for the convenience of not wanting to get out of their car, so the prices go up. This Gloria Jeans is constantly full, it's actually bizzare for such a sub standard product. 

Now looking at lets say a small business. They sell cans of coke for what, $3.50-$4? You can buy a 30 pack from woolies for $28, so their margin just on their drink alone is big. If i go to a burger truck and pay $22 for a Burger and the cost price is $4-5 at max? That's already a big margin. It's different for small business cause their expenses are big and they're trying to pull through and establish some brand loyalty, customer retention etc, but at the end of the day, it's still greed to ask of x amount of $ for a burger
It's a discussion board, go use twitter or instagram if that's not what you're after.
No they are claiming a fall in sales, not profits.
I love good food and I love trying new things but I am also a shameless McDonalds enjoyer. McDonalds is not the best burger out but it tastes specifically like McDonalds which has a weird way of hitting the spot exactly.

Side note, there is lots of bad, mediocre, and expensive food out there too. The amount of pub feeds I've had for $20+ which aren't even as enjoyable as chain takeaways made by sweaty teenagers.
<grin>
The problem is that they're correct. McDonalds is a 100% discretionary purchase.  If they upped their prices and sales dropped by half, they'd pretty soon find a way to reduce the price, probably by reducing the BS corporate fee your article points to.

But it seems a lot of people will pay almost anything for convenience.
No thanks.
Lots of fish and chips shops make better burgers for cheeper or less, so I go to those now. The only reason I would go to Macca's is because it's open when I finish work and I'm peckish, but even then sometimes it worth it to go to bed hungry ya know?
Some socialist with a senate ticket could probably get elected on this “ha ha only serious”
Hell yeah. The Russians did.
I know they recently took over the Aussie 711's and reportedly have said that they will try to bring some of the Japanese things to them. If they end up anything like they were in Osaka 5yrs ago, it's a good thing. 
I did read the article. The article demonstrates that the cost of the product does not perfectly correlate with any individual factor that contribute to the price of a burger. It doesn't have a strong correlation with decreases OR increases in price. Furthermore the article only covers some costs, with factors like rent and insurance also things that will impact the price point that aren't covered. 

There's also no reference point comparing McDonald's to other stores, whether they be multinational like Hungry Jacks/Burger King, the specialist burger places that are intended to be a bit more gourmet, or your fish and chip shop type places where the burger is just another option on the menu.
And the patties are barely half a cm each. They are so damn thin. Yeah Bettys Burgers does thin patties also, but they're tastier and cooked much better than the shit Maccas churn out en-masse.
But then companies would need to pay taxes in Australia. That would be disastrous /s
It really is that simple.
If I need to license some technology from overseas for real, I can't deduct the cost.

It should be no deduction allowed if the expense or loan is from a related entity.
there isnt much to explain. If you open a chain of restaurants in Brazil and you set up an HQ in a low tax jurisdiction like Ireland. Then you license your logo and brand identity to the local organization in Brazil (which you control) for a fee, then you can engineer absolutely any Brazilian taxable local profit you wish by just adjusting the royalty fee (as that is recorded as an operating expense). And all the actual operating profit bubbles up to Ireland, where it may be taxed at 5% or whatever the special deal there is. Apparently macdonalds australia used to use Hong Kong but under pressure over financial trickery they switched to Europe but the end result is the same. Like Ikea: Australia sees a huge expanding local operation that somehow barely makes much corporate taxable profit when actually it has pretty fat profit margins.
two billion.

and if they have the cash to ship 750m offshore for nothing but royalties then their true profit margin is insane. What domestic cafe can siphon off 40% of sales as untaxed profit and still make an ATO profit?
I mean isn't that more efficient? If your order takes '5 minutes', shouldn't you move to the side so someone who's only ordering a coke can go through quicker?
> what's the point of the metrics if they don't paint the proper picture and they piss off all your customers.

Welcome to the reality of 99.9% of all KPI's, they simply exist for some middle manager somewhere to pretend that they're doing a bang up job to senior management, then for senior management to gloat and pretend that they're phenomenal at their job to the executives, it's useless gits and metrics all the way up.
I find it challenging to believe that the world's chief executives woke up on New Year's Day 2021 and collectively decided to be extra greedy going forward. 

I find it even more challenging to believe that they woke up on New Year's Day 2024 and realised the error of their ways.
A profile with over half a million posts thinking they can critique others. That’ll do me
I feel like there's an enormous gulf of choices between "eat maccas" and "go to bed hungry", no? Like just eat a piece of fruit or something.
I've a chippy run by a Greek family near me so I'm a happy camper. 😊
Is it still allowed to be called McDonald's in Russia? If we nationalised it would we have to rename it Hungry Mac's or something
Exactly. You just make it so all payments to foreign related entities for non-tangible goods and all services are now no longer deductible. This will cover all the usual tricks like marketing, advisory, management and consulting fees, licensing fees, royalties, transfer payments, loan interest, debt forgiveness, etc etc etc. treat them all like dividends. This forces companies to start paying tax, or they move operations to Australia which means increased employment which means increased income tax. Instead of the crap Facebook, Microsoft, Apple etc all pull where they are “operating” out of Ireland for digital goods sales, they do what Google did and open up an RnD / engineering office in Australia and deduct those wages to offset, at which point those employees are contributing to economic activity and paying income tax.
Yep, how hard would it be for a company to be legally forced to pay tax, IN THE COUNTRY THEY EARNED THE INCOME IN. Is that really that hard to enforce? Enough of this income shipping to Ireland or other tax havens.
[deleted]
No because a 30 second order will get parked and ignored in favour of 3 10 second orders. So the 30 second order waits the time it takes the store to sort out their order (30s) plus the time it takes for somebody to be available and ready to run the order to the car (2-5 minutes depending on how busy front counter is. This is being being generous btw since when they are REALLY busy this can easily be 10+ mins), plus the time it takes to get to you (30s to 2 mins depending on where you’re asked to park, my store had a long ass trek to do because the front door was in narnia).

Yeah, 3 orders waited 30s less, but you waited 4 and a half minutes you didn’t have to.

You’re treated like a lower priority customer because you ordered something they don’t have immediately on hand, since you essentially are. These days, that means literally any burger. You can usually have 1-2 burgers ready by the time they are finished paying, but if the store is busy they get a backlog and they won’t start on your order immediately. Whether that’s 10s late or 10 mins late doesn’t matter to them, they’ll park you as soon as the meal runner sees your order isn’t ready as you pull up to the final window and they’ve finished making your drinks.
Think if it more like opportunistic peak capitalism. Most of the time the are just nipping at our heels, but given the opportunity they will go for the throat.
A  peice of fruit . At this time of year. In this economy????


Lol I am in the midst of training my brain to accept ham and cheese sandwich, banana or orange as suitable meal replacement for the midnight maccas run.

I don't know when it happened but I fell into a person who eats at 1pm. 630pm and midnight.  Awake from 7am to 1am



I can tell you my nightie habits where to drive and eat maccas/hjs/whatever was on special in an app.

It's very hard to change some habits and a peice of fruit is good advice but that late snack will always be terrible untill I break the habitual feeling of only grease will cure me.


Thanks for not asking. Apparently, I wanted to write that down
Get a rice cooker, cook some steamed rice. 

Get a bag of Chinese dried pork sausages (lap chong) and steam them in  the rice cooker while you cooking the rice. Thinly slice them and have them with some hot white rice, spring onion and soy sauce. Trust me its very filling.

Likewise look up rice cooker recipes. You can throw eggs, cook meat  and cook all sorts of meals in the  cheapest rice cooker. I like doing this way because its 1 dish to clean! You can even do your 2 minute noodles in a rice cooker. You can cook great meals just living in 1  room boarding house if you creative with a rice cooker as your only stove!

 For the price of Burger you can make a pot of  Indian Briyani with 2 KG's of chicken drum sticks in it, if this is your tastes. A whole pot of Briyani can be put in the fridge and you can dish up as you need  a meal. Seriously a large pot or Briyani can be made with less than 10 bucks worth of ingredients and is very satisfying.

If you get a rice cooker you can do fried rices with all sorts of scraps or whatever you like in it.

Even something like boiled spaghetti, with some butter and cracked black pepper is a real comfort food that will fill your belly very well. Plain rice works as well with butter and pepper. You can fry some beacon up chopped finally to give it more flavor.

What I can tell you is that home cooked Asian style food is cheaper than all fast food takeaway, period especially if you cook 2 cups of rice which will last you a week or more.

Another thing that works well and that is quick. Just buy a can of corned beef which is cheap. Throw the corned beef in a pan with some chopped onion and chopped tomato. Heat it and stir it around and throw that on hot rice. Again a quick cheap comfort food that is filling

One cup of water, salt and some yeast stirred around in  bowl with some flour in a sloppy mix can make a great pan bread. Just fry the sloppy mix in a frying pan and it makes cheap  pan bread which is delicious with corned beef/onion stew that I mentioned. 

Another poor mans food is Barley soup. Make a huge pot and throw in some meat/ soup bones. Have bowl with some white rice mixed in. A big pot for 1 person should last 1 week or more. Just make sure it stays in the fridge because it can ferment and go off leaving it out.

 Theres tons of dishes like this  thats better than crap packet food and much more healthier. Just try it.

You dont have to buy breakfast cereals as well. Just some flower, water, sugar, cinnamon and even a small amount of coconut cream  you can boil these up as dumplings with hot milk. Again trust me the crap sugar cereals you buy just tastes like carboard crap in comparison.

Another cheap as crap ingredient for breakfast is semolina. A bag will last you 3  or  6 months you need so little. One cup in water and simmer. Just eat it will milk, butter and sugar. A really hearty  breakfast. 

You can throw the semolina in the pan with a stew  and it adds a lot of bulk to stews. A quick way to have a evening meal, is to throw a cup of semolina in a pot with water and simmer it. Throw a chop or off cut meats with fat in with the semolina. You can ad onion, salt pepper etc. Its so delicious  combining semolina and beef. I learnt this trick while backpacking in Africa. Thats how poor people living in slums and mud huts cook. Semolina in everything with meat in stews. Delicious as hell.

If you desperate, just break up some white bread, throw it in some hot milk with cinnamon and sugar and that makes a quick 2 minutes break fast or tummy filler before bed.

I can go on and on. With basic raw ingredients  and basic veges you can make yourself gourmet meals that costs many times less than any takeaway food.  You just have to try and get into the swing of being cheap like a poor student. I used all these recipes while back packing and living cheap. And now I cook many of these quick meals for the kids and they never complained.

Really there is no need to go hungry with staples in the house  even on the lowest poverty budget.
>Like just eat a piece of fruit or something.

Eww, I'll take hungry thanks
They have renamed them all "Vkusno I Tochka" (Tasty, period).
Well, yeah they technically are allowed, because what are McDs gonna do about it?
The input costs of a big Mac are sub $1 (all in, labour as well) with a $7 sale price. Cola is sub 10c, selling for $3.

Multiply by stores everywhere in Australia, yeah it's reasonable.
Pay minimum wage and sell a mass produced, mass cooked burger that has barely anything of quality in it, for $8.65 with small carbonated sugar water on the side for another $5 ? every family with two kids that now walks in pays $50+ for the tray of crap? no surprise they make as much as they do.
Depends on the store though 

Ones that are franchised don’t tend to do this as they know it pisses off local customers and they aren’t fully beholden to head office metrics. The one closest to me is a corporate store that does it for the dumbest shit like a cheeseburger and chips. One further away I rarely if ever get parked because the dude that owns has been a franchisee for decades and knows the metrics are bullshit (total cunt though- I worked there pre 2010).
