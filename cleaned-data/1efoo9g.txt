Currently up 6-1 at half time against the number one ranked team (huge sport in Serbia too), who has also won the last two Gold medals! Unbelievable performance 🔥

*End up winning 8-3! Serbia also only ranked 4th (but have been the best for a long time and dominant at recent Olympics) and we are 9th
