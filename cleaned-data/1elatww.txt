That Obit makes no mention of his Bronze medal for men's Doubles Tennis at the same games

This one does - https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/edwin-flack-first-olympian

There is a little caveat on his status as first Australian Olympian - officially Australia wasn't recognised 'til 1901 - so he competed for England

Probably safer to say he was the first Australian to win an Olympic medal - although even that has the caveat that, like so many other Australians at the time, he was born in England, and moved to Aus at five years old

Whatever his status - he was a great competitor
Who did he give every inch too ?
