Somewhere, an American is outraged that you let our flag touch the ground.
I'm pretty sure this flag is like... a decade old, possibly even older? I remember having one a long time ago...
Haha, maybe but it’s not an offical country’s flag, so it’s fine.
It's from my dead nan's place, we are cleaning it out
Yet...get rid of the soccer ball and it would be close to what I'd like our flag to be.
It's fine anyway. Just a piece of cloth with a picture, no different to a teatowel
