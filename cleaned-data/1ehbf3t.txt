Can I just say how pleasantly surprised Iâ€™ve been by the ABC and their online coverage of the Olympics. 

Iâ€™m someone who has floated around all non-paywalled sites over time, but found 7 is the worst for clickbait, 9 has been poor quality, and news dot com has been a bit of both with a dash of being really bloody negative about the games. 

ABC though has been awesome. Informative. Mix of live stuff and feature stuff. Excellent writing. Iâ€™m a convert.
Chalmers has had an incredible meet, and hopefully gets another medal in the mixed medley. He is a master of the anchor leg ðŸ’ª
A dose of something. Thatâ€™s for sure

But I bet thatâ€™s why you used that word in your headline, isnâ€™t that right ABC

And Iâ€™m all for it
ABC has some excellent sports feature writers. Articles by Dean Bilton (the author of this article) and Nick Campton (mostly writes about rugby league) are worth keeping an eye one, and ABC's live sports blogs are normally good quality too.
