paying more for housing?, compared to where?

What a nothing story.

>"We're happy to have a look at taxation arrangements."

Mhm sure, you just need to form government, overcome the constituional hurdle that says that taxes collected by the federal government cannot "discriminate between states or part of states".

And then actually want to pass it, which they wont.
More nothing policy for dimbulbs
Isn't this unconstitutional under section 99 of the Australian constitution?
Sounds like by calling attention to this - the existing tax offset is likely to be ruled unconstitutional. Nice one Dutton, the Nationals will be pleased...
The cheque is in the mail! Of course I love you! No, I won't cum in your mouth! I'm happy to have a look at that!


Some of the all-time classic lies. Nothing to see here.
Does the MSM take him to task on it. Oh wait why would I ask such a dumb question. OF COURSE THEY DON’T
I thought pushing for equal outcomes was part of the Marxist agenda? Its hard to keep up.
Excellent news for regional PO box operators.
The problem with the "moral" feelgood argument Dutton is trying to push is that you can alternately argue that morally rural people should pay MORE taxes as proportionally the cost of providing government services (which is what Taxes go to) exceeds the cost of urban dwellers. (as otherwise non-rural people are paying to supplement rural people)

But we don't make this argument for the same reason we don't just divide the population on bullshit things like this unless we're trying to drive a wedge.

Realistically the GST is about 12% of the tax we pay so you can't realistically argue tax-breaks to offset the GST they pay. 

GST revenue is already divided between states (not directly proportionally), so it could be argued that higher GST rates for higher rural prices means rural services should be higher. But that doesn't try to pull votes with stupid arguments like this one. 

He's either an idiot or just arguing in bad faith.
It’s almost as if it costs more to get goods and services to remote locations. What a flog.
I love that tax and constitutional experts are like yeah the zone offsets are super illegal but no one has bothered to sue us in the last 50 years so whatever.
If councils want to lower their rates, they are free to do just that.  If Dutton wants to introduce a government-owned petrol retailer, he can pitch that policy.

But if he is thinks he will win back the teal seats, or even the outer-suburban seats with this policy, he needs to replace his policy advisors.
Look at Davros behind him
Dutton has lots of practice of passing laws that aren't legal.
Not saying Dutton isn't full of shit but I know that in mining and tourist towns in WA it's very hard to buy and rents are insane.
>overcome the constituional hurdle

He'd likely do is a rebate type arrangement based on electorate ! I mean region..
I'm fairly sure that remote parts of Qld, WA and NT already have a lower rate of tax - so I'd imagine that hurdle would not be difficult to address.
Petrol costs marginally more per litre in the country (unless in truly remote areas), but the overall fuel expense is typically way lower considering you’re doing substantially less driving.
This is just the start, wait till he starts floating shit like "People in regions should all get two votes"
The people who vote for this kind of thing believe we live under the US constitution.
It already exists.

Zone offsets include such remote areas as Darwin and Cairns.
If you call it a “subsidy” to equalise outcomes, it’s socialism. But if you call it a “tax cut” to equalise outcomes, that’s good ol’ fashioned capitalism.
"To each according to their voting intentions, from each according to their class".
Sounds like a great reason to carve up part of a paddock into 1m^2 parcels, sell each one with a proper address and provide a mail forwarding service.
Someone would have to have standing to bring a case, and changing the existing offsets or creating new ones would likely provide someone with a more contemporaneous argument about standing. If they did bring it, the HC's ruling on the changes might effectively strike out the entire zone offsets.

It's one of those things that everyone knows is probably unconstitutional but no one has been aggrieved enough to challenge for a long time. Post Williams though, the likelihood of these kind of constitutional cases is taken way more seriously.
It used to be the 26th parallel, some kind of rebate but I think that is rescinded now?
You've never left a metropolitan area
This is just wrong.
It was very similar to that in Qld under Joh

>The **Bjelkemander** was the term given to a system of [malapportionment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malapportionment) in the Australian state of [Queensland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queensland) in the 1970s and 1980s.[^(\[1\])](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bjelkemander#cite_note-1) Under the system, electorates were allocated to zones such as rural or metropolitan and electoral boundaries drawn so that rural electorates had about half as many voters each as metropolitan ones. The [Country Party](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Party_of_Australia_%E2%80%93_Queensland) (later National Party), a rural-based party led by [Joh Bjelke-Petersen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joh_Bjelke-Petersen), was able to govern uninhibited during this period due to the 'Bjelkemander' and the absence of an upper house of Parliament.
Businesses in the City of Sydney get two votes, as against a resident's one vote, and they still couldn't get rid of Clover Moore.
Only if they have children?
When they were brought in back in 1945, those places were far more isolated than they are today
Esk is about to have an immigration problem.
Just checked it - Remote Zone rebates are still available.  Not worth a lot though, but means any constitutional barrier is easily addressed.
I grew up in a country town, only moved metro as an adult. All my family is still regional. But please tell me more
Melbourne City Council is the same, it's not right.
