Hi all, I am a 23 yo from Tasmania and am going to be driving from Melbourne to the Gold coast to drop off a relatives car. What places would you recommend I stop at along the way as well as any scenic/adventurous activities?

Depends on your route. But you could see the Big Merino, the Big Banana, the Big Guitar. There's heaps more.
Hey there, I'm also Tasmanian and have done the Tas to Qld drive a few times. It depends on what you're interested in before being able to recommend anything and also if there are any time/distance constraints on your drive.

First time I had planned to make a 2 week holiday of it with activities and walks so I followed the coast around and up. Wilson's Prom, Lakes Entrance, Eden, Kiama, Royal National Patk - all the beautiful spots along the way. Check the long range weather forecast though, rain started day 2 and didn't let up and became a race against time to beat flood road closures near Grafton.

The other 2 times I've travelled via Goulburn (big merino) to Sydney which I found to be a bit of a slog to drive. Can't comment on the inland (M39/A39) via Dubbo.

Happy travels
