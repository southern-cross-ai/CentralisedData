Spoiler - [he had a knife and was NOT killed](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-10/police-hospital-shooting-kingaroy-hospital/104209460).
Guess he was in a great place to be shot, anywhere else he might have bled out before hospital.


Probably not ideal to have a shooting in a hospital given the disruption caused but still well done by police to stop the threat.
