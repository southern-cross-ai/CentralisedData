Not sure how I feel about that.

On one hand many “high-functioning” autistic people are often friendless and find difficulty finding relationships, and those they do find they often only associate with like minded people leading to an echo chamber environment. These are certainly risk-factors in having extreme beliefs.

On the other hand this results in further marginalisation leading to increased isolation and further pushing autistic individuals down the rabbit hole.
Thankyou was wondering what it was.

Did I miss something? What eco-warriors? Those guys who block the roads? That may be irritating but it is nowhere near the level of legit terrorism.
Most problematic one is religious fruitcakes, and unfortunately the ones who notice it first (other religious fruitcakes) don't report on it because they see themselves as part of the same tribe.
