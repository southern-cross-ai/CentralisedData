Hi,

My cat has been diagnosed with early renal disease and I should feed her with prescription diet which is Royal Canin wet/dry food for Early Renal Disease. The problem is that my cat doesn't want to eat that food. I introduced it slowly, over a 10 days, mixed with her regular food, but she rather chooses to go hungry than to eat that. I don't know what to do?

My cat had bladder issues, so I have him on a prescription diet too. He really didn't like Royal Canin but he likes the Hill's brand, so maybe that could work for your cat? They have both wet and dry food (the k/d kidney care) But I'd have a chat to her vet about it and see if they have any suggestions.
You could also try serving it warm, it sounds so gross and it smells, but some cats can’t resist warm food. For the dry food you can serve it in warm water. Helps them get water in too!
There are many renal diets for cats that you can follow, making the food from scratch. I adopted a cat that came with more advanced renal disease and was told (given his blood test results) that he wouldn’t last 6 months. By making food for him following various online vet designed food plans he survived for over 6 years. Our vet was amazed with his blood test results.
At the time there was an Australian vet that made a supplement powder to add to made food to ensure they got the nutrients they needed. This was six years ago so I don’t remember everything off the top of my head but I know it needed to be low in phosphorous and contain certain omega’s. I always used human grade ingredients as there is little regulation of pet foods in Australia.
Ask your vet if there are any alternatives which your cat might find palatable.

There are several others - some of which appear to need a prescription from the vet - example [here](https://www.mypetwarehouse.com.au/cat-food-prescription-diets/kidney) - that you may be able to try.

[This](https://felinecrf.org/which_foods.htm) page may help you with some other ideas.

Good luck finding something your fur baby will tolerate.
My cats needed to use the urinary diet food, and we originally tried Royal Canin and they hated it. Then we switched Hills but it gave them constant diarrhoea. Finally switched back to Royal Canin and they began to love it.

Probably need to be a bit more persistent or explore alternatives.
Hills may have a food you can try? You can also contact Royal Canin for advice
I'm sorry to hear. My cat is Stage 3 CKD. He also refused Royal Canin and Hills in all the flavours available, both wet and dry. I tried warming it up, splashing a bit of water over the top of them, using liquid treat toppers, mixing snacks in and he refused. He would fish out the treats and leave the food be.

The only thing he eats now is the shelf food (Fancy Feast, Dine, Applaws) so I mix [Vetoquinol Ipakitine Renal Support Powder](https://vetslovepets.com.au/products/vetoquinol-ipakitine-renal-support-powder-for-dogs-and-cats?variant=43851368693996&currency=AUD&utm_medium=product_sync&utm_source=google&utm_content=sag_organic&utm_campaign=sag_organic&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjw2dG1BhB4EiwA998cqLMfpH0ovtHMYW92ZFOSI1f6VDXNGnLfU31FQrx_JR7QE0RWqhn89BoCmKEQAvD_BwE) in with his food. I've done this after consulting my vet who said he'd rather that he stays full and eating - even though the foods are deteriorating his kidneys, than to starve himself.

Since getting on the Phosphorus binders he's far less lethargic and is relatively active. Before getting on them, when we were trying the Renal foods he was very sluggish due to being weak, starved and dehydrated.

I wish you the best.
Thank you all, each and everyone for suggestions, I will start with Hills and see how we go👍also, very interested in home made recipes
Hills k/d Early Support is the equivalent prescription from Hills. Give that a try... they have both dry and wet.
Cats are fussy fussy creatures.  There are multiple flavours of wet/dry food in the different brands.

Just get a selecction, and try different ones.  Reducing the normal food you include.

Eventually only giving renal.  Fussbag will then form a preference for one of the options, and you are good to go
We've had ours on the royal canin renal food for a couple years now and our vet had warned us that it's not very appetising food and that cats tend to struggle moving onto it. They also had said that any food is better than no food if we were really struggling.

For ours we find that she won't eat if all we give her is the renal, but if she gets some good food on top then she'll also eat the renal food underneath. We've worked out that a 3/4 renal and 1/4 normal food ratio is what she'll tolerate. You can also try mixing the dry food with a little bit of chicken broth or a bit of the creamy tube treat things on top. A bit of tuna or chicken on top also seems to work for ours if she's being really stubborn.
The most important thing is hydration. You want to reduce the burden on their kidneys which means lots of water to dilute what they're processing. 

Feed them wet food exclusively, no dry food. Multiple water sources in different locations, different materials for bowls, changed daily, and consider overly chlorinated tap-water as an issue. You want them to always have at least one appealing water source even at their most picky or nauseated. It can also apparently help to raise them a little off the ground so the cat isn't leaning so low and as affected by increased acidity and related nausea. I've found cats generally drink the bare minimum they need and in this scenario I've mixed water into their food, measured with a shot glass and in proportion to how much food it's with, if you're adding fibre (plain Metamucil) and how much, and your observations of the consistency of what's coming out the other end. It can also be important to supply water this way, again, due to the nausea and not wanting to drink. You're also going to be dealing with constipation due to their body demanding more water and lactulose is the answer to that, and is a balance of laxative effect and its negative effect on hydration. I've used 1ml (needleless) syringes to measure it out. Paraffin can also be used but I don't think it's as effective, without getting into those details. 

If you've got the money, definitely get the expensive renal diet wet food. Royal Canin and Hills. If it isn't appealing, mix it with another variety they do like. Maybe something super tasty, but just be careful it isn't something completely counter in renal terms or plain very unhealthy like a can of Fancy Feast. Warming up food can make it more appealing. It can be hard knowing the special food will help but you might have to make concessions and just try your best. Ultimately you want to offer the best accommodations but also have a happy cat. And again, hydration is most important.

I'd suggest having a variety of novel, tasty things to eat in case you hit a serious patch of nausea and not eating. 

Be careful to regularly give lactulose, or paraffin. I've found the former tends to need administering every seven hours but maybe it'll be different for you. I've found it best to mix it with a little super tasty wet food, mixed in a shot glass and licked off a finger if the cat's fine with that. I'd suggest keeping this super tasty food exclusively for this purpose to help it be a surefire thing. 

Lots of urination and maybe some messy poopin' means a lot of litter maintenance. Stay on top of it throughout the day, every day. Otherwise going to the toilet with accumulate negative connotations and they'll end up not going, not eating as a result, stressed, and in poorer health from the stress. I recommend Catsan Clumping Clay, but it's pricey. 

I think from diagnosis to the end it's usually about 12-18 months. It's worth keeping in mind and giving them all you've got for that short period of time. And, being prepared for making the tough decision when it comes and not letting things go too far. I'd suggest asking the vet about critical end-stage stuff like Mylanta and subcutaneous injections well in advance of possibly needing them.

I believe [this site](https://www.felinecrf.org) is between very accurate to perfect. It's probably best to further research anything mentioned though.
Try the hills science brand - maybe your cat prefers that flavor. (Mind loves  the royal canine renal, but hates the Hills Science) might be worth a try.
I went and asked vet and they also said try with Hill's, no other suggestions, so now we're trying Hill's🤷
Yeah, during cold months I always warm up her food, I put pouch in warm water
That is really good to hear, I will Google, especially recipes for some broths because that is her favourite food.
Thank you 🙏
Hill's is on a trial since yesterday 🐱 we'll see how it goes
>I tried warming it up, splashing a bit of water over the top of them, using liquid treat toppers, mixing snacks in and he refused. He would fish out the treats and leave the food be<

Yeah, same here!
Thank you 🐾
Fingers crossed 🤞
Can you please tell me about chicken broth, is it home made?
Thank you, I really appreciate the time and effort you put into this post! I'll do my best 👍
Hopefully she likes it. Fingers crossed for you!
Good luck! Btw Pet Circle has decent prices on Hills/Royal Canin and they sell the vet ranges
You're welcome! Also if you haven't already I suggest checking out r/RenalCats for more posts and suggestions
We use a low salt chicken broth from the shops, one of those powder ones and mix it up fairly weak and then mix in her food with that. If we're feeding her 1/4 cup of dry food then we'll mix maaybe 1/8 cup of broth with it. I'm not sure how good the chicken broth is for her so we just use enough to give it a bit more flavour to get her to eat her food.
Thank you🐱
