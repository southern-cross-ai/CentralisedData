Come at me but how is this news? People get granted bail every single day, just means they're not keeping you in custody and you follow the rules and appear at court on the date your matter is heard

People acting like she's got off scot free when the matter hasn't even concluded
Not in NSW so can anyone clarify if the charge ‚Äúsexual intercourse with a person under special care‚Äù relates to the kid having an intellectual disability or something or just that it highlights that she was in a position of authority over them? 

I guess with him being over 16, she thought she could get away without the ‚Äúindecent treatment of a child‚Äù type charges, maybe this is the closest equivalent available?
Feel for her husband
Of course she was granted bail
Is it just me or is every comment invisible?
Rape not sexual assault

Let's wait on a trial to see the sentences
But the bloke who stole a bunch of Bluey coins gets denied bail ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüôÑü§°üåè
They are treating her like she is a child, ‚Äúcan‚Äôt leave the house without a parent‚Äù she is an ADULT treat her like one and lock her up she knows what she was doing and she knows better. Even crazier that her husband was in court defending her! He‚Äôs either a cuck or she convinced him it‚Äôs all a lie and she‚Äôs innocent.
So many people in this thread are convinced she is guilty. False accusations happen all the time. Police get shit wrong a lot. Just because some one was charged does not mean they have been found guilty.
Rape* ftfy
Now reverse the roles....

More of a workplace violation than a crime, so what's the story?
It‚Äôs literally a core concept of the legal system called the presumption of bail. It‚Äôs up there just under the presumption of innocence. You are innocent until PROVEN guilty, which means it is unjust to take away freedoms just on the basis of an accusation. Bail should always be granted unless there is a clear and present danger to the community, or a clear and likely risk that the accused will not re-appear before the court. 

Once you please guilty, you may have bail revoked if the minimum punishment is prison, but usually you will remain on bail until sentencing is handed down.
A google search for '"granted bail site:abc.net.au' suggests that the ABC pretty frequently reports the granting of bail for stories they are reporting on.  Why should this be an exception?
I suppose the idea is that if it was a male teacher and female student people think the teacher wouldn‚Äôt get bail
It's classic stoking of the culture war. On one hand I'd expect better from the ABC but on the other, I'm not surprised.
Because the main picture they used is sure to get clicks ‚Ä¶FFS‚Ä¶
It‚Äôs a very cynical and distorted way to report this news. They‚Äôre clearly trying to wring every last drop of salacious detail they can. Appalled to see it on the ABC.
Because of the large re-offending rate of people let out on bail.
Position of authority

[https://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol\_act/ca190082/s73.html](https://www5.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s73.html)

  
Disability would be an aggravating factor.
Age of consent in NSW is 16.

She just (somehow) didn't think it was a bad idea to have sex with a student. 

Stupid. 

She will be charged with the specific law of **Sexual intercourse with a person aged 16-18 and under special care**

It accepts that genuine consent might exist, but that the position of power is one where the relationship should not occur. 

If she wasn't his teacher, this would not be a crime.
It may also mean the child is not currently in the care of their parents and may be placed in foster care by Child Protective Services - it differs from state to state so I‚Äôm not sure.
Yep. Married last year and she was already cheating this year. I would have walked straight out of the marriage as soon as she was charged
To be fair, the majority of child sex offenders get bail.
Yes. It‚Äôs called the presumption of bail. Unless the prosecutors show a clear and likely risk to either the community or of fleeing, bail shall be granted to anyone who has not been convicted.
Unless the person is a danger to the community or a risk of fleeing, they will be granted bail. 

Do people on reddit want every accused person to sit in jail for months while they wait for their trial?
Yes. Unless she poses a flight risk or risk to the community she will get bail. If she violates bail conditions she will be locked up pending her court hearing.

Psst, your sexism is showing, like in many of your other posts.
And if it were a MALE teacher, he would peobably be in prison until the trial. 

At least the judge said she's going to jail once found guilty. Many female offenders in this situation get a slap on the wrist with a limp lettuce leaf and never see the inside of jail, but a bloke is virtually 100% guaranteed to be off to jail for a long time. 

Double standards anyone?
I had that happen on another post.  Reload sorted it out.
What would ordinarily be called "rape" is referred to as "sexual assault" in NSW legislation. 

Arguably the shift in language is a good thing. "Rape" is etymologically related to "rapina" = robbery. It's probably a good thing that we no longer conceptualise rape as a property crime, but rather as a crime agaist the person.
>

>She was supported in court by her parents and husband.

Thats the only mention. I mean he could have just attended court to see the evidence against her. It doesn't mean he is defending her. I certainly would want to hear the evidence against my wife instead of waiting for it to be revealed by the media months later.
Maybe hubby was encouraging the whole thing. I sure wouldn‚Äôt be showing up for my wife in that situation.
There has reportedly been video evidence, and that she herself admitted to the acts.
If the student didn't consent, or has manipulated or coerced consent, then it would be rape. 

This isn't rape. 

This is a *specific* law, banning sexual intercourse between an offender and a person aged 16-18 under the special care of the offender.
And nothing changes. What‚Äôs your point?
The kid wasn‚Äôt her colleague, he was under her care.
Rolf Harris that you?
Even if the student is above the age of consent and the interaction was ‚Äúconsensual‚Äù (for lack of a better term - not trying to imply enthusiastic consent or minimise anything here), the teacher still holds a duty of care and doing what she allegedly did is definitely illegal.
Not sure what you‚Äôre on about. He‚Äôs a 17yo child and she was his teacher. It is absolutely a crime.
You should be on a list.
He's a minor under her care, that she has power over.  It's predatory behaviour.
YO , someone check this dudes hard drive.
Just like screwing your sister, this is also illegal because of the relationship they have. 

Is THIS simple enough for you to understand now?
Even though both parties might have completely consented (and are of age), there is a specific law against having sex with a 16-18y.o in your special care.

I'm sure you're down voters don't understand that, but ah well
Why is most of this being reported on?
Except men get bail for stuff like this all the time?
Male teachers get bail. All the time. You have to actually demonstrate you‚Äôre a flight risk or likely to reoffend, to be denied bail.
They probably would still get bail if they haven‚Äôt pleaded guilty yet.
They would though.
I know a man who‚Äôs been charged for child sex crimes who was granted bail. It‚Äôs only after he did a runner that he lost bail.
As the comment above you notes, a quick Google finds that the ABC regularly reports on bail being granted. As much as you may hate the ABC, this is not culture war bs.
I thought that might be the case. For all the ‚Äúhe‚Äôs legal, whatever‚Äù comments, I would bet anything that this kid is not one of the straight-A, great support at home, has received plenty of love and care in his life, kids in her classroom. 

There are so many reasons that teenagers will occasionally develop some feelings of attraction for peripheral adults in their life, it absolutely sucks that she took advantage of this and exploited her position. What a creep.
Is that lowered since I was in school? Is that the absolute age of consent, or just for the 16-17 zone where it's a lesser crime or not a crime at all if the partner is within X years?
Can he wait until she's in jail to do the divorce then get a better split of the assets?
Majority of all accused who have not confessed or pleaded guilty get bail because they haven‚Äôt yet been proven guilty. Especially so for non-violent crimes
I mean...we have significantly more statistics on male child rapists than female so this feels like something you could lookup if you wanted to see the rate of men getting bail.

We also have much more statistics on the limp lettuce leaf treatment that male rapists get too. If you felt like looking it up.

Seems like you're more upset about the possibility that female rapists go free than the reality that most rapists go free. 

But, considering that you're too lazy to google shit I doubt that beyond virtue signalling on Reddit you actually do anything to advocate for harsher treatment of rapists so
I know someone who is on similar charges and yes he was granted bail. 

Only after he did a runner did it get revoked.
There is an argument to be made that where a significant power imbalance is in play such as here, and the victim isn't an adult, then they can't meaningfully consent.
The law says children in those positions are unable to consent.
The article works as designed in getting engagement from a certain side of the culture war.
Someone needs to read up a bit more on this, a bloke is not likely to get bail for this.
I bet the choice of photos in the reports aren't posted smiling ones for the guy.
He dead
Age of consent is 16 in NSW so what's his age got to do with it?

Yes, she should not have had sex, but only because of a *specific* law, created for this situation to stop teachers have sex with students. 

The student may very well have 100% consented to this, and since this has come out and not been because of his complaint (likely video leaked) it's likely he completely consented. 

We obviously don't know that for a fact, but the charges that have been laid and the way it's come out suggest that to be the case.
You know the student was above the age of consent in NSW?
Yeah, the law recognises that there actually CANNOT be complete consent between an adult and a 16-18 year old in their care. It‚Äôs very weird you‚Äôre seemingly defending this kind of relationship as otherwise fine but for this ‚Äúspecific law‚Äù.
There is really something to the model in some EU places where people are *charged* with crimes immediately get their name scrubbed from publication, and only returns after conviction. Even when it‚Äôs an ‚Äúeveryone knows‚Äù one like Anders Breivik
No dispute from me mate, I don‚Äôt know the statistics at all, but I guess because it‚Äôs more unusual for a woman to be in this position that when it happens it gets a lot more attention so people get there opinion skewed by the coverage ?
Especially in cases like this where the victim is over the age of consent in NSW. The crime here is related to her position of power as a teacher rather than the age of the student, based on law changes made in 2018.
Yep, I have the exact same story.
There's only so many ways we can protect people from themselves and this law is about that. 

There 100% might have been actual consent from both sides, but it should not occur because of the type of relationship that the two hold.

As I said elsewhere, if she wasn't his teacher, this is literally a non-event between two consenting people.
>In NSW, the age of consent for sexual activity is 16 years.

https://pro.playsafe.health.nsw.gov.au/tools/consent-age-the-law
Rape in general is very poorly handled by the judicial system. If it were up to me I would have a much more serious punishment than they do get. The trauma from rape is a lifetime burden - speaking as a male survivor. In addition, in those days, it was not taken seriously by the police or anyone else so I didn't report it. It also calls your own sexuality into question and that is something that I DEFINITELY didn't want to deal with.

When it happened to my sister too, it made me have to face my own. I have had a lot of counselling for the damage it did to me to the point where I don't have flashbacks from any of the traumas that it set the stage for. But it does leave permanent scars including the fact that even now I do not trust people easily.

This is why I am very outspoken about the fact that rape and DV CAN happen to men as well as women.
I'm sure all the details will come out in due course - but if the student was the one that entirely initiated everything, and had absolutely no complaints (ie bragged to his mates about it) are you going to claim there was no meaningful consent?

Remember, absurd that I have to do this, I am not defending her, and she made a grave mistake in doing what she did. What she did was completely wrong.
No it does not. 

He isn't a child. 

The law is specific, this is not manipulated or coerced consent.

This is a specific situation of sexual intercourse (not assault) between a person and a 16-18y.o under their special care. 

A doctor and patient would be the same. 

However, and this is the key point - ***if she wasn't his teacher*** this is not a crime. 

It's consensual sex between a 17y.o and a 30y.o
The side that is opposed to using positions of authority and power for personal sexual gratification?
Incorrect https://amp.abc.net.au/article/104193758
I think that law was created because there are issues with people giving full consent with such a power imbalance. Do you not think this law is a good idea?
# YO check this persons browser history too!!. 



yeah buddy im sure police is the one in the wrong here and not the teacher with strict duty of care obligations that making being above the age of consent an irrelevant issue.
There is no wording of that in the Act that covers this. 

Do you agree if they weren't teacher/student, consent between them could occur?

Edit: the charge would have been Sexual Intercourse without consent if what you say is true
>He isn't a child. 

As per the law, he is. 


>if she wasn't his teacher this is not a crime. It's consensual sex between a 17y.o and a 30y.o

But she is and under the law a child can not give consent under these circumstances. Sexual intercourse occurring without consent is a category of rape, regardless of it being its own type of offence. 

As written by a legal professional, "a person aged 16 or 17 cannot validly consent to sexual acts with a person who is in a position of authority over them, like a teacher or a sports coach."

https://www.armstronglegal.com.au/criminal-law/vic/offences/age-of-consent/
This is a really weird hill for you to die on, but you do you. I acknowledge that the age of consent in NSW is 16. At the same time, in Australia, by legal definition, you‚Äôre considered to be an adult when you turn 18 years old. This kid is 17, so I will continue to call him a child because that is what he is. This woman is an A grade predator.
Huh, I stand corrected.
I have not made a comment on that point in that post. 

Of course I think what she has done is deplorable. Of course I think that law is appropriate. 

I never said otherwise?
Wait, you need to learn how to actually converse. 

Like, take a step back, try to comprehend the words that are written in front of you, and respond to the meaning of those words. 

I ain't defending the teacher, I was simply stating a fact for you, since you were acting as if this was pedophilia.

It's not, because the student is over the age of consent.

It's a problem because it's a teacher student relationship, and that should not occur. 

C'mon dude, it ain't hard.
We're talking about NSW. The wording of the section around this is specific and different.

>Persons aged 18 or older can validly consent to sex with a person who is in a position of authority over them. In this context, the age of consent is 18.

NSW don't have this wording.
A 17y.o can have sex with a 50y.o if they want. 

Is the 50y.o automatically a predator? 

Some people love their milfs and cougars mate...
Pays to check your opinions are actually correct before you go spreading them online.
buddy, we playing semantics over here. 

"Technically its not rape because X ,Y, Z. "

Also my initial comment was obviously a joke.    
Its weird you are taking this so seriously.
Not if she is his teacher. Specifically banned by law. Like banging your sister or other family member. You really are a numpty if you can't see the diff
Yes, if you're an adult that has sex with children I'm absolutely fine with calling you a predator.
Yer, you joked about it being pedophilia, and it isn't. 

That's all.
You've missed the context of this discussion. 

I know exactly that.

I have not once defended her or her actions.
yeah never said anything about age of consent, you did.
To be honest, I was confused at your point of "it is legal for a 17 year old and a 50 year old to have sex if there is consent" in the context of this situation. In general you are right, if a 17 year old random girl wanted to get hot and heavy with me (I am 50+) it IS legal.

But if she is my student - it isn't. And to be honest I do occasionally have female students who make me feel a little uncomfortable with the intensity of their attention (I teach year 10 to 12, mostly doing business subjects).

Not that I would ever actually WANT to be with a 17 year old -  it just doesn't float my boat. Heck, my wife is 20 years younger than me and I really didn't see her as a potential romantic partner when we met and built up a friendship. But I certainly wouldn't let anything happen with a 17 year old, let alone a student. To each their own though, as long as it is legal.

Have a good one :-)
Why would you be checking someone's hard drive then? You only do that to uncover CP
I don't disagree with anything you're saying, and that includes the fact that I know this act is illegal. 

My point is actually a slightly different discussion, about why this offender wasn't called a rapist and pedophile by the article author.

It's a bit tangential, I get that.
maybe there is photos of cute cats or pie recipes.
