I've come here to ask as I've found reddit to be a wealth of knowledge and valuable in giving perspective.


My 7 year old daughter had a swimming lesson yesterday and the parent of another child in the group took videos and photos, multiple of each, of their child (and therefore mine as well as others) and after the 3rd time I asked the parent to stop. They claimed it was a public space and it was OK.  

Imagine my surprise when I looked on the website of the facility we have swimming lessons at and it isn't banned, but the person taking videos/photos must have permission of other kids parents to do so. 

I'm really uncomfortable with the idea that anyone can take photos or videos of my child in a swimsuit. 

Am I overreacting? 
As a parent, I don't subscribe to the view that everyone is a predator. Here's my view:

If the person taking photos obviously is a parent, then a few snaps ad 20 secs of video centered mainly on their child, then its probably ok.

If its continuous video not focused on their child and longer than say a  minute, then it is in not ok territory.

Also - the person taking photos should have accepted your request and not tried to push the point.
I run similar type classes as part of my job and at the beginning of each session I have to say, ‘please do not take photos of your children during the session, this is to protect the privacy of other children present’. If staff are taking photos, we are required to ask every single parent present for consent. This is standard procedure for a council run facility in Australia.

Is this pool council run or private? If it’s council, approach the teacher. You should be handling this with them, not directly with the other parent.
You said it yourself. The rules of the facility say they must have your permission. They don't have your permission therefore it isn't allowed. Raise it with the facility's management if the other parent won't be reasonable about things.
Swimming instructor here. We only permit it if no other children are visible in the photo or parents permission has been gained and told to teacher by those parents not the photo taking parents. We have banned people from the facility for taking pictures against a parents wishes. 

Contact the facility about the issue. They will likely know who the parents are, and if they have posted the photo on public social media will be able to ban them right away. Otherwise they can send out a behaviour reminder email and train staff to shut it down if they see it.
I tend to take pics when my child is in open water. Because it makes things easier, and also because I don't need randos kids in my photos.
I am a photographer - and I’ve been a press photographer where I have had to take images of people without their consent in a public place. 

There is a difference between legality and morality and if someone asked me to stop taking photos - I absolutely would. Especially when it comes to their children. 

Also, a swimming pool is not a public place - it is a private property and the business owners own the property.  

As a professional, hearing about another photographer being asked to stop taking photos of someone’s children and continuing to do so disgusts me. 

What was the purpose of them taking photos? I doubt they were employed by the establishment and if they were there should be signage to say that your image may be taken and if I saw that sign and there was nowhere to swim without having my photo taken, I would go to a different pool
>They claimed it was a public space and it was OK. 

Too many people think too much is public when it's not. The pool is likely not actually a public space, it may be a space open to the public but that's different. 

My simple advice for you is next time make the kind request as is your right as your child's parent then if they refuse to seek assistance from management. Management can then tell them no, and lean into enforcement measures like having them removed or calling police. 

When it comes to kids, kids enjoy additional protections under the law when it comes to privacy.
I go to a pool that also has kids swimming lessons. There are signs up everywhere saying that photos and videos are not permitted. No one is allowed to use their phone in the pool area (not even when it's all adults in the pool). The swimming centre does take a graduation photo of the kids when they move up a group, but the kids are fully clothed in these.
Not over the top for many reasons. Besides the obvious kids in togs, someone brought to my attention the privacy of kids location when parents are divorced and those photos being put on social media. There can be many different reasons why it’s not acceptable.
[Here's ](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-02-03/paedophiles-trawl-facebook-for-family-photos-warns-commissioner/7136376) the reason I never took photos without consent and I never posted them online. I remember a time, before phones with cameras, when people would wait until no one else was in the photo before they took the shot. Now everyone just gets their phone out and within seconds it's on social media. 

I'm a journalist and the pool is, in fact, on private property and you are supposed to get permission from the owners / management before taking photos. Even the carpark for the pool is private property. I'm not allowed to film or take photos or video on private property - shops, cafes / restaurants, pools, library, and the list goes on. 

Also, I get fed up with this culture of just filming or photographing people without their consent. They might have escaped from a violent home or relationship. If you upload it online, with location, date, time, etc, and the perpetrator sees it, the person with the camera could have just put the people in the image in danger. Nobody thinks anymore.
A lot of opinion in this thread but no references to Australian child safety standards, which cover this kind of thing, and have become mandatory for clubs and sporting organizations to follow in recent years. It’s not up to local pools to decide for themselves any more. 

The code varies depending on which state you live in, but here’s a starting point:

https://www.playbytherules.net.au/got-an-issue/community-child-safe-sport/child-safe-sport-in-each-state-or-territory

You can also read the AIS Sport Integrity policy on photography here (quite general, though, and some states apply stricter rules):

https://www.sportintegrity.gov.au/sites/default/files/SIA282-0224-SG%20Photography%20Filming%20Children%20Young%20People-A-5%20%5BDIGITAL%5D.pdf
Most places with swimming classes I've been to have signs saying photography is banned.

Maybe check with management
Im a lifeguard and any filming or photos are banned at most pools. Just tell a lifeguard, if they do it again and lifeguard doesn't notice, again tell the lifeguard it'll get escalated to a supervisor and stuff.

Please please just tell staff in any scenario it actually just makes our job harder to de-escalate if we're arriving when people are already heated with other patrons.
When I was a child, I always hated it when my parents took photos of me without asking. I felt a bit violated when someone captured a permanent image of me without asking me. So, I can imagine that if someone else's parents were taking photos of me - and they refused to stop when my own parents asked them to - I would have probably found that very upsetting.

I think many people in this thread are a bit overly fixated on whether or not someone creepy is going to look at the picture. To me, that's beside the point. The point is that if someone asks that the photo not be taken, then the photo shouldn't be taken. Maybe they have good reasons and maybe they don't. But just in the interest of being kind to each other, we should not violate simple requests like "please don't take photos of my child".
I worked in pools for 10 years until early this year, I worked across 6 different centres in that time and every single one had a no photography without prior permission policy. 

This involved going through the duty manager at the centre for approval and ensuring that the only person videoed or photographed was their child.

If you’re not comfortable with someone else videoing your child and they’re refusing to stop go straight to management, they will nip that in the bud immediately.
Not overreacting. Your gut is telling you this is wrong for a reason. 

I was repeatedly sexually assaulted by a pedophile at a public pool as a child. My being in swimmers was a big thing for him. Easy access. Made it seem like play to the people around us. Before he got to that stage, he was taking photos of us kids coming out of the change rooms in our swimmers on an old polaroid camera. 

Remember: parents can be pedophiles, and if a parent doesn’t understand why this is concerning behaviour, that in itself is a red flag.
MIL is a swimming teacher and has issues with this all the time. It’s not unusual for them to have kids who have been moved due to domestic violence and given new identities. These kids it’s especially important not to have photos put online. Some parents just won’t accept they aren’t allowed to take photos though (which they are not in their pool).
My daughters has swimming lessons. The owners of the facility keep an eye on parents taking photos and remind them it’s not allowed. They have kids there that are wards of the state, or under child protection etc.
>Am I overreacting? 

Yes. The pedo hysteria which kicked off in the late '90s has lead to generations of parents who are terrified of every stranger and have become helicopter parents who don't even let their kids roam the neighbourhood or visit a friends house without a security audit. I think this is a significant contributor to the increase in mental health problems among children.

Pedos don't want a picture of your kid swimming in a pool.
A lot of Karen's in this thread.

If they're obviously filming their kids, then why do you care that yours happens to be in the background?

It obvious that they're parents and they're making happy memories and you really care that your kid is in it?

It's this over the top helicopter bullshit that's putting society down a shit road. Why do you care? If it was a guy on his own or they didn't have kids in the pool I'd understand, but they're in your group! Why not ask them to include your kid and get a copy? Have your kids meet and look forward to swimming lessons to not only learn but see their friends.

I've got 2 boys under 6, I see parents like you alllll the time, talk about sucking the enjoyment out of something.

Get involved, make it an event for your kids, film to and collaborate and make a season of it you can shoe your kids, not whing and complain to management only to make things awkward everytime you go to swimming lessons.
As a professional photographer (and a parent), I ALWAYS ask permission if kids are involved. I don't know people's personal circumstances and for good reasons, some people do not want their children photographed. I hand over my contact details and obtain the contact email address of the parent / guardian so I can forward on pics for their own records. Now, this practise has been drummed into me but for the average hobbyist / enthusiast photographer, they might not think of checking in with those around to see if anyone objects to their child being photographed. None the less, I'd raise your concern with the swimming class as perhaps it is a good reminder to this individual that consent should be sought when kids are involved.
What if some of the kids are living in secret because of previous DV stuff?

Don’t be a dickhead and take pictures of other people’s kids
I take videos of my daughter in her swim lesson. I zoom in on her so no other child is in the video. Once a kid gets too close I’ll stop. Did you ask to see the video to see if your daughter is actually in the video?

Also, not everyone is a predator. This is someone enjoying their child’s lessons. If you can’t handle other ppl filming their children because your child is also nearby, then maybe you should consider just participating in private lessons.
Have a read of [this opinion piece by a lawyer](https://www.lawyersalliance.com.au/opinion/photography-and-the-law-when-is-it-illegal-to-take-a-photo) and [this one which is QLD specific](https://www.macamiet.com.au/can-a-stranger-take-a-photo-of-my-child-without-my-permission/) If the pool is private property then the person needs permission to take photographs. Even government owned pools are considered private property. My local pool has signs strictly prohibiting people from taking photos and directing people to ask a staff member to take photos for you, which takes some of the creepiness out of it.
Parent here. Look it's not ideal but can't be enforced. That's life, sometimes you can't let things live rent free in your mind and you just have to move on. The majority (99.95%) are well intentioned.
Totally anecdotal but I’ve been taking pics and videos for years of my sons at swimming lessons and not once have I been asked by a parent or staff to cease. Perhaps because I’m there every week I’ve become a regular of sorts or a familiar face. I don’t know, but it’s never been an issue and I’m certainly not the only parent doing it.  

OP, going against the grain here but I think you’re being OTT, but it is your right to be protective of your kids how you see fit. Just don’t assume the worst of everyone. It’s no way to live life.
you are overreacting.

not that many people get aroused by kids, news media blows it way out of proportion because shit news drives engagement, and in this commercial hellscape theyre driven to tell you that every second person might be a pedo.

yes its fair you can request people dont take photos of your kids, but theyre gonna be recorded everywhere they go for their lives now, since we stuck cameras in everything.
Yeah I think you are overreacting. Like use some common sense here, if they're obviously photographing their own kid with yours somewhat in the background, is that REALLY so dangerous?

Are you going to raise your kid and go through life seeing potential predators and threats at every turn? Erode every sense of comraderie and community in the interest of protect against unlikely (yet possible) threats?

Just chill man
Those photos are precious memories for people of their children's fleeting childhood. I think it's definitely okay to be cautious and wary, and if you're really uncomfortable I think it's reasonable to politely ask the photographer to stop. Some centers have strict rules against photography of children at pools. I think the chance of malicious intent is extremely low, though. I think people just want to preserve memories of their babies.
It’s totally reasonable for you to object but you’ve found the flaw in the facility’s rules - they are essentially leaving enforcement up to individuals and that leaves you a bit out in the cold if you’re dealing with someone unreasonable and rude! Definitely take it to management.

Rather annoyingly our pool’s conditions of entry include a blanket agreement that’s you can be photographed or filmed for their marketing and that they own all rights and don’t have to seek your permission to use the images or video. Which I personally hate and feel runs counter to the spirit of their rules for protecting kids. Luckily I’m never going to look presentable enough at our lessons for anyone to want to use my picture.
I've taken photos of my kids in swimming lessons,  but I've always made absolutely sure nobody else are in the photos.   It's not hard with multiple levels of zoom.
If they are going around focusing on your kids, perhaps get concerned, but if your kid just happens to be in the background, I think you're overreacting.
I think you're overreacting and creating a problem which doesn't need to exist.

Nobody will agree with me though.
At my local club lime pool it is against the rules to take nonconsensual photos regardless of whether it’s adults or children. I’m sure the pool will have a policy on this if children are involved and they don’t have consent of the parent. Report it to the staff.
I don't mind if my kid is in the background of someone's photos of their own kid. If their camera focus was solely on my kid we'd be having a few stern words to say the least.
Most pools have very strict no photos rule in pool errors.

I’m surprised that no one asked them to stop.

In my naive new parent phase we took our daughter to the pool and I took my camera to take photos. I was politely asked to put the camera away after less than a minute.

I understood the reasons immediately
Depends on the venue.  


My local pool has a strict policy of no photography at all times, and whilst it is a PUBLIC pool, it is still owned by (Usually) the council, so Council's rules apply.  If they dictate no pictures or video, then that is the rule.
Double check with r/auslegal but children are entitled to stronger privacy protections for images than adults, even in public spaces. You have no control over what happens to those images - for all that parent knows it could unintentionally alert an abuser or a threatening someone you’re going to testify against. They’re definitely in the wrong.
Public spaces are classes such as places like beaches, parks etc. If the swimming lessons take place at a leisure/sports centre with pools, they aren't a public space. They are a business that allows public access. This means that the idea of photos/videos being allowed there is incorrect. Most places that have pools do not allow photos and videos being taken due to privacy reasons. This parent was way out of line and should have stopped when asked. Next time this happens, report it to the lifeguards or swimming instructors. They will tell the parent to delete the photos and give them a warning. They can be removed if they don't abide by the rules.
Doesn't matter what the rules are.

Consent should *ALWAYS* be asked and honoured, anything else is immoral.
Your overreacting the parent was just capturing their child's moment that your kid so happened to be in the background of. I don't think the conditions of photography requires permission of indirect photos. Often with lessons / coaching you agree to photography in the fine print.
There are lots of reasons you may not want your child in photos and vids, I don’t think ppl realise it’s not just bc of pedos. 50% of us are divorced, lots have crazy exes who will react if they see their kid on someone’s fb while in the other parents care. Mine would have. Not right or fair but that’s life. It was safer for me and the kids to keep mine out of the public eye.

You’re not overreacting however, maybe try asking if they could take pics while ensuring your kid is not in shot. I feel like you’ll get a better response that way? Or, get staff involved, ask them to offer to take the pics for the other parent as they can make sure your kids aren’t in the pic.
I think you ARE overreacting in that theres a pretty chill step that can be done before going to management. A meeting with management is not the first step. Satisfy yourself that there is a concern with your child being photographed first.

Maybe the better way to approach it is to have a chat with the other parent taking the photos to see if your kid makes a focused appearance in the photo. Explain that youre cautious of privacy and just want to check to be safe rather than sorry. A short way of doing this is saying "hi, youre not photographing my kids are you?"... It allows them to think about what they're doing or perceived as doing, correct their behaviour and save face. They'll of course say "oh, no I wasn't" and if they truly weren't they'll probably volunteer to prove that to you... Job done.

I'm a parent that takes photos at my kids swimming lessons. I take photos of my kid and I'm mindful of other kids and instructors in the photos. I use portrait mode so kids in the background are a blur and try to take it when the instructor is facing away (i.e. can't see their face or wet clothes clinging to their front). The rules of the place allow exactly what I'm doing. But also I don't get bad vibes from all the other parents there. In this day and age there is more often than not common sense about what can be posted publicly. 

I give my fellow parents the benefit of the doubt. However, wouldn't hesitate to have a chat with another parent if it thought they might not understand.
You said the rules say they must have permission of the other kids parents. Tell them that is the rule & you do not give your permission & if they persist you will escalate. I’d also raise it with the pool manager before the next lesson, so they are aware it’s an issue.
This dispute can be easily solved with some basic social skills. No one is in the wrong here, you absolutely have the right to govern who takes pictures of your child. Their safety is dependent on you. That parent also has the right to take photos of their own kid in what’s an important phase of growing up. There is a 99% chance that the parent isn’t some sort of predator, but you can still get what you want without having a big fight about it. Thats the art of good social skills. When you say “stop taking pictures of the kids”, you are insinuating that the parent is a predator. It feels pretty bad when you are just an innocent person and someone insinuate that you could be the literal worst type of criminal. That will invoke an automatic defensiveness and hostile emotional response. What you could do instead is start a simple conversation about which kid is theirs ect. “Oh they are doing so well!” Yada yada. Then just politely mention that you are quite uncomfortable with photos of your child being on another device. Even in the background of a photo. “Mind if I just check to make sure?” Because there isn’t a defensiveness, the other parent will very likely let you check. And hey! Maybe they didn’t get your kid in the shot anyway! If they did then they would most likely delete it just out of respect. You protect your kid, the other parent gets to take photos and look over them for years to come, reminiscing on the good times. Everyone is happy. I would advise against escalating because it just makes for a bad time for everyone involved. Unless of course the other parent is being stubborn, then you should definitely talk to management.
You aren’t overreacting. I agree most people aren’t predators but the sad reality most people are blissfully ignorant about how many predators there actually are. They take photos and videos of their kids and others and put them online for anyone to see. In a world flooded by crappy family vloggers, so many people are desensitised to the very real risk of putting images of children online.
The age of paranoia
I wouldn’t take a photo of fully-clothed adults without express consent. 
Anyone saying it’s an “overreaction” clearly doesn’t understand how easily (& frequently) digital images can be (& are) abused; let alone the risks posed by AI/big tech spying/porn/deep-fakes & God-knows-what-else our kids will have to deal with as they grow up. It doesn’t matter WHAT the photographing parent’s intentions are, they need to learn it’s not the goddamn 80s anymore! As long as they’re too young to consent or object, it’s your RESPONSIBILITY to protect your kid’s identity & privacy.
You could check the centre's policy. Ours has a no photos policy.


Also, it's not a public area lol it's a private business.
It would be entirely appropriate to raise your concerns with the swim school and let them deal with this.

For anyone reading this, anyone asked to stop filming a child should do so. There are children in the community in care that need to be kept away from adults who have caused them harm. The sharing of footage that could indicate where this child could be found is extremely risky. It shouldn't be necessary to breach that child's privacy and share that the child is under a court order so that filming is stopped.
As a lawyer working with victims of Csa and parent I would have thrown their phone into the pool*

*I may also have vicarious trauma I guess
The swim lessons that I've taken my kids to have never been public spaces. 

You walk into a building, likely being rented by the swimming franchise. You walk past an admin desk and go up poolside where only parents/family are allowed. 

It's already been said, but talk to management.
This falls into the "just because you can, doesn't mean you should" category for me. It'd be nice if we had a little more consideration for others, but it feels like that's disappearing quickly.
I thought about it to send a photo to my parents - my child’s grandparents who live overseas but then I stopped myself as it’s not right to take photos or videos of other children, especially in swimwear. Even with permission from the parents I don’t think it’s right, it just feels wrong to me. I’d wait until no other children were in the pool if I wanted a photo. That’s my take anyway.

Thinking back to when I was a kid, before camera phones - lol before mobile phones! - it would not have been acceptable then for a parent to be stood at the side of the pool with a camera just snapping pics of the kids. It shouldn’t be acceptable now.
People just want photos of their children doing swimming lessons. It's not that deep. It's a nice memory to look back on when they get older.
Nope you’re not. In Sweden it’s illegal to take photos of children. 

Just sayin, some countries have already made it a rule to stop this shit from happening.
I think I remember working for a council pool facility and they had told us at induction that it wasn’t illegal for people to take pictures of other people swimming regardless of age because it was a public setting. The facility your at would likely just ask the person to not take the photos just like you did… I don’t believe it’s illegal but unethical perhaps. I honestly don’t mind if my children Chet snapped by other parents as usually the parents have good intentions and are focused on thier own children. If the concern is surrounding predators they’re going to get that content form wherever they can whenever they can is my guess..
I work as a swimming teacher and our pool has a blanket no on photos being taken
My two children attend different swim schools. Each swim school has signs up that no photography/video is to occur during lessons. This is the same as all of their other extracurricular activities and sport.  

As my son is one of two children in his swim class the only time I can get a video is when the other child in his class is absent that week and it is only because my son is in the end lane that I can - no other children are visible in the video.
What pool was this? Every public pool I have been to specifically prohibit filming or taking pictures.
It would be fair for you to stand in front of the camera if your child is in the field of view. But otherwise it’s probably innocent.
Man don't go to the beach
I only take photos of my kid at swimming lessons when she’s the only one in the frame for that reason - I don’t want anyone else having photos of my kid in her bathers, and I don’t want anyone else worrying I’m doing the same. 

I especially hated when observer parents would take photos of the little baby class, with us parents in the water with them. Those I did have a go at, I definitely didn’t consent to being in some stranger’s photos with my postnatal body exposed just because I wanted my kid to learn to swim. 

Officially our swim school has a no photos policy, in actual fact they don’t want to fight with parents who insist on taking pictures anyway.
It’s a bit OTT and precious as it is their kid and they’re not filming yours solely as they’re in the background, it’s normal to want to film your kid especially if you have relatives that can’t be there or have no social media. Probably want to show the kids grandparent how well they’re doing and your kid won’t probably be noticed as they’re only the centre of your universe.

It would be different if it was a single man or woman coming to film the kids and your kid without having a kid in the swim school and would be reason for concern but they’re just a proud parent and a creating memories they’ll show at their kids 21st one day. Stop making things what they aren’t and removing the enjoyment out of what should be a fun time for your kids. Millennial parents are so exhausting to deal with and such helicopters, let your kids live and think about why you’re really there. For your kid. You’re going to give them so much deep rooted anxiety seeing all these potential threats and risks, happened to me with an overprotective mother and now I lack a lot of confidence.
Entirely overreacting. Get a grip! The person was taking pictures of his child and yours was in it? Ask him if he can share the pics with your child and thank him profusely. You can satisfy your anxiety that the pictures are normal and you might even get a nice pic out of it
I like to video my kids swimming lessons, we’re British so I like to be able to send them to my parents / husbands parents so they can see. However, I only do it when they are doing their actual “swim” (ie not in a group and not with the boards etc). I zoom in as much as possible. If I do happen to catch the face of another child I normally edit an emoji over it. I also try and make sure my kids wear appropriate swimming attire (I know that’s such a sad thought but jn this day and age id rather be safe than sorry). 

I totally understand your POV and if any parent spoke to me if I filmed I would either show them I’ve zoomed in a just captured my kid or I would stop for that particular lesson. However, in general, I feel like when you’re a proud parent like that you do want it captured. Maybe next time you can suggest that they only film (zoomed in) when their child is doing a length by themselves, or speak to the teacher and ask if your child can be the first out the pool so the other parent can film.
>Am I overreacting?

In my opinion - Yes (I have two kids who both did years of swimming lessons - and we have no photos of them because it wasn't allowed)

I'm from a different time. There was a photo of myself and two of my sisters - in wet swimmers - making sand castles - that made the front page of the local rag. We all seem to have survived that trauma 
  
  

There is no general prohibition on photography in a public place in Australia

There are some local regulations that restrict that - commercial photography or video around most of Sydney's foreshores for instance - and prohibitions on photography that could be considered indecent

https://www.artslaw.com.au/information-sheet/street-photographers-rights/

On the other hand - if it is private property - then the owners can impose whatever restrictions they like - but they can really only ask the person to leave
Admittedly I'm old, but I've hardly ever seen people taking photos of children at the pool.  I think it's extremely rude to the other children, they are here to learn to swim and didn't consent to being in your photo. They can take a picture of their own child swimming in a separate lane if they want to.
So, the majority of people are going to think you are overreacting, because it doesn’t affect them. Some will just not have considered other perspectives, and others will just be lacking conscientiousness. 

This is a good example of why safeguarding vulnerable people is not always best handled by the opinion of the majority.

Swim schools have a ‘no photos’ rule for a reason, as do schools, childcare centres, etc. 

1. We have a family violence epidemic in this country and you don’t know who is affected. It could be any child, their parent, the swim teacher etc. Identifying the location and routine of an unknown person is incredibly dangerous. It’s also incredibly stressful for the affected family member who is constantly trying to manage their/their child’s safety and keep their location private.

2. Adults & children want to feel safe and comfortable using a swimming pool, especially if they feel vulnerable from wearing less clothes than usual. It compromises the comfort level of others to have someone swinging a phone around with no regard to who else they are inadvertently filming. I say this as the parent of a child who hates being filmed or photographed. 

3. Creating an atmosphere where it’s okay to film/photograph of children in less than normal clothing is *a really bad idea*, because those that *do* create CP material *will go to those places*. I think people would be shocked at the overwhelming volume of CP material that is being generated from Australia on a daily basis.

4. Phones should be away while actively supervising children in a pool, even during lessons. Phone use disrupting appropriate supervision of children is a huge problem at swimming pools. This has already become policy at many pools and spreading fast.

Go to management and explain the situation, and politely say you were concerned about it. It’s their rule, they will want to know so that they are able to better enforce it.
I personally think you are over-reacting. They're clearly not there being predatory, or purposefully taking pictures of your child. They're taking photos of THEIR child and will probably never have a second thought about the other children who are in the photos or videos. 

Anyone can take photos of your child at the beach without your knowledge, or in any other public space. 

Vigilance is great and can protect your child, but not everyone, everywhere is a predator.
You do realise we are all being filmed when we are out and about and you don’t even bat an eyelid.  Security cameras. Dash cams. Traffic cameras.  All that footage could be used for anything at all.  If the children and yes I have children are clothed and yeah I include swimsuits as clothes then you have nothing to worry about. More important things to worry about in life than someone filming their child at swimming lessons.
You're definitely not reacting, if that's the pool rules then that's the rules.

I used to be a swim teacher and later swim school manager- the places I worked had pools with a no photos rule or photos of only your child and only if a member of staff checks your photos.

I used to get really frustrated when parents would take photos of my lessons, it was disruptive, added something extra I had to think about that benefited no-one and took away from everyone else in the lesson. I also used to get frustrated when people didn't think about if I/another instructor were cool with their photo being taken.

There were a lot of parents who took photos with no regard for the rules, I/staff were verbally berated or sworn at for trying to enforce the rules or asking that their photo not be taken. Several parents were asked to not re-enroll their children next term- because the rules are there for a reason.

Take it up with the swim school and pool management, you're within your rights to not want your kids photo taken or on the internet.
100% needs to be a blanket rule that there is no photography unless permission is given. It’s not that everyone is a predator. It’s that there is a .01% they are predators. Or that they put the video online and sadly some predator uses it. 
A blanket rule is best. It’s not a common sense situation at all. Sometimes small groups of people in the world ruin things for others.
Australians really love their rules. Let's make another one.
Another parent filming their own kids in public space and incedenly yours at the same time is a far cry from a sex pest pedo without kids going in there and doing it.

 You're overreacting!
You’re 100% overreacting. The parent was just trying to take a few shots of their kid, they couldn’t have cared less that your kid was even there and are absolutely not looking at your kid. 

I was weirded out about taking photos of my kids in their swim lessons when I had my first kid, but now, no one is going to stop me capturing a memory of my own kids.
Yes, calm down, 99.999999999% of people don’t want to do anything to you or your family. They do t even care about your family. 

Live and let live.
>Am I overreacting?

Yes
Live Saving Australia has a set of policies on "Guidelines for pool operations" (commonly known as GPOs) and every pool has to follow them.

This includes strict rules on photography and video of participants in pools which say "no, not allowed".

Staff are expected  to police this. Unfortunately these policies are only available to paid members (which we think are all pools). You can ask to see these policies at your pool.

There are provisions for photography in some particular situations where lots of permission slips have been filled in, as their website explains. Obviously in this situation they didn't get permission from you.

There have been situations (domestic violence) where the partner's location has been identified when accidental photographs of children have been published.

Source: My wife who has been a swimming teacher for over 10 years.
I’ve filmed my kids when they were little, usually the very first lesson just for memories. But it was very quick and we tried not to capture other children or the teachers. You have to mindful it’s also someone’s workplace. Sometimes it can’t be helped and we only captured others incidentally

Maybe this is all the other parent is doing? And they prob reacted badly if you confronted them very publicly, especially if they were offended at the implication. 

I agree that if they’re making full-on videos that capture much more than their own child, you have a right to feel that your kids’ privacy has been invaded. It’s like us at the gym, we wouldn’t appreciate being the background  in someone’s TikTok video, unless it was just incidental, or passing by.
There’s a difference between taking photos/videos of the kids swimming in the pool, and kids in swimsuits standing/walking by the pool. Which one was it? 

I’d say filming kids swimming is perfectly fine, it’s mostly a blur with only arms partially visible above water anyway.
Technically... Public space is different to Public place.
Public space is accessible by the public,  but privately owned. Permission to film or photograph has to be given.
Public place is a free for all.
The thing to consider is if a child happens to be under a protection order of some kind, then photography isn't allowed.
Other than that, you have to rely on the photographer to stop or delete.
With swimming pools it is just easier to have a blanket ban on cameras.
I notice grandparents doing this a lot in my children’s swim lessons, I think parents these days are more aware of the sensitivities around photographing other peoples children. 

I most definitely do not think that the majority of people taking these photos are predators, but I do have an issue with people posting photos of my children to social media and I have absolutely no control of these photos once someone else has them on their devices. 

I was the witness in a high profile criminal case and am very careful about posting any identifying information online, this is even more paramount when it comes to my children. I know it can’t be totally avoided these days but don’t think it’s appropriate to photograph then publish photos of other peoples children without express permission
If you have a problem with people just doing people stuff - ie taking pics of their kids, you should probably remove yourself from the environment that causes you this angst. 

Furthermore, walking the streets of most major cities records more video of you and your kids than the parent just being a parent.
Yeah, I do think you're overreacting. My kid has been in swimming lessons for years and I frequently see parents snapping proud pics of their kids. My kid does private swim lessons so the rare time we take a photo/vid of him, there aren't other kids around, but I don't think families should generally be disallowed from photographing special memories due to overt paranoia.

I never ever post my kid (or anyone else's kid) on social media. And yeah, I've had to have conversations with family (particularly grandma) about not posting photos of him up for the world to see - mainly because of consent, not fear of pedophiles. But just because I don't post him on social media, doesn't mean I don't take photos of him on my phone, and same goes for tons of people.

I do think this is pretty "Karen" behaviour, not gonna lie. An overblown paranoid concern that won't be an issue in 99.9% of cases being used to actively effect the lives of every single person around you in a way that makes things a little worse for them. That's... not great.
Just remember you are being recorded nearly everywhere you go, probably inside the pool as well. 

And also, it’s like the sentiment that you try to feed them so well as a baby and toddler and then they are teens and you have far less control when they’re at school or out with friends.

You try to protect their social media identity as children and then as teens they broadcast their life to their friends via Snapchat, TikTok etc. And even if you don’t allow phones, their friends will record them and post it.

Don’t sweat the small stuff. Just enjoy her lesson.
Chill the fuck out. This mentality is what is killing our culture.

Your first thought when seeing people taking photos of their own children is that they're actually taking secret photos of YOUR child for sexual gratification? Talk about jumping to conclusions.

People can't even take photos of their own children anymore. FFS.
If it makes you feel any better, your kid in a swim hat and goggles wouldn't really be identifiable in the back of someone else's social media photos.... Not that this makes it OK but food for thought.
My swim centre had a strict no photography rule but all grandmas seemed to be given a free pass to photograph their grandchildren.
I'm an instructor of kids mostly 3-6 years in a council run pool. parents are advised of the no photos rule but many ignore it.
If I know the family, and it's so the non present parent can be involved (FIFO, international travel, etc), I will push their kid off first so they can get a shot then shut it down for the rest of the lesson. if that doesn't work then I just put myself between the parent and the child until they get the idea.
Other than that I'd suggest you speak to the OnDeck or ask your instructor to, so that the following week the OnDeck can approach the photograph taking parent directly. 
We also get the water pixies team out once or twice a year to take underwater photos and that usually appeases most folk.
The pool I go to always has signs up saying no photos. The lifeguards will come up to anyone taking a photo. Even in public areas, I try really hard not to take photos of other kids in the background.
As someone who has worked as a swimming instructor in multiple pool and beach facilities, it depends on the facility and the organisation running the program.

I'm very cautious of people taking photos because, unfortunately, we don't know who we can trust, not only because of predators but also due to custody issues. If this does occur again, and they continue to ignore your request, then you should speak to a lifeguard or the lesson's supervisor. I always asked parents to refrain from taking photos when I supervised lessons and was happy to do so if a parent asked.
The swimming place I used to take my kids for lessons had a super strict no phones policy. People would try and break it all the time but they would patrol for phones, it was great
The previous swimming school (mainly for babies and young kid) that my kid went, did have a rule that “photography allow, but please avoid including other students other than your child in the photos”

It was a very small school, usually only 2 classes at once and each with max 5 students.  We all took photos from time to time, to record our children best moment.

Now my kid moved to a much much bigger swimming school - I can’t remember if I see the rule of parents taking photos - but almost nobody do (but be frank it also kind of feel when kids are getting older, parents view swimming lesson as a chores, rather than a precious moment, so they just couldn’t care less)

I admit I did take one or two super quick snap when I ensured only my child in the photos, as part of “my first day of new swimming school!” moment.

When enrolled, swimming school did ask me to tick or untick if I allow the them to take photo, and if they can put photos in social media / website or not.  I opted ok on the first part, but no on the second.

Anyway - in theory if the parent take a quick snap of their kid that might have included my kid, I wouldn’t stress.  But if they seems focus on my kid and if I asked them to stop but they don’t, I would go further.
Our swimming centre banned video and photography for this reason,  if they ignored you and the premises doesn't have that rule. Then sorry to hear that person was disrespectfully and didn't apologise and delete.  Maybe ask of the centre can put that rule in place. Or move to another centre. That's what I'd do.
If you’ve got an ongoing issue you talk to the management of the centre. You asked them they didn’t care. You can’t get in a fight at your kids swim class. Another way of doing it saying “ Is my child in your video? “   So you’re being very clear that your issue is not what they are doing but if it has anything to do with you.
Oops. Your phone fell in the pool.
You’re not overreacting at all! You’re well within your rights to insist that your child isn’t photographed if that’s what you wish. You’re her protector and advocate and you can carry out that responsibility in whichever ways you see fit. Im not a parent but I have a lot of younger family members and understand your hesitance / wariness. Good luck with this, I hope you find a way to resolve it.
I work as a shift manager and lifeguard at a swimming pool and all 3 Rec centres I have worked at have had a no photography policy UNLESS it’s of only your kid and the background is a wall (so no one else is in the photo), so it was mainly allowed so parents could take photos of there kid with there certificate for passing a level. 

Totally understand why this rule exists, because although the parent next to you might not be a creep, doesn’t mean someone else there isn’t, and it shouldn’t be the staffs job to personally inspect every photograph and interrogate how the photographer knows the child in the photo, so instead a blanket rule of no photos helps protect everyone
Depending on the place you have lessons. Most leisure facilities require a consent form from the person taking photos or videos and will agree that they will not take photos or videos of others. You have every right to ask them to stop and public place or not, that doesn’t give them permission.
This from someone who has worked in leisure for 20+ years
All I know is that the people that tend to worry about pedos so openly... tend to have their own demons in the closest.

Vocal people are often projecting and it speaks volumes as to what 'you' would do with photos if this is where your thoughts go.

I say that as someone who is a victim of childhood sexual abuse and other things.
Yes, you are overreacting. Calm down.
Overreacting helicopter parent bullshit. Nobody cares about your kid.
This might be unpopular opinion but it sounds like you're main concern here is your child being sexualised in their swimsuit? If that's the case and its not competitive swimming what about rashies and shirts to cover them up while still being swimming appropriate?

 Should the other parent be taking photos without your consent? Probably not. Can you guarantee they won't? No. Unfortunately cameras are everywhere in our society and you have to assume the moment you step out your front door you could be photographed.
Yes. snap shots in a public space are free for personal use. So snap shots are fine. Unless the facility has banned/restricted them.

Now, if  they are focusing on your child, feel free to complain. You can always take a photo of them and ask the police if this is a person of concerned.



Anyway, they'll soon get photographers regret; "I was there taking the photographs but was not involved with my child".
I don't think your overreacting. I have taken photos of my kids at swimming lessons too, I always block other kids faces if I post it anywhere, because of your exact concern, but you don't know whether this parent would show the same courtesy.
Was the kid nude?, no?, what's the problem? Is being clothed the same as being naked these days?
You are not overreacting. I asked a similar question about parents taking photos in my daughter's beginners ballet class in /r/parents and got absolutely crucified. They tore me to shreds but I checked with the rec centre and it turned out they have the same policy as your pool - the permission of other parents is required to take photos and videos since it's virtually impossible to not get other kids in them. I've since realised this is the policy of almost every facility and school. I ended up mentioning it to the teacher who brought it up at the beginning of the next class and nobody took any more videos or photos with other kids in them with a few harmless exceptions.


It sucks to have to be vigilant but unfortunately due to some of my job I have learned the world is a very dark place with a small, but present minority of bad actors who come in all shapes, sizes and genders.
Yes you’re over reacting.
As a parent of children who are protected by a court order and are not to have their photo listed on any websites. I will 100% warn the other parent twice to stop, 3rd time I’m reporting it to police. 

And yes it happens frequently at the weekend sports.
If something is visible from a public place, it's allowed. A local primary school had an issue with this, where a neighbour was taking photos of the kids - guy got a visit from the police, but legally nothing they could do.   

Swimming pool may or may not be a public place, but regardless the pools policy is what you'd cite.
Blue fit policy at our pool is explicitly no permission unless granted by staff: https://bluefitswimming.com.au/class-policies/
So the facility where I worked had signs around the pool stating to take photos and videos you must have permission from either the supervisor on deck or management. Typically we were completely fine with it because it was the younger children in the kindergarten class and all the parents would be fairly friendly with each other anyway. Every so often you’d get the bad apple that would ruin it for everyone though (which is also why we had to put the signs up in the first place). I’m not sure what the go is in the public recreational centres but in private pools if you have an issue go to the managers and tell them what happened and they should be able to remedy the situation pretty easily.
I wouldn’t like it either. Hope they don’t post it online. Complain to the pool.
i don't think you're over reacting, risk management regarding predators is the reality of the world today.  it's just knowing how to balance it - prevention of unreasonable paranoia and still enjoying life.

i'm pretty sure that there are restrictions of photographing/filming underage kids, particularly in public spaces.  in the very least, if no consent is gained that child/ren must be sufficiently rendered unidentifiable within the image. each state can vary and the legalities can be murky.

 you said      - "website of the facility we have swimming lessons at and it isn't banned, but the person taking videos/photos       must have permission of other kids parents to do so."

was your child captured in those photos?  do you know who took the photos?  regardless, it would pay to inform the facility if you see someone taking photos so that they can deal with it.
No photography allowed in pools! 
There are signs everywhere. 

When we had baby and me classes I would swim away from the rest of the kids so my husband could take a photo of us without anyone else. Still one person got upset about it. My husband showed him the photos, that it was just me and our baby and the guy was chill afterwards. I think he was worried  about someone taking photos of his wife not the baby. 

Now my son is 6 and we haven't taken any photos because he is never alone in the shot. 

Even when I take photos of my son with his classmates or friends I don't know very well, I first ask their parents if it's ok.
[deleted]
They’re correct. It’s a public space and there’s no expectation of privacy in a public swimming pool.
Solution: private lessons.
Sorry you experienced that. What an unkind and thoughtless act by the other person. 

Good luck speaking to management.
Pay for your child to have private lessons then you won't have to worry.
No you’re not overreacting. I would flag it with the school and then ask the other parent to not include your child.
Don't care what anyone else says. You asked them to stop and they should have stopped. Period.

Putting the predator argument or "overreacting" aside, they were rude to you when you asked them to stop and tried to make up an excuse why they could keep going. If another parent tells me they're uncomfortable with me taking pics of my kid with other kids in the background then I STOP. Plain and simple. My kid would have to be doing a triple backflip before I'd keep filming against someone else's request.
Definitely not over reacting, whilst I’m not sure of the legalities involved with it the whole thing is just off.
No, you are not overreacting at all. Children at swimming lessons are in swimsuits and they can be quite revealing, especially when wet and clingy. It’s absolutely inappropriate to take photographs of other people’s children in their swimsuits (even if it’s not a rule at a particular pool - it’s still wildly inappropriate).

Edit, lol here come the downvotes. What a surprise that a social media platform with a large incel population thinks it’s okay to photograph 7yo girls in wet clingy bathers. Jesus
Have you considered that the "security" cameras that are in all these places that you visit while hovering around your kids could just as easily enable these sort of behaviours that your paranoia creates. Get on with life and deal with real problems, if all you have to worry about is the highly unlikely possibility of someone doing something unpleasant with a photo ( could even be a photo of you) things are not really that bad.
It’s people like you that are making this country a nanny state. To me you’re the one sexualising a kid in a swimming suit by being so paranoid of why someone is taking candid photos.
Sounds like you need to contact the facility or post to more social sites.
Overreacting, yes, being aware of your children and others privacy privileges is good etiquette tho
Yes
Hope you don't plan on taking your kids to the beach
I'm probably in the minority here, but I don't give a shit if someone takes photos of my children (within reason). Even on the extremely unlikely chance that someone jerks off to them or makes deepfakes or whatever, as long as no-one knows about it there's minimal risk of any real harm. And there's about 50 billion images of actual naked children or children in fashion catalogues or whatever, I doubt they're interested in mine. 

People let their imagination get away from them and think that pedophiles are trawling some online catalog of children to abduct and mollest or harvest their organs or something.

The truth is that the overwhelming majority of child abuse is perpetrated by parents, step parents, family members, coaches, clergy and group leaders. All people trusted by the child's parents.

Abduction nd/or abuse by complete strangers is vanishingly rare, it's not worth worrying about.

You know what I worry about? My child getting cancer.
The pool my child swims at has a no photography policy, however the reality is that in public spaces there can be no expectation that photos and videos aren't being taken. There's security videos, there's people video chatting and you might be in the background, it's just the reality of the world. Additionally, I realize that I'm putting my child in a bathing suit and taking them into the world, and while 99.9 percent of people are not going to take any notice, yes there may occasionally be a creep around, but there's nothing I can do to prevent that unless I lock my child up and never let them interact with the world. It's a risk I have to live with.

I think the person was rude for not stopping when asked because clearly they were making you uncomfortable and that would have just been the right thing, but they aren't wrong that it's a public place, they are photographing their kid, they aren't interested in yours, they just happen to be in the vicinity. 

Maybe it's important for you to think about what it is that you think was happening that you are not ok with so you can better navigate public spaces with your child. Are you actually concerned that this person is a pedophile that would use those images nefariously or are you just feeling a bit "my rights!"? If you don't want your kids in photos that other people are taking in public because you just don't like not having control of their image then I think that ship has sailed and there's nothing you can do. Every beach, lake, water park, etc is going to have photos being taken. If you need a photo free environment to swim in you're going to need to install your own pool in the backyard.
Pretty sure this is illegal now  ???  Check the laws in your state.
You are not overreacting. This parents behaviour is alarming. Many children are subject to court orders and restraining orders. Photographing and filming any children without consent can put children at serious risk! This needs to stop immediately.
Well school is a public space, but I'm also on the don't take pictures of my kids bandwagon. Specially so photos don't end up on the internet. It's impossible to control though.

So maybe say bring it up at a pta and meanwhile keep a close eye during these kinds of events.
Parent of 3 kids here....and don't shoot me for it....you asked for opinions. I think you're overreacting. 
It's the parent of another kid right??
And as someone else said, not everyone is a predator.
You don't own the outdoors.

But they should have respected your request, given the rules.
Most sexual assaults are committed by family members or close family friends

So unless you're related to the person filming, probably over reacting.
Yes you are overreacting. Who the fuck are you a kardashian? I’m sure any parent who would go through the effort is for the benefit of their own child/family only. If you don’t want your child to be caught in the background footage find a private swimming lesson for you and your child.
I am pretty sure that if someone is taking a video of humans, the humans must sign a release form saying it's ok for them to be filmed and for them to appear in any type of video or photograph media. 

I don't think it's actually legal to just film random people
Do you mean "common sense"? Blasphemy!
The problem is not necessarily that the person taking the video is a predator but everyone these days insists on posting their kids online which means then whether you like it or not your kid gets posted online.
I agree broadly with your view, but I feel uneasy about the "obviously a parent" thing. As a male, as a father, I've had looks.
As someone who used to work in child protection I feel really uncomfortable when people share photos of their kids on social media let alone having some stranger taking photos of kids in bathing suits. 

I realise I’m probably damaged from my work but take my reactions as you will.
A recent report found that around half of all material found on child abuse websites were ripped straight from social media. That means people innocently put up photos/videos of children, and someone in their social network took those photos/videos and reposted them to one of these sites. 

The person taking the photos/videos might not be a predator, but who knows where that media will end up once it’s taken.
It’s got nothing to do with the person being a predator. To bring up a really gross point, disgusting pedophiles literally trawl through sites like Facebook for photos of children and deepfake them on to porn. If a parent isn’t comfortable with a stranger having a photo of their child - and especially if it’s in the rules of the facility to get permission - it should not happen.
Sometimes it’s not about the person taking the photos, but about the kids. I have a family member who used to be a lifeguard and photos were banned at their pool because what if a child is under some sort of protection order?
I totally agree. I’m in the UK at the moment and there is no photography allowed at all at any times in swimming pools at water parks and I find it insanely sad. I just want to capture some precious moments of my kids learning to swim and having fun to keep and one day show their grand parents. To view us all as predators is exceptionally sad and paranoid approach.
It's fine to take a snap of your own kid. However, if it has other identifiable people (i.e. you can see a face or body part that can be used to identify them) as soon you publish or share it (and social media is a form of publication), you cross the line.

What happens if the person in the background is avoiding a violent partner and the post gives away where they are?

The same goes for sharing.  Once it leaves your control, it can go anywhere. 

Just because you can doesn't mean you should.
I believe most people’s view of this will dramatically change when pedophiles access publicly available videos and AI to transpose kids faces onto sex animations.
Whether or not your child is the focus doesn't matter. Ultimately the video will be digested by automated systems and your child will be identified and that footage associated with them forever. If it ever finds its way into the wild, either 'legitimately' or otherwise, you've got the problem you wanted to avoid.
You don’t know if it’s focused on their own child. 

Also, they should have just said “Ok” when asked to stop by another parent with a kid in the same class.  🤷🏻‍♂️

My kids go to a swimming school where no photos are allowed. The entire facility is for teaching only, and is not a public pool whatsoever. I guess that makes it easier to enforce, since everybody is there for a lesson, and there is no public swimming, and you cannot say it’s a public space.
Maybe instead of subscribing we could look at some data?

https://theconversation.com/a-survey-found-1-in-6-men-admit-sexual-feelings-for-children-so-is-paedophilia-increasing-218124

To illustrate; if they post it to their social media, let say they have 600 family and friends, roughly 300 men, that’s about 50 men who are attracted to children that they have shared that image with.
50 is certainly enough for that image to get moved somewhere else, or to be saved, adapted etc.

It’s absurd someone else would be able to make that decision about an image of your child without your consent.
Absolutely right. I will be contacting them tomorrow and requesting a meeting with management. I just want other perspectives as to if I'm just being OTT or if I have a valid point. I dont want to be making demands that are unreasonable. I want to poke some holes in their policy and hopefully get them to change it.
Yep our law does not prohibit anyone photographing in a public space.
That is weak as piss from the swim school. They are just relieving themselves of the responsibility to police it. How the hell can they reasonably expect parents to get permission from every other child’s parent? And as others have pointed out, it is definitely not a public place. When my kids did lessons, their swim school had this rule and enforced it. They also had signs posted around to make it very clear.

Edit to answer your specific question: you are most certainly NOT overreacting!
All commercial pools have policies on phone use. Partially for privacy and partially to stop parents from being distracted on their phones when they’re meant to be supervising young kids.
This. Our swimming pool/school is the same. The lifeguards will tell parents to stop taking photos if it’s clear other kids may be in the backgrounds etc. next time, just tell a staff member and they can step in instead of you. I’m also pretty sure that if you pay an entry fee in to a council or privately owned facility, it is no longer classed as a public space.
The other part of public place is, is there an expectation of privacy. It’s a swim my pool open to the public and likely owned by the public . There is no expectation of privacy in a public pool.
Would like to know what laws you’re basing that comment on about being open to the public but not a public space?
I don’t know that just being a public space would make it ok anyway. I assume public toilets (like at the beach or national park) are considered public space, but you shouldn’t go snapping pics of people in there.
If it is a government owned pool, then it is public and photography in public areas is not against the law.  The signs may not have a legal basis and may not be enforceable.
Brother I don't think it's hysteria to not want other adults to take photos of your half naked children. I get what you're saying but once they have that photo it can and probably will be uploaded online.
I'd be more worried if it was a priest taking photos / video of kids at a church function...
You should be concerned about pedos, they're in all parts of society and year after year we keep hearing about the politicians, celebrities, priests, coaches, Scout leaders etc who are pedophiles.

And we also hear about the huge amount of damage that one's actions can impact and ruin a child's life. Including ample cases of suicide.

Be justifiably vigilant in vulnerable places like bathrooms, change rooms. And especially if an adult is there who doesn't have a child in the group.

But you also have every right to ask a parent to not photograph or film your child regardless. Especially in a private facility.
Pedos frequently lift images of kids swimming, just like OP’s and share them with other pedos all the time. A large percentage of child exploitation images shared amongst pedophiles is “ordinary” content, just like what the other parent was photographing. 
[They absolutely do](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/22/us/instagram-child-influencers.html)

That article is an extremely rough read, but an important one.
The solution here is to take private lessons.
I can't imagine how many less childhood photos I would have if people didn't let my mum take pics at school events, bday parties, sport competitions, school fairs, etc. All those photos of me have other kids in them too - some are my friends and some aren't. But they're fun to look at, especially now 30 years later because society and fashion changes so much. Imagine if every picture was me and only me at a cropped angle. That would be boring
You don't know OP isn't a Russian spy masquerading as an Argentinian diplomat so it might be compromising!
So, someone doesn't want you taking a photo of their child, and your reaction is to become hostile. You accuse them of "sucking the enjoyment out", and you start calling them names. ... What's up with that? Can't you just respect their wishes? Do you really need to take photos of their kids at a swimming lesson?
Okay but now other people's children are posted on your social media or out to your friends and family and that video or photo ends up online for the world to see and ends up in some paedophiles possession no it's simple take photos and videos of your child without others in it it's honestly not that hard
Not many people - look on Instagram at comments and also 1 in 5 kids are sexually abused (if not more). How would you know
I agree with you
It’s not hard. Just went through my camera roll and none of my pics have the instructor except one where she took a selfie with the kids. And very few kids in the background
> but the sad reality most people are blissfully ignorant about how many predators there actually are

Probably a lot less than you imagine. There are as many as there always were. Facebook hysteria just makes people more scared.
>The guy

They never mentioned the gender of the filmer
Exactly - you’re from a different time. It’s a different world and the kinds of abuse kids face from digital images online is an entirely different thing. What if that picture of you was doctored to put your face in a rape video then spread online, or shared amongst your high school peers? You’d still be ok with it? Privacy matters, ffs, we don’t have the luxury of taking it for granted anymore!
Keep in mind that r/parents is very American-centred and has a lot of people who are very scared of strangers.
I get permission first and will only take pictures of my child in awards ceremony and I am willing to show any that I do take
Why did you gender the parent for no reason at all with no information about their gender?
In a burka. 

With a robot coach.
Or a substantial amount of parents who think they should be able to capture memories of their children. Your assumption that the photos are nefarious is flawed.
> Edit, lol here come the downvotes. What a surprise that a social media platform with a large incel population thinks it’s okay to photograph 7yo girls in wet clingy bathers. Jesus

You are the one who sexualised it. Maybe look in the mirror.
Why do you like saying "wet clingy" so much. It's in your other comment too.

Sicko.
then you'll be very surprised when you find out the actual truth
Common sense would be asking for permission to take pictures at the swimming lesson.
Assuming every parent everywhere always posts snaps of their kids on social media.  

If I was asked by a parent to stop taking pics of my two kids in swimming lessons then I would stop without apologising. But until then I am taking pics and videos of *my* kids and sending them to their nonna (who doesn’t use social media because old)
Let’s not forget about how childcare centres these days  take daily  photos of children and post on the app for all parents to see . I can’t really stop other parents from  posting those photos online which may have image of my child but when can I say . We live in a very strange world, there is really no privacy .
Offenders aren’t focusing on the background kid in the swimming video.
So what? Do you think pedos are so starved for content that they are desperate for pictures of kids doing sporting activities?

Absolute paranoid hysteria.
Also, the parent taking the photos might be fine. But what if her husband, or one of their siblings or cousins or uncles or a friend of a friend is a predator? All of a sudden those images could be shared in global CP networks.
I ran into this when my teenage son was playing soccer. He was looking into a soccer academy, and they wanted photos AND video of him playing. I had access to a really good video camera - not quite movie or broadcast TV quality, think "prosumer"-grade.

So I had to take photos of him playing, and short videos. But to get the "short" videos, i.e. the best shots of him moving, manouvering, etc, I had to shoot a lot and edit down to 10-second shorts.

So I looked it up - there's a Qld Govt website that has a list of guidelines, dos-and-don'ts for people taking photos and video of their children at sporting events. I've lost the link, but it could be Justice Dept, or Sports Dept. It's OK to do so, and it's OK to have incidental images of other children in the shot.

But it's pretty much a case of common sense, and courtesy. Ask permission of the club, don't go into changing rooms with a camera, inform the referee, inform both coaches. If anyone else's parent/s object, then explain why you're doing it, and that you've sought permission from the club, etc. But if they \*really\* object, don't push the issue, take it up with the club. The committee can put out a newsletter clarifying the matter.

It was mostly OK, but one opposition team coach was absolutely convinced it was illegal. Not just "I'd rather you didn't", but "That's illegal and you'll be reported". Wasn't even his home ground. I told him was for the academy, and showed him a printout of the website guidelines, but he was adamant, so I didn't do any filming that day. It wasn't about me, and I had plenty of other opportunities.
Unfortunately I just get my wife to take photos of the kids playing in public. Gets less greasy looks and assumptions of being a pedo. Male privilege.
Dont think you're overreacting, check the comments on Instagram videos of kids doing shit like gymnastics and swimming, pedos fuckin everywhere.


The amount of accounts "reaching out" to the kids is actually terrifying.
If you look at my limited social media I am not married and don’t have kids.
Sounds like a smart Predator doesn't even have to risk themselves, just scrape social media. Probably only those that get a thrill from taking a risk would still try it.
Not only photos but the locations as well.
That’s why you lock your Facebook.
Yes you should read the data. In future, please click through to the underlying study and actually read it rather than the headline. (Assuming you’re not a bot)

Always sense check things that seem absurd. Do you actually think 15% of the male population has sexual feelings for children or do you think maybe the headline is presenting an interpretation that is designed to get clicks?

For what it’s worth, our center has multiple signs up around the place saying “STRICTLY NO PHOTOGRAPHY” so you’re not out of place at all.
No you’re not being OTT. People who peddle out the “it’s not illegal to take photos of others even after they have asked me to stop” in a situation like this are the gross ones. I don’t care if it’s not illegal, if someone has asked you to stop, you stop.
Imo you aren’t being unreasonable. 

My ex and I don’t allow pics of our kids to be shared online and have asked family not to put our kids on Facebook before. 

It’s disturbing to think about but the reality is online pics of your kids can be, maybe already have been, used to train AI. I’m extremely uncomfortable with what the future holds in this regard. It might sound over dramatic now but I can absolutely see ai generated child porn being a thing and the last thing I’d want is for my kids pics to be part of the training data for that AI. Not to mention there’s already plenty of nefarious shit online that doesn’t involve AI. Someone might upload a seemingly harmless pic of their kids in swimmers to Facebook and be unaware that the pics end up in some sick fucks collection of young kids.
‘I don’t want to be over the top, so I’m going to request a meeting with management rather than raise it informally with the swim teacher next time there’s a class.’
It’s very reasonable to take it up with management. Unfortunately there are a lot of adults out there who simply don’t understand why photographing other people’s kids in wet clingy swimsuits is inappropriate. It’s one of those situations where the pool needs to set the rules.
For what it’s worth, my local library prohibits video without a permit which I 100% agree with. Technically a public space, but they’re serious about child protection and people’s privacy . 
People don't care about your kid, really your child is an annoying addition to the video they are trying to take of their kid. They are probably just as disappointed as you are that your kid is in the pictures. 
Maybe don't take your kid to places where there are other kids, as it is likely someone will take a photo at some point. Perhaps keep them in one of this plastic bubbles at your house, let them experience the world once they are 35
As you found out it was against their rules so at the time you could’ve spoken to staff and they would have been able to do something. Now though it’s probably too late, although they might have a word with the parent next time.

But even if it wasn’t against the rules, I don’t think it would be unreasonable to ask the parent to blur/remove your child from any of the photos if they’re going to post them online.
If this happens again, you should be able to mention it to the lifeguard on duty or the reception staff. 
Absolutely not over the top. You shouldn’t have to have your kid photographed by others as a condition of your kid swimming or participating in lessons. 
You're going over the top with management. This person isn't going to delete the photos and video of their kids. And you've got no right to ask.

Now having said that, you now know the rules of the place. If it happens again, go to management. Confront the individual *next time*.

What do you think going to the pool management, because you weren't informed of the rules *until after the fact... that's your problem* is going to achieve?

The cops are going to go kicking down the door of someone who is filming their own kid (s) because some nutter took offence?

And that's what you'll look like. A nutter.

**But** if it happens again, that's different *now you are aware of the rules*.

The top comment is *not all people are predators*. Maybe take a breath.
How is a privately owned pool a public space?
But a swimming facility is not a public space really. That’s the catch 21
And even when it's a public space, that doesn't mean it's ok to take pictures of other peoples children!
If there are conditions of entry (seperate to state laws) and management has the right to remove you for not adhering to those conditions then it’s likely not a public space.
How is not not intuitive or common sense? You pay to gain access to a pool. Yeah it's open to the public to access but it isn't a public space. You are bound by their rules and conditions and they can tell you to leave or ban you. Like any other shop or business. 
Restaurants are open to the public, but they can ask you to leave. Similarly the pool would be on a property that is not public and the company who owns or rents it can tell people to leave.
If it’s private property the owner of the property can set the rules about filming.

https://lawpath.com.au/blog/legal-film-public-places
Firstly you need to understand that it can be kinda complicated, I don't know the laws and I'm not a solicitor, I could be using the incorrect terms as well. 

Firstly let's understand what I mean by "open to the public". Open to the public is a space that is in general private spaces that are open to the public, such as a bar, restaurant, shop, shopping centre and could include things like recreational facilities and even gardens and parks, and these may include spaces that are managed by the government but usually they are managed by companies whether it is a nonprofit organisation or a for profit organisation.

Now public spaces are areas that in general are managed by the government for the free use and enjoyment of the general public at large. For example streets, footpaths, hiking paths are usually public spaces.

Now in regards to what laws, well there's a lot of them, trespass laws would be one of the big ones, but I don't know those laws like the back of my hand, but as I understand it you can't exactly be trespassed from a public space, police can issue a move on order that orders you out of the space but that's a police order not a trespass order so it's different. 

I'm sure there are other laws, probably laws that give councils their authority, same with laws that give states and the commonwealth their powers as they are the ones that usually manage public spaces. 

Essentially it comes down to who exactly controls the land / facility as to if it's a public space or private space that is open to the public. Additionally, private spaces that are open to the public may have additional terms and conditions of use and or entry, such as limits or bans on videography and photography.
I think they're referring to if the business is private property. Open for public use but it is privately owned. Different rules apply.
Nah those are bathrooms, different laws apply. 

The beach is a public space most of the time, but again kids enjoy additional privacy protections under the law that likely don't make it legal. 

Morally it's wrong.
The pool is run by my local council. The signs are totally enforceable as they form part of the conditions of entry. There are also signs prohibiting taking in glass bottles.
Yeah naa I work at a public pool, we've called cops and they've escorted people out for stuff like this when it escalates.
The rules are enforceable in the sense that they can used to deny access to particular people in the future, even if violating the rules isn't "against the law".
The difference is that when I was a kid there was no social media, not sure if this applies to you. Photos were taken and printed and put in a photo album not plastered all over the internet. I wouldn’t want someone taking photos of my kid and putting them on social media because I’d like to protect my child’s privacy and data as much as possible. 
Intent matters, despite what you seem to think. Most parents are not interested in your kids, a lot of people take phots/videos for memories and not to post them on social media.

I am all for getting rid of predators, but effectively accusing another parent in your child's swimming class of being one is not going to end well.
Yeah but usually they’re kept to show grandparents or on the parents private Facebook or insta which will 9/10 only be seen by friends and family. There’s millions of child influencers and sus child photo accounts to choose from so I doubt it will ever be found unless they’re an influencer.
What?

Anyone can take a photo of your child and you won't ever know. 

How about not worrying about the super transparent family in front of you that you KNOW are innocent and worry about the ones you don't see.
>that video or photo ends up online for the world to see and ends up in some paedophiles possession

And then what? Does the child suffer spiritual damage because some pedo in America has a wank?
There's always been more than people think there are.
True, I assumed, my mistake now corrected. Thank you
Yeah I think context makes a difference too. In my case a it was a ballet class for 5 year olds at a rec centre and since they're beginners they don't have all the right gear like tights, so some of them have their bums out which is all fine until parents start taking pictures.
It’s not the photos that are nefarious, it’s that parents these days love to overshare and post everything online. The pools are a private facility and permission needs to be asked to film/take others pictures.
No one thinks anyone is being “nefarious”. Regardless of the photo taker’s personal intent, the act of photographing someone else’s kids in their wet bathing suits is just so gross and inappropriate. The reason why pools need to create rules is because there are unfortunately parents out there who simply don’t think this through.

FYI most pools my kids have swum at just have a “no photographs” rule, full stop. I’ve seen lifeguards ask parents to put their phone cameras away. This is not a few fringe Karens complaining - it’s actually fairly standard for pools to prohibit this. The Reddit weirdos who think photographing kids in swimsuits is okay are the fringe weirdos here.
Because that’s exactly what makes the photographing totally inappropriate. I’m not a “sicko”, I’m a mother to young children. Some of the commenters on here appear to need it pointed out to them why it’s incredibly inappropriate to take photos of other people’s kids in this situation. (The people who don’t get this are the sick ones.)

I’m at the swimming pool with my kids twice a week and I understand exactly what OP is concerned about. Thankfully our main pool has a “no photographs” sign so it’s not a problem for us.
No, asking permission would be courtesy. Common sense is abiding by the conditions of entry and use.
[deleted]
Common sense tells us the earth is flat - Albert Einstein
Common sense is realising most people have no idea who 95% of the other people in there are and its impractical to take a survey of the full crowd so a happy compromise is to try your best to take photos of your own kid and respect the requests of anyone who does approach you.
I videod and took a couple of snaps of my 3 year old in her lesson last week as she had improved so much and I wanted to show her how fast she was going. She has asked to watch her fast kicking video every day since, she was thrilled I noticed her improvement and so proud of herself. 

No social medial posts or sharing, just for the benefit of my kiddo. She will probably ask to show her grandparents next time we see them. 

If someone had asked me to stop filming I would have been confused by the fuss, but compliant.

I just rewatched the video due to this post, yes there are other children in the video background, only their heads above water and with goggles and swimming caps - no possibility they could be identified.

I feel like I must have an innocent mindset, it just never crossed my mind this could be an issue (obviously also with knowing the context of why I took the pic/video).
[deleted]
Every year I tick the box that says I do not consent to my child’s image being posted
Lol did you not pay attention to the clause covering that in the enrollment form?

I can tell you legally they have needed them for years. When I worked in the industry we knew which children were allowed and who wasn't and all pictures were screened before being posted
They have to ask for your consent first.
Some days my child gets tagged when not even in. I think ours have got lazy. TBH I never bother looking anymore as it usually involves scrolling through about 20 photos to find one with your actual child in.
As I understand that many childcare keep the photo's behind a logon.  (How secure will depend on the childcare)
that's not necessarily true. predators will hone in on whoever they want to.  unfortunately we live in a time when this is a real risk.  the trick is finding the sweet spot of risk mitigation and freedom of enjoying normal activities.
No. I worked in child protection. It’s not paranoid BS.
Unfortunately it is average stuff like sporting activities that ends up with pedophiles. 

I know someone who works in workers comp claims for police and they've seen reports come in from those that work on child abuse cases and my friend was shocked by the amount of 'normal' social media content of kids that ends up in those big child sex abuse image troves.
It’s not just about fucking pedos dude. I don’t post my kids photos online for a bunch of reasons and no cunt has the right to do it without my permission.
Starved for content? No. You’d probably be surprised at the volume of images and videos of kids doing sporting activities that are used in child exploitation, often lifted from what parents or others have shared on social media. It’s very common for predators to use and share ordinary photos for child exploitation reasons. That’s why it’s prudent not to share images and fairly sensible to not have your child photographed in a bathing suit by people you don’t trust. 
As a complete side step to the topic at hand, your assumption that the other parent was a woman I find interesting:) Nowhere does it specify gender for either parent.  Also if it was a dad taking photos of their kid does it change anything?  It shouldn't, it's their kid as much as the mother's. I know in practice this changes it a bit, poor dad's as 99.9 percent are just that, dad's.

Thanks. I don’t think I am either.
As someone who doesn't do Instagram, I have to ask: what the hell are comments? Surely people aren't announcing that they're pedos.
I can understand that.
Yep. That doesn’t really cover the other people who have photos with your kids in them though which is the whole issue raised here.
Yeah we didn't think and first baby swim class we excitedly took a photo (carefully with zero other child in the shot) and got told off. Definitely not allowed.
My dad doesn't get why my partner and I don't allow our kids to be posted online or ourselves for that matter. And while your reasoning for your decision is partly the same as ours there's also a more simple reason also, we don't want our kids on fucking Facebook. One family for a birthday or Christmas, that's it. There's always someone out of joint in the family (mother in law usually) if something is happening with the grand kids and she's not involved. 

My dad is a prolific oversharer typical Facebook boomer. Always wanting to show all his Facebook friends how"interesting" his life is. When our first was born, we saw my parents first cause they were closest to the hospital on the way home and we just wanted to get it over and done with. He takes a photo holding the new born which is fine, I told him "wait two days before you post it, we haven't even told our best friends the kid is born yet." Driving home, my partners phone is already blowing up from their mum... thanks dad. I haven't sent him a photo of either of the kids in 4 plus years.  
A Victorian man was sentenced to prison last week for creating and sharing AI-generated CSAM, so regrettably it's already a thing.

I hate to break it to you - but this is already happening: [https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-06-11/bacchus-marsh-grammar-explicit-images-ai-nude/103965298](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-06-11/bacchus-marsh-grammar-explicit-images-ai-nude/103965298)
It’s a child protection issue and it’s appropriate to raise it with management. 
Are you really annoyed that this person doesn’t want their child wearing a bathing suit in someone’s camera reel? I don’t feel like this is unreasonable.
>People don't care about your kid, really your child is an annoying addition to the video they are trying to take of their kid. They are probably just as disappointed as you are that your kid is in the pictures.

Perhaps keep them in one of this plastic bubbles at your house, let them experience the world once they are 35

That's the dumbest thing I've ever read u/Past_Alternative_460
I don't think you realise how prevalent child predators actually are - and once those videos and images have been posted online anyone can see, save, edit and whatever else with them and it's completely outside of your control. 

Additionally, most children who are sexually assaulted are known to their abuser. That parent could have a pile of videos of children in swimsuits that later turns out to be part of a huge stash of CP. 

Even if the actual parents doing the filming aren't doing it with that intent, those consuming the content later very likely could be, and can also use the knowledge of where that swim school is to begin following and profiling kids prior to making contact with them. They can use that knowledge as a way to build trust. 

There's a range of reasons why people shouldn't be allowed to just film kids in swimsuits without the parents' permission, and most of them are very reasonable and good parenting.
Hey, if you have a problem with the law, speak to your MP, I don’t make laws - these rules have been made by common law judges over centuries. Anyway, the law is beside the point here - the point (as the comments above have already said) is that this is a matter of common sense and common politeness, not law.
Our law only differentiates between private homes and public places. There’s no catch 22 from a legal perspective. But that’s beside the point - people really should just have a bit of common sense and be considerate of other people. If someone says please don’t photograph my children, they should stop. Personally I don’t mind people taking photo or two of their children when they are in a group, but boomer grandparents who live stream a group activity, and influencer mummies who take videos to put on instagram, they annoy me.
Won't it have to be something like a club that has exclusive memberships like gyms, clubs, tenants, etc ... but if anyone can come in from the street, pay a fee or not, then it's basically public? What's the test?
>How is not not intuitive or common sense?

2 reasons

1) people are idiots
2) people are idiots and they listen to other idiots who spew legal BS from other countries such as the US.
Because most people think they have rights they actually don’t have.

And generally speaking there’s very few places that give rise to our expectation of privacy under the law.
Cops often don't know the law on public photography.  Watch some "auditing" videos on you tube.  There aren't many in Aus but there are quite a few from England that has similar laws.  The police often get it very wrong.

I have had an encounter with a police officer in Aus who thought he could just demand my ID for nothing.  You have to be suspected of a crime or  be driving a car to be required to give ID here.

There is an episode of Bondi Beach where cops tell a photographer he cant take pictures in public, when it is a completely lawful thing to do.
Not if it is a public place.  You can only be trespassed from public if you break a law. For example if you assault someone.  Its different for privately owned places.

Rules are not laws.  Police may try to enforce rules as many police don't know the law well,  but they would then be breaking the law, and subject to complaints an possible legal action.

The police may also be aware of the law but try to get you to do what they want by lying about the law.  Most people don't know the law so this kind of bluffing usually works.
I'm 37, so yes, it was the same for me. But also not every parent these days in social media obsessed and there's no indication the person OP was talking about was going to post them online. I have a friend who has kids, I have never seen a single picture of them on FB. Everyone is different
OP has never said they were a predator, its okay not to want someone posting pictures of your kid online, you dont need to think that parent is a predator to not want them doing that.
I think its totally okay not to want your kids picture taken or for your child not to want there picture taken by anyone whether they are a predator or not, but I just wanna check, how do you KNOW this parent is innocent?
I think OP said photos were allowed under specific circumstances, for all we know the photos could have been focused on their own children without the other children being recognizable or even included, If OP had of handled it better, they could have discussed it with the other parent, ascertained what their intentions were and seen what was in the photos, instead they assumed they were right, confronted the other parent and now have created a situation over something that is more than likely completely harmless.
OP should go to one of those pools then, given the pool she is at allows it... You have no idea that the parent mentioned was even taking photos of anyones children but their own, as most people do/would. 

The fact that the automatic assumption here is that a parents photos may inadvertently end up in a predators hands is the problem. The photos werent posted anywhere that we know of and the entirety of the accusation is that they were taking photos of their own kids...

This is the case of a few Karens complaining from my perspective.
Conditions literally say permission is required. From OP:
> it isn't banned, but the person taking videos/photos must have permission of other kids parents to do so.
Literally the opposite of common sense.  Common sense is ignoring everyone else's fine print and sticking to what very obviously appropriate or not.
It isn't that simple. You may not think that but still be raised in a culture that thinks of it as inappropriate for thousands of years. As much as some people wish, you can't just magically turn off that stuff. It doesn't mean you "see kids sexually" if it crosses your mind.
That’s literally the second sentence????
I really can’t believe that’s even a box you have to tick. Surely the blanket rule should be don’t post children on the internet and if they really need it for something there should be a consent form for that specific event
Yes I am aware of that, I do tick the box that I don’t want my child photos to be shared on social media . That’s the condition between me and the childcare and I wasn’t blaming childcare at all . It doesn’t stop other parents from  posting photos of their child which may or may not have image of my child though .
My kids swim school has a simple policy where one of the staff will take your phone and get photos and video of just the child in question and no parent is allowed to record.

It's a good middle ground
Thank you for your contribution to the protection of our innocent. It’s invaluable but obviously very difficult work that should be appreciated by the rest of us. 

Considering your expertise, would you mind settling a moral dilemma for me? I recently was told a story by someone I know about a roommate they had 15 years or so ago who is a criminal know to police for drug related offences. This roommate was in possession of CP but my friend (who is on the autism spectrum) was young, intimidated and didn’t realise that the appropriate course of action at the time would have been to report it to the police, even though they were disgusted and highly disturbed by the discovery. 

Now that I know this, I feel morally obligated to report it myself but I’m not sure how to go about it or if it will even be taken seriously as I was not personally witness to the CP or know my friend’s roommate. My friend wishes they had reported it back then but don’t feel capable of doing it themselves and have given me all the details they can remember to report it for them. 

Am I overthinking this? Should I just be going into my closest police station? This happened in a suburb over an hour away from me though.
You’re exposed to the worst in society on the daily so I’d say you’re view is massively skewed
No one seems to remember the Victorian schools rowing fiasco about 20 years ago. Whole website devoted to boys in rowing suits, all under 18. Some of my friends had hundreds of photos on the website.

Most photos taken with long lenses from the shore clearly in a clandestine manner but many also at regattas from the crowd.
>and no cunt has the right to do it without my permission.

Except they do.

If you're in a public space, under most circumstances anyone can take a photo of anything and that photo is then their intellectual property and they can post it wherever they like.

There are some caveats, but very few.
Oh yeah, I was initially planning to be gender neutral, I was writing on the run though and slipped into conditioned thinking. Also, I dated someone who had a female friend whose husband's brother turned out to be a paedophile, so that probably coloured my thinking and phrasing too. 

But yes, the vast majority of men aren't child abusers, and some women are.
"It wasn't about me" means that I wasn't going to make a fuss about it, diverting attention from the most important thing - the game that was about to start.

As far as listening to someone who's wrong - you pick your battles. And I never had to deal with that guy again. He was being a prick about it and it wasn't worth my energy - I've got better things to spend it on, and not drag myself down to his level.
You are not
Regrettably, [they are](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/22/us/instagram-child-influencers.html)
Is she 100% sure her kids are in the photos? At age 7, lessons usually focus on individual turns at swimming. You can zoom in on your child in the pool without other kids surrounding them, because they are doing their lap alone with the instructor while the other kids wait.
Haha we did the same but no one told us off, we were pretty careful to only get my husband and son though. I do think they should give that opportunity to a first time lesson, to offer a close up shot with/without a parent and no one else in the shot.
Weird way to say greatest thing but ok
> Additionally, most children who are sexually assaulted are known to their abuser.

Just to this point, I doubt a random parent is classed as "known."

Known is more in reference as having positions of trust and exclusive access to the child.
Put it this way, most places under a roof are not public.
We're talking about getting swimming lessons at a pool. Do you think the instructors are legally required to continue allowing someone to come for swimming lessons regardless of any broken rules?

In any case, if we're going down that kind of "you can't make me do it" reasoning then we're going to end up in a crap place for everyone.
To be fair, it's Australia. I'm nearly certain they can find a law that the person has broken, and then they get to go to court and find out how relevant the law is if they want to.
What do you think the implication of confronting them is? The OP does not even know specifically what is in the photos. The most likely scenario is that their kid was barely in them, there was no assertion that the focus was on anything but the person taking photos of their own kids.
Of course it is, doesn't mean I can't judge your paranoid mentality.

By your logic, you'd have to think EVERY adult around your child is potentially a paedophile.

Every teacher, day care operator, doctor, dentist, swimming teacher...

Where does it start and end? For me a tell tale sign is, if someone is having fun as a family, the likelihood of them been a risk is almost zero.
Please. We live in a digital age when many people sync their photos to the cloud. Even if you don’t have cloud syncing AI is reading our images on our iPhones to enable the new keyword search feature. There are examples already of data companies misusing people’s data for all kinds of purposes. There was recently a story in the news about images of Aussie kids being scraped to feed AI algorithms.    It’s a crazy digital world we’re living in.
Given we only have OPs paraphrasing of what the conditions actually are, my guess would be permission would be needed to take photos of other people's kids. Taking a photo of  your own kid that happened to have someone else's kid in it is different to taking photos of other kids. At least that's how I'd see it.
How did I miss that
This isn't how I've found its presented. It has always been a form requesting permission, at both school and kinder. If you don't fill it out, then they don't have permission.

We generally give permission because it's just private apps for the school/daycare. You get occasional updates of your kid in the sand pit or whatever excursion they were on.

If it's for actual social media / advertising, then there is an entirely different permission form explicitly stating that.
Then you would never end up with photos of your child in the app so you can't discuss what happened at school that day (keeping in mind kids 3 and under are pretty shit at telling you what happened today).
I have a question, as a person who posts kindy photos on facebook for family; I post photos that other children are in but will place big, usually flower, emojis over any other kids faces in the photo - as well as any centre logos... in your opinion, is this okay? Or should I stick to only sharing ones with just my child in them? (This may seem like a really obvious-answer question, but I am on the spectrum and also have severe anxiety so I've never even spoken to any other parents at the centre, let alone, been able to ask for their perspective lol)
Thank you. 

My state has the Child Abuse Report Line. I’d assume others are similar. Maybe you can sit with the person while they call, or support them in another way. 

The call is taken and it is given a rating as to how serious it seems. Resources mean many reports don’t get investigated. It could corroborate other reports. 

For your own piece of mind reporting is probably a good idea.
Maybe, Ive got ptsd so it certainly took its toll, but it also comes from seeing shit others thankfully don’t have to eh. 

It’d be a brave person to discount experience and just put it down to overexposure.
Except that in this case the swim centre has a policy of no photos and in my case I would tell the person taking the first photo not to do it and no one has ever refused
Thank you. And your other comment. Much appreciated.
Jesus… She doesn’t know. That’s the point. It is the rules of the facility that parents are supposed to get permission for that exact reason.
If the kid sees that parent on a semi regular basis (which they likely would if they're in a regular swimming lesson with their child), they are familiar to them. Familiarity breeds trust. It means that they have opportunities over time to engineer a situation where they can be alone with the kid. Not exactly a random parent in this scenario.
They dont want someone posting pictures of their child online.
People can sell data about your kids on the darkweb that's been gathered from photos.
How many people do you think have been murdered or raped or sexually assaulted by someone they KNEW were innocent?
Now you are stretching to someones phone might get hacked or photos on someones phone might be misused? If your position is your child's photo shouldn't be in anyone's possession but your own, I need to explain the way modern surveillance and the privacy laws in Australia work...

but seriously, letting your kids grow up thinking like that is problematic, it will rub off on them, they will see shadows at every corner it isnt healthy.
>Taking a photo of your own kid that happened to have someone else’s kid in it is different to taking photos of other kids

In both scenarios the parent would be capturing images containing other people’s children, so I don’t really see the logic behind assuming you’d only need permission for the latter.
I think it is very considerate of you to put something over other kids faces in the photos . I wouldn’t be upset over that at all .
Thank you for your good advice. I will find the number and sit with my friend while they make the call.
Yeah for real, "this person has experience in the field, so we'd better disregard their opinion and perspective " is crazy work
> Except that in this case the swim centre has a policy of no photos

Which is something the swim centre has the option to enforce, not you. Even then, depending on the nature of the facility they may only have the right to remove the person. 

> and in my case I would tell the person taking the first photo not to do it and no one has ever refused

The fact thar people have willingly done something doesn't mean they have to or that you have the power to enforce.
So very welcome
Permission to film with other children (OP’s child) in the background. You can film only your child. You can let the parent know the child isn’t in the video by showing them. 

The intent is to film their own child, not other people’s children. If OP wants zero filming around their child, then she should pay for private lessons. You can’t go around telling parents they can’t film their own children. Ask to see the video or tell them to make sure your child isn’t in the video. Jesus. It’s not hard to communicate, but just going off at a happy parent and telling them they can’t film their own kid isn’t going to work. Pay for private lessons.
I guess they should never take their child out of the house then.
If you are worried about that give up now, you have no right to privacy in public places in Australia, every time you leave your house with your child they can be photographed legally.
As said, you can live paranoid or you can communicate, get to know people and make judgements, you know, as humans are meant to in a collaborative and social society.

Or you can judge and assume with no knowledge and live your life with demons in every corner.

Yes people are sexually assaulted by people they know, I know it happens, but you've jumped from a photo to SA, last I checked you can't SA a photo.
Statistically the biggest risk to the kids safety is a parent. The biggest thing you can do to protect your kids is seek therapy and understand toxic mind sets.
Awesome. Thank you :)
Good luck with things, sorry you and your friend are having to deal with this.
Oh it’s pretty easy to enforce

Also just because it’s a swim centre doesn’t make it in public even if it is council owned, it’s can still be legally regarded as private property
Youre the one making assumptions, youre the one who claims to KNOW this person is innocent.
>Oh it’s pretty easy to enforce

Again, you have no legal rights to enforce this unless you're planning on committing assault in which case enjoy prison.

>Also just because it’s a swim centre doesn’t make it in public even if it is council owned, it’s can still be legally regarded as private property

A swim centre may or may not be considered private property. Being private property does not mean that you have an expectation of privacy. It does mean that the owner of the property *may* be able to enforce *some* conditions of entry.

The owner of the property is not you.
What’s more likely? That the family taking photos of their kid in a swimming lesson is ACTUALLY a family of pedophiles enacting some secret plot to take photos of your child, using their own kid as an decoy, in order to post them online? Or that they are just taking photos of their kid for their own memories?

Sure you don’t KNOW for certain which one is the case but there are plenty of minuscule risks and odds that you need to accept in life, or else you’d just stay inside wrapped in bubble wrap all the time.
Yeah, I said if I saw a family at my swimming lessons, creating a memory of the child learning to swim, 100% I'd assume that's innocent and would not bat an eye. It's happened and I haven't cared.

If I saw someone who didn't have a child in that lesson, I'd have a problem.

The difference and reasons for the assumption of trust is pretty obvious.

Those aren't the only 2 options and I don't think anyone is even saying the first one. You can want someone not to take pictures of your child without believing they are a pedophile.
I was SA’d as a child during swimming lessons so I agree with u/specularblinky that there’s no way you can assume innocence
