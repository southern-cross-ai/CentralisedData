It‚Äôs getting ridiculous 
What‚Äôs a good chilli price for you?
Never buy in them little packets, grab a hand full of fresh & freeze them for later
Hot take
What till OP finds out that [saffron](https://www.woolworths.com.au/shop/productdetails/170748/masterfoods-pure-saffron) is $59&#8239;600/kg.
Go to an Asian grocery store, you can buy about 400g frozen Thai chilis for the same amount.
They are out of season, grow your own and dry them it‚Äôs super easy.
Unnecessary plastic = $3.50. Chilli = 30¬¢
Is this just advertisment for ColesWorth?! Because that's what you're doing.
A few people are clowning on OP but these are [sixty cents each](https://www.woolworths.com.au/shop/productdetails/136510/woolworths-red-cayenne-chilli-medium-) loose and it's pretty annoying when only the packaged ones are left
Then buy them singularly. People who buy them buy them for convenience.
Why the fuck would you buy these in a plastic container? Deserving to be ripped off.
I hope you didn't buy it,  you can buy some poor man siracha (pantai brand) for that price
Literally just grow them, I have been growing chillis outside in Tasmania for 3 years now, I dont look after them I don't care for them I just check every few months and ill get about 30+ of the cunts from one plant I just have a clear bit of plastic above it so frost doesn't kill it
Small volume things often have a high price by the kg.
They're sixty cents each loose ([source](https://www.woolworths.com.au/shop/productdetails/136510/woolworths-red-cayenne-chilli-medium-)) so these are about 60% more expensive just for the plastic container
I pay a dollar for around 40 chilis at my Indian grocer and freeze them. I don't understand why people shop at Coles/Woolies for fresh produce.

I find my chillies grow year round, but are a bit small and munted in winter.


Still good though.
Yea not all of us have backyards to grow things
Is it stealing if you take them out of the plastic and scan them individually?¬†

It‚Äôs not like bacon from the deli vs prepackaged stuff because it‚Äôs the same product
So.. the plastic prices are getting ridiculous?
Yes but having to dedicate an entire room just for Saffron is where they get you .
You can grow them quite well in a pot on the windowsill inside as well. So long as they get good sun
Mine dropped its leaves and went dormant mid June. Can feel the days getting longer again so there‚Äôs light at the end of the tunnel for chilli enthusiasts
Get a cheap cold-frame for them and cover overnight and they should get a little bigger.
True, it‚Äôs expensive to be poor. I used to grow mine on my balcony before I went bush
Don‚Äôt need a backyard‚Ä¶they grow pretty happily in pots as long as you keep the water to them
I grew mine in pots in a courtyard and at a different place on a balcony. 

You can also do them indoors in a windowsill if they get enough light. 

But sure what‚Äôs the next excuse?

Edit: tomatoes grow under much the same conditions as hot peppers. Spinach and silver beet also do very well in containers. Plus spring onions (I planted the root/white parts from store bought and they‚Äôre going insane), parsley, basil and chives are all doing well in random pots or yoghurt containers with a $10 worth of dirt from Bunnings all in my east-facing kitchen window.     In my current place I‚Äôve dropped maybe $40 total on pots, dirt and fertiliser and while I‚Äôm clearly not *feeding* myself from windowsills, I‚Äôm getting some peppers, one tomato so far, handfuls of greens for salads and herbs that I haven‚Äôt had to buy ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
As they should be.
mine grew well first potted, then no more flowers... i have given it some blood and bone and moved it to a sunnier spot, so hoping it will not be beginners luck
Find something high in Phosphorus - it‚Äôs what helps flowers develop. 

Once flowers have developed use a toothbrush and gently nudge them to fertilise.
Yep. Coffee grounds work great.
