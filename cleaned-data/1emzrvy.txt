I know that there is a global shortage of cocoa, the ABC did a story on it in March this year. I'm just wondering if anyone else having trouble getting their hands on it?

I've been to several shops in Brisbane and they are all out of stock.
Supply hasn't eased yet:

You might have luck if you go to an independent delicatessen (as opposed to one in a supermarket). They usually sell European foods. It might cost a little more because it's an independent shop, but they'll usually have something. Years ago, when there was a Nutella shortage, I told people to go to a proper deli. Plenty of alternatives. Or, a Dutch or German food shop, if you can't find a deli. I'm half Dutch.
Last I checked Australia is part of the globe...
Thank you, quite helpful
Cocoa Powder has a rather long shelf life, so if a business has stored inventory (could be they anticpated the shortage or itâ€™s just not selling as quickly here) than said global shortage would not effect them yet
We have smartie pants over here.. Just because there is a  global shortage doesn't mean every country is affected the same. I.e global orange shortage, we are a net exporter in Australia,  price and availability have remained stable.
It was actually tongue in cheek, but I forget reddit has issues with sarcasm and such
