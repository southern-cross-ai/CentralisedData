Wins the C1 in addition to her K1. Our 14th medal and 7th Gold with Jessica Fox winning 2 of them.

Legendary run from a sporting legend!
The Aussie with the most individual Olympic medals **of all time** (6)

And just the 8th Aussie to win 3 gold medals in any sport

Jess Fox is one of Australia‚Äôs best ever athletes what a freak
[deleted]
Chosen as flag bearer and lives up to expectations with 2 golds, how good
One of Australia‚Äôs greatest athletes of all time. She‚Äôs a very good chance at another gold in the KX-1 too. What a legend!
Hopefully she can make it 3/3 with the kayak cross later in the week.
The steely stare of a fearsome fighter! Well done Jess!!
World #1 ranked canoer for a decade and now the 2 gold medals 

GOAT
Well done, Jess. Bloody legend!

That being said, my heart bleeds for Satkov√° there. I think the knock on one of the earlier gates threw her off and that may have caused her to lag on the turns.
She‚Äôs amazing!!

And all our gold medals are from women, right?¬†
What a Champion!!!! üá¶üá∫ Onya Jess!!!!!
That was an insane demonstration of masterclass canoeing. 100% cemented herself as the world‚Äôs best.
What a beast, just amazing to nail 2 finals like this when the margins are so slim between getting a penalty or making it through. 

Her mum was hilarious running along the edge in celebration, ran into an olympic official from all the excitement
A bit late to the party here, but my word that final was brilliant. Such an emotional and fantastic final; really captured the essence of Olympic sport.

Lilik‚Äôs performance was for sure a golden one, but Jess Fox is simply otherworldly. In that spot, with that pressure, to deliver a near sub 100s run is unbelievable. So happy to see my favorite Olympian double up in K1 and C1!

The Olympics may not be everything we want it to be, but the essence of competition and sport which remains is still awesome. It‚Äôs why I love the Olympics so much. 

Congrats to Jess again! Legend!
Jess becomes Australia‚Äôs total individual medal holder of Olympic medals in Australian history !
Jessica delivered a fabulous performance today, so proud of her. But, I had a üíî watching Logan Martin getting knocked off in BMX.
Came here to say this! She is an absolute legend with nerves of steel. Such recovery under pressure, still can‚Äôt believe it! Worth every second for staying awake for this. This was a mic drop moment.
At what point is she just our best athlete of all time?
Check those biceps, what a weapon. One of the GOATs of the Aussie Olympics for sure.
The way she saves her best for the final run and absolutely nails it under pressure is something that sets her aside from most..
Such a legend

Her whole family are involved which makes it all the better! I hope Noemi rises up behind her
Fantastic Ms. Fox!
Viva la Australie!
Ripper run from Jess!
Imagine being the best in the world at something and then managing to defend your position. Once you defend your position at the top, you can truly know that you deserve to be there. The absolute rush of that moment must be insane
6 medals across her Olympics career and still likely to compete in LA. Insane
I did a bit of white water kayaking in my younger years and was nowhere even a smidgen of how good Fox is on her worst day.

She is a white water beast. Love to watch her compete because she makes a highly technical and skilled sport look somewhat effortless.
Jess is her

I feel like I need to hand in my citizenship because I didn‚Äôt get up to watch it live, but it‚Äôs amazing news to wake up to¬†
Anyone see what the penalty was for?
Fuckin crushed it.
Well done üéâ
Let's go Jess!
What a feeling watching that so much pride surging through my body,,,Foxy is a star ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§üá¶üá∫üá¶üá∫üá¶üá∫
Legend.
go you good thing awesome effort you cant beat a crafty foxüòÅ
I was awake and missed this. Fuck.
Stone cold killer !!! I love this woman ü´°üî•
Is she going super saiyan??
Ripper! Well done!!
Was so impressed to watch
The GOAT! üêê
my library was showing this on the projector! she was great
One of the best athletes ive ever watched compete, up there with Lewis Hamilton for me.
Future AOM member incoming
She's an absolute beast, and I love her so!
Aussie, Aussie oi,oi üá¶üá∫
She‚Äôs pretty hot to
Legend? I hate that I'm a old man shouting at clouds but... Nurses are Legends, Cashiers who put up with the public are Legends. People who defend the very Land we occupy are Legends, I really dislike our cultures obsession with "sports heroes" or "sporting Legends". No disrespect to the op here as I'm a fan of sporting people aswel(mostly racecar drivers) but not ones like footballers who can commit crimes or genuinely be putrid human beings but still get worshipped because they can kick a ball especially down here in vic. I fully expect to be downvoted out of existence.
[deleted]
I‚Äôm genuinely surprised none of our swimmers have 6 individual medals. This is amazing by Jess
Doesn't Emma McKeon have six gold medals? Let alone the others. I think she has 11 over all.
>Crazy she still can add another gold before these games are over WOW

And be the FIRST EVER OLYMPIAN to get triple gold in the canoe/kayak
I think she did get a 2 second penalty in the end. It was showing her time as 101 when the next run was going. She was just so fast it didn't matter.
What‚Äôs the third event?
KX looks mad! I love finding out about sports I never knew existed.
[deleted]
She looked so locked in before starting her run. Insane talent to come out 4.5 seconds ahead of the German paddler who was miles ahead of the rest of the field.
And the sheer joy when she found out she‚Äôd won. Brought a tear to the eyes
yeah it's sad but she's only 22 so she has plenty of chances in the future fortunately
But Natalya Diehm got a bronze in the BMX! That was so awesome
We've had athletes in other sports who are equally dominant, just not necessarily at the Olympics. Given that it's impossible to rank athletes in totally different sports, she's certainly among them.
Already is in my Opinion. They talk about McKeon but most of hers are relay Medals. Fox is now Individually our most successful Olympian of all Time.
Vive l'Australie ?
Gate 19. She brushed it on her right hand side
Why do people care about any type of entertainment? Wow, x actor puts on weird clothes and pretends to be another person, why do people care? Wow, someone played around with some beats and words to give it to someone else to sing, why do people care?

Senseless, obtuse take. Athletes are examples of the very peak of what human beings are capable of and inspire others to push themselves harder. And it's actually very normal to be proud and happy for someone else's success.
Titmus will probably reach 6 when she swims the 800
It's because it's wrong, did they mean at this Olympics?

Emma Jennifer McKeon


12 Olympic medals following the 2024 Olympic Games made her Australia's most decorated Olympian and included one gold medal from the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, four gold medals from the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo and one gold medal from the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.
A lot of that are relay medals, ie- not individual.
[deleted]
Slalom maybe, pretty sure it's been done in the sprint canoe/kayak
Yep, beat 2nd place by 4.5 sec so could have afforded 2 penalties. Of course we didn't know that at the time until the last competitor blew her run.
[deleted]
That‚Äôs the biggest thing to take away from this mornings gold.. the pressure and how she performs so well under it. The final run of the #1 qualifier in the final showed how hard it was to handle when she flopped for Jess to take the gold.
Any idea who they would be? Not that I disagree, I just don't have the knowledge for it.

In recent memory, I can maybe see Kerr and Ariarne Titmus in the conversation. There are probably heaps more too
Lol try telling ESPN that, they made a fool of themselves with the top 100 athletes globally in the 21st century list, and people didn‚Äôt understand that comparing athletes in different sports was completely flawed so instead they all bickered and bitched in comments sections that xyz who plays abc sport should‚Äôve been ranked higher then zyx who plays cba sport
Did they ever show it?
ü§ûüèª
Individual..
Emma has only won 4-5 individual medals, though. Majority of her medals have been in relays
It‚Äôs ‚Äúindividual medals‚Äù. Emma has two individual gold and two individual bronze, the rest of her medals are part of relay teams.

So it‚Äôs not wrong at all. Jess has the most individual medals
How many of them are individual and how many are team based?
Ahh that makes sense. Thanks
Well both her parents are pros haha
[removed]
Born in France I saw. Could she qualify for the French team?
Whenever they take a reasonably OK sport and add "Cross" to it, you know it's going to be glorious and this did not disappoint.

Rally Cross is the best cross though.  Just full sending rally cars into each other is awesome to watch.
Holy shit, that looks like a fucking nightmare
That looks fucken cool. Whens that on?
Not sure if Olympic sport or Gladiator segment
Anna Meares is the first one that springs to mind (won individual medals over 4 separate Olympics, 6 Olympic medals including 2 Golds, 11 world championships over a 14 year career)

Kerry Saxby-Junna, represented Australia 27 times and set 32 world records in race walking over 16 years

Shelley Taylor-Smith, marathon swimmer, held 7 world titles, broke 15 race records and was world number 1 ranked marathon swimmer from 1988 to 1995 - and often finished first outright against male competitiors

Ian Thorpe, over a 9 year career won 5 Olympic golds, 13 world championships and set 23 world records

Louise Sauvage, 9 paralympic golds across every distance from 100m to 5000m, 12 World Championship golds, 12 marathon wins

Herb Elliot, who only competed at world level for a few years (retiring at 22) but broke the 4 minute mile 17 times (ten of those times in a single year), in winning the 1500 at the Rome Olympics he broke his own world record by nearly half a second and his time wasn't beaten for 7 years.

There are a few more, sometimes hard to quantify (how do you compare Mick Doohan winning 5 consecutive world championships in motorcycling to  a runner or swimmer? But it's still an athletic achievement).

None of this is to denigrate Ms Fox who is a superb athlete and certainly deserves to be mentioned as one of the greatest
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Foster_(woodchopper)


Not an Olympic sport obviously, but at a global level he's probably one of the most dominant athletes of all time.
It's hard enough comparing athletes in the same sport but from different eras, let alone different sports!
Her Mumma won gold for France in '92 and '96. They moved to Australia for the Sydney Olympics in 2000. 
Her Dad must be so proud of her...

Well done , Jess Fox. Absolutely amazing effort. Greatest kayak/canoe champion the world has ever seen.
No doubt a lot of our star athletes have immigrant parents.
Mother... 

Emigrated...

Technically, yes. The rules of the olympics say that once an athlete with dual citizenships chooses a country to represent, they can not change unless under specific circumstances. There was an interview she did where she said she bleeds green and gold and chose to represent Australia. 

There's also a number of Australian's representing other countries in the Olympics where they have dual citizenship. The Australian media spoke about them during the opening ceremony.
I love rallycross, ppl bag it often but it's amazing!
Even the starting is hectic!
[deleted]
Thanks for thia response, was exactly what I was after!

I definitely don't think it takes away from Fox, just highlights the calibre of people she's in the conversation with.

Personally I was hoping for this sort of thing so I knew some names I could google and check out. Thanks for that!!
When I think of Australian sporting legends, I think of two unicorns, sally pearson and Cathy freeman. Australia have been marlins in the water for a long time but our land speed has always been less desirable, so these two ladies really stand out to me as legends who deserved to be thrown around along side names like Thorpe/fox/etc even if there list of achievements aren‚Äôt as long
Jason English should be up there as one of Australia's best Athletes of All time. Seven Consecutive World Championships in 24hr Mountain Bike racing.

Acticle printed in Sydney Morning Herald from 7 years ago. 
[Jason English: the best Australian cyclist you've never heard of](https://www.smh.com.au/sport/cycling/meet-jason-english-australias-best-cyclist-noone-has-heard-of-20160927-grpd13.html)
Wow, you are not joking.

Wikipedia:

"He started woodchopping with his father, George Foster, in 1978, and between them they won the World 600 mm Double-handed Sawing Championship eleven years running. He and his brother Peter Foster continued competing and winning this event for another ten years, until 1999, making David a world champion 21 years running. They lost in 2000, but re-gained the championship in 2001, after which David's son Stephen took over as his wood chopping partner.

His other achievements in wood chopping include winning the Australian Axeman of the Year award nine times in a row, winning every major wood chopping event in Australia and New Zealand, becoming the first person in sporting history to have won 1,000 championships and being the only axeman to have ever won six out of seven championships at the Sydney Royal Easter Show."
Her mother won bronze in 96. Never got the gold at the Olympics.
Pretty sure her dad is English to so we got lucky getting her instead of the English or French lol
Not just athletes, more than half of Australians have at least one parent born overseas.
Sorry‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.

Sir‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..
Honestly as a very American American Jew I am so proud of her since she;s and Australian Jew... even though obviously I wish an American had won ;)
Awsome. Thank you. I'll be watching it that's for sure
>google and check out.

A good starting point is the Sport Australia Hall of Fame, particularly the "Legends of Australian Sport." There's a smattering of footballers and cricketers, but many inductees from lesser publicised sports (Like Heather Mackay, who dominated women's squash - in 20 years she lost only TWO matches, and even found the time to represent Australia in hockey twice).

Happy googling!
Agreed, without downplaying their achievements I think swimmers in particular get a disproportionate amount of attention compared to our other athletes. Sure, they usually win more medals than other squads, but there's more swimming events than any other sport, too, and it's not as if other athletes are any less dedicated
Thanks for that. Makes Jess's efforts ring out even more
I'm not sure about the Dad. He doesn't sound like he has a British accent. Brits never really lose their accent because they don't have to learn a new language when coming to Australia. I have Irish work mates who have been in Australia for 20 years, who still sound as Irish as the day they left Belfast.
