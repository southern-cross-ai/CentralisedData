No shit. We live on what is effectively the world's biggest island (don't argue semantics with me), and we're almost completely beholden on importing the vast majority of our medical supplies.

Yet another case of the ridiculous short sightedness of successive governments that have allowed our manufacturing industries to be progressively gutted
So we haven't learnt anything from the pandemic about reducing our dependency on overseas for medical supplies
The constraint is apparently the plastic bags the fluids are contained in, not the availability of water or salts. In my public hospital, we predominantly use Baxter fluids which are made in Australia (has the kangaroo on it).

What this highlights for me is the sovereign risk we have with lack of local manufacturing.

I'm strongly of the belief, for the greater good, we should have government-controlled local manufacturing of essential medications so we can care for our people. I'm not saying the fourth line IV antibiotics for an esoteric infection.

We clearly have a demand for items, lets make them locally and legislate that.
"Shortages" becoming increasingly frequent. Why is this?
I’ve supplied and tendered to Australian government for years and they have no one to blame but themselves. 

They put zero value on local manufacturing and even local employment. I can quote a Government procurement manager as an example. I was explaining how we were one of the last suppliers to manufacture in Australia, and that may mean we are a little more expensive but we employed over 200 Aussies. She said “we consider that we can compete globally, therefore we procure globally.” They went with cheap overseas crap. 

Not long after we shut down all Aussie manufacturing. All jobs gone overseas. It’s just not viable when local manufacturing has zero influence in large contract purchasing decisions. 

Now Governments are looking around wondering where the manufacturing has all gone? It’s too late, it’s very expensive and complicated to get back and when the political winds change they won’t support it again. 

It’s gone and they killed it.
“The shortage has put the issue of Australian manufacturing of medicine back in the spotlight”

No kidding. We can’t even make salt water? Seriously?
the tga would have an easier time listing what medicines AREN’T having supply issues by now
Luckily I’m having mental health problems right now so I’ll be able to just use a constant supply of tears
Jokes on them, I mainline coffee
Yeah we are rationing our bags on an absolutely needs to have iv fluids during surgery basis. Its mindboggling.

Public health goes for the cheapest, nastiest version of everything. And when purpose built buildings are broken 1-2yrs after theyve opened they simply find the cheapest workaround to avoid spending $ to fix things so they actually function as intended.

40 year old buildings are still functioning better than something built last year at the lowest possible cost.

Its not surprising thar theyd choose the cheapest supplier for fluids too, regardless of any other factors, its cheapest, always.
So, 21st, seemingly millions of managers and consultants, and iv fluid?
Amazing that a country completely surrounded by ocean can run out of salty water. Just wow.
 a shortage of saline? this is hard for me to understand. no doubt it's more complex than i presumed.
[removed]
I'm still trying to get ozempic because all the fat people are taking it
There was a mild shortage this time last year of straight saline IV fluids and it blew my mind that we are importing what is essentially sterile salty water ffs
The government of the day typically lasts 4-8 years so I have absolutely zero faith any of them even consider the benefit of the country. 

When was the last time we had a  government we actually believed could lead instead of just clocking in to get paid.
You say successive governments but it takes decades to build industry, but only a year to tear it down.

Just look at what the LNP did to Holden promised support to win the election, then reneged once in office, in the space of a year Holden and all of its supporting businesses were done. It doesn't just come back the moment Labor gets back into office.
Pfft who needs manufacturing when all we need is land speculation, infinite growth baby!
But at least they’ve let private “colleges” flourish to act as visa mills for foreign “students”… so it’s not as if they’ve done nothing /s
What gutted our manufacturing industries was the massive wage cost in comparison to developing countries, which is why all Western countries have outsourced the vast majority of manufacturing.


Onshoring manufacturing is fine, but the products will be far more expensive then imported products and that money will have to come from somewhere. And unless we manufacture *all* components and consumables (like plastic bags for IV fluids in this case) we're still not immune to shortages.
>successive governments that have allowed our manufacturing industries to be progressively gutted

There's a particular flavour of government that enables this to happen... It's the one that hates unionised emlpoyees more than they like capitalist industry.
You could say that about everything on the market. Heck it wont be long before we will be importing gas and iron ore. We certainly know how to screw ourselves, not the lucky country anymore but the dumb country because we are so obsessed with our economic self destruction.
But won't you think of their cronies and the politicians who get their pockets lined?
*laughs in vyvanse shortages*
Oh they have learnt, it’s just that there is little value to shareholders when producing things here.
The problem with local manufacturing is that you will still run into globalised supply chains. We have the saline, so we start making bags. The bags probably require material from some supplier only located in China. The attachment points might only come out of Ukraine. More complicated items might have hundreds or thousands of components from across the globe.

Do you start making everything in the chain? Including refining the petroleum to make the plastic? Then costs massively blow out compared to those globalised chains.
You don't make as much profit from oversupply.
Scale reduces cost in manufacturing. One big facility means less cost per item than two smaller facilities at half the production rate, which is the direction manufacturing tends to go.


Eventually something breaks or needs servicing in big facility (or there's a recall, or product use increases and the manufacturer can't scale up to the required rate, or a storage warehouse burns down) then you have a shortage. But supply is cheaper when things are going well so we can treat more people for the same cost.
The supply chain is globally fucked.
Record levels of immigration and zero forethought. Blame Australian people, we are voting for this crap.
when I worked for the WA labor government in 2007-8 a policy was that we must tender and choose in order to procure from 1 western australian business , 2 australian business, and 3 only if not available from the first two, to procure feom overseas.

the liberals repealed this rule in the first month of gaining power in 2008
It’s complicated and there’s all kinds of exceptions and exceptions to exceptions, but one of the requirements of the AUS-USA free trade agreement is that many government procurements can’t preference Australian suppliers (“equal footing” basically). I assume that other free trade agreements have similar requirements. 

I’m not saying that’s a good thing, nor do I know if your company’s products were covered by this. I’m just pointing out how complicated it is. 

Just simply preferring Australian companies to promote local business isn’t necessarily as straightforward a policy win as you might think.
It's obviously not just "making salt water". It's a sterile therapeutic product needing a shitload of expensive infrastructure. You can't just switch on that supply. 

It's fine if we want to prioritise the manufacturer of these products onshore but it's going to take many millions out of the health budget. Local manufacturers will also not be immune from other shortages within the supply chain (plastics, inks, packaging, etc).
Jeepers you might want to get that looked at.

Hope you don't live in the sticks.
Profitability has been maximized.
It’s a worldwide issue
Iirc it's the bags not the liquid, that said I'd expect producing large quantities of packaged sterile liquids to be a non trivial exercise even if it is just salt water.
That proves it doesn't work I think.

If it worked they'd be thin.
I had to go 5 months without mental health meds last year which is still affecting me due to a shortage.
You might think that with a fair amount of coastline and inland salt lakes we aren’t short of the raw material that goes into saline. 
The lack of redundancy, planning or foresight in healthcare is dire. I will never forget the decimation of US IV supplies after Hurricane Maria: hard to imagine more than half your key supply just no longer being available more or less overnight. https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/news/hsph-in-the-news/hurricane-maria-u-s-iv-bag-shortage/

From memory, most of the world’s paracetamol is manufactured in India, we have had so many shortages of key antibiotics that I stopped paying attention some time ago, I haven’t even seen tenecteplase in hospital for three years and even alteplase is restricted now too (clot busting drugs, vital for rural management of serious heart attacks as well as some strokes and other blood clot disorders more generally for those non-healthcare readers) and this shortage comes after a shortage of dextrose 5% flasks that still seems to be lingering and which makes preparation of a lot of critical care drugs either inconvenient, wasteful or both.

Everyone was paying attention to semaglutide (Ozempic) but meanwhile the rest of the healthcare system is looking increasingly like Old Mother Hubbard’s cupboard…
Typically coalition absolutely fucks shit up as much as possible, Labor gets in and attempts to fix some of the damage, then our very biased media points fingers at Labor.  
If you say attention to politics outside of Herald headlines we have had some very good governments, it's just not reported on.

It's the Australian way. And will anyone \*do\* anything but whinge? Nah mate.
2007
As it turned out, GM pissed off from a heap of countries,  including cheap labour countries like  Thailand.  Nothing was going to keep them here.  There is this Reddit fantasy that it is all the Government's fault.
Who else is going to pay the tax to increase the dole / disability/ free housing / free education/ free childcare ?
So basically capitalism only works if there are people who will work for slave wages for those wealthy enough to afford to consume.
All true, but downvoted because people don't want to hear bad news.
I take both vyvanse and use HRT patches. Every time I have to fill a script it’s half a day of calling g around pharmacies hoping someone still has supply. The HRT patches have been having supply issues for over a year now.
Love the US government saying "yeah you have enough, sorry nope none could be made"

Fuck off.
😂🥹😭
At least at the time, even if we were to manufacture here we would have been beholden to the US Drug agencies and the patent holder who would have been unlikely to license it
:(
Can confirm I was affected right before Xmas, had to switch to dexies
Pretty sure it's still under patent in Australia
Even going off your very pessimistic assumption (that there is a single point of failure in every point of every global supply chain) it's still a better option to at least manufacture the final product locally than the absolute mess we have ourselves in now. 

"Costs blow out" is the worst reason to not manufacture locally. Costs blow out when purchasing saline bags (or any other short-supply item, like we encountered during COVID) turns into a global highest-price-wins auction, whilst the health system absorbs millions in extra costs due to the mess caused by the undersupply.
Pretty much. 'The market' is naturally monopolistic without regulation, due to the efficiencies of scale you describe.

So without protectionist regulation (which does have its own problems) you end up with a single point of failure that can cripple a whole host of required/useful services if anything goes wrong, in exchange for it being slightly cheaper when everything's going perfectly.
I've never been to parliament house, let alone voted on legislation there.
Let me guess, you're definitely not racist?
This is still a procurement process in QLD Health… Among other things like the company stance on DV and the environment
What sort of infra? Like boilers and packaging systems?
[deleted]
I’m not sure if I’m in the sticks. The main road and train line have that draining feeling like you are going to the sticks but it’s also still on the metro train line. We have Roos, echidnas, platypus’s, foxes and wombats that makes it feel like the sticks and I think we’re the closest suburb with them to the city at least on my train line.
No salty water left in the entire world 🙃
yeah i figured the sterilisation was at least part of it. still weird on the bags tbh but clearly all the things together makes it hard.
Flouexitine?
I've had the same on and off over the years with my Zoloft, (the non name brand just doesn't work as good)

oh ho ho, yeah because its the media that votes in elections? No, its the absolutely self centred biased and massively racist australian populace that votes. Case in point... "migration is responsible for inflation" crowd will vote in coalition next election because its easier to blame brown skinned immigrants than to consider the fact that 4 generations of white australians sold out this countries' natural resources for their own paltry self benefit in the guise of "jobs and growth". Down vote me all you want but your racist grand pa, and dad got us where we are.
Yeah we all remember when Rudd fixed the privatized punitive employment services, or when Albo did it.

CSL was privatized in 1994 (10+ years of continuous Labor) and still holds the government blood products monopoly.. I think it has gone on to be a 200 bagger for shareholders?

Albo can set up another CSL anytime they want, it's obviously a very lucrative business for the taxpayer.. the answer is that they don't want to. The question is, why?
Multinationals, oil and gas companies and big mining companies!

Oh, I see what you did there… on second thoughts just bring in more migrants
If wages were effectively uniform around the globe, there'd be no reason to outsource manufacturing to other countries.
Also people want high wages then want everything real cheap from people paid a slave wage.
arbitrage and human capital is a story as old as time
Not capitalism. All societies. Go back to ancient times and wealthy people (lifestyle roughly comparable to middle class of western society today) were supported by large groups if slaves or lowly paid peasants. It's been part of human society for all time.
Slave wages, typical Reddit armchair communism. I think you mean raising billions of people out of poverty through globalisation, how monstrous of capitalism.
I’ve actually had to go onto compounded HRT because I couldn’t get my patches for love or money. I get awful migraines with no HRT, so I couldn’t function. Just horrible. Vyvanse I can get, but not the patches.
> The HRT patches have been having supply issues for over a year now.

Close to 4-5 years now depending on the brand you use, when most folks jumped back to pills it pushed demand up at around the same time that the major brand was having production issues which spurred another shortage until a secondary brand could start to fill the market. It's been a bit fucked and like playing whack-a-mole with what you can actually access.
Takeda's patent expired last year, US has approved generics already
>  'The market' is naturally monopolistic without regulation

Except there's no amount of regulation you can put in place that will prevent the capitalist class from eventually accumulating enough power to remove said regulations.

This is an extremely dumb take and I can't believe it's being upvoted.

Your hangup at the word therapeutic is just bizarre. Virtually all therapies given in excess are harmful. That doesn't mean they're not therapies. IV fluids are akin to medications and do require similar infrastructure and oversight. The TGA provides oversight to IV fluids just like other pharmaceuticals. 

Boiling water in a pot for 20min might be sufficient for drinking. It is not sufficient for fluids that are going to be injected into sterile compartments in the human body. Heat sterilisation for medical purposes uses temperatures much greater than >100°C, and typically longer than 20min. They also use irradiation for sterilisation, which is even more effective. There is also the matter of sterilising it within appropriate, airtight packaging that can be simultaneously used for administration. You can't just boil it in a pot and than transfer it into a bottle, as it'll be contaminated in the process. As soon as it's expose to air it's contaminated. 

You cannot make the equivalent of IV saline by adding salt to tap water. IV saline is nothing but water and 308mOsm/L of sodium chloride. Both tap water and table salt have numerous other impurities/electrolytes within them. One of the main important characteristics of IV saline is its reliability to not interact with other medications mixed with it. That can't be guaranteed with your saline recipe, that would also contain dozens of other things in it (magnesium, calcium, fluorine, etc). The osmolality of your saline solution would also be entirely unreliable, as the composition of tap water is not consistent. Your saline recipe is fine for irrigating a wound or doing a mouth wash. It's not appropriate for injectables. Furthermore, saline is not our only IV fluid. 

We absolutely need to ensure a safe and reliable supply of IV fluids, and this absolutely does require expensive infrastructure. Compromising safety and quality on this would be disastrous. And I repeat, it's incredibly disappointing that people have upvoted you on your obscenely misinformative statements. 

Source: I'm a critical care doctor.
>Technically, you can give someone too much saline, and it would be no longer be therapeutic by definition - despite being the exact same product.

Either you're saying anything with a therapeutic range is not really therapeutic, or there is some mysterious substance not known to science but known to you that is safe at any dose. 

FYI pure oxygen will kill you.
It's not redundant - saline is a therapeutic good. Like any medicine, device or other therapeutic, it can be overused or misused with adverse consequences. 

I don't think the suggestion is that saline is too complicated to manufacture. However to manufacture it on a large scale while meeting the TGA's requirements would be significantly more expensive than importing it. 

Again, this is fine, but the trade off the additional cost.
This is so incredibly dumb. Fuck me people really think they know everything so confidently and yet are so spectacularly wrong
I don't really understand your point - are you saying this problem could be solved if we all just made saline at home? Are you dense?  Obviously the complexity of making 100mL of this shit at home for shits and giggles is nothing compared to mass producing, packaging and distributing millions of liters of it.  Millions of litres that - by the way - have to be quality assured to have an exact milli-molar concentration of sodium chloride, and need to be kept sterile throughout the entire process otherwise people will die?

Also WTF are you talking about 'your use of the word therapeutic is redundant'.  If you give too much of any medicine that exists then it will eventually be toxic.  Doesn't mean it isn't a therapeutic product.  Pointless semantics.
The concentration of salt would be more than 9% after 20 minutes of boiling though!!
At least you can get to a decent hospital.

My kid had some troubles, and I'm so lucky that we were in reach of good care.
It’s a packaging issue apparently and it’s not worldwide as originally reported 🙄
Vyvanse
girt girl summer
It's easy for Rudd to say this stuff now he's no longer in the game.  

If any party, Labor/liberals/greens, whatever, attacked the media they know that they wouldn't survive as a party for very long.  
Have to toe the line to some extent if you want even a snowballs chance of making change
In terms of media ownership by a single entity per country:  
1 is China at 100% (state owned)  
2 is Egypt at 90% (state owned)  
3 is Australia at 70% (Murdoch).  
This doesn't count the 'competition', for example channel 9, which until recently was chaired by an ex-Liberal treasurer.  
Or the ABC, which until recently was chaired by a former Murdoch journalist.  

So yes, you average Aussie is a bit stupid and racist, bit who tells them to think like that?
bwahahaha we can’t even tax our own coal, gas and oil.. and good luck taxing multinationals who spend more on tax consultants than Australia spends on tax enforcement
An absolute nothing statement that has no bearing on the current situation, nor does it actually engage or think through what would happen if wages were the same the world 'round.
Thanks!
As punishment, the person you responded to should now read all the iv fluid pages on deranged physiology!
But! The level of complexity and equipment is roughly equivalent to a microbrewery with higher standards and intense monitoring for IV saline.

It is insane that we are seemingly hard pressed to stand up a new manufacturing capability that we can certify in 6 months.

We never had a problem with our son’s Vyvanse script.
I am fully girt right now
Except that's circular self-defeating logic, if they can never attack the media or do anything about it, how is the problem ever going to be resolved? Or are we supposed to just accept as Murdoch et al. grow their stranglehold year after year?
Don't forget that Seven West and Newscorp are deep in each other's pockets at the moment.
> who tells them to think like that?

Dang, if only they could learn to think for themselves, y'know, actively engage in critical thought and the like?
Punishment should extend to mastering the strong ion difference given we are talking about "normal" saline.
Deranged phys is actually pretty fun, what are you talking about 🤣
Just because you're seeing large metal tanks in your animated video doesn't mean it's in any way equivalent to a microbrewery. You're also just blatantly dismissing "higher standards and monitoring" as if this doesn't require significantly greater cost and infrastructure.

If multiple world leading IV fluid manufacturers are having issues with production, why do you think it'll be so simple for us?
It was based on strength. If you were on the high dosages you were not affected.
I don’t think your comment is helpful
Me too, Rexx (…that’s a euphemism for having a wide-on, right?).
Oh yeah forgot that aspect of the 'competition'.  
So realistically speaking we're up to what, 95% of our mainstream media being either owned or paid for by a single entity?
I chose the video as an illustration.


How much does it take to set up a microbrewery, to the standard of humans putting a cultivated product in them?


About $15 million, 2018 dollars, Pirate Life Pt Adelaide.


Is producing an alcoholic beverage and maintaining the quality control to meet food/safety regulations different from manufacturing an IV fluid?
Yes.
Radically different?
Like completely new science?
No. Both processes rely on purification of inputs, monitoring, quality control, etc.


Could a brewer step into IV manufacturing? No. But could a QA/production line expert work equally at both enterprises?
Yes.


Knowing what we know about the industrial processes and costs of microbreweries; can we plausibly guess at IV manufacturing costs? Absolutely.


Let's say it's 10x harder to run a clean room manufacturing line for IV than a brewery.
Your setup costs are... $150 million in 2018 dollars.
The government will happily blow 4.4 billion on "roads to recovery" programs (2023 dollars), because people driving from A to B generates tax revenue.
You know what else generates revenue? Living tax payers.


Pretending this is voodoo science magic is bonkers. You might be a specialist who deeply understands the literature about what it put into a human body. No disagreement there.

But are you also a specialist on industrialisation or automation? Or quality control at scale? Or cost optimisation?
I am not saying you will face no problems in scaling up to demand from 0.


But could we drop several hundred million on the problem and 6 months later reasonably expect we have a pilot supply of IV fluids from at least one of multiple manufacturers; with a 3 year roadmap that breaks any dependency on foreign nationals?
Absolutely.
I was on 50mg and it was out of stock for months. I think some people on 20s and 30s went to 50s which dropped the supply and causes issues.

Now I've been out for 8 months because apparently I need a new diagnosis and the have been waiting for a new appointment.
I always had trouble getting my script filled when I was on 30 and then 40mg, had no trouble with filling 50... Yet.
Ah ok. My son is on 70mg
I just meant that I wasn’t aware of an issue with Vyvanse shortages. It turns out the higher dosages, which we get, were not as impacted.
You've conveniently ignored my question.

If multiple world leading manufacturers are failing, why do you think the Australian government giving some money to a private enterprise is suddenly going to fix it? Like, when has that ever happened in the history of our country...
