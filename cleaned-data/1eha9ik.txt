Greyhound racing is frequently referred to as a sport even though its participants cannot consent. Also, what other sport killed 320 of its participants in a single year? Because that's how many greyhounds died on Australian tracks in 2023.

  
Here are July 2024's statistics:

The statistics are collated from racing steward reports by Coalition for the Protection of Greyhounds and are cross checkable on sources like greyhound recorder.

* 7 on track deaths (74 total in 2024)
* 1,198 on track injuries (6695 total in 2024)
* [A greyhound was injured](https://www.facebook.com/share/3pni3vhsmvcQsM4X/?mibextid=WC7FNe) and in considerable pain, needing to be carried off track. It took 90 minutes to locate the dog’s trainer ‘Desmond Cecil’ who after being asked ;why having lunch was more important than his suffering dog’ Cecil replied in anger, swearing and assaulting the steward. The greyhound was later euthanised.
* [A GAP Tasmania whistleblower](https://www.instagram.com/p/C88ftsKSyfm/?igsh=NGd5bmRlNjFndmZ0) went public with the conditions of greyhounds who arrived into their care:
   * ‘I saw dogs arrive so emaciated and hungry that they immediately vomited their food back’ 
   * ‘A lot of them arrived with pressure sores…and the majority had dental disease from poor diet and neglect. Often the dogs couldn’t eat kibble and had to be fed mush or wet food until they had their rotten teeth extracted by the vets.’
* [The GRNSW Board was sacked](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/article/2024/jul/04/nsw-greyhound-racing-board-licence-breach-sacking) for failing to disclose ‘anything that could bring the industry into disrepute’
* [The GRNSW Chief Vet’s report claims](https://www.theguardian.com/sport/article/2024/jul/12/watchdog-investigating-nsw-greyhound-racing-facing-integrity-allegations-of-its-own-in-explosive-report) (amongst other things) that: dogs were being raced at unhealthy levels, lies about the number of greyhounds rehomed, high numbers of deaths (including killing unwanted dogs), inaccurately reporting deaths and nothing has changed since the 2016 shutdown
   * For example, 970 dogs were reported as killed in NSW in 2023 but the Greyhound Welfare and Integrity Commissions digital tracking system recorded over 2,900 dogs killed. 
* [Doug and Les Kenyon banned](https://www.instagram.com/p/C9O99bzyvdo/?igsh=c2FlZmU2NnQxYzBp) for live baiting offences which arose in September 2023. They were found guilty of multiple charges of using live animals to bait greyhounds at a rented property shared with multiple other greyhound trainers (why didn’t these other trainers speak up?!)
* [Three greyhounds were dumped](https://www.instagram.com/p/C98swxxyWTH/?igsh=MXFmd3V1dDR4MDVjZQ==) at a rural pound after all three were ‘adopted’ by the same person a month earlier - a new method for getting rid of dogs?
i volunteered as a kennel hand at a greyhound rescue for a number of years. I saw cruelty cases frequently. One dog that i still remember many years later arrived with an infected wound on his knee; x-ray revealed that the fuckwit cunt we got him from had tried to do backyard surgery with random wire, failed miserably and left the wound to fester

So many dogs came through who were underweight, in poor condition, with teeth rotting out of their fucking mouths.

the part that pissed me off the most was that because we were a rescue, and the majority of the dogs we received were surrenders, the charity insisted on keeping cordial relationships with trainers who actively hurt their animals and not reporting them. The argument was that if we weren’t nice to them then they would just shoot the dog and dump it in the bush instead of giving it to us willingly 

edit: forgot to add, we accepted greyhounds that had been blooded, (which GAP does not, or at least didnt when i was a volunteer at this other place), and those dogs were genuinely dangerous. I remember three dogs who came in (all brothers) who had been blooded and only raced a handful of times but weren't fast enough so they got dumped at a vet. Well while they were at the vet waiting for someone to pick them up, they escaped and killed another dog. It was not safe to rehome these dogs, and because we were no-kill, those dogs stayed with us for years, and were still there when I left. It’s completely fucked. The only reason they were there was because some cruel POS trainer decided to blood them.
It's not a sport. Without the money no one would ever race dogs just for fun. It's just gambling using animals instead of cards or a pokies machine.
Greyhound racing is a money laundering racket. The animal cruelty is a side effect that they do not give a damn about.
Once money is involved with anything animal related, animal abuse is not too far behind.
Greyhound racing: a government sponsored excuse for gambling, alcohol and animal abuse.

Shut it down.
Greys are the sweetest breed too. I wish I had the room for one in my life.
I have a rescue grey, she is the sweetest girl. When she came to me it looks like one of her toes had been removed after a racing accident. 

I have no idea how anyone could just throw away such a beautiful good natured animal.

It's a shit industry, much like horse racing, just a bullshit way for scumbags to make money..
A few years back I saw the footage of live baiting where animals were strapped to a lure to train the greyhounds. They were slowly ripped to bits. It was absolutely sickening.  After it was publicised, the NSW Premier announced greyhound racing would be banned.  He backflipped shortly after.  Not sure if it was related to money or whether he was paid a visit by someone involved in racing but it just shows the corruption that must be involved.  Barnaby Joyce’s response? He wasn’t worried about live animals being slowly torn apart.  He just criticised the people who took the footage for trespassing.

Here’s some footage of the ABC investigation. Warning - some of it is graphic

Here's my [rescue greyhound on a pillow](https://i.imgur.com/UM63f0O.png).

Only about 1/3 or greyhounds are rescued. Think about getting a retired greyhound when you want a dog.
Couldn't agree more. And rodeos suck shit as well.
Racing of all kind should be banned for both horses and greyhounds. Equestrian sports need to be looked at closely and have some major changes if not stopped.

Sadly I dont think any of this will happen anytime soon....
Dogs fed meth, male dogs with deep heat on their nuts, dogs filled with water, all tactics used depending on the result the trainers need per race. All of it is known by the regulators and yet its still happening. 

If you’re a ´trainer´ of an animal used for sport you can go fuck yourself.
I’ve been a rescue foster, joined the big greyhound groups of Facebook for advice but they drove me nuts. 

Avidly pro racing despite claims of neutrality. Refuse to acknowledge systemic problems with racing (it’s always ‘a few bad apples, we love our dogs!’), and got mad at people calling the dogs rescues (‘they’re retired!’) despite the industry having no real plan for post-career dogs except relying on the generosity of the public to manage their behaviour and health issues and related costs for the rest of their lives. 

Some trainers prepare dogs for pet life (time alone, time in house, exposure to other types of dog and animal, to small kids etc) but most don’t, so these dogs have no idea what’s going on when they get to your house.
Greyhound’s make fantastic pets, particularly older ones. I got mine when he was 6 years old, had a particularly rough life. His now 9 and loving life. He is a sweet dog, affectionate, gentle and has bags of personality. Highly recommend adopting a greyhound. 
Buddy;

It’s important to also note, dogs have a very short gestational period and produce multiple pups. How many from each litter do you think get killed as ‘wastage’ because they aren’t fast enough. For those that agree horse racing is also a disgusting sport, a horse’s gestation period is close to a year and produces one foal, greyhound racing deaths is on a whole other level. It’s shocking and I’m scared to think what the true numbers are.
The rescue system is pretty messed up as well. In NZ almost every single greyhound rescue is run by greyhound racing nz, which means they can just dump the retired dogs and profit off of the adoption. Sure, its better than killing them en mass but it’s almost impossible to get a greyhound without supporting the racing industry.
There’s the export market for greyhounds to race overseas or be sold as meat. 

The whole “industry” is corrupt and should not exist.
how is this Non politics,it only still exists,because the sport has corrupted our political class
Greyhound racing is barbaric and a LOT of the people involved in this cruelty are exactly that. Cunts galore.

There's a fuck ton of litters forced out of breeding bitches every year, yet only a handful of those make it to the start box.
WHAT HAPPENS TO THE REST OF THEM
Don't worry, the happy survivors get donated to science after their career, where they live their last few weeks/months in a concrete kennel style shelter being fed bare minimum food with bare minimum play/interaction while getting needles/bloods/surgery done at various points!
When animals are not used to entertainment and sport and food, we will be one step closer to peace. I pray for all the animals who have to suffer through humans. They deserve so much better.
My best friend’s late dog was an ex-racing greyhound. He’d been utterly traumatised and was very reactive as a result. Like any noise or movement near him, he’d freak out and snap (huge bite risk) for two seconds until he realised he wasn’t about to be abused. He was otherwise a lovely dog. People who support greyhound racing can go to hell.
I've two ex racing greyhounds. They are awesome dogs and know their treatment on the track was no great.  My boy grey was then sent to a blood bank facility where once a week they'd take his blood, then SELL that blood to vet clinics.  What people do with animals is  sickening.

The over breeding of these dogs is a BIG issue in Australia, UK and Ireland.  We get sent some of these to the US to find homes.

Im so happy the mexican track closed down, this needs to start happening everywhere.
Same with anything involving horseriding. They can't consent. Ban it alll
Speaking of the Olympics, how is it that we’re getting more and more vocal critics and calls for the ending of horse-racing, but every four years we all go nuts for, among other things, horse-racing? I mean they’re making a horse run like buggery *and* jump over shit, surely that’s dangerous for the horses also?
Fucking Morons who try to justify this cruelty to innocent creatures with their excuses is mind blowing. They can all get fucked and put down when they get an injury. The racing industry is diabolical and the people involved in it are as well. Fuck em all to death.
>...what other sport killed 320 of its participants in a single year?

The best I could find was a study that focused on coronial reports into deaths during or related to sport between 01/07/2000 to 21/12/2019. Basically, over a period of twenty years, 321 people died while participating in "wheeled motor sports". Kind of pales in comparison to those greyhound numbers.

Ban Greyhound Racing, Horse Racing and the use of animals in the police force.

They can't consent about time we stop abusing them.
We had an on site greyhound race track that just closed down after forty years.  I was a security guard to the kennels 25 years ago, but didn't see any abuse.  Unfortunately, the stories I heard more than made up for that.  Greyhounds are such a chill, laid back breed when not forced to race or hunt.
Problem is that due to the previous backflips, banning greyhound racing is now considered to be a polticial no go zone, just like a mining tax
Its was a banned wasn’t it? And then back flipped.
All of it is disgusting, and we need to put a stop to it.
Mate. Mate.

I've said this before, and I'll keep saying it. We need to make Lawnmower Racing the new sport to bet on.

It's got no animal cruelty, it's bogan as fuck, and it'll revive the Australian aftermarket car parts industry as people try and work out how to bolt a turbocharger to a ride-on 2-stroke.
BuT We ReHoMe A FeW DoGs!!
Any kind of racing of animals is cruel. I'm not a hippy vegan or anything, but mistreating horses, dogs, or whatever else for sport to gamble on does not sit well with me.
FYI for anyone who lives in WA and also wants to see this horrible industry end - the current parliamentary petition to end greyhound racing in Western Australia closes in just over a week! Please consider adding your name if you haven’t already*, and share with your family, friends & work colleagues!!

We really need the public to rally together for this one - the last petition got just under the amount of signatures needed to get action taken in parliament 😭

Interesting story I got. Once, when I took my guinea pigs to the vet, there was this guy with a greyhound. He said she nearly ended up doing racing. The vet said, 'Lucky girl.'
Greyhounds definitely consent to running. Eg lure coursing. That’s the first point clueless people make, it’s a true fact but it’s deeper than that. 

The injuries on track are nothing compared to the sheer number of greys being mass bred and culled. On and off record. The million dollar dogs are treated nice but the duds are thrown to the way side. Inconceivable numbers. Only a small portion make it to the greyhound racing program. 

These are not pets they’re money machines.
horse-back riding also though probs not on the same level
Absolute bastards
Is greyhound racing part of the Olympics?
[https://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-11-07/blooding-greyhounds/5076970](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-11-07/blooding-greyhounds/5076970)
Yeah can we also look at people who own dogs in apartments and breeding dogs for particular aesthetics that lead to breathing or spinal issues? It's cruel to lock an animal in an apartment for hours on end or that struggles to breathe its entire life because you wanted it to look "cute".
you cant be an animal lover and not be vegan
1. Yes we all fucking know about greyhound racing is fucked. It’s recent and consistent news, like horses being put down after the Melbourne cup. 

2. Relating it to the olympics is fucking stupid. Makes as much sense as saying “oh you are watching the footy, here’s some greyhound torture facts”.
I was involved in the greyhound industry in the 70s and 80s when I was a boy. I saw animal cruelty. I saw the racing animals fed and treated better than the trainer's families. But the racing dogs were presented in magnificent order and had to be declared fit to race by a respected vet or they would be scratched. I can confidently say that the racing animals were treated extremely well, after all, they were the trainers meal ticket. Other animals involved in the process met a more dire fate.
Get greyhound racing into brissy 2032 Olympics
Shut up.
Ok.

I’m going to regret asking but what does blood mean in this context
Fuck this is a shit story. But I've got to say as horrible as it is, I'd rather the cunts get reported. If they find dead dogs on the property it just strengthens the case for animal abuse.
Excuse my ignorance, but what is blooded?
The actual dog racing sport - lure coursing - is so incredibly niche that if you’re lucky you might win back the entry fee in dog related prizes. I can guarantee when grey racing is banned there will be no uptick in lure coursing
But pokies machines done get emaciated and euthanised😤
People do race dogs for run without money being involved. It's called lure coursing, and is an ANKC sanctioned sport.

However, sighthound breeds are the only breeds that have the option to actually run with other dogs on the same field (max 3 on the field, aka a trio). Other breeds/mixes can compete, but they run solo and are competing for points towards an individual title. Points are earned based on the dog's coursing ability (enthusiasm, speed, agility, accuracy etc). 

There is also SprintDog, which is sort of like dog drag races (100m straight sprint) but again, dogs run solo and are playing for points towards an individual title rather than "beating" other dogs. 

Notably, despite these two dog sports being suuuuper popular (SprintDog can have over 100 entrants per night), you won't see any greyhound trainers showing up to run their dogs. No money to be won = no interest from them. 
Of course they would; it's called coursing when done seriously, but yeah people would.
This.
This is a sad but true fact. Look at the Olympic equestrian rider who just pulled out after a video came out of her whipping a horse across it's legs 24 times in a minute in a training session.
Yep, the meat industry is a great example of this. Intensive animal agriculture kills orders of magnitude more animals than greyhound racing does, and the conditions are equally inhumane. You won't get over 300 upvotes for making post about it though.
100%. I used to live with people who showed dogs, and the amount of animal cruelty even in that was surprising.

For example, many owners would yell and hit their dogs for not standing or walking correctly, it was pretty common to see dogs shaking all over from fear while they were competing.  
And some competitors were known to kidnap other competitors dogs, kill them, or slash their faces, so they couldnt compete.

It was awful. I think all competitions that have any financial gain should be banned. (Even indirect financial gain because many dont show dogs for the prizes, but to get a better reputation as dog breeders so they can charge more or get more clients.)
Greyhounds, horses, betting, online gambling, casinos, pokies, lotto, now gift cards. That’s Australia. Fucking disgraceful.

Edit: payday loans.
The secret is that they run on cat firmware.
I want one too! But I have a pet rabbit 😬 some can still be compatible with small animals, provided the behaviour assessments all come up good, but I'm not risking it for now.
I have one and we lived in an apartment just fine!  They need an enclosed space to zoom a couple times a week,  otherwise a couple walks a day suffices.
My extended family has rehomed a number of greyhounds over the past 6-8 years. So many of them had to have many/most teeth removed due to lack of last care, stomach issues and several have come in terrified of men. It’s so sweet when they learn how to be dogs. They’re such goofy, sweet animals.
To be fair, my grey broke a toe slowly running around a park. Some greys (including pet greys) repetitively dislocate a toe and amputation is kinder than repeat pain.
I can only imagine what was said or done to Baird that made him suddenly change his mind.
> He backflipped shortly after. Not sure if it was related to money or whether he was paid a visit by someone involved in racing but it just shows the corruption that must be involved. 

Baird went out on a limb against the wishes of the Nationals and others within his party. Then Labor decided to push the idea that it was anti working class and the whole thing was sunk.

So depressing that Labor stood against one of the few times that what a Liberal premier wanted aligned with the right thing to do.
I can’t watch this. But tell me, is this still happening..? 
I think it’s actually about 1/5 😭

Please give your boy a boop for me and here’s Jayce in return https://imgur.com/a/96IhRaF
Sometimes the bull wins, at least for a short time.
I always forget about rodeos because they aren't popular/events we see around where i live but just as atrocious. Really everything with animals needs to be banned at this point...
Other sports may have their own kinds of danger, but shit, at least the athletes are able to consent to said dangers.
Equestrian sports is an important part of English/Anglo Australia  culture and tradition so it shouldn’t be banned but needs to improve. No one would dare the tell Mongolians to stop their horse racing tradition.
Have also heard about the owner stepping on the dog's paws as they are loading them into the gates when they need that dog to lose, from a person who is in the industry.
This is just false. Dogs are drug tested randomly on the night, tested if they win and if it’s a group race every dog will be tested. They’re not on meth. 

Dogs are also weighed pre race and have it compared to their previous starting weight, if a dog was loaded with bread or water, it’s not going to be racing as it will be overweight. 

Hate the industry all you want but don’t spread rubbish.
So horse racing no good either?   Pigeon racing?   Ferreting for rabbits… not a sport.. more of a hobby/ food acquisition/ pest control… but still uses animals. ?   Can we raise budgies and breed them?   I once had a chicken called Oscar Goldstein and she loved to chase me around the house… but I would not think of that was a sport… so probably ok.

Awww gorgeous, give him a boop from me please! This is Jayce. I rescued him when he was three and now he turns seven in November 😅 https://imgur.com/a/Znuurs4
I think it’s estimated they breed around 14,000 puppies per year and at least ~20% are initial wastage. Plus 80% of greyhounds are bred via surgical artificial insemination which is such a cruel and inhumane practice it’s banned in most countries
Yep - at least in Australia we have an independent rescue in most states and I encourage people looking to foster or adopt to go via an independent rescue as you’ll get more support and you won’t be supporting the industry’s terrible practices that flow through to its rehoming of dogs.

For a recent example of this, the closure of GAP Wye (putting 70+ greyhounds in limbo) [is a good example.](https://www.instagram.com/p/C70x7sVy81L/?igsh=eWk3OWczaWVzeTZx)

In fairness, greyhounds are kind of important in terms of blood donation (which goes on to save the lives of the pets of the general public when their dogs have major medical emergencies requiring transfusions) because almost all of them have a universal blood type which means their blood can be used for any dog that needs it regardless of the recipient dog's blood type.

Once a week is probably too often though. Places like USYD vet clinic, SASH etc run canine blood banks but they'll only do a dog once every 2-3 months. You also don't get paid for it, though you might get a voucher for the clinic. 

Unfortunately given that most people won't volunteer their pets to be donors (or they don't meet criteria, like mine), greyhounds kind of do play a vital role in saving other dogs' lives.
Agreed, add meat eating to the list as well.
A big difference between horse racing and equestrian sport is the horses do not start competeing at a young age, a young horse competeing at olympics is usually around 8-10 years old. Race horses start around 3 years old when growth plates are still there, this is one reason we see alot of fractures and breaks in legs/shoulders/hips etc....
In saying this you of course still see injuries in equestrian sport, but no where near as often. 

Show jumping and eventing is also very different to horse jumps racing. They literally want the horse to go as fast as possible in jumps races which is highly dangerous with alot of evidence of such. Show jumping and eventing will use speed in varying amounts because accuracy is more important than speed alone. They never gallop over obstables/jumps. 

I think the main concerns is how are the horses being treated during training, day to day life and what equipmemt is being used, such as bits and nosebands.
I’d saw there is a difference between show jumping / lil horse dances compared to the Aussie racing industry. You don’t have to like either though but they’re very different levels

And even if a comparable statistic could be found - the human participants were able to contest to participant (which means they were able to appreciate the risk and make an informed decision) - something that greyhounds or any dog cannot do
Banned only in NSW and the ACT (and NSW backflipped). There’s an active industry in every other state and NT
They run, yes (genetics and training). But consent requires an ability to appreciate risk and make an informed choice, something they can’t do which is why it’s up to owners of dogs to make that assessment in a dogs best interest (and obviously the racing industry fails that tenfold).

[Here’s footage of my boy being forced into a start box.](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9iUsMTzZMM/?igsh=MWZiNjJ3cW45a2x0Yg==)

I agree the off track horrors are a lot worse but due to a lack of independent regulators and whole of life tracking we’re usually reliant on anecdotal reports (easier for pro racers to refute) rather than the cold hard on track stats.
Horses are much more expensive to raise than dogs, this would limit the tendency to cull and mistreat them.
Look up the word nexus. 

Olympics. Athletes. Consenting and getting paid to do it. 

Doh/horse racing. Animal cruelty. Creatures who cannot consent, forced to endure barbaric conditions for the enjoyment of losers on a betting app.
My greyhound is very happy living in an apartment and has never willingly step foot on our balcony. He’s also very happy to be left alone for a full work day as he just gets uninterrupted naps. We used to get a dog walker to take him out for a lunchtime walk/ pee break but he started refusing to stand up 🤣

Apartments are not inherently bad, any owner no matter the dwelling type can be a bad owner by not meeting a dog’s physical and mental needs and I’d argue that generally apartments force owners to be better as you have to leave them for dogs to toilet which gives them stimulation and exercise.
Agree, however, I think that people accepting that greyhound racing is animal abuse is still a step towards them realising that raising and killing them for our consumption is also abuse. You don't become vegan overnight & being against dog racing is a step in the right direction and shows at least some empathy toward animals.
It has to keep being talked about until it is shut down.
Well it’s got people’s attention hasn’t it? And given that pro racers call it a sport and greyhounds athletes I thought it was apt to draw the distinction.
Olympics have equestrian sports, thus horses, thus possability of mistreatment/abuse concerns.
> Makes as much sense as saying “oh you are watching the footy, here’s some greyhound torture facts”.

I mean, what's wrong with that?
It doesn’t matter how well they’re treated off track if they face inherent danger everytime they’re put on track. 320 greyhounds died on track in 2023 and a further 11,600 were injured.
Feeling attacked?
And your point is? That that fact makes greyhound racing okay? Looking forward to seeing your advocacy about slave labour as you seem so concerned about it to make comments on entirely unrelated posts.
Pretty sure it means that they've been trained to catch and kill animals. Rabbits, possums, probably a lot worse (maybe even other dogs, who knows). The point is, once blooded, they live for the kill, and hence, dangerous.

It's a horrible thing because as a breed they are the most gentle gorgeous animals. We've got a greyhound that was a rescue and he's the most gentle soul you'll ever meet.
Using live animals (e.g., rabbits) in training. 
Had the same question, Google gave me two options. Both equally horrifying. 

1. Live baiting. Giving the dogs a taste of blood using live bait. This obviously makes the dogs unsuitable for adoption. 

2. Unwanted dogs are used as blood donors before they're put down. Essentially drained in blood before they're killed.
I’m pretty sure it refers to a dog who has been trained using live animals as lures that they get to kill at the end.
For those unsure whar this is ABC 4 corners did a story on live baiting in the greyhound industry years ago. It is worth watching, but warning it is very disturbing.

I can see both sides, and both are equally as impelling to me. 

On the one hand, I'm glad that there are people who care so much about the dogs that they are willing to foster good relationships with the abusers so that the animals can be turned in safely. 

On the other hand, I can see how allowing the treatment to happen may be the only way to get enough prosecutions for action to happen. 

I think, on reflection, that I fall on the side of the rescuers.
When me grandparents were doing greyhound racing I learned that blooding involved starving the dog and then locking them in a small space with a live rabbit so they'd kill and eat it, it was meant to make them chase harder. Thankfully for how shit my grandparents were they never blooded their hounds, especially since they'd let me and all the other neighbourhood kids play with them and sleep in their kennels at nap time lmfao.
Live animals in training, someone else said it further up
Like all dog events lol you spend a hundred bucks for a weekend of trials and maybe you'll win a stuffed toy, or a voucher for DNA testing, or maybe even a $3 ribbon if you get REAL lucky and hit the jackpot 😂
Found the fellow dog sports person 😆 You beat me to it.
Yes well. Let's hope lure coursing can stay well away from the long-standing culture of  cruelty and overall shit show that dog breeders have created and firmly entrenched for God knows what reason.
Money can change people. My cousin who grew up loving horses and was a lovely guy turned into an animal abuser via being a race horse trainer - all about money and winning.
But but but the horse riders LOVE their horses and don't only treat them as a means to an end!!!!

Fuck right off with that. I don't trust anyone who uses animals for sport
Whilst I agree with the sentiment, not *all* of the conditions are equally inhumane. There is ethical meat available, and Australian meat at that... we have a *lot* of regulations, just not enough people checking.... but it's still working towards being the norm across the industry.

Greyhound racing has no practical purpose at all. There is nothing provided to the whole population that justifies any of it. The animals are not happy and healthy, they are not taken care of or a part of a pack, they're trained to chase and then they're locked up. It's messed up.

My brother sent his greyhound to a training place, and she came back after 2 weeks with a raw tail and sores on her nose. She was miserable. He never sent her again.

Eta: Point is that the meat industry has a purpose and regulations and lots of people looking at it. The Greyhound issue, not so much and it's results benefits no one - except the owner and their associate's wallets.
They really, really do. People are always surprised that they're strongly recommended for apartment living, because they're basically 100mph couch potatoes.
Please don’t give their secrets away like this
"It’s so sweet when they learn how to be dogs."  
hmmmmm not sure about that ... i think mine has decided that she is a cat.... :D
My girl uses it as an excuse to get out of doing things she doesn't want to do, I discovered this when she produced the "Greyhound scream of death" and started limping when we were at the dog park.   I got her out of the park and was walking to the car when she forgot that she was "putting it on" and started to trot along without a care in the world, I turned around to go back to the park and she let out a howl and started limping again until I turned around and headed back to the car again!!!!. :D
If they chose to ban the horse racing at the same time Labor would have supported it but then the LNP would have withdrawn support for it.
Yep - one of the items included in my post was a sentence for people found to have been live baiting last year (on a property shared with other trainers and no one dobbed it in 🫠)
Yes, and not just in NSW - it’s happening in every state that has greyhound racing. Greyhound racing trainers are the scum of the earth.
It might be part of the culture and tradition but I refute that it's "important". Cultures and traditions are not static and should change as needed.
I’d describe it as a niche interest of a select few rather than an important part of our culture.
You could say the same about cock or dog fighting, but I know you wouldn't.
Culture can fuck off and die in a hole if it involves cruelty. What a shitty excuse. Also, "culture" refers to the beliefs, values, customs, and behaviours that characterise a society. Culture is ever-changing, and as we learn more about how our actions cause suffering to others, we can adjust our cultural practices to better reflect our values as a society. Why on earth would you advocate against that?
And FGM is also a cultural practice. Should it be allowed?
Equestrian sports have been tied to wealth for as long as they existed, I wouldn't say it's ever been wider culture. The Equestrian events rarely tie into the culture of Australia and its horses, except maybe in herding competitions

You tried
Empathy is a skill you learn. It's not just for people either. You can, if you want, empathise with animals and how they are treated. They aren't mindless. Cruelty begets cruelty and you appear to have no shame. It could also be that you are too stupid to think any deeper on this issue. Fuck you and all people like you
this place had around 40 greyhounds in crates, they were allowed out twice a day for short amounts of time.  Mine lived there for 2 years, it was run by a person that USED to be a vet and no longer held a valid license.   Its much different then places where people bring in their pets to donate blood.  No photos or videos of the place were allowed either. It was not a good place for the dogs to be and it has recently been shut down.  So in all fairness, you dont know.   My dog was also give medication to aid in creating more blood so they could take more at each blood letting.  Medication that was NOT needed for a condition he does not have and many other greyhounds  were given it also (I've spoken to at least 20 other owners who got their dogs from this place, all but one of them was on this medication, none had the condition).

We have  a local emergency vet place that also does blood donor stuff, and totally run by owners volunteering their dogs. They then give that blood to vets who need it for surgeries.
I think another distinction between racing and eventing is horses often enjoy cross country, especially at a high level it would be dangerous to have an unwilling horse doing it. My old horse loved cross country, it combined 2 of her favourite things: jumping and going fast, she was a bit of an adrenaline junkie really.
Dunno about that, "lil horse dances" aka dressage has a pretty well known history of some wildly abusive practices. I mean...Charlotte DuJardin bailed on the Olympics this year because of that video of her beating a student's horse across the hind legs with a whip to try to force it to do, a passage I think? Piaffe? One of them. And STILL people are defending her. 

And let's not get started on Rollkur.

People just aren't as aware of it, because most people see dressage on TV one time every 4 years and don't have any broader contextual knowledge of the sport or the abuse.
You would be surprised how many people can afford horses but cant be bothered caring for them, at least once the novelty wears off.
Horse racing needs to be seen separately from equestrian sports like what you see at the Olympics. Horse racing really isn’t any different from the dogs, especially for the trotting horses. Lots of abuse, lots of drug use, lots of horses being killed every week once they’re not useful. You can sell horses through the auctions for meat prices—they are going into pet food.
I see you extrapolated your own assumptions from a question.
Why would it step foot on the balcony? That's not really being outside and free to explore is it?  

Look, I get it. I've owned dogs before and it's hard to remove your wants, needs and emotions from the situation but at the end of the day, the dogs didn't really get a choice did they? They were placed in an apartment and told this is home. Do you think if the choices were an expansive farm, a huge backyard and big house or an apartment, the dogs would really choose to live in a small boxy apartment?
Yes that's a dog dead a day. Not good. But I reckon there would be at least a dog a day run over by cars owned by people who neglected their pets. I don't know your background, but I know what I know and greyhounds are treated better than most people.
I didn't post that here. So confusing.
This is 100% true!!

We had a whippet and I miss him..

He was an absolute gentle and affectionate companion..he loved our kids, he was amazing. He was a rescue dog as well....
I wish I hadn't googled this
Yeah, that's actually banned and can be a jailable offence for animal cruelty.
Any live animals....
It refers to 1. However number 2 is very common as most Greyhounds have a universal blood type which can be used for transfusions on other animals. 
I’ve fostered 10 greyhounds, they are amazing dogs. One girl, Velvet, was too small to race being the runt of the litter and was rescued from a Vet clinic after being a blood donor. She had scars all over, but one very deep and prominent scar above her femoral artery. My cousin (who is a vet) saw it and said you’d never do that on an animal you want to survive, it’s aimed at getting maximum blood in a short period of time. 
It’s a disgusting sport and so is anyone who supports it.
Greyhound bleeding (your point 2 - basically taking all their blood then euthanising) is a big thing in Queensland and I’m pretty sure UQ is complicit in it

https://greyhoundcoalition.com/media-resources/terminal-blood-donation/
It's #1. I think Four Corners did a story on it a while ago. 


For some reason I remember it being that the live rabbits were strapped to that little wire thing that runs around the track ahead of the dogs. Either that or my mind is so fucked up that it made that part up and I now remember it as fact
That’s like choosing between Satan and Cthulhu.
It’s just a shame that the consequences of treating animals so poorly are “tsk, tsk, here’s a pittance of a fine, don’t do it again!” And they let them keep owning animals. If it were heavy fines, bans and jail time then reporting them would be more worthwhile.
Disgusting!
There are dozens of us. Dozens! 😆
I'm unsure what "long standing culture of cruelty" dog breeders are responsible for, and I'm even less sure how you could conflate that with happy dogs chasing a plastic bag in a field. 

It's been a sport, like many other dog sports in Australia, for decades. You just typically don't hear about these dog sports because there's no money involved, so the only people participating in them are people who actually give a shit about spending time and money on their dogs with zero chance of any financial return.
>  My cousin who grew up loving horses and was a lovely guy turned into an animal abuser via being a race horse trainer

I mean he was already an abuser while growing up, it was just in ways that people find acceptable, they don't call it "breaking" because it's a fun and enjoyable experience for horses.
> There is ethical meat available

Except there isn't, as even if you want to ignore the argument that you can never ethically kill another being to exploit its resources, you would never be able to have "ethical" operations that handle the scale and magnitude of consumption within the country.

> we have a lot of regulations, just not enough people checking.... but it's still working towards being the norm across the industry.

We have the regulations but they are not enforced, and if you were to blow the whistle on them you'll be immediately frozen out of near every industry imaginable, even worse if you "illegally" record footage of said abuses you'll face a worse sentence than someone who goes on a rape murder spree in an orphanage. Our government has put a -lot- of resources into punishing anyone who speaks up on the atrocities of our farming system.
We don't really have much ethical meat at all. Nothing farmed is ethical. I guess you could argue that some game meat is ethical though.
I introduce mine by saying he is silent, clean and dry. They aren’t really dogs.
Dog hardware,  cat software 😁
Not sure where you're getting that from to be honest. Foley was always fairly vocally pro horse racing, and the year before the greyhound scandal was spruiking a massive tax cut for the horse racing industry. The year after he was pushing for the barrier draw for the Everest horse race to be held on the Harbour bridge.
Oh noooo 
Horse racing is a niche interest of a large number of cultures.
Is it part of Australian heritage? No.
Yes, rogue trainers can attempt to use prohibited substances but as you point out, the regulator catches them through drug testing. You said trainers use meth to get a race result they want, rogue trainers can try and they’ll get caught out. 

The industry has robust drug testing in place to stamp this out.

You don’t get to claim that meth is being widely used by trainers as a way to win races then link to a source where the industry catches and bans people using prohibited substances to win races.
Never once did I say that the facility your dog was at was in any way acceptable. I was simply clarifying - for Australians, who are the main audience here - why greyhounds are used for blood donation and how it works *in Australia*. Nobody is running dodgy facilities like that here, and it's important that people *in Australia* understand that your experience is simply not something that happens *in Australia*. 

Edit to add: I should say, though, that terminal blood donation IS done on greyhounds here. And that's a practice that IMO is fuckin terrible and shouldn't be legal.
Since having him we’ve gone away several times to places with backyards - he watches us from indoors. Backyards don’t provide enrichment or exercise naturally, human involvement is still needed for that and as a consequence the human involvement can provide the same exercise and enrichment outside of an apartment and backyard. 

I encourage you to rethink what engaged and responsible dog ownership looks like.
Really? Because my post, including the GRNSW vet report, seems to contradict your narrow anecdotal evidence.
So whippet.. good?
So whippet.. good?
Must never happen then...
Yeah and it's psychopathic thinking that this is an acceptable form of training. Dogs were domesticated 10s of thousands of years ago & are mainly companion animals nowadays. Doing this to a dog is so cruel as, from what I understand, it's nigh on impossible rehabilitating dogs once this happens (blooding them).
This is a link to the 4 corners episode. Warning - it is disturbing.

> I'm unsure what "long standing culture of cruelty" dog breeders are responsible for, and I'm even less sure how you could conflate that with happy dogs chasing a plastic bag in a field. 

I mean the context is obviously greyhounds, given the topic of the thread and what you were comparing coursing to, no?
Nah his horses were adopted (along with the rest of his animals), so that process was already done, but I get where you’re coming from.
You think it's ok for it to happen in countries where it is?
The stolen generations are part of our heritage too, and we stopped that nonsense because it's wildly damaging and barbaric.
I love a 'bad apple' argument. 39 'bad apples' (who were caught) in one state in 7 months... gee whiz, it's almost like the whole industry is rotten.
I mean, I think I have a pretty good understanding of responsible dog ownership as my last dog lived an active, healthy life for 17 years without any surgeries or major vet visits. 

His learnt behaviour from sitting in an apartment all day to the point he won't even wander around a backyard when he has the opportunity is honestly pretty sad to hear. 

You can really convince yourself that without you, your dog would literally sit on a couch and never wander outside? I'm also  not saying dogs need to be always sprinting or running. But at the very least should have some choice in being able to wander around outside when they choose without it being when the owner tells them to.
No pal, I have no quarrel with you. I'm on your side, I'm an animal lover but will kill rats, mice, mosquitoes, cock roaches and cane toads. Just saying, it is contradictory for greyhound trainers to mistreat their dogs if they want to win races and prize money.
I’ve met several whippets named Devo
Whippet real good.
Agreed 💯%
I was unsure, because I was talking about lure coursing (which is open to all breeds/mixes) and you specifically referenced "dog breeders" rather than "greyhound breeders" specifically. 

So I genuinely wasn't sure if you had an issue with ALL dog breeders, or whether by "dog breeders" you only meant greyhound breeders. Apologies for my confusion. 
Devils advocate but if we are using the "whole industry is rotten" then wouldn't every single trainer or owner get caught or test positive? Not 39 in 7 months? (Like do you have any idea how many dog trainers are actively working in the whole state? If you got a thousand then that's 39 in 1000 hardly the entire industry and we both know there would be many more than a thousand registered in the state)

I get what you ate saying but that's hyperbole, yes there are bad cases but assuming everyone is doing the wrong thing is like assuming everyone steals or speeds, some do but not all and especially not all judging by the rates people are caught
Do you have any idea how many greyhound races have occurred in 7 months in NSW? 39 is nothing. 

Also a positive substance violation does not mean someone has intentionally doped a dog. 

A positive substance could be a completely legal medication that just can’t be in a dogs system on race day. For example one dog on the first page of that link had Cimetidine in its system, it’s a stomach acid reducer. Not every positive substance infraction is something sinister. 

I do not care if you hate the industry, that’s completely fine, I was just pointing out some mistruths in the original comment I replied to.
[Well they aren’t the smartest bunch are they?](https://amp.abc.net.au/article/102632778)
Just whippet!
39 is just those that got caught. Everyone knows your industry is largely corrupt as fuck, so 39 is just the tip of the iceberg
Well natashagb95, perhaps they are not. We are so wonderfully superior, we can sit back and be judgemental. Some types or individuals do what they can and what they know to sustain their families and if that doesn't meet our approval, I doubt they really care what you or I think.
Whippet, whippet good..
I’m not involved in the industry, I don’t own or train greyhounds. I don’t even bet on greyhounds. I don’t care if people want to ban greyhound racing, if that’s what you support that is totally fine by me. 

I was just pointing out that the original comment saying trainers used meth on their dogs and made them come in overweight as a way to rig races just isn’t true.
Making money by putting a living creature in inherent danger for gambling profits is not an ethical way to make money. These people have more of a choice regarding their income than the dogs they injure and kill for their income.
How do you even know if you aren’t involved?
I can see your point. But what does ethical mean? Gambling profits? Most greyhound trainers can't afford to bet. They are running for prizemoney. Some have been indoctrinated into a kind of cycle, so their lifestyle choices are  limited.
Probably better off if we just put all the trainers down, instead of the poor dogs.
Did you know in every state there's an 'appearance fee' which they get for entering dogs in meets? This encourages the over-racing of dogs (making them more injury prone) to just get the appearance fee. This is money, paid by state governments from taxation they collect.

  
It's not about the trainers betting on dogs. It's about them putting dogs in inherent danger and counting that as a job (as well as the systems and structures that allow it to continue). And if the trainers can't see the writing on the wall and get out or re-skill well that's on them for when the industry is finally shut down. I have no sympathy for anyone complicit in hurting animals for entertainment and gambling and calling that a 'job'.
