This genius level vox pop was hosted by the renowned Andrew L. Urban and produced by the esteemed Margaret Pomeranz of The Movie Show fame. 

Watching it recently made me wonder whether those who were interviewed were even aware their interviews were being revisited, decades later, on national TV? 

I thought it would be interesting, given the change in tech permitting the type of wide coverage and interaction which this site permits, to ask whether any of the members of r/Australia were either interviewed by, or were perhaps friends with or related to those being interviewed on this fascinating gem of a historical cultural document?

Love that show and how candid people were with him.

Every time I see an episode on SBS I feel like tracking down Andrew L. Urban (probably here?):   
https://pursuedemocracy.com/contact-us/  
and asking him to please release all of his information so that I could build a wikipedia page that somehow doesn't currently exist but I'm a lazy bastard.

All the episodes from all of the seasons are available, so some of the bare bone information is there to be compiled but it would be good to get his input?

Fantastic show and some really interesting characters.
There was that show a bit later too, set of a commuter train with a regular cast that were friends just chatting about shit.
simpler times !
[A young Andrew G/Osher Gunsberg](https://m.facebook.com/watch/?v=695469117718629) "You can't possibly want me on this" to "I feel very weird telling you all this." - Andrew Urban had a knack.

I was under the misapprehension that Urban had passed away quite a while ago yet was pleased to discover that he's still well and truly with us, according to IMDB and so there's some hope for his carefully coaxing interview technique to yield even more episodes for us to enjoy, perhaps?
Thanks for the advice and information. I've now posted it to r/AusrtralianNostalgia too.
Going Home on SBS
that was good, I  watched some of that.
Nice find! Everyone seemed more chill back then. Miss those days.
Is that the Queen Street Mall in Brisneyland?
That's good to know. Ah if only....
didn't he present select movies of the week on SBS  some years back? I could be wrong....
I don't usually like reboots but its ripe for another go.
Yep, There were a few eps filmed in Brisbane, and I think Melbourne, IIRC. Most were Sydney
No idea - I'd guess Bondi or surrounds cos that was Osher's stomping ground.
I think you may be right.
