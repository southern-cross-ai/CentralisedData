Oh fuck this! Poor cunt wont be able to have Avo Toast anymore. Let's all pitch in and help this bloke out.
CEOs compensation has increased 1,460.2% from 1978 to 2021  During that time, the typical worker’s annual compensation grew 18.1%.  
  
This is why these days people with full time jobs often cannot afford to feed and house themselves.  The CEO's are getting all the pie.
Good (though he still gets a golden parachute to the tune of around $13 million).


Aside from no one needing that much money, despite his achievements whilst CEO, he has absolutely trashed the brand and pretty much any trust or reputation that it once had. I always thought it was absolutely disgusting that he could walk away with that much money.
even monkey can run Cuntas, sack people, o/s Maintenace, jack up the ticket price, monopoly the airport slot, set your own salaries and bonuses.
Considering the shit job he did as CEO, all while demanding a pay packet multiple times the size of far larger and more successful airlines, he should get zero.
Only $10m?
Wake me up when these are permanent pay cuts instead of short-term bonus cuts.
Oh no, how can he possibly survive on... $12mil? Poor poor Joycey, he's only got enough money to last... 12 Lifetimes.
Diddums
My heart fuckin bleeds.
Good.
i hope the money goes to improving qantas.
Damn, poor guy. I do hope he'll be okay!
Someone should start a go-fund-me for him /s
Only 10mil?
My heart bleeds for him
Waaaaaah
Haha sucko !
this will feel like not enough for some but a ~40% pay cut is a fair whack. Good on the board for finally having some balls to hold execs somewhat accountable.
Even that is too much!! The same should be done to politicians!
Fuck the rich
Can we please launch him to the moon as punishment
Great news. Absolute drip of a human being who destroyed an airline.
All he wanted was a succulent Chinese meal
#prayformillionaires
Is he going to share some of the $14m with the many customers and staff who suffered from his poor decisions?
Sadly, he can have all the avo toast he wants still .. lol

Makes no sense.
It has also [outstripped market growth](https://www.epi.org/publication/ceo-pay-in-2021/), and there's evidence that [higher pay does not equate to better performance](https://repub.eur.nl/pub/20029/).


>This is why these days people with full time jobs often cannot afford to feed and house themselves. The CEO's are getting all the pie.


It's a bit more complex than that, but broadly, the excessive executive pay culture we have is not serving shareholders particularly well. Lots of CEOs are being rewarded extremely generously for doing a mediocre or even poor job. Look at how the CEO of Boeing got [$32 million in compensation](https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/05/business/boeing-ceo-pay/index.html) despite completely trashing Boeing's reputation and delivering an aircraft that killed hundreds of people. 
What's your source on the typical worker's compensation only going up 18.1% in that period? Inflation was 862% over the same period. 18.1% would leave that typical worker at a fraction of minimum wage and unable to afford even the most basic necessities.
why are you using accumulated growth with 'annual growth', or are you just repeating something you don't understand?
125 million to be exact, paid by the taxpayer.
But once in a while you get asked few tough questions in parliament which you can refuse to reply. 

Or get smacked with a feather on 7 News when you screw your customers once again, blaming them for delays and other shit.

Not so easy hey? :)
He actually had a legally binding fiduciary responsibility to the company and its share holders. 

Under Australian law, CEOs are required to act in the best interests of the company and its shareholders. This duty is codified in the Corporations Act 2001, which outlines that directors and officers must act with due care, diligence, and in good faith. Failing to do so can lead to severe consequences, including civil penalties, disqualification, and even criminal charges.

**Fiduciary** 

adjective:

 1.   Of or relating to a duty of acting in good faith with regard to the interests of another.
   
 "a company's fiduciary responsibility to investors."

 2. Of or being a trustee or trusteeship.
 3. Held in trust.

Scraped from the front page, first result of a Duckduckgo search for the word 'fiduciary'.

General duties still apply

Don't use it all at once.

Peace.
It's a good start but it's nowhere near enough.
Amazing how all his bonuses came from theft rather than real corporate performance.
I mean he was fired, that’s a pretty permanent pay cut.
I guess so, but he earnt $120m over his time there. To those ends, does it really even matter to him? Still obscenely wealthy
#JeSuisMillionaire
He probably won't
When the people making the decisions are the ones setting the pay rates as well it does.
I was curious as well. Figures appear to be taken from the US based Economic Policy Institute 

https://www.epi.org/publication/ceo-pay-in-2021/

While growing inequality is an issue in Australia, I doubt it's quite as drastic as it is in the US.
Well, just send journalists on a junket and [they'll be eating out of your hands and singing your praises](https://www.smh.com.au/traveller/travel-news/qantas-new-non-stop-route-to-europe-takes-off-20240603-p5jiue.html), because they're easily bought off due to the fact they have no integrity whatsoever. 
>He actually had a legally binding fiduciary responsibility to the company and its share holders.

No argument there. The problem is he was overall pretty useless. He's destroyed staff morale, trashed the brand, undertaken what is most likely illegal actions in relation to the workforce and sold tickets to cancelled flights. And that's before we get into the almost complete lack of strategic planning that has left Qantas with a (mostly) outdated fleet which it is now trying to patch up during an aircraft production shortage.
> The Qantas board will also dock the short-term bonuses for current and former senior executives by 33 per cent.
10m is still 10m. Won't change anything massively for him but I'm sure it will sting.
I swear I'd do the same if I could set my salary. Politicians and CEO/board members are really sweet gigs. One makes rules for themselves and other sets pay for themselves.
yeah I knew it couldnt be Australian, we've had amazing wealth growth,

I've seen yankee wage growth media/average/low income its "this can't be real" low
How much did the board pay for him during his tenure? Just so I understand what best talent costs, and what do board mean by you got to spend big bucks to get the best. If this  is the best, then it's NDIS and robodebt level messed up.
67% of an overinflated package is still overinflated.
Absolute power corrupts absolutely. 

It’s human nature to take and take. Those rare types who don’t take absolutely and greedily are the rare types we should celebrate.
Just want to emphasise - two things can be true. We're not the basket case the Yanks, and there has definitely been a growing gap between productivity and average wage gains in Australia.

https://australiainstitute.org.au/post/ten-years-of-productivity-growth-but-no-increase-in-real-wages/

Divergence seems to have taken hold around 2000, and the numbers look even worse post pandemic.
definitely true, corporations gaming the 'system'

Its kind of exploded since the 2007 financial crisis, it feels like everyone saw Australia did ok and realised its riped for the picking
