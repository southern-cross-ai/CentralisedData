What would be the minimum qualifications I should attain?

If I want to make my self attractive to mining companies what would you recommend on top of the minimum qualifications?

Are there any mining companies that would pay for my training? maybe at a lower hourly rate?

I'm only interested in driving mining trucks (Caterpillar, Komatsu... etc) 

not road transport trucks...

Any tips for a first timer in the mining industry?

Thanks heaps.

As far as FIFO work goes, the rates are on the lower end, and companies are moving toward fully autonomous.
Just go to seek and you will see 'trainee dump truck operator' jobs everywhere.
Having the same issue - have all my tickets but finding it hard to get in the door after changing industries.
Companies like programed will train you up. 

Just google entry level jobs and you'll usually find a training program or course that will train you - starting salary around 100k. 

Be warned - it's a very boring mundane job. It's basically being a bus driver but for hundreds of tons of earth.

If you wanna get into mining you either gotta know someone or get lucky with an “Entry Level” position! Just keep applying! You’ll score one
I worked a gold mine a few years ago and all the drivers between 9 and 3 were mums from the local town. 


I seem to recall they all did onsite training.
