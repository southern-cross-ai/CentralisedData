Hi guys, I bought a Fold 6 that had some issues and decided to return it. 

I spoke to Samsung over the phone and they asked me to email photos thru to prove the device is in good condition I guess? 

That was nearly 4 weeks ago and I can't get a reply from their support over email. I've been into the Samsung store and they can't help me apparently due to it being an online order. 

The biggest issue apart from this is I had a trade in on my old phone which the company is charging me late fees ( total of $120 atm) as Samsung hasn't told them I've returned my new device and keeping my old one. 

I've sent Samsung and this company a total of 8 emails and have been calling Samsung multiple times for over 4-5 hours going by my call log. I'm really over it and has given me a bad taste for Samsung which is disappointing because my old phone was good. 

What would be the best way to tackle this? Do I need to approach an Ombudsman, I don't think Samsung really cares about giving me my money back.

samsung are scammers on warranties.

There been over the last few months huge amounts of a scammy practices on PC's and TV's.  Cant imagine phones are any different

Go to your state fair trading
Drop the words 'TIO Obudsmen' and see what happens.
Mobile phone handsets are under the white goods in the ACCC. But complaints should be via your states Dept. Commerce or similar.

"When providing repairs, you must fix the problem within a reasonable time. What is ‘reasonable’ will depend on the circumstances.  

<snip>

 a consumer could reasonably expect their phone to be repaired within one to two weeks. This includes the time it takes you to assess the phone, communicate the nature of the fault and remedy with the consumer, and carry out repairs"

Yeah I had a Samsung D520? Slide phone. The cunt had a bad charge port and the sliding mechanism was fucked. Sent it to Samsung who assessed it for 12 weeks and sent it back saying "uneconomical to repair". 
That's it. No fucking refund or anything. Dick smith who are gone now didn't help at all. 
Yeah it's BS I will never buy another Samsung product because of this.
Yeah the TVs burn even thought they guarantee it won’t. The first time they replaced it because it’s under warranty but the second lasted less than the warranty duration but they won’t take responsibility for it. They only offer to sell you a screen at a “good customer” rate.

Scumsung can get bent on everything.
I remember them trying to gaslight people into thinking that dead pixels on a monitor were just fine actually back in the 00's.

Samsung have always been dodgy cunts.
Bought a Samsung washing machine, it was a piece of shit and they refused to fix it under warranty because we were more than x km from their warehouse. We live near Hornsby ffs, it’s metropolitan Sydney! 

Ended up replacing it with an LG which has been so much more reliable.
