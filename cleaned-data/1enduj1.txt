Would love it if they bothered to turn their radios a few times when do a pass over Australia so we could contact them.

Australia gets left out a lot of the time, astronomically speaking.
We really are girt by sea
Can you imagine?

"Oi! Cunts! This is Australia! Over."
I'm laughing, but in truth you need a license to operate the type of radios that can communicate with the ISS.  Part of the license requirements is that you need to identify your callsign.

ACMA can get a bit cheesed off if it gets reported that you are swearing.
