Up late again watching these amazing women in the pool for us. Completely led the way, all these incredible female athletes these games. Makes you proud af. 🇦🇺👊🇦🇺👊 (Nice cherry on top beating the US in 2nd to 🤣) 
Our women's swim team has been world beaters for eons.

Dawn Fraser was the first woman under a minute in the 100 free and won it at three Olympic Games and would've done four if she didn't steal a flag and fuck up her swimming career. Was unheard of at the time and barely been done since.

Shane Gould and co took in most of our medals at Munich - with Gould retiring before 18 cause our media were complete fuckwits to her. She held EVERY world record in the pool at the same time. Not even joking.

Then you go through the years with Susie O'Neill, Petria Thomas, Leisel Jones, Libby Tricket, Steph Rice, Emily Seebohm, Jodie Henry and many, many more medallists in the pool.

The latest generation is even better. It's a true era of excellence to have this much talent and we're seeing history with our female swimming cohort currently.
Just an incredible performance by them. What a last stint by Titmus
Girt baby, girt.
Had the pleasure of working with Ariarne a couple years ago, she's so genuinely Aussie larrakin I'm so happy to see her success continue
Just quietly? Eh?
Americans are girt by guns and they didn’t win a single medal in shooting.
when you think of all the millions of Aussie kids who do swimming lessons, these Olympians are the best of them.
Titmus 🐐
Now pay them enough to live on. Sick of seeing stories about Olympic athletes going broke training to go to the games.
Just quietly? Australians are never quiet about sport, it’s almost all they’re talking about. 

Except when they lose.
People are saying TItmus has an unfair advantage because her fingernails are like paddles 😂

Edit to add: source Daily Mail 😂
Girt
You can just say swimmers
Proud of Aussies. Great swimmers. Pretty much great at every sport.
This race was about to start when I had to goto work, knew titmus was out for gold though.
They are truly remarkable. So proud
Mollie!!!
Australia leads the medal tally if you only count females.
This is my first olympics without my grandmother and I just know she would be so so so excited and proud to see this, phoning all of the family making sure everyone knew about it.
Y’all keep misunderstanding the “just quietly” it’s embarrassing lmaooo

It just means like ‘I’m just gonna interrupt whatever you’re talking about bc the Aussie female swimmers are actually fkn incredible’. It’s not intended to downplay, it’s more of a ‘shut up for a moment so we can talk about this bc it’s great’. It IS a post to celebrate them! My goodness lmfao you shouldn’t be on reddit if you lack media literacy
You don't have to be quite about it,
Yell and scream about it please 🥺
Oi oi oi
True sportswomen . All about the team and sport. So refreshing to hear them talk and how they are around each other.
Look at their arms!!!! Holy shieeet
Superwomen. As much as the Olympics doesn’t generally whip me into a frenzy, my respect for the men and women who’ve got there and are doing their thing is immense. What I would give to have even one ounce of their dedication.
Say it with your chest and yell it from the rooftops! No need to be quiet about it!
Aussie Pride, represent!
I sang the anthem so loud the cat took off
Congrats to the women! But also, what the hell have the men been doing? Letting the team down lol
True, they are legends.  Hats off to Katie Ledecky from USA also though.. TIL she holds \*ALL\* the top Twenty (20) fastest ever times in 1500m Freestyle
They are fabulous!
Super duper duper stars!
Why not out loud?
Don’t say it quietly! SCREAM IT FROM THE ROOFTOPS!
How about loudly. Fuck yeah.
No need to be quiet about it. SHOUT ABOUT THEIR BRILLIANCE!
It bought a tear to my eye
Simply put, LEGENDS.
All female elite athletes are incredible.
Australians aren’t quiet
I think all the Aussie swimmers are going well.. even the males
truly world class go girls
Chinese got owned
For some context here after reading some comments lol I'll say this... 

I love seeing any fellow Aussie do amazing things and didn't post with any undertone whatsoever other than heaping praise on these baddass Aussie women killing it in the pool (Let alone out of it; Jess Fox, the BMX girls etc) so would rather just keep that the focus.

The irony of using the words "just quietly" is the opposite is generally inferred as is the case here. I also probably would have said "Aussie Blokes" if the opposite was the case posting now that I think about it.

As far as any woke bs goes... Yes a country we have issues around genders (there's two), DV, discrimination etc that can't be ignored. But social media is the last fukn place they get solved. In reality it does the opposite and just adds to the divide IMO.  So I personally just find it tedious when conversations online always steer that way... But that's just me. 👊🇦🇺
[removed]
What about the men?
The Aus women are team oriented and don't big up others.


They lack a big personality like jananaa put 
Throw enough tax payers money at the Australian swim team and you’ll get these results. Personally I’d rather the money spent on other things. The amount we spend per Gold medal is ridiculous. We’re paying so we can brag about “punching above our own weight”. This mentality drags the nation down.
I will never understand why people give a shit about sport.
Swimming isn't a sport.
[removed]
Shane had words to say on all that in the episode of  ABC's "You Can't Ask That" [focussing on Olympic gold medallists](https://iview.abc.net.au/video/LR1917H004S00).
I remember when Shane Gould was on Australian Survivor, she was what, in her 70s? They had a couple of challenges in water - she absolutely *slaughtered* everyone swimming. It was fantastic.
My stepdaughter is 6 and currently moving through the grades in her swimming class. Watching her dancing around the lounge room singing “Aussie girls, Aussie girls” and saying that one day she wants to swim at the Olympics while we watched the heats brought me almost to tears. Here’s to many more generations of Aussie women excelling in the pool.
Excellence begets excellence
Goes back even further.  Look up Annette Kellerman.
Rumour has it that she didn’t steal the flag.  She took a fall for someone else
They should just call the Australian swim team the Brisbane dolphins because frankly the rest of Australia contributes FUCK ALL.
They are already thinking of erecting a Titmus statue in her hometown here in Tasmania 

https://pulsetasmania.com.au/news/tasmanian-mayor-eyes-statue-of-olympic-gold-medallist-ariarne-titmus/
That swim was so incredible it made me teary with pride and admiration.
I sea what you did there 
We desperately need to write a full song consisting solely of using 'girt' as a euphemism for things that we can sing at every Olympics.
It’s our unique own performance enhancer
I can see that, like the interview where she was saying the crowd was going nuts and mentioned "Bro, its just a heat"
Yeah fuck quietly, let’s shout it from the rooftops!!
Seriously, when has the Australian media ever been quiet about the success of our athletes, let alone the swim team.

So glad OP was able to let us in on this best-kept secret.
I love these Ammosexuals looking at Olympic shooting and making comments that they don't know what they are doing
🤣🤣
We don’t have THOSE kinds of guns! 🤣
Do u think they could really beat those kids?
Ice in the veins!
From where though?
They do. Gina Reinhart looks after that for them.
So bombers fans stop talking about sports in September
> Except when they lose

Exactly, no one's saying anything about the Matildas today despite all the mania we had when they were doing well in the World Cup...
Just quietly, they are being facetious
There was a low point with our swim team years ago. Around the time "The Missile" Magnussen was heavily promoted.

Things went very quiet at that point in time.
We also can’t celebrate without bashing the opposition.
They sussed us out and we thought we’d get away with the fingernail secret 🤫.
Cus the men haven’t won a gold medal yet which is incredible
I think OP is celebrating females by using the word
Olympic Swimming is categorised by sex though so technically female is the correct term to use really   
  
Just saying swimmers makes it seem like its including the males (also incredible just haven't won any gold medals :D)

Men/Women are interchangeable but are also gender terms and we are moving to more gender neutral definitions its probably less accurate than using female!
What’s wrong with saying female swimmers?
He can choose whichever words he wants
I'm also not sure why OP is scared of congratulating them loudly
No we can't, because then the men would be all "I'm a swimmer, I'm a winner" instead of thinking, "I need to try harder" like they bloody should, *not one* medal by an Aussie boy in these Olympics, get your fingers out!
Couldn't have said it better haha thank you 😅
Eh. It’s in the same boat as ‘literally’ imo. Bit overused and a trend within a demographic.
[deleted]
Yeh. I know you’re not supposed to criticise our efforts but the male swimming team hasn’t had a great games. 4 Silvers and 1 bronze thus far.
The men have a lot more competition. There are still a great deal of countries where girls would either be banned, discouraged, or at the very least not encouraged to play sports. Especially sports in which they would be wearing swimsuits. The men in those countries don't have the same impediments.
🙄 here we fucking go….
That is precisely the intended irony of actually saying those words... It's intended to be anything but quiet, hence making the post to highlight it.
I don't understand this comment at all. You're the first and only one to bring up the US... ???
It's meant in good faith not having a proper dig. Take it as acknowledgement of the fact it's satisfying because the USA mostly wins fukn everything
Australians(on reddit) seem to have a massive US hate bones for some reason. You would think more of it would be directed at China who are actively buying their politicians.
They've been poxy... Pull ya finger out lads and bring home some gold. The girls have crushed it.
Australian women seem to do better historically, and I'm tempted to say it's tradition. Australian women's sport has generally been better than the rest of the world, possibly because we give more of a dang about it (relatively speaking).
They are looked after so well they don't have the motivation to try as hard.
It's due to competition. A lot of people love Sport bc when a person or team that they like wins, it means that team is better than the other simply put, and it gives the audience a sense of pride for said team.
It's entertainment. People find it fun to give too much of a dang about sport, because something something patriotism probably.
😳😳😳
[removed]
Fuck knows I wouldn’t want to swim against an Olympian. Training stays even if the body slows down. Their form and experience would still crush youth
That’s bloody fantastic. Fingers crossed for her swimming dreams!
!remind me in 10 years
The Australian team has facilities and training camps in QLD. The weather in Brisbane / the Gold Coast means they can train more comfortably year round. Additionally, people like Gina Rinehart have pushed Brisbane as a swim hub for the team. They go there to advance their swim careers. 

That doesn’t mean they’re all Queenslanders. 

Ariarne Titmus is from Launceston, Emma McKeon is from Wollongong, Kyle Chalmers is from Port Lincoln in SA, etc etc.
Famed brisburnian ariarne titmus
Crazy she’s only 23
I love that the Mayor of Launceston has neck and back of hand tattoos.
Old. Premier claimed her as Queensland's yesterday.
I just hope they do it before she gets married and changes that iconic last name.
Take an upvote you both. That’s all I can give you at the moment. 

Good start to Friday. Haha!
Water you talking about?
Tell me you lack media literacy without telling me you lack media literacy
I’m not sure why but this made me laugh out loud. Just the idea of our Olympic swimmers swimming their hardest against millions of children

Lol I saw some guy the other day setting up an OnlyFans to raise money to compete =\\
Maybe we shouldn’t be relying on billionaires to fund our athletes. Especially billionaires who’ll throw a tanty and withdraw sponsorship if an athlete calls out her father’s racist as fuck views, and who’ll demand they swear fealty to her and be her loyal army of defenders if an artist paints a portrait of her she doesn’t like.
Man we're catching strays in an Olympics thread
nah mate, there's nothing sporting happening in September.

*cries*
lmao the downvotes prove your point
try again
That was precisely the intention ☺️
you should only be saying that when you need to point out certain things. Like "the female swimmers for Australia have won all the gold medals for the Australian swim team".

Or "the Australian female athletes have won all the gold medals for the Australian team and would currently be ranked 6th outright on the medal table."
It's a good habit to get out of, especially since we can all see the photo. It's a far worse problem when people say things like "female doctor", though.
If you wouldn't say "male swimmers", don't say "female swimmers".

If we were talking about the male swimmers, even if gender was mentioned it would be "men", not "male".
The irony of that is I meant exactly the opposite of being quiet about it...
 Kyle charmers says hello
Girl what 🧍‍♀️
This isn't the irony you think it is... You just proved their point 😂
Cam McEvoy has a good shot at the 50m freestyle. Get behind him 💚💛
Australia's always generally done better in women's swimming than in the men's. Maybe the competition is tougher; we generally give more of a dang about women's sport than the rest of the world.
Be wary of the sleeping swimming powerhouses nations of Pakistan, UAE and anywhere else girt by dirt.
I get you. I love to drop a ‘just quietly’ when I’m talking about something everyone knows about
in my experience the americans (on reddit) can't seem to shut up about how they are the only country that matters (there is a whole subreddit dedicated to how much americans just assume that everything is about the US), and while its a vocal minority and i get that, aussies tend to really dislike people who are too full of themselves. China doesnt do it, but the US does.
Why. What did anyone in the audience achieve except viewing advertisements?
Something something nothing else going on in their heads and the brain is just an organ that likes to identify algorithms and requires feeling a part of something and sport keys into that fairly well. But if it wasn't for advertising its signal would be massively attenuated.
Literally, like I might be autistic, but watching people even slightly care makes me just shake my head in puzzlement.

Sure swim for exercise and fun and your health, feels great. But caring about the location of a ball on a field, as a group of grown men... Wtf..

I swam against a junior world champion in 12th grade at a school swimming carnival, and it was the single most brutal thing I've ever had to do. It felt like we weren't the same species.

Gould would be next level.
🤝🫶
So it's basically as stupid as assuming all politicians are from Canberra and Queenslanding the city like it's 2022?
*Tasmanian thank you very much!
She literally moved to Brisbane when she was 14 for better swimming opportunities.
23? Jeez. Guess it’s true that the Aussie sun ages you…

Edit: lol looks like i’ve pissed off a few aussies
And was dead wrong, mate

Just because she had her second head removed as a child doesn’t mean youse can claim her, aye.
Premier can say whatever he wants, Titus vocally claims to be Tasmanian!
They claim half of NSW and the whole of NZ & Pasifika nations for State of Origin, so nothing new there.

Except they lost Origin.
I can't take the credit. It's been a thing online in the last few days. People are asking why Aussies are so good in the pool. The answer is there are many countries surrounded by water, but we are the only country girt by sea.

It's the first time I've seen people embrace the word girt and I'm proud to jump on the bandwagon.
Many thanks for your recognition ... may you have a wonderful Friday also !!!
[Slightly loud context video (that counts as a volume warning, right?)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kni9NRNd3s)
I've spent years working for one of the largest media organisations on the planet. I'm guessing you just spectate.

"Just quietly" means "just between you and me". By definition, "confidentially". There is nothing quiet or surreptitious about this team's success.

So, drop the silly insults, and just explain to me why you think you're right, and I'm wrong. I'm itching to hear it.
no way that's actually tragic

MAYBE ESSINGTON SHOULD LOOK TO RECRUIT FROM THE AUSTRALIAN WOMEN'S OLYMPIC SWIM TEAM AS THEY CLEARLY KNOW HOW TO WIN A FINAL
Nowhere is safe holy fuck
Yeah it was just uncalled for. But then again, that's our Essington every second half of the season.
This was posted yesterday
But why?
That's over-semantic don't you think?
Even if it were male swimmers the post would have even just said “these guys”. Not even “male” or “men”.

Because “guys” are cool blokes you’d have a beer with. “Female swimmers” are a removed, clinical version of an occupation - not people with personalities.
I'm assuming you're not into sport, but this is very normal and helpful word. We're trying to celebrate these female swimmers.
Female Doctor is more problematic, but male and female are clear competitive categories. At some point, you could reductively say "These Olympics Participators are absolutely incredible just quietly" if you really want to get rid of all categorisers.
Doesn’t answer my question of what is wrong with saying female swimmers.
'men swimmers' or 'women swimmers' is not really grammatically correct though
Men is not an adjective
I personally would probably say "male swimmers" over "men swimmers".  
"Female" is not derogatory
Would it tho? If the post were specifically about the male swimming team would people be complaining about it? Or would it be ignored.
Comparing it to how we'd talk about the men isn't a great comparison as they haven't historically had bias or derogation applied by gendered terms (outside a few specific cases). So it's typically fine to use men's/male/guys/boys/gents interchangeably as long as the grammar works.
I assumed it was the middle of the night still when you posted and didn't want to wake the neighbours
There was a swimmer from Bahrain(?) that I saw a few days ago with a name like Michael Miller. Are the Gulf states buying off swimmers from other countries to compete for them in the Olympics, just like they do with more commercialised sports ?
👌🙌
You must be new to the internet if that’s your experience
Dopamine, seratonin, increase of testosterone, and adrenaline. This applies for both sexes. Usually, competition causes the body to react this way due to the nature of fighting in humans. 

In a survival sense, winning means surviving, getting more food, being safe and also being more powerful than the opponent. Survival also depends on choosing the side that has the advantage. 

As society and technology had developed, we rarely experience that in a survival situation. Because sports are competition based activities, they usually induce said bodily reactions, hence why so many love sports, get choosy with teams, and feel utterly defeated/excited and pumped when their teams lose/win.
Each to their own my man entirely... But you are in a rare minority...

When I went to Canada for a couple of years in my mid to late 20s I couldn't believe how much younger everyone looked than us Aussies - it was 100% from the sun

I guess your opinion matters even less when you have mistaken Lani Pallister for Arianne Titmus.
Positive discussion about the incredible sporting performance of the best swimmers in the world

Commenter comes in with a rude and unnecessary comment about their appearances. Then acts surprised that people downvote. 

🙄
[deleted]
Clearly has made her waaaay quicker in the pool..
Pretty sure Titus claimed to be Roman
I know.
I love that someone was triggered enough to downvote you. No prizes for guessing which state they're from.
Theydis, and as a Dee Why born, Melbourne living bloke, couldn't be happier.
Queensland has won 15 out of the last, maybe 20. You guys can have one every now and then to keep the interest but you'll struggle to string a few together.
Always reminds me of the Late Show sketch by Tony Martin where he describes a police hostage situation - “Come out and surrender, we have you girt!” Couldn’t find a clip online alas.
😂 I was actually wondering what was going on there. I just figured it was some anthem reference and rolled with it. Nicely played though. Friday Upvote 😅👌
Is New Zealand not also girt by sea?
> but we are the only country girt by sea.

We are?  Does girt mean something other than girt now?

Feeling like a boomer…
A winning one
Holy fuck I wish we had a r/afl for outside of the sub comment of the year
Because if they were men, we wouldn't be saying male swimmers.

Just swimmers.
Nothing 
They are female swimmers 
Wtf is wrong with people these days?
Yes, it would be "the men's swim team", not "the male swimmers".
Unless they can attribute the success to one of the wealthy individuals from a gulf state, I don’t think they’re interested. They love to wave their cocks around by buying sporting clubs instead.
and where are you from can i ask?
Yep I get it for the people playing the sport, like they can earn money. To a degree I understand anyway. I mean, still if the release of your neurotransmitters relies on essentially a randomised location of a ball that you attach a narrative to then I dunno, I'm back to square one and don't understand at all.

I certainly dont understand the people watching it on the tv; unless gambling on the result maybe.. but the only people making money out of gambling is the business.

Like, skiing, mountain biking etc I can completely understand the enjoyment and even the spectacle. I do both. Love riding motorbikes sightseeing out in the national parks.

But watching the location of a ball.. you're going to survive. In fact watching a televised match probably costs you money and time and inhibits survival as a viewer to a tiny degree. Only becomes valuable when you speak of the ball's location at work to another person who cares about the location of the ball too and you both share a moment together about the randomised location of the ball strengthening your very mundane relationship.
Did anyone winning any races tangibly improve your actual personal or family's wellbeing or was it all a marketing stunt?

Edit: Honestly I'm willing to admit I'm probably autistic. I don't understand sport even slightly other than for the pure enjoyment of "movement/feeling" of the person actually doing it. Watching or caring though. No idea.
To be fair, it’s probably not the best pics of her. She doesn’t look bad at all, just definitely not 23.
Not saying she doesn’t. Just looks older than 23 imo
I didn’t even notice the photo on the post - was referencing the article posted. But Lani is 22…. Slip Slop Slap everyone.
Commenting they look older than 23 yep. I was agreeing with the above commenter. Get off your high horse.

Not surprised. This is reddit, everyone loves to get offended.
I’m an Aussie citizen, so will post here. Thanks anyway. Sun damage is a bummer. Some of you clearly in denial. Be safe out there.
I’ll pay that.

South Australia?
I find that usually the team with the most Rabbitohs wins.
[Definitely not thinking of Adam Hills?](https://youtu.be/Vde8Ag-4qXc?t=66s)
National anthem reference.
And the uk? And Iceland? And Malta ? And Madagascar?
Girt means surrounded, enclosed or encircled. So yes we are girt by sea & the only country with these words in our anthem.
Still means the same thing but rather than the numpties I grew up with who were anti-girt we are now embracing the complexities of the English language, at least for this word.
But the male swimmers haven't won shit lol so it is specifically talking about the *female* swimmers.

Go touch some grass please not everything is a social injsutice
There would be nothing wrong with saying male swimmers. I hear it all the time. The post is talking about the women specifically so where is the issue?

Nah mate, the state of De Nile.
Adam Hills did the Australian Anthem to the tune of Working Class Man. But it was definitely Tony Martin with "We have you girt". A good decade or more apart.
I got that. I was replying as the post above me said Australia was the only country completely surrounded by sea. But it’s not. Which I know is not the point of the original post 🤣
Way to completely miss the point.
But how many of them have those exact words in their national anthem?

Yes it's a bit of an archaic wording but it's ours and we're owning it - that's the point here.
Australia is girt as fuck.
Yeah I think this generation is embracing "girt by sea" in the way a parent loves a child - it may not be perfect but it's ours and we're so proud.  We're going to own that and make it fully Aussie.
We’re not the only country surrounded by sea though.  Hence my boomer puzzlement.  I’m too young for this feeling.
The new “recalcitrant”.
The inclusion of the word “these” implies that it’s just the people present in the photo. The male swimmers who haven’t won any awards aren’t pictured here so the word “female” is irrelevant here regardless.

It doesn’t hurt to just say “these swimmers” - anyone with a basic grasp of the English language will understand that the caption doesn’t apply to all of the Australian swimmers lol.
Of course there's nothing wrong with saying male swimmers. The people are talking about how the job title for a woman comes with the female prefix while dudes get to be named with just their job 
Says who? Th AOC, the athletes, the commentators... anyone involved in the sport, really.

The events are called "men's swimming" by the Olympics, not "male swimming", so they're called the "men's swimming team".

That's... literally just how it is.

Same with almost any sport. It's the FIFA Women's World Cup, not the female cup.

I'm not even sure what you're trying to argue at this point.
They're female swimmers who are members of the australian women's swim team, and make up the entirety of the women's relay team, competing in the women's swim events at the Olympics. That's all fact.

So what are you trying to argue here, exactly?

>Chat GPT (who I take to be an unbiased arbiter)

Ha, that was a joke, yeah?
I'm probably autistic.

And we’re an island … the biggest sooooo the biggest girt, that’s gold right there
So, just this week there was a tweet; an American asked why Aussies were dominating in the pool, and a brilliant Aussie responded with something along the lines of ‘you guys aren’t even girt, how can you think you stand a chance’. Cue other Aussies piling on with sentiments such as ‘get girt or go home’ and calling the USA team ‘girtless wonders’ meanwhile the Americans are all going ‘what the hell is girt?’ It’s been embraced as a hysterical way to torment the Americans as part of the ongoing historic rivalry between the US and Aus swimming teams. 

Hope that helps to give a bit of context!
Respectfully, it doesn't imply that at all... It implies I was referring broadly but specifically to the Australian female swimmers.  If I was talking about anyone in the picture I'd have said so individually I'd have said so. Again, aim was just point out how amazing they've been period. Not to get people caught up in a debate.
But the post is specifically talking about the female swimmers. It’s being specific. Genuinely mind boggling to me that people kick up a stink about this.
You’re arguing that someone on Reddit should use the word women instead of female. Who actually cares. They both mean the same thing.

It's all good bro I respect everyone's opinion. If you wanted me to actually rattle off some of why sport is so incredible I could. (I can't really be fukd lol but I would still)
That was so fucking good

Why isn't this a thing. The energy of it at a large event would be amazing - especially if Barnesy did it.
No one has to fuck anyone mate. Unless they want to. Tony Martin made the girt joke in the 90s, well before Adam did.
Ahhh, I see! Thanks!
People get really sooky online when you use the term female, they don’t care when you use the term male though, it’s pretty embarrassing to be honest.
I'm not arguing anything. You asked a question, I gave you the correct answer to it. What are you even getting upset about?
>Looks like we are agreed then OP's caption is correct. Case closed.

There are technically correct ways of addressing people, and proper ways. If you want to refer to people as if they're in some sort of nature doco - the female of the species - that's your call. Just don't expect *women* to respond well to it.

That's just how it is. 🤷‍♂️
I’m not getting upset at all. I’m just confused why it’s an issue. Someone else brought it up and I asked what’s wrong with saying “female swimmers”. No one has been able to tell me why it’s wrong.
