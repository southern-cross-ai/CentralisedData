Usually $11.50 for two. 
At Little Farms. 

The most expensive place to buy groceries in Singapore, other than Hubers. 

They are 3 for $7.50 on Redmart. Similar price at Cold Storage. 

Probably cheaper at Giant and Fairprice.
You also picked one of the most upscale chain supermarkets in Singapore
*Two avocados for 10 bucks*

And that's not very good
What did you expect? Singapore has to import almost 90% of what goes into their mouths. 


And don't be surprised if certain sensitive produce has to be sent by air freight further adding to their costs.
Lol same price aa IGA in Australia
And look at how big they are compare to the piddly little shit we get offered at Coles.
I need to understand how does south east countries get better quality of australian products and we get the bottom of the barrel
I saw $50 grapes in korea
There‚Äôs 3 in that box
We truly have it good
No $8 for 2 or $9.26 for 3
It's all the melenials over there choosing the avocado on toast over home ownership.
I remember when we were there we saw peaches going for about $35SGD/KG which at the time was pretty much equivalent to AUD. Not sure which store it was
Wait till ya find out how much Driscoll's berries are
Fucking hell, why is our shit so expensive over there?
Smashing!
Must be Job Bluth's favourite store.
Is that a branch of Harris farms?
In Aus. We get the dreggs. This is why.
Is that because they're imported? Yikes!ü§Ø
It‚Äôs one avocado Michael. What could it cost, 10 dollars?
I mean, I‚Äôve seen them going for $4 ea in Coles or woollies in the past
And they‚Äôre hard as nails those green ones
I can‚Äôt believe it. The sign doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äúavocado‚Äôs‚Äù
Was avocado that expensive?
Wait till you get to the meat section...
Looks like those jokes about avocado toast were true /s
Go to coles at this point.
Little Farms is the only place I ever reliably found good avos.  Worth the extra $ IMHO
Was just at Surfers and we bought a bag of 10 for $4. I don't get how the prices on avocados are even decided anymore.
How much for the toast?  How much is the toast!? This post is missing critical info.
But they are the best avocados in Singapore.
Place I work for in Perth is selling them at 2 for $9. Super bougey chain though, and they're really nice Avo's tbf üòÖ
Cheaper than Coles
Wrong time of year in Melbourne and it‚Äôs not too far off the mark. 
Same with mangos.
I bought some last week for $1.79 each from Coles.
Tell him he‚Äôs dreaming
Looks like those Singaporean millennials will need to stop eating smashed avo if they ever want to afford a house
No wonder housing is so expensive in Singapore!
And people in Australia complain how expensive they are here üôÑ
Shepards are 3 for $1. 

Even at that price no one wants them.
Good luck ever buying a house!
There's a Coles section in their everyday supermarket - Fair price. I was like whoaaaaaa when I was back in sg for a trip. Lololol.
That‚Äôs a 3 pack
When I was thete
Yeah.... but it's Singapore.... You'll  get that.

Just enjoy your great transport, good governance and clean streets.
$4 SGD/avo is outrageous but I bet if you scooped out the flesh and weighted it against the flesh of a typical avo you get here about $2.50 SGD, it would represent good value!

Little Farms is like the Harris Farm of SG - fancy stuff in rich people suburbs. You can easily find regular avos 3 for $5 SGD.
Wait til u see the price of them in China lmao
Daylight robbery...
WOW, The only time I feel lucky in this economy is that I live in Australia & can get local grown avocados from Roadside Stalls for $2/$3 a bag for about 5 ü•≥
They are full of Crayfish.
They were $8 each in perth back in 2015
This is why millenial Singaporeans can't afford property.

  
JK despite being a city state taking every square metre of an island, property is still cheaper than Australia
Ah yes the mystical Australian avocado! The magic pill for all health issues. Those Australians are mighty fit and strong, surely if we hoard their avocados we will be too!
This is so sad üòû
They‚Äôll never afford to buy a house with that price of avocados!
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a banana, Michael. How much could it cost, $10?‚Äù

‚ÄúActually, $12.‚Äù
Was that at the Takashimaya shopping centre In singapore last week have quite a bit of Aussie produce, noticed the avocado immediately.
Eating like a local and not a westerner would be way cheaper lol
I bought 1 here for $1.50 and thought that was too much...lol
Soon they'll wonder why the produce gets shop lifted more often
Soon they'll wonder why the produce gets shop lifted more often.
Title doesn't match the information in the photo at all.

Photo says either 2 for $8 or 3 for $9.98.
AVOs. ü´£. not what I was expecting when I saw the title in my list.
Is that why they‚Äôve crept back up to $2 here. I was enjoying them being a bit over $1. While it‚Äôs good to export surplus food it shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to drive up prices for Aussies.
Yup Little Farms is for rich people in Singapore (located in expat hubs like Holland Village, Tanglin and River Valley)

[$AU24 for a tin of Sirena tuna](https://littlefarms.com/sirena-tuna-in-oil-425g-603867?gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAAC-xnA7sD-DFHioCMTmsMC_hZvUze&gclid=Cj0KCQjwzby1BhCQARIsAJ_0t5OWKP95Yz2zlt2jAFcfMMww_kJq46MqLu3HgztLTZUznTv8tTdsGocaAhG1EALw_wcB)

You can make a killing selling Aussie stuff in Singapore. The affluent locals are all over anything Aussie branded especially vitamins, skin care, organic produce, baby items.
But the photo says 'super specials'. 

Are you implying that $8SGD isn't a super special? Why would they lie....
This price ‚Äúhass‚Äù to be a joke ü§£
Sometimes you get 5 for $9 if you're lucky at cold storage (the fresh food people/s)
Yeah but your Avos are at least not growing things inside them.
Even less at Indian grocers. I live in Katong and go to Avighna.
And surely that's S$? Even worse. A$1 is 0.85 Sing currently.
[deleted]
Well shit, the younger generations in Singapore are never going to be able to afford houses with avos at that price!
Do you want avocados or not
Yeah but you're God, isn't money kinda beneath you?
Came here for this exact comment
Yeah but isn't money kind of beneath you?

Get out of here with that 'principle' nonsense.
Yeah but you need them
Yes but it‚Äôs THE PRINCIPLE!!!
and its hilarious, they wants to push to 10M population in this island smaller than the size of the whole Adelaide Metropolitan region when its already having more than sydney population and especially how their plans for self-sustaining farming failed
fr? I work at a foodworks and we're selling avocados for 2 dollars a peice lmao
I can believe it
Iga is so expensive in the area I live. I just bought a kilo for $4.50 from woolworths (the odd bunch ones).
For real? I buy mine from Harris farm which is super expensive normally but get them for $1.50-2.50 depending on the week. That‚Äôs wild
And then they still try  and sell you rotting Avocados as a special while other places clear the rotting ones out for the full tray for the price of 1 Avocado. Avocados that should be in the skip in the back. The mean spirited greed is everywhere in colesworth empire.
Coles and Woolworths have a ‚Äúsupermarket spec‚Äù which dictates size and grade. Usually the bigger fruit is more expensive so they won‚Äôt include them in their specs (unless there is a glut which means lower cost). Also growers have to be certified by their own version of HACCP, which a few growers will not do. There‚Äôs a lot more to it than people think
I guess noone here wants to pay $4 each for top tier avocados.
Are they better than the ones we get? Just because they're the best in Singapore (according to the sign) doesn't mean they're better than all the ones in Australia as well.
Edit: Apparently this is an upscale supermarket which would explain the price but wow I can‚Äôt believe people would pay so much. I was enticed inside by the massive sign promising the best avocados in Singapore. They better be for that price!
Colesworth won‚Äôt pay for quality.
It‚Äôs called capitalism with (relatively) free trade. If a company can get a higher price overseas there is no incentive to sell it in Australia.
Export quality is higher
Just because a sign in a supermarket in Singapore says it, doesn't mean it's true.

I live in Singapore and we've never bought anything from Little Farms, the avocados here are... fine? They're certainly not so good as to comment on.
Funnily enough, home ownership is super common in singapore, the rate of ownership was 89.7% as of 2023 compared to 66% over here in aus.

Mainly because they do what our government is incapable of doing, which is building houses. When a government does that you actually can have both avocado on toast and a home. Crazy stuff
$15 a pack....but its the US import tho
Because it's air freighted. The box of blueberries that's $3 or less in season here goes for $10+ in Singapore.
Nope they're just Little /s
At least $25 sgd, not including 10% service charge and 9% gst/vat
UP means usual price
I doubt that‚Äôs in AUD.
What the heck? That‚Äôs a pricey can of tuna!  Is sirena tuna a similar price everywhere in Singapore? Or just at little farms?
Need to start myself an eBay tuna store.
That BS
That‚Äôs the ‚Äúwurtz‚Äù joke I‚Äôve ever heard
Upscale just means they charge more, buddy.
The fresh produce at most of the chains depends on where they are sourcing their produce from. Fairprice happens to source a lot of stuff from China.
r/DownvotedToOblivion
They already have housing provided by the government. There is like 80% home ownership there AND wages are decent so I think they can stretch to an AVO. 

It's probably best we export them all now anyway, given the sitch here. Only so many Avocados the boomers can eat hey
Not üö≠
In Singapore, avocados eat you.
It's the principle.
Gotta keep the ruling party with the next gen of loyal supporters, and cogs that go into the GDP making machine. If Singaporeans can‚Äôt increase the population they‚Äôll just import more.
Think more of sydney
Thank you. I learned something new today.
I believe so, when going into either Woolworths or Coles the quality of produce feels like 'take it or leave it' scenario
[deleted]
Nah who said anything about the sign? They look good just based on their size and colour
Singaporean here working in Australia,  just to let you know the home ownership is apartments only. And we will need to use our CPF(Super) to pay for it. 

And cause we used our CPF, we will need to pay the money back to the CPF, including interest, which we were supposed to get if we left it in the account. So most Singaporean will need to work their whole life in order to pay back their house.
There are strict property controls in Singapore in regard to how many properties you can own. There are also very little landed properties and at the time I was living there the labor building the houses was very cheap. 

It is also a 40km wide island with a different economy and housing needs.
If you're referring to HDB, you don't own the apartment, you "own" the 99yr lease on the apartment. And you're probably paying for it with your CPF. But that's if you can get one, because if you're single and in your 20s, you're going to have to buy with a sibling or family member because HDB isn't available to singles until you're 35 (land scarcity etc). And your apartment is only getting upgraded if you live in a govt held electorate. So home ownership might be "super common" but so is not having your own place in your 20s and living with family members if you don't have a spouse or you can't afford a condo by yourself.
Ohh that makes more sense. A shame cause I love berries but I'm too poor to afford them here
So interesting, the font their pricing + advertising is so similar
Yea, the signs are in Singapore dollars
Oh, Little Farms stock lots of Aussie products that can‚Äôt be found in other stores so they charge a premium. They cater to rich locals and expats missing a taste of home. Ngl after living here for 2 years I‚Äôd pay top dollar for some twisties haha.

The chain supermarkets like FairPrice and Giant cater to locals and carry different brands of canned tuna, usually imported from Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia at cheaper prices.
I ‚Äúrelish‚Äù the fact you responded
[removed]
Yeah nah, those are 99 year lease, lest you get acquisition back from the government for a new train station or smth. Wages is a laughing stock....besides, government housing is prioritised to married couples and over 35 for singles. And it's at least a 5 year wait for it.
I don‚Äôt live in Singapore‚Ä¶.can you explain further your comment about the younger generation having housing provided by the government. They just get houses given to them?
Staying in power by increasing and importing votes, classic examples of how The PAP is corrupted to the core when comes to democracy and serving self interests, one of the reasons why some Singaporeans I met wants to move out to Australia or elsewhere, unfortunately the oppositions also too weak to replace them as of now
Singapore population(over 6M) is already more than Sydney(~5.8M)
That is what an upscale supermarket is.
Products and produce all definitely more upscale too at places like the market place. Better choices for cold cuts and cheeses than in Australian supermarkets. Even the beer and wine has a great selection.
They look like very ordinary avocados to me. The size and shape you see at Woolies.

Colour varies as they age, so I won‚Äôt go into that.
That might not be so bad. Depends on how nice your apartments are.
It being a relatively small island makes it all the more impressive and all the more ridiculous that Australia does it worse.
But its Australia " we punch above our by weight doing nothing" I guess if we keep going we going to be the heavy weight slum champions of the world punching imaginary houses that were never built.
We do get south African ones once in awhile, but I'd only buy when it drops to 7-9 for a pack of 3 if there is a bundle. Only for blue berries though. Raspberries or black berries can go to hell. At least there's korean/taiwan/china strawberries , sometimes even Malaysian from Cameron highlands
I go there for the meat and dairy products. Can‚Äôt find Meredith‚Äôs sheep yogurt anywhere else.
I hear you are looking for some twisties‚Ä¶

Pick your poison, cheese, chicken or wicked cheddar üçó üßÄ üòà

Spicy ramen is good if you don‚Äôt respect your own asshole üçú
It must suck to be this miserable lol
Then reword your first comment to not imply that upscale means differing quality????
Well, you clearly never would have. Because you incorrectly described upscaling. Lol.
Same as "buying" in Canberra
Essentially, yes. The details matter and you don‚Äôt always get what you want, but you have a place to live. 

Decent vid on the topic: https://youtu.be/3dBaEo4QplQ?si=2CaQAD7FDVUrnwZd
Singapore solves it's housing crisis by having it's working class live in dormitories, or in squalor across the causeway in Malaysia.
This all makes sense when you take off the rose coloured glasses and realise the PAP hates the working class with their elitist attitudes.
Thank god you‚Äôre here. This supposed scientist is having a world of trouble getting their head around this concept.
You must have a great woolies because mine are never this fresh and unbruised
HDBs are fine. In terms of size, they're actually getting smaller and are fairly bare bones as they're to be customized, which many people do (and thus need more money)

 If you have a Singaporean the choice between an HDB and a condo unit (which generally come with more amenities, like a pool, gym or tennis court), then I imagine most Singaporeans would like the condo.
And one other thing it's a government public property which they lease to us for 99 years. So your future generations may be kicked out of the home if the government wants to redevelop the area.
The comparisons are hard to make still. 

The population of Sydney for example is similar to Singapore but land usage is very different. Australians would have to give up their backyards and that would be a hard thing to convince people of. 

While Singaporeans can avail of multiple properties, this is heavily restricted and thus the Australian idea of property ownership as a wealth creation tool would also need to be changed. Not saying Singaporeans don't do the same. 

Labor, in Australia labor is expensive and one of the drivers of the cost of housing. Not to criticize tradespeople but they are not cheap and milking the situation for their benefit. If we could import mass labor, pay them cheaply, stick them in dormitories, and then send them back home when the job is done things could also be different.

The government also has control over house pricing in regards to subsidies, market cooling, land supply etc which the Federal government may not have at a state level. 

CPF investment in housing, makes it easier for people to buy their first house, though Australia has similar policies and additional policies. 

Remember also in Singapore you don't own a house, you lease it. Very few parts except the  bungalow areas are owned. Foreign investment is also controlled differently. This affects resale pricing. 

Singapore can be a strange place also when you scratch below the surface, multi-generational living which Australians normally avoid, and areas where off-shored labour are living many to a room. 

While the Singaporean situation is one to be admired, one which we could learn something from, the situation is different. The Australian government of course could have taken an opportunity to cool the market etc, build more houses, and employ economic options to improve housing as well.
I am not an expert on the matter, my layman brain looks at this and says that there are so many issues like investment and negative gearing issues, supply chain issues, and labor issues that I cannot comprehend an easy way out. Even if the bubble bursts the pain that it will bring will be enormous, and no government in their right mind (or at least hoping for re-election) will try to cool the market off as there is just too much at risk. 

So I agree there is going to be a lot of things said and not much achieved.
Sucks a bit if they're just having a bad day. Sucks a LOT if they're always like this
They're not 'given to people' they're subsidised by the government quite heavily and are on a 99 year lease agreement. At the end of 99 years the properties revert to the government, regardless of who owns it at that time.  It also depends on your income level, marital status, whether you have kids, whether you have parents etc.  

It definitely provides for most people to have housing, and is a hugely successful policy, but it's only possible because the government has immense power over the population.
Yes but it‚Äôs the part about this housing being provided by the government that struck me. I can‚Äôt see the government providing squalor‚Ä¶.dorms, yes. But squalor‚Ä¶?
They are as bad as, if not worse than how anyone could describes the LNP or labour party here. Leeching off the the locals working class and their policies that manages to piss off both the right and left. I never understood conservative or liberal would even think of supporting the PAP oligarchy. If singaporeans continue voting and giving PAP more than 80 seats in the parliament, I can say the future of singapore is gone case
not really, those condos are getting more expensives and doesnt worth their value these days, the amenities are kinda pointless when you dont use them often but gonna pay for the maintanance fees
They avoid the hard part of providing low-income housing by making workers drive across the international border to sleep. They also allow companies to house [foreign workers 20-to-a-room in dormitories.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/singapores-cramped-migrant-worker-dorms-hide-covid-19-surge-risk)
> If singaporeans continue voting and giving PAP more than 80 seats in the parliament, I can say the future of singapore is gone case

Even with a formidable opposition, do not underestimate the PAPs willingness to gerrymander the election to their advantage. Do I need to remember the scandal that is "reserved presidency", by excluding the other candidates to manufacture a walkover result.
