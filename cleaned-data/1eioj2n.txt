Everyone knows that when you go rural enough, it becomes legal to not train your workers.

Do you need to be “trained” to keep an eye on six toddlers at a pool?

There were three childcare workers looking after six kids. It really shouldn’t be that hard. There’s so much paperwork/bureaucracy bullshit in that article, as if SOPs were the real reason or would have somehow mitigated the risk. Absolute rubbish. 

Any reasonable person checked they have all the children they’re responsible for before leaving a location. If people don’t do that instinctively, no amount of “training” will compensate.
