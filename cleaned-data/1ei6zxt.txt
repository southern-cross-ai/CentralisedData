I was joking with my wife today about the old Diet Coke ad that featured Yaculpo, the pool boy "scoop Yaculpo, scoop like the wind". However, when doing a Google search, it's like it has been erased. 

Definitely not PC, but has Diet Coke buried Yaculpo?

Nah mate, it was a legit series of ads by coke. The crickets in this thread just make the whole thing even more sus.
