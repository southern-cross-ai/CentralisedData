Whatever happened to life in jail? I’m so over the “20 years is basically life”. No, life is life. As in you die in jail. Can’t believe you can take someone’s life only to one day live a free person again.
My heart goes out to the two children. Can't imagine what it will do to them knowing their father brutually murdered their mother. He is where he belongs.
I just read another article that states it was a life sentence with 20 years before being eligible for parole.
Shit reporting by the ABC is what happened. He was sentenced to life, with a minimum non-parole period of 20 years, **not** a 20-year sentence.
I guarantee her murder was a culmination of ongoing abuse. Hope he rots in prison.
Traumatising.
It mentions that in the linked article, too, but the headline is misleading.
Absolutely. The article says there is no evidence of prior abuse, only control. Control is abuse, and there is no doubt that was the tip of the ice.
I cannot find where it says he got a life sentence. It does say he needs to do 20 before parole but there are multiple mentions of 20 year sentence not just in the headline. 

I’ve noticed this recently I don’t know if it’s a new thing or not, but they seem to be putting the minimum time and representing it as the full.
