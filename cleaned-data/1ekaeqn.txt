The Olympic Team one to boot!
Looks so odd after being used to seeing the Queen on them for so long.
Bit generous with the hair
The dollarydoo has become the chucklebuck
Whenever I see his face on a coin, I will think of the fact that he desperately wanted to be Camilla's tampon.

Such dignity and nobility.
it doesn’t look real bc i’m so used to the queen on it
Fuck yeah, 2 Chuckiebucks!
Won't even wear the silly hat.

If royals don't do the pageantry why even have them?
I like how you saved heads for Pic #2

Built some suspense.

I’m easily pleased.
Anyone else think it’s ridiculous to make an Australian Olympic coin and then stick the face of a foreigner who cheers for team Great Britain on the back?
A friend of mine owed me a bit of money and she gave me this same coin about 2 weeks ago.  And yes, my very first Charles coin too.  I will be keeping it.
It doesn't look like him. It should just be a enormous ear.
Looks a bit like Michael Scott
It will be good when the profile is at least facing right again, how long til Wills?
For everyone saying they don’t like his head on the coin I don’t think you’ll have to worry I think it’ll be a short lived period then I guess the hate will be on the next of kin.
Feels odd
Booo
It’s been so long since I used physical money, my first thought here was “2 dollars isn’t a thing”, then I remembered it totally is.
I’ve been looking for one. Glad you got one
Just not the same without the queen
Looks like his eye would glow in the dark.
Got me a dollar Charlie last week!
Sausage fingers coin
👍
I have two and I literally had no idea what they were until I saw this post
The first ever Chuck Buck!
I'm calling it..

In 80 years, these will be some of the most saught after collectible mainstream coins, following Charles record short reign of 23 months, plus the fact that it was an olympic year.

While I'm at it, Trump will be directly or indirectly (likely the former) responsible for the third World War  following his withdrawal of the US from NATO early in his second term. Let's say.. April 2025.
Nice, what are you going to spend it on?
Ew
Yuck…
As someone who has only been back in Oz a couple of weeks and having grown up with Lizzie on the coins, it does look a bit weird at first. Simply cos I am not used to it.

EDIT: grammar
Cute
I have zero connection to the monarchy...
I audibly and without even thinking about it, said NO as I swiped
So, so long. Forever, basically, from my perspective, being born a decade after the introduction of decimal currency here in Australia
Given that her reign pre-dated the Australian dollar, she was always there.
Not generous enough with the ears.
he'll be dead in a few years and the next guy is like Shine-O Ball-O
Will Bills in circulation eventually
You can now buy tampons using his face.
You know, of all the kinks there are, that's kinda mid range really.
No he didn’t. He said “knowing the luck I have, I’d come back as a tampon.” Very different context - but don’t let that get in the way of a good Reddit comment 👍🏻
The schnoz alone could do some damage. It's kind of romantic in a really gross way. 
I sent a pic to my husband... like. This is weird....
He does have wear a crown on some coins around his coronation but they’re only minted at the Royal Mint IIRC
I like the fact that you thought that XD
I mean not really. The back of the coin stays the same on every coin we make. 

The front design is completely seperate, while the back is uniform to serve the purpose of indicating the fundamental details of our currency, being that the AUD is issued by the crown, i.e. Charles.

If your talking about becoming an independent nation and issuing our own currency, that's a completely different story, one that's not been historically successful when put to a referendum.
Chuck is officially the King of Australia here, not the King of Great Britain.
Of course it’s ridiculous.

Also a sign of how immature we are as a nation
Heh, and what's with his hair? No way he could get a comb-over that lush
Boo-urns
It’s the first time I’ve used cash in easily 3 or 4 years
Canada had a coin that goes in the dark.
why would the sausage do such a thing
Trump isn’t going to withdraw the US from NATO. Stop flapping! Breathe..
I’m keeping this one so I can peg it at him whenever he visits Brisbane, hard to miss with his dumbo ears
Congratulations
Crazy thing is, Elizabeth II was on our coins far longer than her father, grandfather, and great-grandfather (a total of 42 years for Edward VII, George V and George VI, versus 70 years for Liz).
Just glad his sausage fingers aren't on it
And no lips.
I got the details a little murky because I really try very hard to make sure I **don't** remember much about Chuck or his family in general.
Curious, Isn't the side featuring the effigy of the monarch considered the "front" of the coin? 

The other side considered the "back" which features the coin value or a commemorative design

Heads & tails
>Also a sign of how immature we are as a nation

I voted to become a republic and I still support becoming a republic.  We had a good run with Queen Elizabeth and her (mostly) hands off approach but who is to say that Charles will be the same?
I don't think he's planning on visiting Brisbane when he comes [in October](https://www.pm.gov.au/media/visit-australia-their-majesties-king-charles-iii-and-queen-camilla) later this year. 

Queen Elizabeth II was 74 years old when the Sydney Olympics were on in 2000, and she didn't turn up to open the games. Do we think King Charles III is going to be up to it in 2032 when he'd *potentially* be 83 years old?
My bad I thought the subreddit was to "chew fat for Australia about Australians" - I forgot the monarchs grew up in west Sydney
Technically yes.  Recognised?  No.  On the whole we (general population)  say heads is the back of the coin.

Another prime example is the whole driving / points system.  When we break the law, we say we've lost points but in legally, we've gained points.
Thank you
