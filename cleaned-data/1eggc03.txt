This right here is the root cause of the housing crisis. It's all well and good to say "we shouldn't build on this site". But when this happens on **every** site, the end result is that nothing gets built, and the housing shortage grows. Rinse and repeat for decades, and you end up where we are today. 

Housing will become affordable 10 years after state governments decide enough is enough, and give NIMBYs the finger.

Developers build suburban sprawl because it's illegal to build anything else on ~90% of residential land. In both cases, the problem is a regulatory environment that panders to local NIMBYs above all else.
