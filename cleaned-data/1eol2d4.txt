Just add your lettuce/ Hot Sauce. 
Wtf that actually looks like a burger.
McSmart meal 🙌🏾🙌🏾
Training no long includes how to place a slice a cheese so its 95% inside the meat and bun. Looks like you visited my local Macca's.
Most appetising Maccas meal I’ve seen in a while, watch Maccas introduce this as a future secret menu item.
I got this this morning but the coke was soda water with a dash of brown haha , 😞 was drive thru and didn't notice til half way home when I sipped it 🤢
The bowel cancer is free!
You're basically making money. Go to Maccas! #bigburger #eatresponsibly
Either it’s a promo one or OP made it themselves and put a ton of effort into making it look like real food. But that doesn’t look like it’s ever been squished into a wrapping before. 
I thought the McSmart meal had a cheeseburger and a chicken'n'cheese burger. What am I missing here?
cannot be, no lettuce in that offer.
The burger looks crap, double quarter pounder all the way.
It is a decent amount of food and a drink for $7, especially in St Leonard's where $15 gets you a sandwich.
You can choose which burgers in the app, between cheeseburgers or chicken and cheese
OP said they added lettuce & hot sauce
Double quarter pounder is an ugly mofo, but it hits the spot after a late one.
Back in the day a large meal was $4.95
Back in your days were the soft serve cones 30c?
The gang discovers inflation
What day? How old are you?
Yeah, and I witnessed the advent of EFTPOS machines at McDonalds. I once saw a guy going through drive-thru using EFTPOS to order a 30c cone.
Or the greed gravy train of the new millennium
Mid 40's.
