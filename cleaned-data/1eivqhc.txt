Oppositions always want the dirtier side of diplomacy and lawmaking made public because it looks bad on the government. Governments always want to hide the same things for the same reasons. It’s always good work to call out the hypocrisy like this, but it’s also entirely business as usual. What’s most amazing to me is that we still have FOI laws at all given that basically every government in power hates them
BOT? or is this posted annually?>
The nice thing about laws like these is that it is *extremely* hard to justify repealing them once they're in place without looking hilariously corrupt.
Gov employee here. Can confirm my contract says I am not allowed to speak about matters. Not on social media and not to friends. I am not allowed to have a public opinion about my employer.

You'd think that. But then we seem to have bipartisan support for stripping back anti-corruption bodies in some states.
Yeah, thankfully we still have the decency in this country that no matter which government is in power we would burn them for getting rid of laws like that.
I've definitely seen this posted here before and it is definitely dated.
South Australian parliament, to a person including libs, labor, independents, etc, voted to limit the ICAC. 

So disheartening
Yeah nah
And Federal Lib/Lab will do the same just as soon as the heat dies off enough and/or they can quietly shuffle it through on the back of some other legislation.


Let's hope they fall below the threshold where they can do what ever the fuck they want if it's "bipartisan" before that happens.
