Outdoor soccer for 6 year olds

$55 annual registration fee,
$175 per term (10 weeks),
$100 mandatory uniform fee

Is this normal or are they taking the piss?
How does it compare to other sports?

I’ve always heard that soccer is the most expensive kids sport but this just seems ridiculous.

$180ish per term is normal for kids sports/activities.  

Feel lucky your kids arn't into the "arts" Music / Art / Dance etc classes you can be looking at least 3 x that per term.
Yes normal
Depends on your club. I run a Jnr Rugby League Club and we charge $150 for the season, 15 games with full kit. We work our arses off getting sponsors and raising funds to keep it affordable. Not all clubs can or are willing to do that.
Soccer is pretty notorious for being the most expensive kids' sport.  By comparison a season of Aussie Rules was $200 with no uniform fee (AusKick is $100), and cricket was \~$150.

> soccer is the most expensive kids sport 

Try any individual sport, e.g. tennis. $40 per group lesson or $100 per private lesson. Plus racquet, strings, tennis shoes etc.
$1000 a term gymnastics and $900 a term for dance.

Sport is expensive.  Cheapest thing we do is Little Athletics.  $190 for the whole year (mostly summer but winter x country too!)
Public liability insurance is probably a significant contributing factor.

And insurance premiums are always going up.
I do Scouts and the fees are $185p/a paid to Queensland Branch. That covers insurances, leader training and the wages of a few staff who run the show. 

The actual Scout groups are run by volunteers and their buildings, rates, electricity, etc... are all paid for by term fees, grants and fundraising. Our term fees are around $70 from memory. 

Uniform is about $60. You need to buy a new shirt every few years as each (age) section has a different shirt, but they're the same nationwide and really well made so you can get them second hand for cheaper.

So you're looking at close to $500 for the year once you've paid for a couple of camps.
Councils continue to raise rent for these clubs, most of the time clubs don’t even make enough to break even for the year. That’s why they make most of their money hiring out their venues for functions and from the bars and canteens
This is reasonably standard, watch out as they get older with soccer many of the clubs raise the fees a tonne to help fund their top teams.
Totally normal. My four year old’s ballet is $250 a term, $75 yearly registration fee, $150 extra to participate in the end of year concert, and have to buy all the shoes and uniforms etc.

$17.50 per week for a game and training is a steal!
$330 is normal. You ought to try being the parent of a figure skater - $400 for skates, $30 for weekly half hour lessons, skates that need regular sharpening at $20 a pop, and outfits that start at $250 *looks pointedly at empty wallet*
Ha that's terrible. I think our little soccer club was $80 with a free uniform, for the whole season. Admittedly that was before the pandemic.

Meanwhile Auskick is practically free including merch, because the AFL subsidises it hard.
Not normal... except for soccer, which is a venal, rapacious sport that exploits its juniors & club players to fund its administration and elite programmes.   A short sighted approach that undermines its own long term success.
That'll get you 2 days of child care. Seems expensive but on par with everything else.
I pay $60 for a season of rugby for my 8 year old. In nz
I’m paying more for gymnastics
Are you metro? We are regional and our soccer club is $110 for the season which includes 20 weeks of soccer: one training and one game day a week. The shirt is $40 and compulsory but they can get shorts and socks anywhere (but club logo ones for $45 total), so $85ish in kit. We also recycle boots between kids and do a second-hand kit option.

All the sports in our region put the fees up when active kids vouchers became a thing in NSW and they actually helped our club stay alive. I’m not sure how it’ll go with the government changes to this.

For reference, I pay $400 a term for private tuition for music. When my daughter was really into dance, I was paying $750 a term!! 
Soccer is veeeerrrrry cheap compared to some activities.
My kids play Soccer, AFL and Rugby Union, with soccer being by far the most expensive, and the least amount (kit, bags, etc) included.
I am paying $175 per term for indoor soccer for a 5 year old. There is no rego fee but I did have to buy the uniform but it has lasted almost 2 years so far.
Is this through a local club, or is it a weekly skills/development style thing like little kickers where paid staff do all of the work/coaching etc? If so, then that is an entirely reasonable cost per term (except maybe the uniform for something like that). 
Soccer is usually done via a local club where up until around 12 years old the coaching and management of teams is done by parent volunteers, games are played on the weekend and a season lasts 3 months or so, and a season might cost between 300-500 for juniors depending on specific club costs for uniforms and stuff.
Netball is $200 for the entire Winter season (Mar-Sept).
Hockey is $40 per term for 6 yr olds. And no mud!

https://www.hockey.org.au/hookin2hockey/
My child has done dance and drama since 6yo (currently 12) never been less than $300 per term.
Yeah, soccer is the most expensive for kids out of the big 4 which includes afl, rugby, and cricket.

It's a common complaint amongst people that love the game because soccer should be as popular as the other sports but parents get turned off by the price when auskick costs $100. Then they get suprised no one watches aleague.

Then you get there and it's parent coaches and umpires and you quickly realise that you paid all that money to essentially use the fields. It's all about funding the seniors.

I was not impressed with soccer after putting my kids through auskick and cricket, paid less and got way more with the others.
Soccer is a shocker.

Wait till your kid is a bit older and it’s $1-2,000 a season. Do you know why it is so expensive? Where that extra above what seems reasonable is going?

It’s being used to pay their senior players.

Yep. Kids fees are high to subsidise the seniors.

Plus most Aust. soccer clubs are still ethnic enclaves where soccer matches at senior level are proxies for wars that should have died with Yugoslavia, funded by you.
$100 for uniform isn’t very competitive pricing. Much cheaper options around for the club.
Is the uniform fee mandatory or just the uniform. There was generally a few friends with older kids who passed us the uniform, or a local buy swap sell group where you get could get one for $10-$15.
I think we only needed to buy socks, and shorts, so maybe $40. Our club lends the shirts as they get reused. Oh, of course add shin pads and boots but that's on us, and we could reuse from our older kids.

Of course I could be wrong, my wife handles sport now.. Did my stints managing several teams with older kids, I'm done..
Shop around. Many sports club who are financially sound provide the uniform free. Our club at the over 10 level costs $210 for the season which is longer than 10 weeks

Fingers crossed you live somewhere that has multiple clubs.

Other option is to ask for a payment plan. I know our club discretely arranges this (no interest). 
That's probably $100 more than what I pay for my kid's soccer. 


I'd say soccer is cheap compared to the other sports I pay for, especially competitive swimming.
Thats cheap. Try having a kid in ice skating..
but i was told that gambling profit trickled down to make kids sport free....
Normal for soccer. Try some other sport, even Auskick afl.
Basketball for ours U12's is over 400 bucks for season
Both my kids do regional soccer team.. 2 kids.. $340 for club and $1400 for regional.. so well over 3k just in registration fees a year.. they play touch football as well which is $90 a season.
If your kid is very good and makes it to NPL level you're looking at 10X this cost.
Oh it gets worse by all reports.
If your kid loves it and excels, you could be travelling all over the country by the time they’re in high school. Possibly even further.
Just saw kids swimming invoice for 1 month, for 2 kids under 4. $279
In WA, season of junior AFL is $160 (Auskick) to $290 (Youth) at our local club, kids get jumper to borrow but have to buy their own socks/shorts. Lots of people get second hand shorts all the time through Facebook buy nothing groups. So AFL cheapest sport for our kids. There is mouth guard cost of $200 but given they can share with basketball and school sport, I don't include that as a dedicated cost.

Basketball is about $380 where we play but some junior comps are closer to $500, again kids get jersey but have to buy own shorts. 

Cricket I've just signed up my son and it was $250 but we have to buy whole uniform separate and then there is bat, pads etc which could cost hundreds more. We'll be over $500 by the time he starts but we're hoping to pickup second hand gear to help save cost.
Yep that’s normal.
Sounds about normal
I find it hilarious that you are complaining about $330 for kids sport.  Around 30 years ago now I was living in Canada and I wanted to start doing ice hockey as a sport - my dad wouldn't let me because spending $2,500 in equipment for something that I might only do for a few training sessions was not worth it in his books lol

$330 for soccer these days is still dirt cheap in comparison.
Normal. Our soccer club provides shirts but it’s buy your own shirts/socks/shinpads/boots. 

Cheapest sport we’ve done is cricket, the woolies/milo cricket was like $100 and included a bat, ball, hat, drink bottle, stickers, shirt with name printed on the back. 

Even proper cricket isn’t too bad, it’s like $150. Shirt gets supplied and Kmart do white cricket pants for $10. Of course the kit is expensive BUT every team has a shared kit so you can use from that if you like, just buy your own protector for $20 because eww to sharing that.
Our 10yr old's season cost $1250 plus uniforms and the off season another $900. Your price seems like a steal to me. Depends on the club and the outcomes you are chasing. We bawked at the price originally, but when you factor in payed coaches and 3 sessions a week its not bad value.
I wish that's all I was paying for my kids extra curriculars 🙃
Don’t let them learn about go carts or motocross.
Jesus we pay $670/fn...

Dance and ice skating. Fifteen, been doing it 9 years.
Your kid could be into:

Motocross
Go karting 
Horse riding 
Skiing/snow boarding
Boating/yachting (joke, you’re only getting into this if it’s already in the family most of the time)
I'm not sure of the point of comparisons with music, gymnastics, ballet, figure skating, art etc. Generally those activities involve private or group lessons run by a business with individuals who do it for a living usually in privately owned or leased/hired facilities.

This is a completely different scenario to a community-based (and community/government subsidised) sporting club doing it on typically council-owned land (for which they may pay a very modest use fee). Coaches are typically paid a fairly small allowance if anything at this level. Refs are paid. Pretty much everything else is done by parent and club volunteers. Of course there are expenses to run a club too. Valid comparisons would be with football, rugby, softball, netball, cricket etc.

"Sounds ok, I pay $XX a year for guitar" (i.e. weekly private lessons delivered by a qualified professional who does it for a living), is just not a worthwhile comparison.

Kids soccer gouges parents to pay their senior players. That's it.
Sounds petty normal. Kids tennis was $250 a term up front pre-covid. No payment plans nothing
It’s pretty normal for an non-subsidised sport.  

Junior AFL and cricket get subsidised by the code because they want a big base to draw elite players from.  Other sports don’t have this focus and so parents pay the full cost.

Some teams do hire uniforms which can save a lot of money.
I played Aust. Rules from 12 to 15 (1981 to 1984) and there was a small fee to register (maybe $5) and no other costs.  
Mum bought me unbranded 2 stripe boots, black/white shorts, and socks. The club supplied jumpers, oranges at half time. End of year trophies were free.  
The coaches were fathers of the kids.  
They used to drive us to away games.  
Money came from local business sponsors on jumpers and around the ground, and some donated things.
Before I had school aged kids I would say yes. Now I have school aged kids, with one doing ballet/jazz, hockey and violin, $330 sounds like a bargain. 
It's normal! Pity the government has stopped handing out vouchers!
Well, two of those fees aren't term based, they're annual. $175 for a term...that's cheap. Most kids activities are $200 plus a term these days.
Wouldn’t complain. We pay close to $1k per child per season (x2 kids) (age 7 and 10). Break it down and it’s around $15 per session (where a session is either a 1 hr training or a game). Compare that to other extra curricular activities. It seems like a lot up front but break it down. That’s across 8 months of the year. They love it and do practice in between and make a new circle of friends as do we. Alternative - do nothing and they sit on screens more, no exercise and less outdoor time. Also watching your kids kick a goal and seeing their face after, no price on that.
It’s ludicrous
Break it down into per week terms and have a think about it. Sounds like it’s on the lower end vs other sports out there.
The cost is largely for insurance. Funding of the senior team by junior teams IS a problem for many semi pro/elite level clubs, but not at the local/community level. The A-League isn’t struggling solely because of supposedly expensive junior prices. 
Last year we hosted a very successful Women’s World Cup. As an example, a mate who volunteers for a local club told me they added 16 new teams this season, 13 of which were women’s teams, this interest is off the back of the World Cup. Same story across the country. The event drove investment into our economy, and unprecedented interest in the sport. The government responded by investing not in women’s football, or even just football, but women’s sport generally. Of course any and all investment is welcome, but that means Auskick/rugby league etc benefit from the work football did, and can use that additional money (on top of their already generous and disproportionate investment per participant) to continue to subsidise their junior sports , while football, who did all the work, aren’t rewarded, and kids who want to play the game are punished because they are either turned away, or their families have to shell out for what they feel is an unreasonable fee compared to other sports.
That’s cheap! We paid 7.5x that for the year for our daughter.
It's bullshit that every sport has adapted "best practice" in charging the weekly game fee up front.

Good for the clubs as they've got all their money up front, but pretty tough on a family with three kids wanting to play two sports each.
Try being the parent of an aspiring figure skater *looks at wallet and cries*
3x is a massive lowball for dance and music - especially if the child gets super into it. When I was school age - in the 80’s / 90’s it was $50-$100 per week for my lessons then. (Ok, not starting - but once I was 6/7 I was having 2 private lessons and one group lesson a week - and that only got more once I got to high school and started more instruments and formal composition lessons.). Today it’s much much more!

The amounts mentioned here are exactly what it’s been plus or minus a little for my child’s primary school aged soccer. Expect to add $80/day for holiday camps, and extra bits once they start wanting to learn from a “coach”. She’s now u12s and some of the teams stump up cash to pay a coach. 

Dance - my kid does 4 or 5 (depending on term) lessons a week. Kids super serious her age are doing 15-20 lessons a week. I fell off my chair when she was invited into that program in year 4. She wasn’t that invested thankfully. (Work out the transport for that - and the cost!!!)
*cries in dance parent* 
Be glad they're not into Ballet...
My kids guitar is like 340 a term plus rental of a guitar (he’s not sure if he wants to keep acoustic or go electric so haven’t bought yet)
Basketball is similar $$ in our household 
It shouldn’t be  no wonder everyone’s getting fat
Yeah I’m heavily involved in softball and we’re fairly similar if not less. 

Making kids buy uniforms is just utterly disgusting to me.
Uniform is obviously essential for competitive matches or a league but this was just a training program hence why it seemed excessive and unnecessary.

They’ll grow out of them yearly at this age too so it’ll be $100/year.
Try getting them into karting 
Former cub leader here and we ran things on the smell of an oily rag.  Scouting Australia fees were paid to branch and we had our term fees which we kept low. Our yearly cost per cub or scout was about $425. For camps they could pay an extra $20 to $25 for two nights including food. 

I actually paid for a lot of activities out of pocket as I could justify it was my hobby and I loved it and those kids. This kept costs down considerably for families. 

Scouting is one of the cheapest activities kids can participate in and yet there is fuck all funding or consideration at most levels of government. Our group folded because we lost our venue.  Local and state government gave zero fucks. We just needed a shed at a park to store our shit in. Seriously fuck all.  So angry. 

Every activity we do with our kids is expensive. Swimming cost $18.50 for a half hour per week  and that’s the cheapest and that’s even at our council pool.  Martial arts is $45 a week for one kid but they’re a good school and worth it in my opinion.
Yeah, similar cost here in VIC. It ain't cheap! Wait till they go to Jamboree and it's like $2500!
Insurance costs are high too.
Just wait until they get bigger... $1200 skates $950 blades.
Yeah, the money in AFL is incomparable. Junior soccer has a higher participation rate, particularly for girls, but it’s not subsidised in the same way.
Launching flares at games is expensive mate.
Depends on the level of soccer. Local leagues are a lot cheaper than elite programs.

We used to pay over $2000 a year for my son in the NPL, but that was for over 30 games a year and top level training 3 times a week. When you break that down per session it isn't that much.

Whereas I currently pay about $250 a season for seniors in a local league.
The reason it needs to act like this because even though football has the highest participation rate in the country, it is funded lower by governments than Rugby League, AFL and Rugby Union. Maybe don’t be so snarky about things next time.
Not really relevant. Wages are far lower in NZ for a start.
Yep, almost 1k per term, plus uniforms plus competition fees. Soccer seems cheap in comparison
How does it equate out when you break it down per hour the kids are engaged?
Your experience is highly dependent on the club you join. My kids tried all the sports when they were younger, got the best kit at cricket but it ultimately didn't hold their attention, the sessions had a fair bit of standing around. Soccer on the other had we had to provide all the kit ourselves but they joined a great club and had an awesome coach, and just got a lot out of it. The small sided games in juniors kept things their interest up.
Depends how much uniform is involved
We started selling the shirts because borrowed shirts each week (ie the old kit bag) was a barrier to girls participation. We tried loaning a shirt a season but they never came back. We charge cost price, but it all adds up for parents.

Also volunteers are very thin on the ground these days. We have to pay a canteen person because otherwise it wouldn’t open.
No one is paid in amateur competitions, except referees. I think regional soccer associations are very different to metro also.
What about horse riding?
$670/fn
Buy a cheap decent acoustic like a tanglewood and they can graduate to electric later down the track. You'll always be able to use the acoustic as you can play it anywhere.
Get one someone is selling. Check the neck isn't twisted, and listen and play it. There are some surprisingly amazing second hand cheapies. Luthiery is an incredibly difficult craft, but due to the laws of probability, cheap guitars are occasionally amazing.

You have to try them, though.
And no wonder our soccer teams aren't as good as they could be.

Imagine how many kids with massive potential just never participate because their parents can't afford it.
People are getting fat because food, especially high calorie food, is so available and easy to get.
Ask around about secondhand uniforms. My sisters kids did soccer for years and she always got secondhand uniforms pretty cheaply.
Training program?

That kinda changes everything, as the responses in here are all assuming your kid is playing in a local association comp.

If it is a “training program”, then that is more of a for profit thing and the costs will all be higher.
I agree with you $100 for uniform is simple profiteering unless some real high end stuff.
My daughter did a 6 week course for $100 and paid $30 for shorts and a shirt.
I hear you!!

The value that a well-run Scout group delivers to the community can be immense, but like many community organisations they constantly run on a knife edge. Not only the financial aspects, but getting people to volunteer.

That was one of our biggest lessons from COVID. We spent a good 18 months asking parents to drop and run and it broke the cycle of new parents coming in and becoming volunteers.

We are exceptionally fortunate that we have a good committee and a good set of reliable, high yield fundraising activities because we're only now seeing our volunteering levels get back to where they were in 2019.

I would love to see government offer more support to help us build a stronger volunteer base. If they can adjust awards to support employers to give staff "volunteer leave" it would help. There's so many little things that are best done on week days, but most of our volunteers are working-age parents who can't get out of work at those times.

We're lucky that we own our own grounds and buildings, but as you say not all are so fortunate. State schools are often vacant when Scout groups are meeting and their grounds are specifically set up for young people. 

Too much of the crime and violence we see in society is because adults and children lack community engagment. Scouting can't fix it by itself, but I'm pretty confident that every $1 spent on Scouting, footie, karate, etc... save more than $1 in policing, courts, jails, etc...
Hello cost of BJJ uniforms
Nooooo    *curls in foetal position in corner*
That just demonstrates how bad they are at lobbying/negotiation. Also, what are they bringing to the table? QRL recently received some cash from the Qld Government for regional infrastructure, which was matched dollar for dollar by the QRL. What contribution is FQ making?
The facilities for soccer are ridiculous in our region. Local council spent millions on another football stadium and the largest soccer clubs in our regions don’t even have a female change room! Our women STILL get changed in the car.
That’s true, but surely there would be an expectation for 6 year olds to go the full tracksuit… right? shirt shorts and socks are cheap.
Did you not just have the kids hand the shirt back over at the end of the last game?

I’ve run kids sports for years and it’s rare not to get uniforms back. 

We also have a $20 deposit that is handed back when we get the unfiroms. It doesn’t cover the replacement but you’d be surprised how much of a motivator that is.
The shirt thing seems to work out our club but I see how it could be an issue.
I have heard of some clubs getting a deposit for the BBQ job, if you do it, you get it back, otherwise they use it to pay someone to run it.
Yeah that too
Hell yeah. People don’t realise the cost. 
Dentist 
Farrier 
Vet
Lessons
Pony/riding club
Safety equipment (helmet, jump vest,boots & clothes) after each growth spurt 

Then the cost of the horse (cheapest part)
Paddock & stable fees
Horse feed and hay
Rugs
Tack
Towing car
Horse float
And the list goes on and on
If playing a full size guitar, completely agree. You can keep acoustics for life.
I am for sure willing to give second hand a go! Will have a look around for one and give them a try.
Our kids definitely missed out on sports when they were younger as the costs were too prohibitive.  $500 upfront and then ongoing fees.. then most sports last a season and switch to a new one to get hit with thise costs again..  

That's a choice between groceries and rent etc.  We worked hard to save and get better jobs and things and as they have gotten older we can do more for them but 

I've always felt bad they couldn't try every thing they wanted to when they wanted too.
Soccer is a MASSIVE racket compared to other sports. Once you get up the ranks, ie kids rep level you have to pay thousands to register plus travel plus this that and the other. Total scam and yes so many would not be able to afford those types of financial demands (often with little notice)
Isn't capitalism wonderful! 

Setting up our society so that the only motivation for anyone to do anything is to make money out of it was certainly a brilliant idea! it's led to *such* wonderful outcomes - really allowing humankind to achieve our full potential!
For sure that too but low income families these days don’t have 300 cash for their kids to play soccer either it’s a bit sad if u ask me
Sure, but sedentary lifestyles also make a big difference, the average adult sits at a desk 8 hours a day.
A little column A, a little column B. More diet than exercise but kids who are continually active and doing lots of sport can put away ungodly amounts of food and not get fat.
Mostly because companies spend a LOT of money making these foods as addictive as possible as well
Most of the time they get a new uniform every year, it’s nice on one hand because it would make the kids feel special, but it is also very wasteful / a waste of money. 
I wonder how many clothes that end up in landfill or Africa are last years kids sporting team clothes.
$100 for a uniform doesn't sound that much.

I can't imagine the quality of a $15 sports jersey.
We've had a whole disaster with blades this year. Couldn't import her usual blades - MK phantoms - so had to move to a cheaper ($585 for Jackson apex) competitor that's similar but not the same. She hates it. So now that we're able to import the other ones again, I have to drop another $950. Coach would prefer her in a Goldseal but I'm not in the mood to try all the blades.
The women’s World Cup was a massive success in Australia around the whole country. Yet all the governments committed money to women’s sport, barely any of which reached football. Why are other codes benefiting from the success of football?

Also lobbying is bad when done by mining companies but required for sports??
When have team rooms ever been gendered?

Aren't there 2 and the home team uses one and the other uses the other?
> Did you not just have the kids hand the shirt back over at the end of the last game? 

That’s where it can be a little more difficult with girls than boys though. Usually easy enough for boys to change their shirt on the sideline, girls would need privacy to do that
And yet a lot of the British, Spanish and south American superstars come from the super lower class.
you don't have to play soccer for your school to stay fit
From what I understand, most of the science point to exercise having a suprisingly low impact on weight loss or gain. When you exercise, most of the calories you're using are actually being drawn from other processes within your body, rather than burning excess calories on top. There is some impact, but much less than you'd expect, and that impact drops quickly as your body gets used to your exercise routine.

Health professionals are understandably reluctant to actually communicate the above, because the general public are short-sighted and weight loss is a valuable carrot to wave around and convince them to exercise for the other, less-visible but more important health benefits it brings. But it's well-documented in the literature that calorie intake is vastly more important to weight loss than exercise in most cases.
She wears the top 3-4 days a week and it’s lasted 7 months
We're not quite at that level yet, thank heavens, but even as a relative newbie to the sport the $60 bucks a week ($30 for lesson and $15 twice weekly for practise sessions) is killing us. Ah well that's part of being a parent I guess!
And all that popularity didnt transfer to the alw. Why would the government invest when no one cares outside major events
At our facility, the only change rooms also house the only men’s toilets. So men have to go into the change room to use the bathroom…therefore it can only be a men’s change room. Ridiculous I know. It was built 40 years plus ago. We now have a grant to change this.
Yes the sport I’m in is mainly girls. They go the toilet and change.
That’s right, it’s not a barrier for them overseas plus they scout talent young and pay for everything. In Australia, if you come from a low socio economic family and don’t beg borrow and steal to keep playing and progressing, you’re iced out
Cool. Must feel like a dream
We aren't even at "that level" yet, but she's very tall and has torn tendons out twice already so she needs to feel comfortable and secure in her equipment for safety. She's got stiffer boots than she'd need if not for injury, so that's expense. It's never been about winning though, this is just her favourite hobby
It did transfer to the alw. This last season it was the most attended women’s sporting league ever, with massive growth in memberships, attendance and tv viewing numbers.

Tell me more how that didn’t translate. Name a more iconic duo than r/Australia and talking about something they have no idea on.
What men's toilet only has urinals?

There's no reason for it to be a 'men's toilet'.

This is such an easily solvable problem.
