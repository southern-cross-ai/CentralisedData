Am very curious to do a deeper dive into who are the top dancers in Australia's scene. It's a real shame they never got to represent us at the Olympics.

Crickets, lol. Nobody knows anyone in “the scene”, they’re just making excuses for the second hand embarrassment they felt when an Aussie made a goose of herself in front of the *cool* countries.
Breakdancing peaked in 1984 (with the movie Breakdance 2 - Electric Boogaloo). It was been in steep decline since then.
How about we just let this thing fizzle out hey? It was only a demo sport, it's not going to be at the olympics again (ever, thank fuck), it can go back to being the very niche thing that it was just a week ago.

Nah, someone has to be held accountable for allowing this to happen.
Allowing what to happen? She made the team because she was the best at it, or is that not how olympic qualifying goes???
