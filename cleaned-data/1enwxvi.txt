If there’s any justice in the world - Linda Reynolds waddles away from this wearing a fucking barrel.
So hope reynolds loses and has to pay all costs....
> Senator Kitching had been sent an anonymous letter containing information there had been an incident in Senator Reynolds’ office.

>Senator Reynolds had told the court earlier this week that Senator Kitching told her about the letter and that Labor knew about the incident and were going to “rain hell” on her.

>But Senator Kitching publicly denied having that conversation with Senator Reynolds, after she privately told Labor senators she knew.
Typical failed management response, same things teachers have to deal with non stop. Just tone-deaf management.

The ABC article is revealing:

> Today the court heard Senator Reynolds knew Ms Higgins had been found partially undressed and drunk to the point of memory loss in her parliament house office on March 23, 2019, had told another colleague Bruce Lehrmann had been on top of her and wanted to see a doctor.

> However, she testified those things did not make her think there had been sexual activity without consent.


Like wtf? Gods I hate how these nasty cover-your-ass managers seem to be everywhere, no matter how dumb their arguments sound.
Scotty didn't hold a fire hose, while Linda was no counsellor.

This all follows on pretty naturally from the judgement in Lehrmann v Network Ten, where the judge basically ruled that just because Higgins had posited a ludicrous conspiracy theory about her employer it didn't mean she hadn't been raped.  I'm sure Lee J wasn't trying to invite a defamation suit from Reynolds, but it's the effect the judgement was just about bound to have.
She’s never short of an answer.
I couldn’t agree with you more. And I think it’s one of the main things that’s wrong with the education system..
Even though the court heard nothing from Linda Reynolds in that case. And now that a court is hearing from her, she’s scoring a lot of own goals.
I’m not sure of the extent of the “ludicrous conspiracy theory about her employer”. But if anything this trial has shown, Ms Reynolds lied about when she knew things, accused the police commissioner of incorrectly taking contemporaneous notes, background media against Ms Higgins. Add in the providing information to Bruce’s solicitor and sharing privileged documents that were confidential. 

I’m more inclined to think that Ms Higgins should be suing Ms Reynolds for what she has done rather than the other way around
The provision of confidential information to the media and even talking to Bruce’s solicitor is a very bad look for her.
100% 👍🏻
