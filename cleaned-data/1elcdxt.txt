>Justice Paul Tottle suggested adjourning the court, to which Senator Reynolds replied: “Thank you, this is a particularly emotional point, given that it led to Senator Kitching’s death”.

Mannnn, what a piece of work.

Surely Reynolds couldn’t get any lower..

>“I was incredibly angry, I was incredibly hurt and (Ms Higgins) could not have picked a worse issue to bring me down,” she said.

Okay, well now I’m wondering how it could even be considered possible to defame someone of such little moral character.
Invoking a passed away Senator from the opposing party isn't a good way to shutdown the notion you were a ruthless political operator during one of the biggest scandals in Australian politics.
I didn't think my opinion of Reynolds could get lower but she seems hell bent on finding ways.
Linda Reynolds to sue Linda Reynolds for defamation for making Linda Reynolds look like a piece of shit.
> “I said to her, ‘why would anybody weaponise such an incident’,” she on Tuesday.

...proceeds to weaponise such an incident.
She is simply a disgusting thing.
I've hated her ever since her repeated assaults on the disabled community. It's nice to see that she's now getting the appropriate level of universal disgust.
Fear leads to Anger, Anger leads to Hate, Hate… leads to suffering
So Ben Roberts-Smith passed the braincell to Bruce Lehrmann who has now passed it to Linda Reynolds… interesting.
Dig up stupid.
Oh fuck off Linda
Wow. She has knocked Peta Credlin off my most hated woman top spot. I never thought it possible that someone more despicable than that creature could exist..
Just when you think this woman couldn't get any more vile she finds a way
There really is no level of Shame this piece of shit waste of oxygen poor excuse of a human won’t stoop to is there. 

And in her twisted mind, her and her other evil cohort of Liberal women who are all for punishing other humans beyond any Level that is humane or justifiable, see others pain and punishment as a badge of honour. True modern Christian’s and their baked in Christian hatred of all they see.
Reynolds, if there was any final doubt that you're an absolutely vile human being - you have now confirmed that to be the case.
As my gran used to say, oldmate Linda is a "nasty piece of work". What is it with these ex-defence politicians and public servants? Just rotten. 
My God, this woman sucks.
She seems to be going for the title of biggest douchebag/scumbag/lowlife of the Morrison Liberal party administration.. And she's got some stellar company too..
I'm a staunch Labor/Greens/Independent supporter. I detest Liberals with every fibre of my being.

But I'll tell you this: had Reyonolds come to court on Day 1 and said, \*"I believe I did not cover anything up. I am hurt by the accusations. I could proceed with the defamation case to (attempt to) clear my name but I'm not going to do that. Doing that would weaken Brittany Higgins case. I don't want to subject a rape victim to further stress, nor do I want to penalise her by taking from her compensation. I chose to do it this way to have maximum media coverage for me to assert my (alleged) innocence. I apologise to Brittany for the stress as such this has caused. Above all, I hope that she can see that rape survivor's deserve support and so whilst I am upset about the damage to my reputation, I am withdrawing my litigation case because ultimately, I support Brittany and all people who find themselves the victims of rape and sexual assault"\*

I think I may have been open to thinking more highly of her and the Liberal party.

However, I will FOREVER associate Linda Reynolds with the following:

\* saying that Brittany, a woman who was raped in parliament, was a 'lying cow'

\* that she is stealing Brittany's compensation for having been raped in parliament house and that Brittany has to sell her house to defend herself

\* that Linda is living up to her middle name of Karen

\* that Linda is now trying to pin the death of someone onto Brittany and trying to submit alleged conversations as evidence when these cannot be verified by the person  involved.

Seriously, FUCK Linda Reynolds! Such a vile human being!
Linda Reynolds, with her spin,  
Plays the victim, claims to win,  
But in her web of twisted lies,  
The truth, obscured, quietly dies.  

A senator's death she dares to link,  
To Higgins' tale, to make us think,  
That blame resides in her own hands,  
Yet it’s her fault, the fire that fans!  

She cries of damage, reputation’s plight,  
But uses pain for her own fight,  
In court, her anger, bitter, cold,  
A tale of power, bought and sold.  

With every claim, she shifts the blame,  
Weaponizing shame, a sordid game,  
The whispers loud, the stories spun,  
In politics, no battle’s won.  

So watch her closely, see the guise,  
Behind her mask, deceitful eyes,  
For Linda’s tale, though wrapped in grief,  
Is but a ploy for false relief.
My god I hope this piece of human garbage gets ruined! Take everything she has and give it Higgins.
Linda Reynolds is now targeting another rape survivor, Saxon Mullins, for setting up crowdfunding for Brittany Higgins.

Reynolds is an utter cunt.
I remember during the reading of the Lehrmann defamation verdict that the judge said even if he won, it would be a very small amount.




I wonder if it will be something similar in this case. Linda Reynold’s reputation is largely based on her own actions. She is aggressively pursing an SA victim over a few social media posts that don’t seem to have been widely viewed, and very few people seem to be aware of the contents of them.



It seems like the settlement offers can’t have been very reasonable either? That’s just speculation though, I can’t imagine that Higgins would want to sit through another courtroom process.
How can you claim defamation of character after you've just proven you will stoop to whatever you need to do to one up someone?

What a fucking horrible human being
Wow. What a piece of work. Really living up to the LNP stereotype
Linda Reynolds she's pure trash
Lying fucking cow. How does she still have a job?
How is it possible after such a big bada-boom that there’s still unexploded ordnance at the site?
Hope Kitchings family sue her… only way these people learn is to have the process backfire in incredible ways.
Reynolds further cementing the fact that she is a despicable piece of shit.
She lacks both the warmth and depth of the thing I'd like to call her
>“Ms Higgins thinks she can provide a social media running commentary on my client’s evidence,” he told the Western Australian Supreme Court on Monday.

So anything Higgins says is somehow an attack on Reynolds?  WTF!
I thought her calling this "a fairytale" was the lowest she could go.
What a cow
Reynolds is a despicable PoS, a real-life Dolores Umbridge.  Also don't know what she's trying to achieve here, apart from continuance of aforementioned shittyness, as on the balance in a civil trial, Bruce *did* rape Brittany.
Doesn’t seem like the steady hand one would want as a defence minister..
She is very much the fleshy face of privilege and shameless arrogance the defines the low point of Australian politics
There is a part of me who wonders if Reynolds knows she might not win at this point and is just trying to do as much damage to Higgins as possible.

She clearly cannot stand that people would be willing to front up money to support Higgins' ongoing health expenses and legal fees after what came out today
What a fucken low down, dirty piece of shit.
What a piece of work.
What a low thing to do. Her legacy won’t be looking good.
This woman is an absolute cunt of a thing.
It's been over a decade of constant  " ....Surely they can't lower the bar any  further ..." ...and then they do....and every time, it's just exasperating.

 Normal , well adjusted people with even a tiny amount of moral code and microscopic amount of ethics don't act like this. 

Is this who we want making the rules for us? Thank God she's not in Gov anymore.

My God.
What an absolute cunt.
This woman has completely destroyed her own life, career and reputation.

What a clown.
She really is a piece of work. Very ugly in spirit
She’s working hard to take the least likable parliamentarian title from Michaela cash and formerly Bronwyn bishop
Rotten, vile cunt.
Hasn't she defamed her own character?
The A typical wealthy political  cunt of Australia. Dumb as fuck but screws over everyone to get what they want
This callous bitch has no limits does she?
Shoulda gone to Specsavers Senator...
She (allegedly) called Higgins a "Lying Cow", then retracted it. [https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-03-12/linda-reynolds-retracts-lying-cow-comment-brittany-higgins/13242902](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-03-12/linda-reynolds-retracts-lying-cow-comment-brittany-higgins/13242902)

Sounds like a really caring woman.
Classy Linda
What an evil bitch of a woman she must be. Who could vote for such a low-life, nasty piece of work?.
The fuck's wrong with this bitch?

Sharon Strzelecki's evil twin.
She’s truly undefameable surely?
> Reynolds said she was “incredulous” Labor would make such a plan and that she elevated the issue to the prime minister’s office before telling the court her blood pressure was rising.

“You’re making me angry. You wouldn’t like me when I’m angry.”
Ooh she's got the devil in her this one
What a cunt
I'd call this woman a cunt but she lacks the warmth and depth
Fucking hell what a cunt
Literally no words - wow !
you fucking what
All hail the queen of doubling down 🧌
I just don't get what Reynolds hopes to achieve from this. Even if the court rules that she was defamed, the outcome is she effectively bankrupts a young woman who was raped, taking from her the very money that she was given in the hope of rebuilding her life. I mean, that's going to do way more damage to your reputation than anything said in the preceding years.

There are no winners in this.
Daaayuuum.
What a see you next Tuesday 👎
What I don't understand is that a federal liberal senator (and therefore has a better understanding than most of Australia's defamations laws) thinks it's a *good* idea to take this to court knowing that the discovery process is going to uncover far more dirt than she'd ever want to show.

Even if she wins she loses. What's to gain here?

This seems almost as dumb as the time the attorney general of Australia still-accused anal rapist Christian Porter settled his own case against the ABC for what amounted to a tiny little apology and no costs - the discovery process was far more damaging than the ABC story.
I absolutely love it. She can’t help herself, and has no idea how it makes her look. This is coming from the same person who tried to pass “helpful”
notes to Lehmann’s lawyers while the criminal trial was underway. She’s going to think she’s onto a winner right up until the moment the judgement comes down on her.
I reckon her lowest was the every fairytale needs a villain line, implying that being raped is a fairytale, and Bruce Lehman isn't the villain.
Looks like Reynolds has handed the defense their strategy: how can you damage the public perception of a person's character when it is already in the toilet to begin with?
How dare she get raped!
Can someone with some legal experience explain what she was thinking?
Higgins didn’t start this, Linda…
She thinks it brought on her death because even though Kitching denied ever saying anything to LR, LR told penny wong and some other ALP women that she did, and even though Wong and co deny bullying kitching, LR likes to think they bullied her to death, and from shitstorm she started.  This situation is the most horrible thing about her, and I don’t know why it is not getting more attention. 

Kitching had an unsent letter in her office, where she denied ever saying anything to LR. She also posted that LR was callous and horrible for calling NDIS recipients welfare for lifers.
Convenient there is no way of corroborating if  this conversation took place.
Her outside accurately reflects her inside
It seems Linda should have sued for commendation instead
Yep, I don’t know why more isn’t made of this point. Putting words in a dead woman’s mouth. Kitching wrote a letter denying ever saying anything to LR.
Malignant narcissist
I find it difficult to get past this  -

> In early 2019, she was a strong opponent of the medevac bill that expanded the medical evacuation of asylum seekers from offshore processing facilities to Australia. In a speech to the Senate, she said that the bill would encourage unauthorised arrivals by boat and that as a result the military would "have to recover the bloated corpses of babies and women mauled by sharks".

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linda_Reynolds
Indeed. When it was we, the disabled, getting abused by Linda no one else gave a rats. It's interesting what people pick and choose is important to them.
Sand gets everywhere....
I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.
Fear is the path to the dark side
We forgot about Christian Porter already?
The ole brain-cell baton!!
Are you saying they are all ginger cats?
There's a Gina at the door, apparently she wants a word with you.
Catherine Campbell anyone?
(Dis)honourable mention to Rita Panahi while we’re on the topic.
Why would you decide to round out a good post by, for some reason, linking it all to Christianity as though that's the singular, self-evident unifying theory? That chip on your shoulder must be heavy.
Don’t forget her lawyer describing Brittany’s story about her rape as a ‘fairytale’ (as in Brittany’s story needed a villain for the fairy tale)

Cause her lawyers apparently think a rapist isn’t a villain.
I can not imagine any politician doing what you said though. Hell I struggle to imagine anyone willing to do what you suggested Linda Reynolds should have done. Not trying to defend the cow, just saying what you posted would be an amazing effort from ANYONE, let alone an LNP pollie.
Well done 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
Reynolds herself made sure they were widely viewed and known about. Streisand Effect.

Hopefully the court takes that as consideration.
> ... very few people seem to be aware of the contents of them.


I'd be prepared to bet that very few people even know who Linda Reynolds is.
Would almost mean she needs to prove she has a character to defame as a starting point.
The Liberals do not believe in accountability, that's how.
Creme brulee?
That's why we call them "Ankles". 3ft lower than a cunt, and lacking warmth or depth.
Dog cunts aren't very deep so it says a lot
To be fair posting a book that is explicitly about how the law fails women and is used to shut them up is pretty on the nose here.
This isn't about Brittany or Bruce - This is about Linda and her poor hurt feelings
👍
Yet in the comments in The Daily Mail there is a bunch of comments supporting LR. But that is the only place I can find any support for her.
She is a sitting senator
And as hard as a title that is to achieve she seems to be pulling ahead in the challenge of appearing to be a soulless husk of human skin draped over a demonic entity.
She's a typical Liberal... when she's asked to defend her case, she points around the room saying "what about them?
And she made the whole thing up. Probably leaked to ALP herself then told Wong and co that Kitching told her. They found an unsent letter in Kitching office denying she ever said anything to LR. LR thinks Wong and co bullied Kitching to death - all started by her. It’s just horrible.
Even if found in favour, her reputation is so bad, that I think even $1 would be over compensating.
sociopath definition
A sociopath, also referred to as an individual with antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), is characterized by a range of antisocial behaviors and attitudes, including:
Deceit
Lack of empathy and remorse
Failure to conform to social norms, including lawful behaviors, with a reckless disregard for the safety of others
The LNP are brain dead that’s why. I mean their own attorney general did the exact same thing and lost… how dumb can you get? You’d think Porter would know more about the law being a lawyer and all.
Side note: I just had a look at her profile and I don't see anything that would give her any knowledge of defamation law. Bachelor of Commerce and some military service, a brief stint with Raytheon (which puts her up there with Julie Bishop as a morally-bankrupt corporate shill, in my opinion). But no law stuff.
It’s worse. She is a SENATOR. They used to be held to a higher standard. However you polish her, she’s a turd.
>What's to gain here? 


Revenge
>What I don't understand is that a federal liberal senator (and therefore has a better understanding than most of Australia's defamations laws)

You don't need an understanding of the law, you just need a big enough bankroll to send the other person bankrupt before you are.

The laws are working as intended from when the Liberal Party last amended them.
Blind hatred and a sense of entitlement do that to people.she genuinely thinks she's in the right.
Reynolds is retiring at the next election, citing the trauma she has suffered as a result of the lehrmann/Higgins saga as a significant motivation for her retirement
She's got Bruce Lehrmann giving legal advice I think.
Seeing as it’s at the trial, I’m assuming she’s not worried about the discovery process anymore …
>What I don't understand is that a federal liberal senator (and therefore has a better understanding than most of Australia's defamations laws)

I think it is also the arrogance and a bit of Dunning Kruger. They're in a position of privilege and they too often get away with bullying people through the legal system.
Is it as dumb as a defamation case by a Lib revealing that they were, in fact, the war criminal they were reported to be?
She's approaching JK Rowling levels of insanity
There's no reasoning with malignant narcissists.
I couldn't believe it when I saw that. How the fuck does she not have the self awareness to sense how that would sound?


I'm not surprised cunts like this are in Parliament. But how was she a cabinet minister, for fuck's sake?
She was just a garden variety party political hack before this, could’ve easily slipped quietly into retirement……
And then say rude shit about me when I didn't report it, offered her a transfer and ordered the couch to be steam cleaned before even talking to the cops.
Thinks she’s smarter than the rest of the room. 

(I have no legal experience but often think I’m the smartest person in the room, with similarly disastrous results - luckily my room is reddit and not a court of law)
When Kitching had died, they found an unsent letter from her saying she never spoke to Reynolds. But Reynolds told Wong and co that she did. Wong and co deny it, but LR likes to think they bullied her to death.
Unnecessary
She didn’t send it
I fucking hate how smug she looks in all the pics.
Wow. What a nasty piece of work.
That’s not true. Kitching called her a callous overpaid, scandal plagued bungler.
It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere
“What’s inside the box?”

“Pain…. But every player gets a prize! It’s the Gom Jabbar Lucky Dip!”
Only an Australian Senator would deal in absolutes
Having had to recently put down my ginger mate, I wish they had the heart of a ginger cat!
Margaret Thatcher would be fuming to hear her name disrespected rn.
Before she eats you...
omfg! I must've not absorbed that reference initially through my anger. Seriously, Linda Reynolds and her legal team are beyond the pale!
I see your point but damn, I'd have had the utmost of respect for her if she had. She could have garnered so much respect and support from the public for a truly selfless act if she had and it would have been a speech as memorable as Gillard's 'Misogyny' speech. I think that some people would have been left sceptical for sure only because such personal sacrifices are rare but it could have just as easily been defended by countering questions as to why by reiterating she doesn't want to steal from Brittany's, a rape victim, compensation to (try to) clear her name and that being a politician, she understands that people's opinions of her and her reputation are going to be contentious regardless. I do think Brittany would have needed to have said or done something that would indicate that she regretted Reynolds' situation but appreciated the personal sacrifice Reynolds was making but that neither of them would have been there in such a position had it not been for the abhorent actions of a certain rapist. Again, this would require a magnanimous act from Brittany but I understand that during pre litigation negotiations, she was willing to be open to some concessions so may have been open to this?

It would have helped to give some rape survivors the confidence in coming forward. Instead, Reynolds' actions only seek to prevent victims in coming forward because if a rape trial(s) isn't traumatic enough, now rape survivors have to contend with the possibility that people pertinent to their case may seek to litigate against them for how they navigated through their trauma of having been raped!

Freeze her and then polish to a "high" shine.
> They used to be held to a higher standard.

When?

Barnaby was a senator 20 years ago
Truss was a senator for 25 years, Vanstone entered the senate in 1984 
The worlds biggest luddite was elected in the 80s as well. 

Then you have the senators in 1970s that fucked with the budget on the request of fraser.
Not always. That's where the major parties also park people who are too odious to be voted in at the House, and it has a lot of factional warlords and ideologues as a result.


It's most obvious where the Liberals are concerned. Most of their craziest politicians have been Senators. 
My bad *senator not MP.
Brittney spends all her money now (buying a French chateau) and has no intention of earning money until this case is over. Linda can't tear down a woman who has nothing. Brittney holds all the cards here and has nothing to lose.

Linda may lose her assets, her reputation and job.

Edit: she bought, didn't rent. She sold it too.
> you just need a big enough bankroll to send the other person bankrupt before you are.

Reynolds has mortgaged her house to cover her legal fees. This isn't some unlimited pocket fight on her side.
She is suing the husband cause he wrote I See you Linda and it made her feel stalked and creeped out. - seriously, she will be tagged as a frivolous litigator and banned from the courts.
Why doesn't she just retire now ?
Right!


Most of Australia wouldn't know who she is. And those who do mostly know her name for negative reasons.


Phenomenal case of Main Character Syndrome.
What a cow
Did she do all that? That’s damning, and criminal.
If you think you are the smartest in the room you've miscalculated badly and need to check again.
Yeah we can all see it, doesn’t need pointing out.
Whatever you're picking up on is coming from you and not me, mate
Pretty grim.

> Garfield Barwick

Sir Garfield Barwick

Not a fan of some of his work - but he deserves the honorific
Wait how did I forget Scotty took the AG role
I see lots of bouncing around in one or two year contracts in here: [APH page about her](https://www.aph.gov.au/Senators_and_Members/Parliamentarian?MPID=250216).

So possibly she was just climbing the ladder, looking for a step up each time she took a new position. And/or no-one liked her enough to offer a second contract when the first one finished. But she was involved in party politics from early on, so maybe all of it was just killing time until she could get elected.
Oh I get it now. Yeah, half the party are lawyers. Even if defamation hadn't come up in conversation before, you'd think she'd ask around before doing something like this. But then, Porter and Dutton use it as a tool of intimidation so maybe theyre all egging her on.
Can we just freeze her?
It  was a thing way back. I didn’t say they were well behaved. Only they were held to a higher standard. See Neville abonner who was a true senator.
She bought that and is selling/sold it due to the trial.
Her reputation could get worse. And it's already so bad.

She's planning on retiring on money Brittney doesn't have and won't owe her because she's not going to win.

This case makes her look more like scum than any words out of her actual mouth ever did.
Renting a chateau? Please tell me you are being sarcastic. She bought a home. Not a fucking chateau. Reynolds didn’t have to bring this legal action forward and she choose to mortgage her home to fund this farcical defamation.
> and has no intention of earning money until this case is over.

Her settlement was based on her not being able to work again
[(see 2.1.1b in the settlement and 4.2 in the draft statement of particulars)](https://www.fedcourt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0014/114062/Exhibit-59-Deed-of-Settlement-and-Release_Redacted.pdf). But none-the-less, even if she doesn't earn until the case is over, that doesn't stop a judgement that is financially detrimental to her. (See the costs judgement against Bruce for example).
I daresay she will find a mysterious cabal ready to finance her, should the need arise (*a la* Christian Porter) maybe they are just being more covert about it these days.
Reynolds mortgaged 1 of her houses, She had 2 +  a holiday house last  I checked.
Why forego 350k
Like most Senators and MP's, they want to milk the public teet for as long as they legally can (and in some cases, and then some). Barilaro was a perfect example, along with a good chunk of current Nationals like Joyce.
The o be fair she was a long time defence reservist that managed to get to the lofty heights of defence minister, she would’ve had the top brass sucking up to her so she obviously thought her shit didn’t stink.
A lying one for that.
Her kinda not directly. It was her office/employees. So she just carefully ignored information and acted dumb.
I am no fan of Reynolds but the steam cleaning is a falsehood that gained momentum. 

A cleaner was asked (by DPS staff as I recall) to come and check the suite and look for signs of a party and/or sex. 

He might have wiped the couch down (this I cant recall) but did look for signs of condoms and checked the toilet. 

I still suspect there was a subtle coverup but there was no steam cleaning, it just sounds good.
Right now I am the smartest in the room, and also the stupidest (I am in the room by myself)
Anyone can be that dickhead. Deciding not to be that dickhead is what adults do. What you did is on you, mate.
It's all about Linda Reynolds.

Even Higgins rape is about Reynolds publicity.  Higgins got raped to attack Reynolds.  Am I right?

Higgins is against Reynolds, the Labor party is against her, Lehrman is against her.  Poor Linda.
Even without the knighthood, he is unmistakeable.
No he wasn't sorry. Not qualified for that one
So she did.
> because she's not going to win.

If it was so certain that Brittany would win, I would have thought there would be no-win-no-fee solicitors scrambling over each other to represent her.
My bad. Bought.

I'm standing my ground on calling it a chateau (coz both left and right news call it that too).

I wonder if a court loss in Australia could claim assets in France?
Not likely. She's not as important or as protected as he was.


She's got a shocking case of Main Character Syndrome and I hope she loses everything.
She may have even “sold her house” to her benefactor who will gift it back after trial. If we’re being conspiratorial.
It seemed more like ass covering than a political coverup. Still, Linda Reynolds comes across as a disgusting and spiteful person in her Spotlight interview, and in her determination to take action against an SA victim.
> Reynolds acted dumb

I can think of an immediate rebuttal to that charge
Accomplices are criminals.
You shouldn’t be downvoted for fact-checking. We can condemn Reynolds on the actual facts as they stand without using misinformation.
He used industrial leather cleaner on the leather couch. No steam clean, but a dna clean anyway.
Lol downvoted (unsurprisingly) for stating a fact that doesn’t align with the lies people have convinced themselves to believe in. Any info that doesn’t blame Reynolds is unacceptable here.
The keyboard warrior, his job complete, rides off into the sunset, as dramatic music starts to.swell

🤣
Are you concerned about Linda’s feelings?
Come on. It’s a very clear reference to the trial that was starting that day. 

I’m fully on Higgins side and hope she wins. But pretending it’s not relevant? Idiotic.
Well yeah I mean how many people are called Garfield Barwick?
There's no requirement for an Attorney General to be legally qualified - so Scotty could have been - but he probably wasn't smart enough to know it

At the Federal level, they almost all have been - except for one little anomaly - Katy Gallagher was Attorney General (and Minister for Finance, Minister for Health, Minister for Women, Minister for Social Services) for nine days - in an interim cabinet at the beginning of the current Albanese gov't

At the state level it varies - Qld had non lawyers from 1932 through to 1986
I am honestly not sure she will be a big earner in the future. The poor woman has been traumatised over and over again and her mental health has taken an obvious battering, both from the rape and everything since. She may now have powerful friends who could coddle her into something that may provide a decent living for her, but she also might be completely broken by the end of it all
> left and right news call

Left like the ABC run by the ex-newscorps managers or left like the age run by the former leaders of the liberal party?
Could someone explain the disagreement here? What actually *is* a chateau? And is it politically loaded somehow to define it as a chateau?
She also does not have a penis and is therefore very disposable to the LNP.
Election year, LNP staff in LNP offices which wasn't the first time something like this happened. ScoMo was pm and saying shit about women being lucky they weren't getting shot. Plenty of politics in this one unfortunately.
meh, its par for the course. 

I think the bigger controversy is that this clearly happened so regularly that DPS staff knew what to do when staffers came back to party/bang in offices afterhours. 

FWIW I think Reynolds is a stupid POS.
She’s not going to read this dude
> It’s a very clear reference to the trial that was starting that day. 

Did Higgins mention Reynolds in that post?  No.  Anything about the case?  No.  

You're saying if Higgins says anything about rape or women it's about Reynolds?  I don't think so.
>At the state level it varies - Qld had non lawyers from 1932 through to 1986

And that turned out well
Chateau = castle pretty much. Mainly in the Loire of France. She has une Maison. A house. That is now up for sale. What’s that line about not believing everything you read in the media? That has bitten me in the arse several times.
> What actually is a chateau?

... 1 lmgtfy later ...

château, in France, during the 13th and 14th centuries, a castle, or structure arranged for defense rather than for residence.
> I think the bigger controversy is that this clearly happened so regularly that DPS staff knew what to do when staffers came back to party/bang in offices afterhours.
