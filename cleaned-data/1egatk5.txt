Likely the numbers should be enough to avoid an increase in interest rates. Unemployment continues to increase. Over a thousand dumped on jobseeker from REX going into administration. Hope the number does not increase as further changes are made at REX
"The only way is up, baby!"
To hike or not to hike is something the RBA is going to need to deal with.

The rest of us need to accept that there are no rate cuts coming in the next few months. Unemployment is going to be double digits and probably a real recession called before rate cuts become a possibility. When they do, very few are going to be even considering borrowing even with 0% rates.

But hey, perhaps I am wrong. I would not bet the house on it though.
I don't know where he got the numbers from, but Ian Verrender at the ABC was saying "likely to come in at anywhere between 3.9 per cent and 4.1 per cent year-on-year" just yesterday (https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-07-30/why-the-rba-should-hold-off-on-interest-rate-hike-inflation/104156966).

So... perhaps a small glimmer of hope that RBA holds off on another rise. One can only hope.
We should import more migrants.
Another rate hike is needed to bring inflation back to 2%-3%. Look at [US CPI](https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm). They've been stuck at above 3% CPI for a year from maintaining the same interest rate. The same will happen for AUS.
I would love a rate rise, please.
Tax time leads people to buy stuff big shocker
13million vs like 2000 employees to which most will cover different service providers required due to a market gap. Not sure REX is some behemoth loss.

Well you are in luck because despite what the pundits in here are saying. I believe a rate rise is a certainty.
