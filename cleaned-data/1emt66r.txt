>How Changamire Chipangamazano, *not his real name*

Iâ€™m accusing the journo of racial profiling at this point.
' Some Qld cops they really know the way to lose their jobs they get the ........'  No culture change by Qld police over the years. Sad this man thinks he is not welcome here. Anyone, no matter what, racial background should not have been arrested for a seat belt incident at a peto station.
Ah QPOL kicking goals again. 10/10 police work. Feel safer every day knowing they were breaking this blokes arm because he wasn't wearing a seatbelt while driving at walking pace.

WE ARE ALL SAFER FOR THEIR ACTIONS. GOD BLESS THE POLICE.
If this account is accurate those cops should be fired. Not wearing a seatbelt to move between petrol station pumps? Those punks were just being arseholes.
This will be a problem as long as the pigs are allowed to investigate themselves. The Ethical Standards Command should be part of the CCC, not QPS.
Can you imagine how good society would be if cops were all straight?!? 

Iâ€™d even settle for 80% straight!
Recently punished for not wearing a seatbelt and the picture itself did not do me any justice ether.. But looking into the seatbelt law Iâ€™m sure I read that youâ€™re â€œnot required to wear it while travelling really short distances at very low speed..

Sort of, but not really

The Changamire dynasty ruled what is now Zimbabwe during the 18th Century

Chipangamazano or Chipanga Mazano are pretty common as a name amongst the Shona people

So the journo is kinda calling him King Smith - but with a Zimbabwean flavour

It would be the same as using Nguyen Anh as a pseudonym for a Vietnamese person
Maybe the guy chose that name for himself in the article. I certainly hope so anyway.
This pulled me up totally when I read the article - why not just ''John Smith (not his real name)''?
At first glance that name looked like Changamire Chimpanzamazano
Well TIL. Nicely explained
Mea culpa also!!!ðŸ˜‚
