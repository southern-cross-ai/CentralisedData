Anyone have any ideas on internet based channels? 

Im trying to cut my parents off foxtel, but they hate having to pick and choose shows on netflix and just want to have something like traditional tv where content changes after an episode.

I found samsung tvs have their own streamed channels, but otherwise Im out of ideas and my google searches arent returning anything.

Fetch TV?

You can get a mini box for under $100, and select channel packs (with a few channels familiar from foxtel). 

I pay $18 a month for 3 channel packs. I loved it so much I bought mum one too, we just share the same account so she can use my channel pack subscription :) easy to use too cause the streaming channels are mixed in with the free to air channels, so no fumbling about changing inputs to watch FTA.
Just to let everyone know, I was offered platinum Foxtel, every channel for $40 a month and free IQ box (which I will never use) just last month.

I've been on-again off-again with Foxtel for 20 years and this is the best deal they have ever offered me and there have been some good ones in the past.

Figure this must mean they are pretty desperate.

Use this as a bargaining chip for your next contract.
>they ... just want to have something like traditional tv

Umm, how about ... free to air tv?

It seems to be exactly what they want and are used to?

Alternatively perhaps the various TV stations streaming sites, iview and the rest would suit them? Free, and easy to use as they basically replay stuff already broadcast.
Plex

If you buy a Samsung TV it comes with Samsung plus which has heaps of shows playing and it’s free
I'm pretty sure Binge has a few of the live foxtel channels on it
I haven't played with it myself, but there are tools for things like Plex which will create the look and feel of "tv channels" from your media library. One example would be [https://www.quasitv.app/](https://www.quasitv.app/), there are definitely more out there. Some might be able to use your streaming accounts to add to what is available to create "stations" from. Maybe this helps you work out something to use?

EDIT: or maybe something like this? [https://getchannels.com/docs/channels-dvr-server/how-to/virtual-channels/](https://getchannels.com/docs/channels-dvr-server/how-to/virtual-channels/)
Just out of interest, why are you trying to cut them off foxtel? If they enjoy it let them enjoy it.
Recently did this. Signed up for binge as it had most of the foxtel channels she watched. 

We had the same issue with binge where you have to pick a specific show instead of just aimlessly watching TV so we  got a hubbl to most Australians disgust but it is the only thing that combined a FTA program guide as well as integrating a guide for all the binge channels. The box isn't great but it's more for the EPG. 

Its basically made it feel a little like foxtel without the ridiculous price 

Still figuring out how on demand works instead of recording things but getting there slowly.
My parents are in the same boat. They keep whinging about Foxtel, but I really don't think they have the ability to use a streaming service. They need shows to be 'on' rather than face an infinite number of choices.
You could look into IPTV Boxes that connect to your wifi and have a ton of international movie channels from different cable networks - they are on ebay for around $100 with a years subscription however I think they are a bit of a legal grey area.
Cost of living is hitting hard, so something had to give
I made a giant playlist on plex of tv shows I've already seen and enjoy, that I pop on random when I can't think of what I want to watch. Problem is you need to already have the content.
I'd imagine it has something to do with it being from $70 - $100 a month
If they're watching sky news they need to be cut off.  Rots the boomer brain.

My three cents, if that scenario exists they no longer have the right to make their own decisions haha

Are you paying for it?
Netflix/kayo/disney or Stan is pretty close.
I think OP gets what I mean
Subsidising, but theyre looking to change
Less than half that but sure
I think only Kayo comes close at around $25/month, which is still a far distance from $70 to 100 per month?

Even if you have all of Netflix, Kayo, Disney and Stan, Foxtel is still the more expensive/restrictive option, just.
Yeah if you only get one... And who does that ?

A typical combo between people I know is

Kayo 25
Binge 18
Netflix 19
Disney 14

$76 total.
You can get full Foxtel satellite sub for that.
But they don’t have channels? For them it’s still not the same.
Ooh, yes, I see.

Then as another poster has mentioned, Fetch TV might be what they're after?

A settop box that has (once setup) the free to air channels as well as several others, some free, some subscription.
