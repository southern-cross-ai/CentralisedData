"But David, what you don't understand, what none of you independents understand, is that lobbies give us money. And money is good for the people. They just don't know it. Sure, some poor sod may lose the family savings, and we'll still allow shitloads of advertising during the actual AFL matches, but that's a price we're willing to pay for that sweet sweet lobby money. 

What's that? Woodside? Now now, let's not get off track here. What's important to remember is that this government is tackling the smoking health crisis in a precise and measured response. No further questions"
This country has an unholy passion for the punt, It has to be the worst in the western world.
Do you know what else was a cop out?

Not asking for jobkeeper to be repaid and effectively printing $1 trillion of taxpayer money whilst blaming y & z gens for not being able to afford to live.
Plain tobacco packaging was a huge ALP win in the face of a concerted campaign from vested interests. This seems exactly the same and the answer is obvious.
What an absolute farce. No major party deserves majority in this country. Force ALP to work with the Greens and shoot the LNP into the sun
Fuck sports bet.
It would be a cop out but the changes would still be a huge improvement.
Gutless
This, for some strange inexplicable reason, reminds me of how I read about a week ago that there was this event hosted by Lachlan Murdoch which Albanese attended. 

>Other invitees included Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles, newly appointed Governor-General Sam Mostyn and NSW Premier Chris Minns.

>Also arriving at the star-studded event were former prime minister John Howard, Seven Group scion Ryan Stokes, mining magnate Andrew Forrest, billionaire rag trader Solomon Lew, Atlassian co-founder Scott Farquhar, restaurateur Justin Hemmes, Australian Rugby League Commission chair Peter V’Landys, Foxtel boss Patrick Delany and Sydney public figure David Gonski.

Isn't it nice how some people can just snap their fingers and assemble a squadron of the richest and most powerful?
I havent read the latest crap about why not. 

But I'll tell you, I've been onsite with a bloke, who when his pay went in. It was gone in 15 mins on the horses.

19 years old. Broke from week to week on the punt.

The youth of our fair country is targeted with gambling.

Darren Hinch would be ashamed, and so should we all.
Reminder of the [tens of millions donated](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-05-10/gambling-industry-political-donations-to-states-and-territories/100988954) to the major parties from gambling beneficiaries, Labor being the largest recipient.

Anyone politician or candidate who takes corporate donations, isn't working for you.

Common sense gambling legislation won't come until we have more Pococks/Wilkies/Greens, etc. Heck, same for climate legislation. Look past the glossy ads next time and see were the money comes from to fund them.

(edit: a word)
We need the Scooby Doo gang to run up and pull off that Albo mask and reveal it's actually Scomo.

RIP Peta Murphy, an Albo lead Labor happily spitting on you grave.
The entire Australian media would collapse without gambling ads. The government can’t completely piss them off in the lead up to an election. 

This was an inevitable outcome and i suspect there will be a ban on social and digital ads instead which a bigger deal for kids.
Fucking thank god for preferential voting and independents. Also as a Canberran thank god Pocock replaced Seselja
Why not just limit them until after a certain time like MA movies?
Why is it the former rugby player is actually better at running a nation than the so called experts?

Make this man pm already! Americans always talk about voting for a man you could have a beer with. Dont tell me aussies wouldnt pick this guy over Albanese and Dutton. One looks like he would steal your beer when you arent looking, the other looks like he would spike it with a date rape drug.. You can pick which is which.
The PM doesn’t want to upset his corporate overlords
If you want to stop kids from seeing gambling ads, banning ads on free-to-air TV is probably the easiest to implement and also the most ineffectual way to do it, you are basically phoning it in.  And yet they still failed just to do this.
YES. WE LOVE POCOCK.

Gambling on animals is particularly abhorent. 

Greyhounds are such sweet dogs, and the industry abuses that fact. They know that they can treat the dogs like shit because they're so sweet that they'll just take it. It's devastating.

It makes me sick that it still happens. And the way horse racing is so ingrained in our culture that Victoria literally has (had?) a public holiday for it.

Shame on us and shame on Albo if he refuses a blanket ban on gambling ads.
Someone called Albo a hero the other day. I said he was less a hero, more a disappointment. And my disappointment continues unabated.
The alternate policy proposal, while objectively and undoubtedly watered down, is still something I'd be happy to take.


"...a cap of two gambling ads per hour on each channel until 10pm, and banning ads an hour before and after live sport.”
...
"The report said Labor would, however, propose a blanket ban on betting ads on social media and other digital platforms."


Granted that the latter is not confirmed in any way. We'll see how this shakes out.
The idea that television and online platforms are separate is outdated. 

What is TV? Do they mean linear TV only or does it include BVOD apps like Nine Now or 7 Plus? These apps are arguably TV and online platforms.

Will be good to see the details but it smells like the government has been captured by traditional Australian media companies and sporting bodies. 

Keep the money from Google and Meta but let it flow into the local companies.
Fuckin' get 'em David.
(edit) TRIGGER WARNING: AIJAC disregard

If Albo can supply weapons to Netanyahu, I can't see why he wouldn't allow ads for gambling.
Bans ~~VEGETABLE JUICE AND SUGAR WATER~~ i.e vape juice, which does NOTHING, but then does NOTHING about gambling ads which does untold harm on society, rips families apart, creates criminals out of desperate people and makes people shit their pants at the pokie stool cos they don't want to lose their 'streak'. 
I cannot wait for the next federal election.
...OP, you realise independents get money from lobbyists too, right?
> According to the report, Labor is planning to propose “a cap of two gambling ads per hour on each channel until 10pm, and banning ads an hour before and after live sport”.

> The report said Labor would, however, propose a blanket ban on betting ads on social media and other digital platforms.


Yeah it might be watered down and a blanket ban would be ultimate, but this is pretty great imo
With the exception of Sky News, Albanese is determined not to do anything that will upset anyone with money and  power.
A full ban I think would be hard but as someone who moved to here and lives here it is crazy the amount of gambling adverts there are. In the UK there is gambling and such related adverts but I think it’s only allowed after 9pm on broadcasting for example. The Australian Government needs to crack down on it
But won't someone think about the gambling billionaires, struggling to make ends meet, living from pokie filled pub to pokie filled pub???
Was he not a rugby union player for western force? Did they not have any sponsorship from gambling companies? Shut the gate behind you scenario if that’s the case?
Are you saying we should take away one of our national identities. Its like saying to an American you should get rid of guns.
Who gives a fuck.  this is just another piss weak distraction from much bigger issues Australia is having
I know this is not going to be popular but I will give it a go.

The average person who sports bet loses 200 per year. That’s less than a dollar a day for something that people enjoy.

The gambling problem lies with true evils which is poker machines, keno and lotteries.

Our do gooders in government pass laws to make it harder to win like removing in game betting, which allows for risk management.

If you know what your doing you can beat the bookmakers we need to make sure people are taught the basics of probability and mathematics. Gambling accounts should be used to train people with in forced risk management.

They should just ask professional gamblers or mathematicians to build the framework.
David Pocock a man who directly benefited from sports gambling advertising during his playing career, now staunchly against it when he's on the other side of the coin.
I agree, it should be staggered though.

Nothing good comes from upending established industries.
Seriously who bloody cares about where in that ridiculous country they can gamble, we are lucky enough to live in the best country in the world,  and you lot are arguing about that shit hole
Per capita, it is the worst in the world.
America has a gun problem, we have a gambling problem. Nowhere else but Vegas builds casinos as a city centrepiece and puts gambling machines in family restaurants.
Not to mention that the majority of the online gambling companies have their headquarters in overseas tax havens, how convenient…
America is catching up real quick since the legalising of sports punting etc through the states. Sports coverage is packed just as bad as Australia. We are raising young males in particular to just be pure addicts.
Highest per capita losses in the entire world.
I worked in the industry until very recently - it's pretty bad here. The only reason America wasn't worse though is because until recently online sports punting was banned. That's no longer the case, so now FanDuel (Sportsbet USA) makes ridiculous amounts of cash there.
We're pretty high up in the alcohol consumption ranking as well. Neck and neck with Russia.
I concur completely, my clever comrade.
The pathetic toothless federal ICAC was is also a massive cop out.
While you are absolutely correct, I don't see how that's relevant to this issue.
This entire government is a cop out.
How do you expect people to pay back job keeper? A huge amount of them were casuals already struggling with rent, putting them into debt because you don’t like the coalition is fucked.
[Nicola Roxon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Roxon) ftw.
They will never ban it. The NSW Gov (and federal) makes ungodly amounts of money from gambling.

That’s the reason there’s only flakey ideas of ‘cashless cards’ for pokies floating around and nothing actually tangible put into action.

The fact as a bar worker you can watch someone literally feed their entire life’s savings into a machine and it’s illegal to even suggest they stop playing says it all.
Way more people gamble than smoke.
I understand your sentiment but the general public has the bloody memory of a goldfish when it comes to the LNP.
I think Labor would form a Coalition with the Liberals before greens or independent under Albo after next election.
And remember how that turned out in 2013? LNP swept back in with a massive landslide. General public absolutely loses their shit when the Greens have any sort of control.
Let's shoot *both* the ALP *and* the LNP into the sun! Who's with me?
Last time the greens had any power with Labour is was shit. Nothing decent came of it.
The way that asshole bro wanna be says sports bet in the ads infuriates me.
You could say that right across all policy front "Battler pretend optics with Thatcher light" They dont want to pick any fights and seem  to just want to lay low on the policy front and fly under the radar. Anemic governance at its best . Seat warmer governance that only exists to keep core IPA agenda coalition policies while only rounding the rough edges. I doubt we will be seeing any bold policy from this Labor government even from something as urgent as housing while Medicare slides into the rot pile. By design I guess!
CLASS WARFARE, I say eat rich pigs. 🐽 
How much more blatant does it have to get before most people internalise the fact that a choice between two representatives of the bourgeoisie isn't a meaningful choice?

It's like the plastic steering wheel you give a toddler so they can think they're steering the car.
It was the 60th birthday celebration for The Australian, no idea why you are framing it as a calling your fingers to make people appear lol
Went to the footy last week and the barley 18 year old kids in the row behind me talked basically non stop about their multis to the point where my 7 year old son asked me what a multi was and if we could get one too. No idea how much they were betting but the fact that they only seemed to care about the outcome of their bets and not the actual game was pretty sad to me
Ah yes, can't do anything the people want in case the people get told it's what they don't want.  Fuck we are so stupid as a country.
Fun fact: Gambling, fossil fuel, alcohol, defence industry, media and many industry donations make up about 50% of the donations to major parties. 

There's just two industries that make up almost 50%, guess who they are? https://democracyforsale.net/
Maybe they could ban all gambling ads, and then to show they are serious, ban all advertising on streaming and cable (making them stand on the concept they were founded on - user pays for content) thus funneling the traditional advertisement spending back into free to air (being their only option) and then legislate that all culturally significant events and sports are given at least a 50% free to air slice of the pie. Restart the communal “water cooler” conversations about select things being that all of society has at least the equal ability to view it and become part of the discourse.\
Cable and or Streaming can then focus on the high brow shows and projects they should be creating.\
But seeing as I really don’t like watching sports, who gives a shit, let it splinter off chasing every smaller and splintered viewership groups until they discover that the viewing public isn’t an endless pit of never ending money that can continue to get new and more complicated streaming teirs to try chasing the limited options available to see the game of the week they are chasing.
Why is the government worried about pissing off non-voting entities in the lead up to the election?

Might as well vote for minors or even independents. I didn't vote for bootlicking parties and I certainly don't want to vote for corrupt parties.
If you read the article they are banning online ads entirely, it's just instead of outright banning on TV it's only 2 per hour. Sure it's not perfect but it's a lot better then rn.
I think a 5-10 year strategy is needed. A blanked overnight ban will have massive financial ramifications for professional sporting codes and broadcasters but give them a time line to work towards to that they can ween themselves of gambling money.
I’d pick a fuckin half eaten turnip over Dutton to be honest. Albo’s a little better. Pocock seems to have a grasp on what’s actually bad and what needs to be targeted and worked on to actually stop the agony in society  regardless of whether it’ll upset the entrenched billionaires and their rivers of gold they drain from the poor (and return a micro fraction of to the politicians via lobby groups and the people via the occasional discount lunch special at the club running exclusively on pokie profits).
Exactly. Won’t someone think of those poor poor billionaires at Aristocrat Gaming who sunk literally millions of the public’s money into new and exciting pokie machines that need to be rolled out to pubs and clubs all over the nation.\
Think of the environment damages the government would create if they had no where to put these machines and were just forced to sue the public via the government for the lost profits they’ve been promised on some back room hand shake deal where they promised to chip in 2-6% of junior level sports events (so long as the exact amount is levied to the clubs to ensure they technically have a zero dollar impost to their operational revenue).
Well they got all the kids to take up smoking with reckless abandonment by outlawing vapes via a a simple overnight change in regulations (avoiding the pesky need to bring in actual laws where discussion, debate and logical discourse would have been used where the actual overall health benefits to society would have been laid out and not as easily ignored) so obviously banning on air and free to air gambling ads is something they could implement from next week if they actually cared about the huge and irrevocable damages being done to the lest able to afford it members of society.
And people like you are why they keep getting away with watering this shit down. *You are the problem*. The government refusing to acknowledge the science on what's needed to make things better is not something you should *ever* be happy about.
You've just triggered the AIJAC
What are you talking about with Vegetable Juice ban?
It doesn't though, it's just an appeasement measure while not actually providing any kind of realistic timeframe or any want to move forward on the blanket ban. It's a lip service notion and nothing more, when they could just go forward with the blanket ban.
You criticise society yet you choose to participate in society. Curious!
And we do, all the time because it's easy to see how destructive the results are.
ok but nothing you just said requires advertising
What an absolutely weird take. It's a funny old world. 
Imagine defending gambling ads. Too many nangs.
Sports betting sponsorship is nowhere near as pervasive in Union
Get off the nangs mate
I've got a mate who works as a software dev for a gambling company in Australia, having previously done the same during his time in the US.

Apparently the US betting companies look to ours for inspiration.
Reno?
That is just so blatently ridiculously wrong I can't tell if you're being serious or not. Vegas isn't the only gambling city in America, let alone the world. 
And Vegas is actually cool. I've been twice. You're meant to associate casinos with gambling and money loss, not your local pub or RSL
Yep, right on. The gambling lobby here even picks up their strategies from the NRA. It’s not the guns/gambling that’s the problem… it’s people that’s the problem, mental health… yada yada..
You’ve never been to US have you? There are casinos all over the place 😂
Macau would like a word.
Hell, they have slot machines here and there in the airports as well. Was honestly surprising to see.
Per capita, catching up? Absolutely not. This chart shows Australia climbing and USA steady at less than half our gambling losses per adult. Data is from 2017, but 2020 data looks the same, in line with the chart

https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2017/02/09/the-worlds-biggest-gamblers
Russia and Australia have both declined in recent years.

Au 2016 10.6 2019 10.1
Ru 2016 12.4 2019 10.4

(Litres of pure ethanol per costs capita). That's not to say we're not still too high (probably are), but we're headed in the right direction, and Russia aren't the vodka-swillers popularly portrayed.

Central and Eastern Europe seem to be the big consumers now.

e.g. Romania 17, Georgia 14.3, Czechia 13.3.

These figures are from 2019 btw. Couldn't find anything newer.
you know why?  because Labor and Liberals voted for it, as the independents wanted it to actually be something that would catch politicians doing the wrong thing! At this stage if Liberal and Labor lost to more independents it might be what it takes to get them governing for the people.
This is a myth, the federal ICAC is exactly the federal ICAC everyone asked for and was exactly what the Greens and Labor had as policy promises going into the election.

There are a lot of misconceived notions about what the ICAC was going to do when started, it seemed people though it'd have various LNP ministers heads on spikes within the week. But corruption of government isn't just done by MP's its done by government employees and by far the vast majority of work done by ICAC bodies around the country is investigating government employees.

You know because there's on average around 1543 government employees per federal MP, ratio is even higher in the states.

There's a lot of weird conspiracy theories (see below) going around that somehow the NACC makes corruption worse or that Labor brought it in so that they could hide corruption. But that doesn't make any logical sense, why do the work of making the NACC at all if that is the goal?
This is because you don’t understand what the NACC is. It’s essentially a standing royal commission that can compel you to provide information and speak to them. 

It isn’t designed and was never promised and nobody wanted it to be able to prosecute people.
Just saying that for every argument against one party there's an equal argument against another.

Hypocrites everywhere
Never said I didn't like the coalition
Just saying they're equally (if not more) guilty of shafting australians.

If they offered jobkeeper money on the basis that it was to be repaid like hecs I can assure you a lot of businesses would've forgone in, and we wouldn't have a trillion dollar debt spanning multiple generations.

If anything it was used to subsidise primary labour costs for businesses.
> it’s illegal to even suggest they stop playing says it all

Can you expand on this?
The general public memory is improving though. LNP AND Labor's combined primary vote at 2022 was the lowest since WW2: https://www.tallyroom.com.au/47834 Even Albo's Labor got less votes than Shorten's Labor despite dropping NG reforms. That's how much the voters are turning against LNP and Labor!

Not quite there yet to kick them both out of government, but change is on the way. Spread the word.
No way this happens, both sides cannot bring themselves to do this.

That being said Labor would rather deal with the Teals, Wilkie and probably Katter before the Greens. 

A Labor/Teal minority government IMO is most likely.
No way that would happen.
I mean they’re basically the same now. Shooting the LNP into the sun will be better for this country
Labor seems to love alot of LNP's ideas. So much so that they've spend their time in office implementing them at the expense of their own base.
Ridiculous comment. Labor formed a coalition with the Greens not that long ago and it's not like they were much more progressive when they did it. They didn't want to of course, but it was the best option. And we ended up getting a lot of good policy out of it.
That’s essentially what happened when Labor first emerged. It was a minor party that grew to the point where the two major parties of the day - the Protectionists and the Free Trade Party - had to merge to compete with the newcomer.
It’s a pretty different landscape now. We have liberal strongholds going teal for want of half decent social and environmental policy. I think a lot of conservative voters now would be less shit-losing than they were back then.
The media has a lot to do with that. 
The hung parliament was the most productive and progressive for over a generation.
You'd still be crazy to vote LNP over Labor
No war but class war
So who do we vote for then?
Well, they can give the event any name they like, the power remains the same.

[https://www.crikey.com.au/2022/08/29/albanese-murdoch-meeting-silence/](https://www.crikey.com.au/2022/08/29/albanese-murdoch-meeting-silence/)
It disgraceful. I had to give my 8 year old the hard talk the other day, about how multis are a mugs game, and how you have to spread your cash across 4 or 5 bookies these days... you know, lose a little to each but then hit their promos hard, and check odds against betfair before putting proper money on.

I didn't have to think about that stuff when I was his age. I was at least 16. Hinchy would be ropeable!
Thank their shitty loot boxes for getting them hooked on the "win" Video Games have a big role to play. Thank god i turned 4 into 800 then into 50 in one night. Learnt the lesson pretty easily there, fucking 800 would have gone into bitcoin in 2015 :(((
Not sure which reality you live in but a coordinated campaign against you from Australia’s entire media is a hard way to win a close election.
Fuck em. Just ban it for the good of the public’s mental and financial state of mind and let the sports learn to “cut their clothing to suit”. Those who are in the games for the love of the games and sport will still happily offer their services to their sports of choice when their projected pay packets drop from the ludicrously obscene millions back to the well to do hundreds of thousand p.a.

Other industries have had to accept things like this in the past and there’s no reason why the over paid under worked administration level of sports that have grown out of the ludicrous amounts of money being squandered by them just because they have it  shouldn’t make us all go “oh poor them, they may not be able to upgrade their billion dollar stadium this year to another billion dollar stadium; but with improved or new coloured seats” when the stadiums of old worked in providing the fans with what was needed. A ground, a place to watch the game, and suitable affordable food offerings the family’s could attend, afford and enjoy. Now it’s a preserve for the well off only so enough money flows into the clubs coffers to build out more marble covered members and associate only private seating boxes thus also pushing out the very people the clubs need to maintain their long term existence.

"wah wah wah anything but perfect progress isnt good enough"
Frankly, I just reject the notion of "anything that isn't outright isn't enough".  
I would love for the Federal Gov to go further, and I hope that the Senate pushes for more than what's described in the article, but if it's clear that an outright advertising ban is not on the cards right now, then I'm not going to scorn *some* meaningful change if the alternative is *no* change.
Thanks, added trigger warning!

Can't be too careful.
0 nicotine vape juice, which is vegetable glycerin and propylene glycol. Sorry I was a bit too vague. 
Like it or not, fast food, alcohol and gambling advertisements literally keep live televised sport afloat. In an age where everyone wants to abandon traditional media, they are the cash cows that are weathering the storm. Bigger leagues like the NRL and AFL can handle it, but if there's a blanket ban on this kind of advertising the smaller competitions (A-League, NBL, Big Bash etc) are legitimately going to struggle.

We already saw the massive reduction in broadcast revenue with the upcoming A-League season, mostly because of APL's horrendous mismanagement of their asset, but a HUGE component of that loss was because of the shift to a subscription-only model that has an absolutely tiny takeup in pubs and public spaces. You have to offset the cost in some way, and whilst I think gambling advertisements are a blight on our society, they are not simply just going to "go away overnight" without major repercussions throughout professional sport.
I was on France recently and I saw ads plastered all over the place for those betting apps, looked exactly like the ads here but in French.

Would have been cheap ads as it was just before the Olympics (and probably still there).
Macau (in the world).
The key point is gambling machines in family restaurants. Many cities have casinos. Not too many have gaming machines allowed outside of them. Certainly not in the numbers we have in Australia. Australia literally has 20% of the world's poker machines, which is insane. 
Can you list some? Not doubting, just curious. 

I don't know of others. I know some have casinos but not as the main city center.
   Vegas is a cesspit, it’s the armpit of the US. 
Everything in Vegas is built with money from people who thought they had good odds. It's a monument to how dangerous commercialised gambling is.
Vegas is a shithole. If anything proves that money runs the US it’s that place where law is suspended and everything is for sale.
Sports gambling began legalisation in 2018 after the ban was declared unconstitutional. Currently it is legal in 38 states. It'll reach them all eventually.

https://www.statista.com/outlook/amo/online-gambling/online-sports-betting/united-states


If you look at the gross revenue as well as its projected user penetration, you have to admit that considering Australian sports gambling was made legal in the 80s. America is certainly catching up quickly considering our market similarities and America's untouchable professional sports apparatus it's pretty clear that there is going to be a long term societal impact just as there has been in Australia. You only need to look at the way espn changed its sports coverage + added there own sportsbook. It's integrated everywhere now as a prime money maker. NBA and NFL integrating with betting partners aswell.

Same figures I found. Yes we do seem to be heading in the right direction but Russia's might be influenced by economic and war most recently. Romania was quite a surprise as was the Seychelles.
Vote them both out - at this point, they are both effectively working for the same corporate overlords, lol.
thats gonna be hard. both lab and lib have teamed up or will team up to cripple newcomers at the next fed election :(
Who is the top person of ICAC in Labor party? The Attorney General, Dreyfus? Lets have a look at him to explain why people feel betrayed by Labor and think both sides are the same.

> Mr Dreyfus echoed some of these concerns when speaking to media on Tuesday.

> "We think public hearings should be exceptional and we think that the commission should be required to determine that it is in the public interest that a hearing be in public," he said.

> "Public hearings, as we have seen, are more difficult to conduct.

> "They raise questions about reputational harm, which are not faced when you hold private hearings, and that is why most of these commissions' work has been done in private. We would expect the same to occur with this new Commonwealth agency."

https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/show-trials-or-critical-why-debate-is-raging-over-this-national-anti-corruption-commission-issue/r4m1wnyzr

Makes sense I suppose? Labor's AG showed public hearings could be bad!!! But people say that Labor WANTED public hearings. Lets go back further...

> "He explained to me that his successful investigation of Eddie Obeid and his corrupt activities was only possible because he was able to conduct public hearings ... which encouraged witnesses to come forward," says Dreyfus, Labor's shadow attorney-general.

> Dreyfus agrees sections of the press can go overboard in their scrutiny of bit players at corruption inquiries who give factual evidence, but argues that is not inevitable. "It's something that the commissioners I think can deal with," he said.

https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/string-of-controversies-puts-national-anti-corruption-body-back-in-focus-20201022-p567pm.html

How weird, this exact SAME person was pro-public hearings? Was that even an election promise? https://www.alp.org.au/policies/fighting-corruption

> Mr Morrison’s proposed integrity commission is so weak that it would be unable to commence its own independent inquiries into Government corruption, **prevented from holding public hearings into politicians or public servants**, and banned from investigating any of the multiple past scandals of the Morrison Government. It has been described by legal experts as a body designed not to stamp out corruption, but to help cover it up. 

They did actually promise public hearings. Oh sorry, you can't see Labor's proud promises for this current government term? How odd. Here's a copy: https://web.archive.org/web/20220521180106/https://www.alp.org.au/policies/fighting-corruption

Did Labor or even Dreyfus own up this backflip? Nope: https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/oct/25/mark-dreyfus-refuses-to-say-when-labor-added-high-bar-for-public-hearings-to-anti-corruption-bill

Dutton was so happy with Labor's bill while the pro-ICAC crossbench was furious: https://www.abc.net.au/news/2022-09-29/national-anti-corruption-commission-dutton-abanese/101483278

If we want government transparency, vote for minors/indies above Labor. And Labor above LNP because LNP didn't even want to investigate politicians with their ICAC proposal. How do I know this? Labor's AG said so: 

> The reason Labor doesn’t support your “integrity” commission Mr Morrison is because it’s a fraud. You don’t believe politicians should be accountable. You want to cover up corruption, not expose it. To get a strong anti-corruption commission we need to change the government. https://x.com/InsidersABC/status/1464723679326060548

https://x.com/MarkDreyfusKCMP/status/1464743963059896321

Heard of the saying, "Letting perfect be enemy of the good"? A Labor's go-to message for any anti-Labor message ie HAFF is only a start, can always improve it later. But with ICAC, it needs to be perfect. Coalitions' ICAC would have went after... government employees and ignored politicians. So, the obstructionist party refused to support Coalition's ICAC. LOL.

How about that, Labor wanted a PERFECT ICAC despite entirely rest of crossbench wanting Labor's ELECTION PROMISE. Kind of shows Labor's priorities.

In fact, Under previous a Labor government as early as 2009, they refused ICAC proposals from minor parties and independents: https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_departments/Parliamentary_Library/Research/FlagPost/2019/April/National_integrity_commission 

Labor is going to lose hard for not going after the "other side" who was perfectly happy to conduct Royal Commissions into Labor/Unions. What another self-own by Labor and watered down ICAC for what benefit to Labor party? To secure votes from LNP politicians? LOL. Or even worst, Labor's corrupt? After all, even Labor's AG gave Obeid, a Labor politician as an example. Either way, a vote for Labor is a vote for LNP, vote both last.

If Labor is actually anti-corruption, please provide examples and not a word salad. If Labor can't do anything of this because of the media; but as Labor is in government, that's just another argument to not vote for Labor. Who knew that figuratively grovelling to a foreigner at the eve of the election had consequences.

Disclaimer: I vote all > Labor > LNP.
Exactly. The NACC works more or less like **every other integrity body in Australia **. The *only* difference is public hearings, which only the ICAC in NSW has. Other than that, it is structured almost identically.


The Greens and their supporters are doing it a great disservice by criticising it without legitimate basis. It is independent of the government, which is absolutely necessary for its function. Ergo, it's not going to bend to the popular will as some might imagine it should. 
You have to forgive the pleb even though they never explained what they meant by toothless. They got inspired by Gladys, Obeid, O'Farrell, etc politicians forced to resign from politics due to ICAC even if that ICAC doesn't prosecute people or even have royal commission powers. And those examples are just from NSW, alone.

Have you considered that some people are just extremely angry and suspicious at Labor's responses? ie Coalition's Robodebt and the zero consequences. Robodebt RC findings were purposely delayed to time with NACC going live. Almost like those at Robodebt RC wanted corruption investigated by ICAC. ICAC was like: Cool story bro, but NOPE you got it. Either Robodebt RC fucked up in delaying findings, in which case ICAC should have investigated it themselves, or ICAC purposely tried to delay findings into non-Robodebt related corruption. Yes, Robodebt RC are not allowed to conduct a RC into non-Robodebt corruption. 

Guess who is a "standing royal commission that can compel you to provide information and speak to them" on non-Robodebt matters? I wonder...

Cherry on top, NACC said it would be oppressive to those involved to investigate it further: https://www.nacc.gov.au/news-and-media/national-anti-corruption-commission-decides-not-pursue-robodebt-royal-commission-referrals-focus-ensuring-lessons-learnt

Funny how those victims got no mercy from the Robodebt oppression yet NACC is so considerate to those involved.
Pocock's not a hypocrite though.  I reckon he's about as genuine a politician as we've had.
How are they guilty of shafting Australians?

Jobkeeper was paid to employers on the condition it was paid in full to staff and that staff didn’t get a pay cut. Forcing employees to repay that is cruel, especially since it’s a complete reversal of the scheme they agreed to.

The entire point was to stop people being made redundant and it succeeded at that.
It's been awhile since I did my RCG but essentially I don't think you're allowed to make those suggestions. Someone can ask you to ban them from gambling/pokies but they have to ask you first, you can't suggest it.

The rest of it is pretty much make sure there's stickers on the pokies, atm and some 'help is available' cards around the place. There's honestly not a whole lot to the course, it does plainly explain why pokies are a rort though.
How does that work Scruffy, Labors primary vote gets worse but wins an election? Hey I noticed the Greens primary vote went up too but they get fuck all seats for it, whats with that?

Maybe primary vote isn't everything? Maybe primary vote counts for very little when the vast majority of the country is just voting who they want in charge and not which party embodies their niche pet ideologies.
You haven't paid attention to Labor in the senate. They prefer to vote with the Liberals and will adjust policy to further screw Aussies rather than vote progressive.
As an engineering student, I will petition my teachers to allow my final-year project to be a cannon that can fire the LNP into the sun
Are you saying the LNP and Labor are basically the same?
Perfectly said:

Albo Labor priority list:

1) Foreign corporations - treason is ok 
2) America - why we say no human rights act.
3) cashed up boomers and Zionists: the 2 most rusted on  liberal voters.
Labor has shifted even further to the right since Gillard. She was also very much an outlier as a quality PM.
Under Gillard, a long time ago. Albo has refused to negotiate with the Greens until Dutton refuses to negotiate at all, or Phon, Babet etc.

Those are simply the facts under Albo.
> not that long ago

Over a decade ago*
I could see the LNP and Labor merging in maybe a few decades time if the Greens keep gaining popularity amongst young people. As much as the LNP and Labor hate each other, they don't differ much in their policies.
You probably are right. However the Labor party probably knows that its alienating a subset of voters and are willing to sacrifice these votes  to stick with their governance light agenda. The real issue here is who is going to be a future 3rd force that can get into government that will fix all these issues. So on that front it does not look hopeful and the alternative will be disaster of ideology. Where do you go?
You'd still be crazy to vote Labor above second last, above LNP
People like David peacock. The name of the game isn't voting in shit or shit lite it's forcing their hands, forcing a change in the ovitin window. Abraham Lincoln didn't want to free the slave but they still did because of forces outside regular politics.
Hint: It has only been two parties running governments since WW2. Guess who!

Hint2: Putting them both last is the best way.
Whatever options aligns more with the working class. Whatever you do, don’t cede further power to the capitalists. That should be your default position until you find we’re in a better balance.

Sounds like you didn't, dumping your wins from gambling into another form of gambling is still just gambling, hindsight doesn't mean zip and that logic is exactly why so many people just keep betting and betting and betting, sunk cost fallacy and all that.
That argument at least made sense when Labor was powerless in opposition. Now these "but media" arguments with a Labor government mean we shouldn't be voting for Labor who do nothing about the blatant election interference.

Don't worry, I'm voting Labor above LNP, at the bottom of the ballot, to put an end to the foreign and oligarch election interference.
Well ultimately it would mean a lot of people in the media industry and sporting industry would lose their jobs, but if you’re ok with that then fine.

Boohoo. Maybe sports players shouldn't be paid hundreds of thousands of dollars a year for playing sport.

Hey I won $300 in Vegas. On Roulette though, not on slots. It's becoming clear to me that gambling is the way to get rich.

Fuck it. I'll build my own casino. With blackjack and hookers
Is it? I know plenty of people who go to Vegas and go fairly regularly. No one I know goes thinking the are going to win big, they go treating it like adult Disneyland, to have a good time and what they spend is part of the entertainment. Vegas has the casinos, but it has way more than just that.
The Ukraine war hadn't started in 2019 though.

If the guy I responded to posted a myth, you're the cooker making the conspiracy board ramblings he's confused by.

The [quote from Dreyfus in 2020](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/string-of-controversies-puts-national-anti-corruption-body-back-in-focus-20201022-p567pm.html) fought for the possibility of public hearings, notably the [quote from 2022](https://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/show-trials-or-critical-why-debate-is-raging-over-this-national-anti-corruption-commission-issue/r4m1wnyzr) pointed out the circumstances where they could be helpful and circumstances where they are of no help. What your conspiratorial demand is to make every hearing public despite the added cost and pressure on witnesses, for an extremely rare occurrence of which we have only a SINGLE cited example of it being useful.

So what sort of pressure on witnesses? Well notably Dreyfus's 2020 comments were pre the treatment of Britany Higgins at the hands of media which only became known about in 2022 post election and the media started their campaign from that point onwards, I imagine 2022 Dreyfus clued in to how fucked public hearings could get.

But you're cool with how Britany got treated right scruffy? I suppose you'd be fine with all rape cases get such a public airing? That's before they even go to court too, because as I'm sure everyone is aware ICAC is an investigations body like the police. Perhaps for total transparency ICAC should wear body cams, rape kits done live on public webcam. No? Too far? This is the sort of absurd outcomes from your arguments but lets continue.

Lets contrast [NSW ICAC leaders opinions](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/public-hearings-show-our-accountability-nsw-icac-boss-20221019-p5br02.html) shall we?

> Hatzistergos also queried a widely-cited figure that the NSW ICAC held only around 4 or 5 per cent of its hearings in public, instead citing the agency’s total time holding public hearings in the 2020-21 financial year.

> “If you look at the extent we do hearings, about 40 per cent of the hearing time – just over 40 per cent actually – is done in public,” he said.

So even they don't do all the time public hearings, but that should be ok right? Just over 40% of a case being made public should be enough right?

> In 2020-21, the NSW ICAC held three public inquiries, which spanned 68 days of public hearings or 48 per cent of hearing time, compared with 85 compulsory examinations of witnesses in private across 72 days.

Oh so its not even 40% of a case its 40% of the time they're spending on investigating, so its possible a case gets less than that, like say 5%? **Sounds exceptional to me!** From all those days they have a single case they can quote as having found use of public hearings? Given it was Eddie Obeid and how high profile that was, I find it highly unlikely that the only reason someone found out about his corruption was that it was a public hearing...

For all that fluff about the value of public hearings they have only one case they can dubiously show its value, yet the NSW ICAC has had at least 3 deaths associated with its public hearing activities **TRIGGER WARNING**:

* [ICAC witness found dead in office after giving evidence](https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/icac-witness-found-dead-in-office-after-giving-evidence-20220707-p5b00i.html)
* [ICAC hearing reveals the tragic death of Dr Liao](https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/icac-hearing-reveals-the-tragic-death-of-dr-liao-20190826-p52kyq.html)
* [Special Report 2023/01: Audit of the welfare of witnesses and other people involved in ICAC investigations](https://www.oiicac.nsw.gov.au/assets/Uploads/Reports/Audit-Reports/20230222-Inspector-of-the-ICAC-Special-Report-2023-01-Audit-of-the-welfare-of-witnesses-and-other-people-involved-in-ICAC-investigations.pdf)

The whole point of the federal ICAC Peter was having one, as I pointed out in my prior post the majority of corruption occurs in the public service, they numerically out number politicians 1500:1. You can play bizarre semantics games all you want but you and many others who had 'federal ICAC now' tshirts, had no fucking idea about what an ICAC was let alone the qualities it needed, until you decided it was something you could inject misinformation into. The NACC was exactly what the public asked for, only a few cookers think its some sort of conspiracy to do the opposite.

Labor is clearly performing anti corruption activities, they brought in the RoboDebt RC, they brought in the NACC, they're currently auditing dodgy operators out of NDIS. Its genuinely a bizarre cooker conspiracy on your part on par with the anti lock down and anti vax riots against quarantines against COVID to suggest that Labor established a federal anti corruption body so that they could do corruption when in office... 

Lets face it its such an incredible logical fallacy you're pushing here... If Labors goal was to be corrupt wouldn't it just be easier for them to have not done anything? Heck they could have just let the Morrison ICAC through the senate right? Why do all this work to make it harder for corruption, unless you actual goal is anti corruption?
I realised the other day that the public hearings in NSW ICAC was entirely because the LNP thought it'd fuck over Eddie Obeid and Labor in general. Hilarious that it only ended up nabbing LNP MP's after that.

Then I realised the claims that public hearings are the only reason Eddie Obeid was caught is a bit of a falsehood given the NSW ICAC was established by the LNP after they won government in the election in which the Eddie Obeid scandal was already public knowledge as it had cost Labor the election.
-You have to forgive the pleb-

Pleb huh. So oh great one, Just a question for you if I may. How are we supposed to get accountability into our governance? We are one of the most taxed populations on the planet and all I'm looking for is value for money (my taxes) and accountability? Please enlighten us on how we "keep the bastards honest"

We have all seen the Senate estimates Grilling Alan Joyce and  Woolies CEO Brad Banducci. We need whatever institution oversees Government, either a Federal ICAC or  NACC and the hearings need to be public in fact live streamed for transparency. That's all I'm saying. I don't care what their title is but they need answer to the Australian public.

Yes this is because you don’t understand NACC. Like I said, it isn’t there to prosecute people and that was never its intent. It is essentially a standing royal commission so having it copy/paste the RC makes no sense, it literally can’t find anything different to the RC.

Apsc and other agencies can punish, but not the NACC. That isn’t their role and nobody was asking for them to have that power.

You need to understand how our systems actually work before you spread misinformation on them.
Nah thanks that's awesome. I just thought it really important for people to know about, thanks. Good info.
Primary votes would be the indicator for who people want in charge though, it's a literal first preference. The fact that their primary vote share is dropping would indicate that both the LNP and Labor are losing that immediate support. Yes they will still win elections, but it's leaning a lot more heavily on the basis that they are simply far larger than any other party with more entrenched history rather than their current popularity. 

Both major parties aren't going to be happy that they keep losing primary voters because long term that can spell disaster because in large enough numbers those lost primary votes can lose otherwise locked in seats, see what the teals did to the LNP. In the short term it can indicate that a rapid swing in an election might occur where the preferences flip and suddenly Labor isn't getting in via preferences but the LNP. The primary vote share might not be the critical factor in winning an election but it's a big indicator of how popular a government really is. 

Labor already were not as popular as their win would otherwise suggest, they have not become any more popular since then either if anything they are even less popular. They may still be re-elected but it may be far finer than last time, which is something the primary vote would have been a warning sign for. Both parties are losing voters, each new set of 18 year olds seem less likely to support either party while the older voters who do are dying off. In 20 years that might be quite impactful.
Look at the NACC: they had majorities in both houses to implement what they took to the election without any need to negotiate, but they folded to the LNP and watered it right down
Do allow for the vacuum held within their pointy little heads.

That wasn't a coalition.


The Greens are in coalition with Labor in the ACT, and have been since 2012. 


>Albo has refused to negotiate with the Greens until Dutton refuses to negotiate at all


Quite possibly because The Greens have been unreasonable. They've been much more interested in trying to score political points rather than actually negotiating. They stick up a list of demands and refuse to budge until they feel they've done enough damage. They don't compromise, so there can be no reasonable negotiation. 
I think by default you go left. Australia has such little class consciousness. We are basically all workers of some form and yet we act as if we’re all millionaire capitalists because we own a house (I don’t). If you are unsure which direction to go then go with workers. Do not give capitalists more power to fuck us because a “labor” party sucks.
There are plenty of other, crazier parties. Often run by crazy, unstable people with severe personality defects. PHON springs to mind. As do the anti-vaccination/"better medical choices" people. Or the Australian Citizens Party. Or that party run by people who want to be immortal. Or actual fascists.


There are lots of nutters out there. Some of them try to start political parties. 
yeh nah you really think the christian fascist parties deserve a higher spot?
Well sure. I like pocock, I voted for him, I met him a few months ago and he even listened to me. more of him I wouldnt complain about, the issue is, most people just blindly vote for the major 2.
You got another suggestion? Let's hear it.
If you think our PM and deputy PM should attend such 'parties' we have some different ideas on how this country should be run.
That's their point you drongo. They snap their fingers and the most influential figures show up. Because that's how parties WORK!
Right. Except i have never bet since and as i already did have a lil bit of doge coin i had bought in 2014, don't have mkre than a few now I feel confident in saying I know enough about crypto to see the risks involved, the potential that is there for the future and also the scams that exist. My mate showed me bitcoin in 2011.

I literally learnt my lesson on how greed is always your own downfall financially. Sure $200000 is better than say $85000 but sometimes it is best to realise your earnings than hope for more, they may never come.

Setting yourself up for failure with that attitude little guy
In honest terms, I suppose I reserve that energy for matters that I feel more strongly about. In light of it not being a 'major' voter issue for me, I'm able to mutually express disappointment that Federal ALP demonstrably have pro-gaming-lobby incentives, but acknowledge that *some* change in this respect is nonetheless positive (and I do think that this will be effectual if still not to the extent I'd prefer).

Again, I do want more, but if not going too-hard too-quickly is some "necessary evil" in a political reality that prevents-against the lobby from being too off-side with an election on the horizon, then I can either express vain outrage at this being the way things are, or express a more measured response - again, it's not one of my major issues, so I'm not going to comment "ALP betrayal" to a cohort of people sharing a similar sentiment, because I think the nuance is more valuable here.

In practical terms, this means:  
- I'm not going to write to my local MP because the Federal Gov made a half-measure instead of a full-measure on this issue.  
- It may be one of many things that affects my preferencing in the next Federal election. From what I've seen of Pocock, I'm quite impressed and would love to see more independents in a similar vein.  
- I don't feel compelled to try convince those wanting a complete ban that this is enough (because I don't think it is - I'm just affirming that it's not abjectly nothing).  
- If I did see someone who felt that no regulation was somehow a positive thing (with regards to gambling, I think this is a very rare person), I might feel compelled to engage them and breakdown how it can have detrimental effects from a societal standpoint.

If I felt 'less complacent' on wanting a complete ban, basically the only thing that would change would be the 1st dot-point and the tone of my initial comment.
> We can't have blatant anti-Semitism running rampant in Australia.

Ya never know. With our government... Nothing is safe! Except ya know, gambling ads and record house prices. 
Because he has no control over gambling advertising as a player.  You need to pick and choose when to fight battles.  I go watch my footy team play, but i don't like the gambling sponsor on the jersey.... so either i don't support the team or i can still support the team and try and fight battles against sports advertising.   I'd probably argue TV advertisements are alll that needs banning.
Atlanta is the center point for travel in the US. It's far from being known as a city built on gambling and there isn't a slot machine in every grocery and convenient store.

He can't, its another scruffy big conspiracy board rambling...

For example he's ignored the fact that NSW ICAC had public hearings 40% of the time which sounds rather exceptional to most people.

Also ignored that the NSW ICAC public hearings have resulted in 3 deaths due to the witness stress.

I mean who's going to be a whistle blower when you'll have the media go through your garbage for dirt on you and face the prospect of your own mortality due to the stress of it all.

But to scruffy that would be just another conspiratorial pin on his board 'they're killing witnesses' or something.
We're agreeing on the same thing. I'm a pleb too. I was responding to a pro-Labor shill who is happy to excuse Labor's failings.
I was the "albo is just small target" and "wait until he's in". I was wrong.

Day 8 into being PM and ruled out a Murdoch RC. I knew then.

The NACC already under investigation for corruption sums it up.
Not to defend or excuse the ALP's lacklustre anticorruption efforts, but I think I understand their logic: the ALP are hedging against another upset election like 2019's appalling poll day. The strategy is that if the NACC legislation had bipartisan support across Parliament from inception, the LNP would be less likely to repeal or undermine it when they win power next. 


If I'm right, this is sensible but also naïve in the extreme, as there's absolutely no fucking way the LNP would be bound by their previous support, and absolutely no world in which the ALP could ever meaningfully punish the LNP for undermining an anticorruption body. The media won't publicise Labor's condemnations in any detail, and they'll never explain the consequences of letting corruption go unpunished. And even if they did, Australians are too ignorant and selfish to care. 


There's a plausibly selfish motive here, too: knowing that the media are themselves corrupt and that the public is deplorable, Labor may also have watered down the NACC to reduce how often and how severely they are themselves in the crosshairs. This inference doesn't even require Labor to want to be able to be corrupt - all large organisations have some corruption (especially if we Australians are involved), so it's inevitable that sometimes Labor would not prevent corruption and be found wanting by the NACC. This would always be covered in more detail and with more venom than when the LNP are found to be the vicious bastards they truly are, so a coward might say "why lean into the whole anticorruption thing at all?" And we know Labor are spineless, so it's plausible that this was a factor. 


All this is to say, the ALP are not evil, but they are cowards. And I absolutely agree with the prevailing sentiment that Labor will consistently back conservatism over very mild progressivism. 
Except they are the same ultimately, they're both neoliberal parties that are beholden to corporation and their imperialistic overlords, one of them being somewhat of a magnitude worse doesn't matter when they're both doing all the can to fleece us.

I don't understand people like you, there's definitely times when pointing out actual material differences matters and is something worth doing. But if you were to stumble upon someone trying to burn down your house, you wouldn't care if they had two cans of petrol or six, you're going to freak the fuck out that someone is trying to burn your house down and it doesn't really matter how efficient one is compared to the other - especially when there's an option on the table to not even burn your house a little.
Why are you saying it like that why are you trying to make this into something deeper? 

It was a big party to celebrate the 60th anniversary.

Also yes why can’t the PM go to something like the 60th anniversary of a newspaper if he is invited?
People in media and high up in Australia got invited to the 60th anniversary party of a newspaper, yes what a shock it’s certainly some conspiracy and the vol big bad guy snapped his fingers and demanded people show up.

Couldn’t possibly just be a party, nope need to paint it to suit a bias. I bet you hate how Murdoch media paints things but it’s funny you are happy to do it yourself
There is no such thing as a necessary evil in politics; that's a myth thought up by centrists to justify including the *absolute worst* kind of authoritarian dipshits in politics so they can play them off against the left so they can keep power as kingmakers instead of actually appealing to people based on policy.
I did notice that I can't seem to comment on any Israel-related posts in this sub. I've been on here since before Oct 7 and I'm quite active so that raises a few questions
Thing is as the op mentions some clubs rely on gambling revenue without it they simply can’t survive. We see this same issue right around the world, for example look at the lower divisions of English football. I don’t agree with gambling or the promotion of it but a reality we have to accept is without it there is no sport or little sport.
Oh absolutely, I have no delusions about that. I had a limit set that I assumed I would lose. And I came close and it's amazing how quickly your brain goes "just chuck another $50 on"

I'll say though, at least with blackjack, roulette, the classics, you have some agency. I hate slot machines/pokies
 but there goes the blow then
Apologies for my tone.

Put the old parties last on a filled ballot as the best way to vote for an end to Murdoch's influence when both his pro-Murdoch parties are no longer in parliament to support him. Labor can be second last, above LNP. Especially for their LNP-lite policy.
I lost faith when he let the Covid isolation payments lapse, while also keeping mandatory isolation for positive cases. It should be a no-brainer: if you tell people they can't work, you need to make sure they can keep food on the table

Thankfully he caved to public pressure, but it shouldn't've needed a media campaign and literally everyone (including the LNP) campaigning for the payments to return
One party is committing to reduce emissions and invest in renewables, the other wants to water down emissions targets and "invest" in nuclear power plants as a farce to postpone shutting down coal powered plants.

One party has made positive changes to Medicare (that admittedly don't nearly go far enough), the other wants to continue to pull funding away from Medicare and expand the private health sector.

One party tried to pass the indigenous voice, the other succeeded in bringing it down.

I don't understand people like you... is Labor perfect? lol no, and fwiw the Greens isn't either. Ultimately though, the LNP being in power is inarguably worse for most Australians than Labor. But no, let's tear both parties down and let good be the enemy of perfect.
You really don't see the connection do you? Ask Kevin about the Murdoch influence on PMs, he knows better than anyone.
I invite you to make more effort than to latch onto the throwaway turn-of-phrase 'necessary evil' as the crux of your argument. If you're not interested in entertaining what I'm supposing are political realities, that's fine, but the outraged rhetoric does not compel many people to meaningfully engage you.
Look that is a genuine issue also, so the question becomes whats more important?  I'd personally be ok with static advertising, like signs and jerseys etc. I'm more against the in your face TV advertising which is all about getting people addicted and normalising it. IMO as a society we should do out best to help those who need it, but there will always be some we can't help.
I can't remember benders exact words here. Was it forget the blackjack?
Wow that was comprehensive af. Ty. :)
Labor ruled out a Murdoch RC because a Murdoch RC wouldn't do anything to Murdoch. Another one of your conspiracies that somehow Murdoch would be brought to its knees even though as far as anyone knows hasn't done anything criminal just unethical.

Were I Murdoch I'd fucking relish the chance of having an RC into my media empire, I'd scream 'freedom of speech' every other sentence, I'd call in favors and none of the media would report on the bad bits. Then at the end when the RC can't actually nail me for anything my reputation amongst the public would be reset and my dying papers have greatly renewed circulation...

Why would you want to super charge Murdoch scruffy? Seems counter productive.
Lot of redflags. 

Poison chalices to Plibersek, Chalmers, Wong, Giles and Dreyfus sit high in my head. But they couldbe resigned instead of destroying their legacies.

Unfortunately I moved to a seat with the Greens, Labor and the Liberals most sensible in last election (checked when we moved early this year).
So your stance is a Pm isn’t allowed to have any life or go to a party ever?

You keep acting like this is some 1 on 1 dinner at a house

Some of you really need to stop needing to outraged all day
I'll make my own blackjack with hookers and blow is my headcannon....
So what's your suggestion?
Same here. Liberals end up number 3 on preferences simply because the options are PHON, UAP or someone too nutty for either of those two options. Thankfully the Senate has better variety
Mate it's not a regular party with sick DJ beats hahaha, its fucking murdoch, seems like you are being deliberately obtuse
First just targeting Murdoch is a pointless exercise when media in Australia in general varies from shit to really shit. It also pointlessly gives him a victim card to play which the rest of the media will happily go along with.

Second anything that gets done will be resisted, the amount of resistance will be in proportion to the scale of the regulations and how easily the media can present their counter argument. So start small so you have some kind of regulations on the books and start with things the media don't really do anyway but you could claim that were they to do it, it would be really bad.

Third we need to give Labor more votes & seats, doing anything against the media will amplify their bias against Labor which will cost votes come election, if Labor doesn't win there's no chance any of this happens. This entire 'Labor bad' circle jerk we see nearly every day in /r/australia is the exact opposite of what we should be doing if we want the Labor party to fix the problems we're complaining about.
Patterson?
It’s a party for a newspapers anniversary that was made into an event

But yes it’s all some big evil convoluted plot

I take it you hate how Murdoch spins stories? Funny that you jump to spin them yourself huh?
