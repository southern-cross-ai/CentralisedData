Just popped into Chemist Warehouse, a jar of Manuka honey for $75. Who the fuck pays that?
7+ dollars for a double cheeseburger by itself. I ate it in 6 bites and felt hungrier than before i ate it
Can't you just buy regular honey from coles? The thing that makes Manuka honey unique, Methylgyoxal, damages the shit out of DNA and is probably carcinogenic.
