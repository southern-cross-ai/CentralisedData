In time for ekka too, seems like a good idea to help get people in the door.
If you told me 25 years ago Queensland and South Australia would be at the forefront of progressive public policy I would have laughed in your face.
Im on the train right now. There is no noticeable increase in train traffic, in fact, this morning is quieter than usual.
Basically put: it's a Hail Mary by a government that is currently on course for a whooping at the next election. And it's a very, very good Hail Mary.
Lucky guy, I thought he'd be rich enough not to need to catch the bus though
Busses going to be packed
This morning was the first time I've ever seen a ticket inspector on a near-empty 5am train. Guess they're hoping to recoup some of the losses through fines.
Always blew my mind that our public transport is so expensive relative to the world. Could travel in most European cities for almost nothing at a set and low fare. Just made sense.

When opal was introduced and prices went up I dated a girl from IPART NSW very briefly who said "we need less people using public transport so prices go up - it's simple supply and demand really". Seemed to completely ignore the social and public policy impetus for having cheap transport options.
I'm assuming the airport link is excluded? It would be in Sydney.
nsw, where you at with this? i would love to spend 50c per day on public transport rather than 75 bucks per week please and thank you 🙌
This is going to make life a lot easier for a lot of people.  Saving like, 35 dollars a week is really no joke if you're scraping by paying for your apartment.
Progressive political decisions like this are sexy!
I'm preemptively heartbroken for when the LNP remove this in 6 months, and angry that people will generally see that as a good thing
Hoping people remember this come voting time.
Do you guys think this will change much with patronage, isn’t PT 9 times out of 10 cheaper than driving maybe some people who usually walk or bike that will change their habit.
50 cents to get to work, 650 rent a week or a million dollars morgage... the land of extremism.
Brilliant.  Should be free but it's a start
It's a good move, but aren't there some decent savings to be made if you abolish fares altogether?

 In NSW, fares cover less than a quarter of the cost of Public Transport as they raise about $1.5 billion. But if you abolish fares it doesnt cost the taxpayer $1.5 billion because there is a lot of fare collecting and fare enforcing infrastructure that disappears. No more army of ticket inspectors, for example. 

 Keeping it all in place to collect 50 cents doesn't seem sensible. Of course, they cannot get rid of it all just for a trial, but if they got bold, it makes economic sense to forego the 50 cents.

If the trial shows increased ridership and less road traffic, who knows what's next?
now bring it to Victoria, we get ripped off with public transport pricing.

doubt it will happen though, the Victorian government has already pissed all their money away and need to tax us as hard as they can.
I'd love to switch from car to bus to cut down on fuel use. 

But I'd be going from a 20 minute drive to walking half a kilometre and taking two different buses over the span of 2 hours.

Not worth it, even for only 50c

Yay regional public transport system...
Get Rich or Ride Tryin’
I'm really curious to know what % of the states Public transport budget is brough back by fares, honestly I couldn't guess if fares only made back 5% of the PT budget or 80%
*cries in NSW*
Great news, if PT is packed then that brings down traffic, if PT is packed then the State is hopefully at least breaking even. I view this as a win win, a strong Public Transport network is the key to a growing and expanding city.
The first 169 to UQ this morning smelt distinctly like someone had thrown up in the middle of the bus. Everybody was looking accusingly at everyone else. While I didn't see any evidence of said "chunder", the smell was quite overpowering.

Tomorrow and further into the week will be the real test of the 50c buses and how busy they'll be. Hopefully no horrible smells.
Wow this is rather fine. I catch a $6 ferry two times a day. No complaints here.
[deleted]
Sorry for sounding like a Bogan about this but, y’know.. “Queenslander!” (Gratitude.)
It's funny how people here are so supportive of progressive PT but when Victorian Liberal candidate said he'd do 2$ fares people were still cheering for Labor. PTV is already shit and expensive, at least it was going to be shit but affordable. 
[deleted]
Government incompetence
I think the Ekka normally had free public transport for buses going to and from the venue.  You didn't even need a go card.
Unfortunately Ekka Station is still unopened. It's only a short walk from Bowen Hills though.
18 of the last 25 years have been Labor Government in SA.
Really annoyed that NSW is the main hub for most businesses (which mandate people in office) while slowly becoming one of the most conservative/regressive states. It's like the reverse of California in the US. 

Hopefully, eventually, companies will move to the other progressive states after most people decide they don't want to live in NSW.
They have actual useful Labor governments. We in NSW can only dream
South Australia has always been a progressive state.
Huh? SA has pretty much always been an extremely progressive state politically.
SA has been progressive long before that:

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Dunstan
This is part of a last minute flurry of policies being announced by our government to try and not lose the election in October
Give it a few months.
25 years ago is 1999 :)
I mean it totally has nothing to do with an upcoming election...
WA again doing next to fuck all to help with cost of living
Queensland especially is not Conservative. Not even Progressive either. It's Radicalism.

Edit: To those blindly downvoting this comment and sustaining the reddit echo chamber, see my response below.

Idiots. Go bottle some more farts.
Tuesdays are the peak day though, let’s see how tomorrow fares.
This is what I expected. Talking to people about Public Transport, no one I spoke to said cost was a factor in determining why they did not use PT. The major issue was the inconvenience factor. Spending two hours on PT for a trip that would take 40 minutes by car for example. Or having to wait 30 minutes for a train. Having to go all the way into the city to then take another train when you just wanted to travel a couple of suburbs across. For the people that do use PT this will be an awesome trial as it will save them so much money but for those that do not currently use PT I do not expect many at all to move across to PT.
My bus which is usually only 1/4 full was full this morning.
Because the most important thing is the network itself, upkeep of vehicles and frequency of services.

'Just make it cheaper/free' is a lazy copout
Richlands train station carpark filled up much earlier than usual for a Monday.
how common is wfh in qld still?
It's bizarre that Queenslanders are so dumb they'd even consider voting for Crisafulli. How many more public services do we even have that he can sell to his donors?
> a very, very good Hail Mary.

Which is going to be great for the people in metropolitan areas of Queensland and very unhelpful for those in the majority of Queensland. 

As history has shown, QLD is a very large state with disproportionate voting areas - metropolitan vs rural areas vote very differently come election time.  

I think this is wonderful for those who have access to QLD's public transport network, but for those who don't have access to it or don't have a need to access it, it's further subsidising a public transport used primarily by city dwellers.
At least Chrisafuckwit wouldn't dare roll back the mining royalties changes now that the benefits are truly hitting
The peak hour bus uses (commuters and students) are already a captive/maxed out demographic
Buses aren't any busier than usual. Tomorrow will be the real test.
I don't think it will be too pronounced, outside of bus routes to the city people with cars will still prefer to drive.  The largest increase in bus traffic will come from people who already take the bus deciding to go out more for recreational activities, so it will be outside of peak traffic.

Buses still have a hard time competing with cars in most journeys.  Some large costs of car ownership are fixed from purchase price, rego, and insurance.  So the bus fare is mostly competing with fuel costs; at 50c you could save about $2 on a 15km journey.  However you are also going to be trading a 20 minute drive for a 40 minute bus trip.  I don't think most people will trade 20 minutes for $2.

I hate driving and i'm on the fence about it. I would swap over to buses for any trip that doesn't have transfers if the seats were more comfortable, and I could enjoy sitting down and playing a game or watching a video instead of focusing on driving.
Good. They'll see that there's demand.
They don't usually start that early. You will see more of them the next couple of weeks due to ekka and the 50c fares. It's mostly for expected increase in passengers. More security and customer service than ticketing. 
Most but not London/UK (where I’m from🥲). I do hope the 50c trial expands nation-wide though.
China was the one that always blew my mind, can travel around 100km for the equivalent of 2$, meanwhile just to travel within your own suburb it's around 3$ and that's usually a whole 1km. It's absurd.
Airtrain has been halved to $10.95.
How are you spending 75 bucks per week? Fares are capped at $50 a week in NSW. Also, it's 50c per journey, not 50c per day. I agree that this is awesome and would be great in other states though.
The NSW election is in 2027.
Yep.. I’m not poor by any means but saving $50 a week is going to be good for me.
Same! I'm moving to within 5 minutes of a train station in approx 6 months, so basically when it ends. I really hope the trial is a 'success' by whatever metrics they use to define it, and not just an election bribe
It's a six month "limited time offer" that is going to end regardless of who's in office after the election (which, not coincidently, happens before the offer expires).
The greatest factor people don't use PT is because of serviceability.

Whether they don't want to wait 30 mins because they missed their bus, or that they don't want to change 3 times, or they don't want to travel 1.5 hrs if their drive is 40 mins. People will often happily pay $30 for parking if it is way more convenient.

But this will help a lot who take it daily. And may change decisions by those who might have driven for those spontaneous trips despite good PT.
I certainly noticed a lot more people at the bus station and on my bus which is usually quite empty.
Before this change for a lot of people it was kinda questionable whether you even saved money especially when you add on the typically longer journey time. For the people that did save it was "is this enough to justify losing the autonomy/convenience of having my car with me."

This change takes the thought process from "Maybe I'd save a few bucks but ehh not enough to inconvenience myself" to "There is absolutely no doubt I will be saving a noticeable amount of money if I take public transport." I think that clarity of reasoning will bring a bunch of people on board.
It's hard to get data when it's free
Maybe, but it may have unintended consequences. You can save for x ticket inspectors and infrastructure, but you may need y more security guards and deal with extra vandalism if antisocial types aren't risking anything to ride around all day.
Reduce the cost AND decrease the wait time between buses. 20-25 minutes is too much
Victoria is very cheap. You can travel the entire state for $10.60…
I reckon $9 max to anywhere in the State is pretty bloody good value if you ask me.
Chicken and egg
I CAN FINALLY AFFORD TO THROW UP ON THE BUS WOOOOOO!
QLD is a pretty big place and active public transport is only in major centres. If you're really looking to take advantage of it, just go to Brisbane.
Applies everywhere to everything except the airport train and long distance regional trains: https://translink.com.au/tickets-and-fares/50-cent-fares
Right across public services in Qld. If visiting the largest continuous area would be from around Gympie to the Gold Coast.
Article states it’s so they can capture actual data about the uptick in travelers.
So they can track usage.
Cause the Greens campaign on free. This is centrist version of progressive policy
Security and data tracking 
Helps people catching the train into brissy though
18 of the last 25 years have been Labor government in most states, let's face it.
30 of the last 35 years has been Labor government in QLD.
Why will they not make public transport better then??
I live in California, it's really not as liberal as you think.

Americans like to put laws on the books and never provide any enforccement.

Their environmental building code is self reporting unless someone sues you for instance. The laws are pretty good though.
Yeah I wish we were more like California 

*shakes head*
Libs in Tassie just reduced bus fares by 50%. Probably cheaper/free public transport is a direction everyone is heading in.
Sa spending no money on pt apart from $200m to improve roads on the tram track. What a joke.
What are some recent progressive policies?
What are they doing for pt? Nothing.  While spending billions on roads.
Of course there is a bit to that, but they have also been giving us heaps of credit on our electricity bills for the last two years before our big $1000 bump last month.  I’d rather a state government that invests its mining royalties back into public services and improving day to day cost of living than a state government who does whatever the minerals council want and cuts public services.
Beats Victoria where they promise a whole bunch of stuff they can't do (Airport Rail) or follow through on promises that have a negative effect on the public (cancelling East-West link contracts at the cost of $1b and extending tolls until my little kids can hire a car)
From the linked story:

> The trial will wrap up in February, on the other side of the October state election.

Palaszczuk was also very against making public transport free or cheaper to this extent. There's absolutely no guarantee this policy won't disappear
It’s also a study of what routes are viable if you remove cost from the equation.
I mean, sure it's because of the election. But unlike the other party at least we can see it happening.

Instead of waiting until they're in the opposition and blaming the otherside for not doing enough.
So youd rather they please corporations instead?
Imagine that. Policy that people want to vote for. How disgusting!
On my god a government doing positive things for its constituents and trying to get re-elected, how unheard of.
No idea why you're getting downvoted as you are completely correct.
Isn't the whole state FIFO?
Hahaha, it's a very moderate Labor government. It's hardly Dan Andrews incarnate
We already know tomorrow fares will also be 50 cents ;)
I honestly think it depends, even when a bus trip is slightly longer it can genuinely be more beneficial than taking the car, not just for the costs(which are now massively in favour of the bus instead of mostly), but for the mental effects as well. When you take your car you're largely stuck in traffic, you have to deal with every tailgating road raging dickhead around you, you have to pay constant attention and be on edge from start to finish - all of this after having spent your mental and physical energy for the day at your job. Meanwhile if you catch the bus you can just relax, throw on some music, read or listen to an audiobook, use the time to catch up on whatever, hell do some knitting/crochet if that's your thing, let someone else worry about all the stress part of it and actually have some time to decompress.

Also works the other way, on the way in it gives you a chance to get mentally prepared and ready for the day, all without prematurely stressing you the fuck out because of some dickhead driver or similar. I think a lot of folks claim that it's strictly worse, or that they could never do it, but genuinely haven't tried it and don't understand how even when it can take a bit longer, it has an enormous amount of hidden positives. Especially around fuel/insurance/maintenance/etc...
I suppose we won't have to rely on anecdote anymore as this trial should reveal all.
That station has a huge car park but it fills up so goddamn quickly
Not common enough.
The party with the biggest record of sales in Queensland is the ALP. It certainly didn’t go down well as Anna Bligh discovered.
>It's bizarre that Queenslanders are so dumb they'd even consider voting for Crisafulli.

No it's not. The ALP has basically been in power for 20 years (barring a short stint from Campbell Newman) - the It's Time factor has to kick in at some point.
not all that bizarre really, it's unlikely you've ever even spoken to someone who does not conform to the labor / green reddit voting bloc lol

The 50c fares aren't about being "progressive" they're about stress testing the Translink network and the LNP have already been vocal in supporting the trial.
It’s a cost of living measure to offset the cost of public transport. If people in rural areas aren’t paying for public transport, there’s no cost for which they need relief from. Public transport reach/accessible is definitely an issue but a seperate one. Also I’m sure there are services/infrastructure in rural areas that are primarily subsidised by urban dwellers.
Rural areas are already being heavily subsidised by metropolitan areas - which taxpayers do you think are fronting up most of the cost to build 100s of kilometers of roads, sewerage pipes, and electric poles/wires out to small regional/country towns?

Subsidising public transport in cities generates more economic activity than it costs, because it's much more efficient to transport large numbers of people on busses and trains than in cars on roads.
Not necessarily. Every person moved from a car to public transport reduces government subsidy. Depends how many it shifts. Driving is one of the most heavily subsidised transport modes.
Alternate view: if it reduces the need for yet further road projects that means everyone wins? 

We all subsidise each other like how we all subsidise your power network in the regions.  Hopefully it results in a better outcome overall.
Oh he totally would.
For a lot of people, the cost of a bus, or a train, isn't the barrier. For most people, its just objectively slower, more difficult to use, and not predictable enough. A 50c fare solves a problem they dont have. 

I have a bus outside of my house. In the time that I have to get there (early), to make sure I don't miss it, and the time that it takes to actually get there (late), I can be 2/3rds the way to work on my bicycle. Then you have to consider the travel time, and the walking to the actual destination. It just doesn't make a lot of sense. 

It's not as if the $5 a day or whatever people are paying was extortionate or a barrier to use. It's accessibilty, predictability, and greater speed. We need more routes, going to more places, more often, closer to us, faster than the alternatives. Its simple stuff.
I'm wondering if doing a big trip into the city on Friday would be a good idea or not this week, or wait until next (Ipswich line)
> Some large costs of car ownership are fixed from purchase price, rego, and insurance.

Except you can't just ignore those costs when comparing to a bus trip, especially as rego, insurance and maintenance can all vary wildly, especially if you get in a prang, get a speeding ticket, etc... Also the savings are far mroe than 2$, especially once you start to add them up over a long period of time. It has been possible for years now to cover the cost of commute for a fortnight for anywhere between 30-80$ depending on your A and B, it's almost impossible for a car to come close to those figures, especially if you don't ignore the parts that still cost money even if they're fixed.
Yeah, packed public transport would be great!!

Too often making the service shit + expensive is used to show "well no one uses it, why would we spend any more on it? Let's pay for more roads/parking since clearly everyone wants to drive".
Thanks. Privately owned so at least that's something. Macquarie Bank would never.
capped at 50 bucks per week where? im definitely spending more than 50 bucks per week but that might be because i work at syd airport and rely on trains to get there. maybe the station entry fee (19 bucks) and exit fee (21 bucks) arent included in this? 
also apologies. my mistake. still 50c per journey? hell yeah!
as far as im concerned there’s no party in nsw that has lower, cheaper fares for public transport but then again i havent looked 😂
Fingers crossed not. Might be moving to the CBD in 6 months to be a 10 minute walk from work but if I have to keep catching PT, I hope that reduced fares are a long-term thing. We should not be paying $10+ a day to travel on lines chock full of delays.
Yeah but of the two, Labor would be more likely to continue it, or a verison of
indeed.  more busses to decrease frequency and passengers per vehicle, and same with trains.
so why do I have to pay that to travel 20km to work?
Most of us aren't going on cross country trips every day. It costs the same to go from the inner suburbs into the CBD as it does to go to Warrnambool. That's just stupid.
And off to Brisbane I will go! I'm looking forward to catching the train one fine sunny day from Nambour to Brisbane, pottering around Southbank/CBD for a squiz, than getting the train back  again, all for grand total of $1.  Will be slower than driving the car, but then wont have to worry re finding a car park either. Chill out day.

Logan+Brisbane alone make up over half the population of the entire state, it's a pretty large amount of people that this benefits considering they operate in almost all of SEQ.
Does it apply to Cairns suburban buses?
[deleted]
This for sure, as someone an hour out of Brisbane, while not the worst, can only imagine if you had to pay for 4 people return just getting into Brisbane for it.
Checks out for everywhere but NSW, TAS, and of course Federally 

* NSW - 12/25
* QLD - 22/25
* VIC - 22/25
* SA - 18/25 
* TAS - 14/25
* WA - 17/25
* ACT - 24/25
* NT - 21/25
* Federally - 8/25
Yeah. But SA has always been a progressive state (especially since early 2000s), especially compared to Queensland. I am confused by the first statement. 
Not NSW it wasn't
Yup within the context, SA is not progressive
Yeah, even here in Qld we live under state/federal laws that are overall more progressive than California.
Fair enough, though there are a number of things that you can exercise easily thanks to the laws (eg healthcare carveouts from the Obamacare days, renter protections and minimum standards). Not saying it's always better but it's a bit better than NSW in a lot of areas.
I'll take California cannabis laws and trade you every building code in the book lol.
God I hope so. It'd be so nice to be able to afford to go somewhere again.
Finally maybe governments are realising that having more people move to public transport has a whole heap of hidden savings, and it's not just about the outlay :P

AND that public transport spending can also be a vote winner, not just road spending.
*Cries in Victorian.*
Every time public transport is referred to in NSW it's either in terms of opening more (good) or having to pay their "fair share" with no accounting for reduced congestion, pollution, and increased access (bad).
Aren't they electrifying the rest of the metro train network there atm?
Yeah the electricity rebates are effectively a voter bribe. They do nothing to address rising electricity prices and rebates like this are bad in the long-term
So you think the federal government's temporary fuel excise decrease before the federal election was good policy?
So the liberals ran a great election budget then giving everyone cheap fuel?
Again, it's radicalism.



Queensland had Australia’s only ever communist party MP (Fred Paterson member for Bowen), the first federal Aboriginal parliamentarian (Senator Neville Bonner), the first state Aboriginal Member of Parliament (Eric Deeral), two elected ALP female Premiers (Anna Bligh and Annastacia Palaszczuk), the latter of whom is Australia's first thrice-elected female politician at any level of Government and its longest-serving State Premier since World War 2, and one LNP female opposition leader (Deb Frecklington). And the state has largely been Labor-leaning since 1989.



One of Australia’s oldest Labor parties was founded in Barcaldine in Western Queensland in the 1890s, as a result of a shearers’ strike. In 1899, Queensland colonial MP, Anderson Dawson formed the first (albeit minority) Labor government in the world. Labor ruled Queensland for 40 years (in an agrarian socialist way) from 1916 to 1956, and dissolved the state’s legislative council (upper house), citing it as a bastion of Darling Down’s squatocracy. No other state has done this.



Queensland abolished the death penalty in 1922. Victoria was still hanging people in the 1960s. Victoria and NSW didn’t abolish the death penalty until the 1970s and 80s. Queensland was the first state in the then British Empire to do so. And was the first Australian state to abolish death duties in the 1970s.



The Forgan Smith ALP Queensland state government was the first to implement a publicly funded health care system in the 1940s, headed by Dr Raphael Cilento. Much maligned Premier, Sir Joh Bjelke Petersen fought to keep the Torres Strait Islands part of Queensland, resulting in indigenous Eric Deeral’s election as the member for Cook in 1974. The Whitlam government wanted to cut the Torres Strait adrift when granting PNG its independence in 1975.



Queensland has always been leading with radically progressive ideas. It's that in this day-and-age, a radically progressive idea is often conflated with conservatism. In history, being progressive was radicalism, in today's world with all its progressivism, being conservative is radicalism.
I just want you to know I appreciated your joke
I would be going from a hour and a half daily commute to a 4 hour daily commute. That extra 2 and a half hours could be spent at home cooking dinner, cleaning up after cooking dinner and cleaning my house. None of which gets done with out me being home to do it.

The other issue is I start work at 7. Which means I would need to be on the first bus by 5am at the latest to make it to work on time. Buses do not start that early. Inconvenience factor
Here's the kicker.  The original plans for the Springfield line included a station at Ellen Grove, and a 3(!!!) storey car park at Richlands, but the plans were scaled back.  I've lost track of time, but maybe about a year ago I saw surveyors in the carpark and asked them what they were doing.  

Apparently 3 storeys is back on the agenda.  Who knows where everyone will park while they slap an extra floor on the carpark though.  Maybe down at the Dutch(?) club past the Lions.
I'm glad it bit her on the arse. Leave our assets alone.
They just switched to 99 year leases instead.
Surely Can-do's time was an indicator of why we don't want the LNP in power?
Just because *’it’s time’*, doesn’t mean you have to shoot your self in the foot…

That’s like saying I haven’t shit myself for about 25 years, so it’s time to give it another go to see if I like it more this time around.
I agree, good to mix things up, but crissafulli has already come out saying he wants to make it cheaper for mining companies to dig out our resources. No thanks
I keep forgetting that Anna Bligh was from Labor, wouldn't believe it from how she governed and running off to serve the banking lobby the moment she got out.
I gave spoken to several. They cant tell me why other than they don't like miles or not labor. 

That's a pretty dumb reason.
lmfao yeah it's definitely unlikely that I've ever spoken to someone who does not conform to the labor/green reddit voting bloc. That's absolutely something that someone grounded in reality would think, you absolute peanut.
The cost of living people without reliable access to public transport have is the cost of running a vehicle because they have no choice.  That $150 million being foregone is $150 million worth of bus services that could be rolled out to places with no viable public transport, offering a cheaper transport alternative to relieve their cost of living pressures.
> If people in rural areas aren’t paying for public transport, there’s no cost for which they need relief from

But on the flipside [as reported by the ABC](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-05/50c-fares-trial-launches-in-queensland/104178154)

> The state is expected to forgo about $150 million in fare revenue during the trial, with government subsidies for each public transport trip set to spike.

> For trains, the government subsidy for every passenger trip in south-east Queensland is now tipped to be $29.47 this financial year – up from $23.98 in 2023-24.

Those people who aren't using public transport are already paying towards the $30 per fare for those who are.
Increasing the footprint, frequency and reliability of public transport generates those benefits.  Reduced fares, not so much.  The current cost of fares is not the dominant factor in someone choosing to use PT.

Spending that money on rolling out new routes to people in the outer suburbs who don’t yet have access to the PT network will get far more people out of cars than $0.50 fares.
I was ignoring them because I was talking about people who own cars choosing to take a bus trip, not selling the car entirely.  In that case you have to pay those costs regardless of weather you take a bus trip or car trip, so it's not going to factor into the decision.

You are correct that potential liability for accidents, increased maintenance costs, etc. are contributing factors.  But I don't think many people will factor those into their decision on a trip by trip basis.  Most would only consider those if they were thinking about selling their car.  And that won't be a consideration for anyone unless you can convince people the 50c fare will be permanent.
True, I believe it does cost more if you stop at the airport stops. The rest of the Opal network (which goes over all of NSW) [is capped at 50 though](https://transportnsw.info/news/2024/opal-fare-changes-from-1-july#:~:text=Weekly%20travel%20caps.,continue%20to%20be%20half%20price.). I think you need to use an Opal card. I absolutely agree that 50c per journey would be amazing.
I'm travelling 20km to work.  I reckon 20/260 (about the rail distance to Warrnambool) x $9 = 69c sounds about right.
did you even click the link

Yes.

As a family of four travelling from the Gold Coast this lets us buy, like, a whole extra Dagwood dog.
That's actually interesting how Labor dominates at state level but generally fails at winning federally.
We're all a little time confused. Say 25 years ago, definitely thinking of 80s/90s
I think that may just be your inherit bias showing there.

Qld has had Labor governments for 22 out of the last 25 years.

Majority of the 1990's as well.
SA was the first place in the world to give women the right to vote and stand for parliament. We've always been fairly progressive.
Fun fact, NSW isn’t “most states”
Except for privacy laws and the right to be forgotten. We're years behind in Australia.
Capped price fares have worked well in Victoria. Easy to go large distances.

I enjoy train from Ballarat to Melbourne return and from Castlemaine to Melbourne return. Good with the right concession
Victoria had the metro daily cap extended to the whole state.

Admittedly, that's better for tourism than it is for daily commuting, but it's still an excellent move in the direction of 'cheaper public transport'.
transurban's interests are more important than poor people didn't you know?
they have advertising at the top of the light rail cars. every single one is about how transit offers will catch fare evaders and to pay your fair share with an embarrased looking cartoon of being caught for fare evading.
> Yeah the electricity rebates are effectively a voter bribe.

A bribe would be a one off.  We've received them for over 12 months now.  Call it what you want mate, it's still money in our pocket and not the mining corporations.  the LNP would never have done it and they sure as shit wont do anything about electricity prices, they'll just privatise everything and it'll turn into another shitshow like Telstra. 

> They do nothing to address rising electricity prices and rebates like this are bad in the long-term

How are they bad in the long term?
You seem to have confused conservatives with reactionaries in your last sentence there mate.

>It's that in this day-and-age, a radically progressive idea is often conflated with conservatism.

And that is just complete bollocks.
Queensland also hasn't had a legislative council (State senate) since 1922, which means the Premier wields a lot of power if they also have a majority government. 

In a way, a lot but not all of Sir Joh's National then era appropriate views on functionality over stimulation are why Brisbane struggles with adapting to more modern day demands (like public transport) compared to somewhere like Melbourne or Sydney imo.
You make a fare point.
Yeah. I work at Coorparoo, if I lived in Greenslopes or Annerley or something I'd 100% catch the bus. 

But a 40min car trip turns into a 1hr30min PT exercise.
He was an indicator of why we need an upper house
People don't vote for oppositions, they vote against incumbents.
That's why Labor has had 3 terms since then.
Honestly we need a third party that's not Labor or Liberals to come to power, that also isn't completely cooked.
People in cities also have the cost of having vehicles too aswell as public transports costs. Let’s also not forget that Government has cut/frozen rego as a cost living measure too
Except that report isn't looking at not obvious/not upfront costs and savings, if even 5% of people were to use buses and trains rather than their cars, the cost of maintenance and upkeep on roads and infrastructure would be far less and that's just a basic example.
i do use an opal card and it does cost more getting off at the airport 🥲 but it sounds like maybe the airport part of the opal network doesnt count towards the 50 bucks. today for example, i spent almost 45 bucks getting to and from work. tomorrow, it will be back to normal opal fares which is almost 8 bucks round trip. it wont be capped at 50 tomorrow
That seems a bit low, you’re in the mid or outer suburbs at 20km.
Last year I went to Redcliffe Show and nearly fell over when I saw the prices for dagwood dogs and fairy floss. Not to mention the rides...

It was the first show I've ever been to where I didn't buy anything to eat or go on any rides.
Covid only started 2 years ago right?
QLD is strange, at state level, it's Labor, at Fed level, it's LNP.
You also spawned Corey Bernardi
I thought this was California then New Zealand?
Ssh, they think they're the only ones here.
Like I said, that stuff is probably being self policed.
Good to go long distances. Munted for me to catch a bus to the next suburb over. 
And you would have thought that governments would capped Tolls by now. The Citylink tolls are the biggest rip off for tolls in the world. But hey its okay Canadian pensioners deserve to be richer than our poverty stricken pensioners. The Aussie battler way, screw you into the ground by bad governance.
Should have happened when we went to 4 year fixed terms
Yep. Goes back to my original point about being stupid enough to vote for Chrisafulli.
They're called the Greens
Do have a look into some of the greens policies. They proposed free public transport in qld in around 2017/19 I think. Public transport is heavily subsidised by the government, fares make up a very small percentage of overall cost. The shortfall could have been easily made up from other sources. Increasing mining royalties is one example. This would also have not required the government to spend $400 million rolling out the new ticketing system.
You have a fixed number of trips that you can take in a given time period.  If PT is an option for some of those trips, it reduces the need you have to operate an existing vehicle for some of those trips (reducing running costs) or the cost of purchasing an extra vehicle to cover the volume of trips needed for, say, a family (reducing fixed costs including rego).

PT is cheaper than owning or running a vehicle.  It's inherently a cost of living advantage if it's available to you.
Also makes traffic lighter which shortens their journey, giving people more time in the day, as well as fuel savings and other small things that add up.
You're SOL until 2030 on that one when the contract is up sorry.

Airport workers should really be compensated for the train.
it's proportional to the cost to Warrnambool.
No upper house, the LNP go bloody insane when they do get in.
You can thank joh bjelke petersen for that. And campbell newman for the reminder of how shit they are.
Win some, lose some
And Georgina Downer.
I don't think I can get to any towns near Ballarat unless they are on the train line. Daylesford and Maryborough are not connected at all. I can get to Bendigo by taking train from Ballarat to Melbourne then train from Melbourne to Bendigo. 

No public transport to get to the train station in Castlemaine
I think you might find the contracts signed with Transurban allow the tolls to be increased by CPI annually. If the States attempt to prevent this, Transurban will sue them, likely successfully.
Lol
So we shouldn’t reduce public transport costs because it’s already cheaper than driving and it would be unfair/not equal otherwise?
free train pass especially since people who drive can park for free at the airport throughout their shift. its shit that public transport users dont have the same benefits
Why is Warrnambool the yardstick? I just picked a random country town to illustrate how silly the fares are. I don't think 20km should cost 10.60 like it does now but .70 is ridiculous.
Gamble responsibly.
Yeah, there's a severe, unaddressed shortage of PT in regional areas. The assumption is everyone is using it to go to Melbourne CBD.
Average ALP voter right here.
What we should do is spend money on public transport in a way that gives the best bang for buck for everyone.  If you’re going to throw $150m at PT (and I think we should), you get a much better outcome by spending it on new routes, more frequent services and improved reliability, rather than fare subsidies.

Do you think it’s fair that people living in outer suburbs, many of whom are at the bottom end of the income spectrum, are forced to run multiple cars because there is no PT available to them, while those in more affluent suburbs with higher incomes have great PT and now get a fare reduction to boot?

That’s the opposite of ‘progressive’.
because that was the example given of how far $9 would take you.  I based that on travel distance from the CBD, to there are from me to the CBD.
Enjoy your world of whimsical fantasy
So because inequality exists at either end of the socioeconomic spectrum, we should scrap the scheme?
Open a window and look at the state of the country.
We should spend public money in the most effective way possible to help reduce inequality and improve everyone’s quality of life.  It’s a fundamental tenet of progressive political thought.

Which bit of that are you unable to wrap your head around?
