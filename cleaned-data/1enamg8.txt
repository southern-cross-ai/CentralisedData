**Warning** **RANT**

[Thought it would be better to crosspost here](https://www.reddit.com/r/olympics/comments/1eathlf/the_nbc_and_other_broadcaster_official_complaint/lh4p0md/), but airing my grievances here too with Stans broadcast effort, worthy of daily Friday Fuckwittery Level specifically:

Firstly I will say [Stan Sports](https://play.stan.com.au/) does have an improved app/ design but FAILS majorly in its actual broadcast efforts with camera work and commentator choice.

So much missed footage as one camera attempts to track the whole Track + Field events, or switches to less impressive heats vs. gripping finals.

And a few commentators are either:

1) useless at commentating 2) knowing what's actually going on/ or are confused wrong/correcting themselces or 3) boring, repetitive and/ or a super annoying tone/style (ie. Pole vault dude, basketball dude "Aaaand thats GOOOOOOOD"---> change it up a bit dude FFS)

They are almost always taking a direct host feed from IOC/OBS. Direct your complaints there. Or you can argue with the people who post daily complaints about the Nine/Aussie commentators who are apparently totally clueless compared to the host commentary. 
My understanding is that there are separate channels or feeds for each field event with no commentary at all. There’s also a general “Athletics” feed with OBS commentary.
I've found the Stan coverage great. There's the options to just watch the sport without the crap surrounding it, and a lot of sports have different lengths of replays. The commentators on the sports I've watched (not a lot of track and field tbh) have been great.

Watching anything on Channel 9 half the job is figuring out who was competing, who won and what the heat was, because they spend so much time focusing on the Aussies, then eff off after they've done their little bit and don't show the rest of the sport!
Yes! The American basketball commentator is horrible! Every time someone scores he says “and that’s gooooood! And every time someone misses it’s “and it’s no goooood! 

He over does it nearly every sentence he says. “And James Bllllllooccckkkks the SHOT! 

I’d rather watch the games on mute or in another language for the games he commentates. 

Anyone have any idea who he is? 

Awful! Mind you, the female UK Commentator for the basketball is really good. The Australian guy too.
You do know the camera work is done by locals working for the IOC? 


You do know that there's only one camera/production team at each event, right? 


Did you really think that every nation sent hundreds of their own camera people and production techs to every event? Or did you think that the Stan guy is having trouble with his camerawork because he's jockeying with 8 other cameramen for the exact same shot just for Australian TV?
I find the OBS neutral commentary outstanding compared to the Oi Oi Oi on the rights holder channel 9. You can watch the exact same event with a completely different experience.  You just miss out on the post event interviews in the mixed zone and about 1000 Woolworths and Qantas ads.
Seconded.
Well good thing both are available, I guess. I find the international commentary pretty dry and it often overlooks the Australians completely which, let’s be honest, is the entire reason I’m watching kayaking or gymnastics in the middle of the morning.
