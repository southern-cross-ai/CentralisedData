Apologies for the tech help question, just not sure where else to go for the answer to this specifically Aussie problem.

I can watch the Olympics live streams on 9Now without any buffering, but whenever I watch a highlight video (also the ones embedded in nine.com.au articles) they always dip in and out of HD and freeze every few seconds.

I guess that the players Nine is using for live vs highlights are probably different and that they have their own quirks.  But at my end, is there a change I can make to my browser to fix this issue?  I'm on Chrome/macOS.

Thanks!
