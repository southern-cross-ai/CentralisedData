I'd love to see cars made here again.
Not going to happen unless we resurrect Thomas Playford
We'll run into the same issue we ran into last time though. No one is going to buy at a huge mark up for Australian made just because it's Australian made. We need to start with the lower hanging fruit like high end onshore refining which we are consistently on the cutting edge of, but never implement ourselves.
Would be perfect for EVs with most of the raw materials here.
