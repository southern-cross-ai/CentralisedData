Failure to address African gangs is what puts the community at risk not calling it out
The economy will continue to decline and as it does we will increasingly see right wing grifters and flailing conservative politicians fan the flames of racism and fear to win votes.


The media benefits from regurgitating these BS narratives. Controversy sells paper and gets clicks. 


The commisioner is spot on with what she says. Her mistake is thinking that right wing grifters, conservative politicians or the media want to learn from their "mistakes" of the past. I put mistakes in quotation marks because for each of these 3 entities the African gangs commentary was not a mistake - all of these groups benefited from inventing outrage about African gangs. And they will absolutely do it again.


Relying on all of our media or political parties or police to treat people fairly is a lost cause. I think the best line of defence against this is conversations we can have with friends, family and colleagues that:
- humanize the people who are victims of this.
- debunk the idiocy of these right wing narratives.
- shame the central people who spread these hateful narratives.

What's the BS narrative? The article is saying that the Sudanese community is considerably overrepresented in crime statistics and in a linked article it says that the majority of Victoria's youth crime is driven by a small portion of serious offenders.
We laugh at Pauline but on the  face of it she is just a rude version of mainstream politics that has some manners to fool people.
The BS narrative that gets pushed is that this violence is an inherent problem with African people. 


It's inherent when the media, politicians and right wing shit bags label these crimes as being a result of "African gangs". It's not being labelled "youth gangs", as we sometimes see elsewhere. It's not being labelled "male gangs" despite males being overrepresented as perpetrators of violent crime. It's not being labelled as "Melbourne gangs". I can't remember ever seeing media reporting about "caucasian gangs".


Regarding "gangs", back in 2018 when this media coverage peeked, the Police commissioner said there wasn't even consensus that "gangs" are involved at all.


The BS narrative that develops from this is that ethnicity or race can explain why somebody is committing crime, instead of the complex web of things that actually contribute. 


Better explained in this article:

>The BS narrative that gets pushed is that this violence is an inherent problem with African people. 

Is that narrative being pushed though?

The article says almost nothing other than complaining about minorities being overrepresented in crime being labelled as being identified as such.


> Proportionally, Sudanese-born youths are vastly over-represented in the statistics, responsible for 7.44 per cent of alleged home invasions, 5.65 per cent of car thefts and 13.9 per cent of aggravated robberies.

> The latest census data shows people born in Sudan or South Sudan made up 0.11 per cent of Victoria's population in 2011.

That means they committed roughly **70x the crimes per capita than the average Victorian**.

It's ridiculous for The Conversation to present itself as intellectual or academic then refuse to talk about the problem.
Are they not? In every culture, in every country they're overrepresented in violent crime.
>“What I saw then was several years of intense media focus, political focus and policing focus on so-called African gangs,” she said.



>“We’re seeing that again now. I’ve seen, in that time, some periods where there are clearly very intense so-called proactive policing approaches to identify and tackle youth offending, and I’ve also seen some efforts in that period where there’s really positive attempts to identify young people and divert them away.


>“But overall what I’ve heard from young South Sudanese-Australians is that their experience is they have become more closely monitored, more surveilled. They feel that they and their families have become increasingly targeted by police.”


This is the exact narrative that ethnicity or race is the primary risk factor of crime, as it's currently being applied by police.
Who's they? And where are your sources to back up your claim? 
You are mixing race and ethnicity causing crime with people within certain communities being responsible for a disproportionate amount of crime.

Police are obviously going to focus on the groups that commit the highest amounts of crime. People within the Sudanese communities in question commit a highly disproportionate amount of crime, that isn't a narrative, that's a fact.

The article is just talking about the best way to address it.

Really funny that you think police allocate resources fairly or proportionately 😂 you must be one of the only people in the country who thinks this!


>The article is just talking about the best way to address it.


It's also highlighting, quote: "the intense media focus, political focus and policing focus on so-called African gangs,”. Which is what my original comment was referring to. Confused why this needs to be spelled out.. unless you're deliberately trying to miss the point of my comment?
I read the article.

I'm not missing any point - of course there was intense media focus and police focus, because, it only takes one incident to draw attention to the fact that a demographic commits 70x more crime per capita than everyone else. 

I dont think the points you are making really have any merit, You're complaining about bullshit narratives yet you are complaining about people even talking about the issues.
Lol -talk to Sudanese community leaders- parents, teachers etc- they will tell you, in language much stronger and more pointed than anything you’ve ever heard , that the culture of Sudanese kids to be bad & commit many crimes and illegal activities and violence and robbery etc etc is significant and a big problem and they need strong discipline and harsh punishment ...
>I'm not missing any point - of course there was intense media focus and police focus, because, it only takes one incident to draw attention to the fact that a demographic commits 70x more crime per capita than everyone else.


The magnitude of that attention was not fair, or accidental, when Sudanese crime equates to about 1% of total crime.


>yet you are complaining about people even talking about the issues.


What? No I'm not. I'm pointing out that right wing nutjobs will, regular as clockwork, weaponise hate against migrants or people perceived as migrants once the economy starts a downturn. This is not a controversial observation and is well studied. We've just watched this play out with far-right riots in the UK.
How do you feel about Ivan Milat? Or Jimmy Savile?

Both committed a tiny fraction of total crimes. Should they have been ignored?

Ultimately people dont want to see criminals continue to keep committing crimes and make victims out of law abiding citizens. I also dont care about whether media attention is fair for convicted criminals.
