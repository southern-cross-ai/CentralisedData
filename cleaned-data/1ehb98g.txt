Yeah ..that’s not good 

“He said there was also evidence cooling towers with legionella could “send aerosols out into the air for more than a kilometre”.

“People can inhale it even though they’re not right next to the cooling tower, and that’s what also makes it a challenge, from a public health outbreak point of view, trying to pin down where people have been to isolate the cooling tower source,” he said
For those that work in public health: should the source have been identified yet? Should be there be ‘contact tracing’ of sorts, as well as testing of cooling towers?

For anyone interested. This is a really interesting video about Legionnaires.

How could Dan Andrews do this?
Explosive legionnaires disease you say 🤔🧐
If only we had some kind of track and trace capability…
This is unfortunate during a time of health care funding cuts in Victoria.
My grandparents had a brown room with brown carpet and avacado green curtains in their living room. It was very unfashionable when I was a kid and I asked my mum why they had that scheme. 

She explained to me the room was originally intended to have a shit tonne of indoor plants in it. It was all the rage to fill your house with plants. The height of 1970s coolness and sophistication, bringing the outdoors in and all that. 

But then people started getting sick. The potting mix and soils indoors were spreading legionnaires. It turned out it’s not healthy to fill your house with in door plants. 

I know it’s not related to this spread. But it does amaze me that the millenial indoor plant crazy took off so successfully with no one ever stopping to wonder if anyone had tried it before and why they may have stopped.

Will there be a short, sharp lockdown?
Today I learned legionnaires disease makes you explode.
Bet they’re all mRNA vaccinated. The only ppl coming down with “illness”.
Strange, I had only heard of the explosive "Ligonnes" disease before.
When I worked in Adelaide cooling towers were sampled and cleaned each month for Legionella. They also audited you each year and the council had a register with your personal phone number on it so they could call you anytime if there were issues. I imagine Victoria has a similar system they just haven't worked out where it's coming from yet. The issue is it can spread in the wind and often grows in dead spots within the circuit which may not get sampled.
I believe viable legionnella cells have been known to travel up to 6km in droplets
WTF
Are they saying where,  or just various areas around Melbourne?

They have narrowed it to northwest of the city, and yes they're treating cooling towers
Apparently there are 14 suspected cooling towers which isn't too many. A positive PCR would take less than a day, but given how ubiquitous Legionella is more than one tower might have returned a positive.

To confirm it you would need to isolate the bacteria from culture which takes a long time for Legionella (\~7 days). 36 hours to prepare and sequence the DNA and then an additional 12 hours for the analysis.

You could also do MLST (sequence much smaller bits of the genome) on uncultured samples but it's much less sensitive and might not be specific enough to narrow down the positive results.
VIC Health just posted this:

Contact tracing is time consuming and difficult. It's been one week. That's not a lot of time.
An outbreak a few years ago that I had knowledge of in WA took about 2 weeks to narrow it down to roughly a suburb size and then they started hitting all of the hvac cooling towers in that area. 

That might seem a while but the main issue was that you don't know it's happening for the first few days - you have a bunch of older individuals present to different hospitals with chest infection or pneumonia (which is not abnormal in that age group), you send sputum samples to the lab - not sure if it's viral or bacterial, a few end up degrading to icu/dying or similar, and then around that time your first round of samples come back and you realise you have a legionella outbreak (at this point the samples also start to get processed much faster). Then the tracers get to work and they start sending out the cleaningcrews - Here, they have quite a large sample size here so they will probably do it faster.
Yes.

To shreds you say?
“Explosive ‘legionnaires’ disease *outbreak*” [my empasis].
It's a bacterial infection that is not passed from person to person
Guess everyone is going to have to learn to live with it, just like COVID
The chance of catching it with indoor plants is when handling the potting mix, as long as the potting mix has been stored correctly and you wear gloves (a mask helps as well) then most of the risk (which is pretty low) is gone.
I mean people used to use lead in everything and uranium paint on their knick knacks, things have changed pretty massively in 50-60 years, not just the various materials, but also peoples understanding of safety and handling. The indoor plant craze took off because with proper precautions it's not an issue at all.
depends on ones health and general level of health I think considering the "at risk" group is people of ages 40+ and those with medical conditions/lowered immune systems.

either way tho - if you think you have it (seems like the type of sickness that makes it very known that something is wrong) better to go to the doctor/er and get tested.
> About 1 out of every 10 people who gets sick with Legionnaires' disease will die due to complications from their illness. For those who get Legionnaires' disease during a stay in a healthcare facility, about 1 out of every 4 will die.

My dad got it in 2022. He felt fevery and had severe shakes with no other symptoms for a week. His doctor misdiagnosed him then the hospital misdiagnosed him again. Then he woke up and didn’t know his name, and couldn’t control his bowels. He was slurring and his eyes weren’t locking on.

An ambulance was called and he was finally diagnosed with legionnaires. He spent over a week in hospital, lost 25 kg and now has kidney problems for the rest of his life. Has had to alter his diet completely, and has iron issues in his blood. It was extremely scary to witness and he almost died.
The Victorian regs are more stringent in many ways. It's like any laws though, they only apply to you if the government knows you have one.
Mmm you’re half right. Systems definitely wouldn’t need to be cleaned monthly - at most it’d be 3 monthly cleans but I’m not 100% sure on sa regs. In vic and NSW it’s anywhere from 3-6 months depending on the risk management plan. Sampling would be monthly for both legionella and total plate count most likely. 

The dead spots are called dead legs and while legionella does grow there it would show up in the water sampling if proper sampling techniques were used as it would leech into the main body of water.
Yeah nah mate we ain't cleaning them every single month.
And his wife?

How do you store potting mix correctly?
A touch misrepresentative not looking at it in context though - you basically need to have a poor immune system to catch it to start with, so that's people who are more likely to die from anything as a group. So the 1 in 10 is kinda similar to your 1 in 4 who is more poorly off to start with than just a random healthy person. 

Terrible stuff though, good reason why you've got to look after your cooling towers and why water authorities, hospitals, airports etc. have requirements for water quality risk management plans.
My limited experience with NSW vs Victorian legislation was that Victoria wasn't as stringent as NSW. In NSW we effectively had to run non detected Legionella counts. In Victoria they were allowed to run up to 1000 CFU/L. This was in hyperbolic towers natural draft towers so maybe the regs were different but it struck me as a little odd. 
A big problem is that sampling only captures a tiny percentage of the total volume of water in the system - and the way that legionella grows in biofilm gives way to intermittent shedding.
Our cooling tower was so small that our maintenance contractor I think decided to perform monthly cleans. Not sure it would be required for a big unit as that would get expensive. The point I would definitely make is that the government actually does take this quite seriously and do a lot of work to manage the risk. So do most organisations that have this type of equipment.

We did total plate count and Legionella monthly, and our contractor in Adelaide was all over any Legionella reports in Adelaide.

I'm not sure about Legionella hiding but it's something I overheard.  I think they were saying often there is an outbreak of Legionella but they don't detect it in the tower. I'm not sure about that but sometimes wonder if the outbreak is from unregistered ghost towers that are contaminated.
SA is minimum 6 monthly cleans but most would be quarterly. You're right, very few will be cleaned monthly.
To shreds you say
And my axe.
Yeah that's exactly what they are doing, that's how they have narrowed down the area so far.
There are shitloads of cooling towers around, especially in the Northwest of Melbourne. It's very difficult to narrow down to an individual cooling tower, especially because most of them will now have been disinfected as a precaution.
And while cooling towers are required to be registered, there will be many in the area that are unregistered and therefore untraceable.
Get them to share their Google maps history if they have it enabled. Download all the waypoints, upload to a heat map and blammo! 

Even if only half the 60 cases have Google maps tracking enabled, should be enough of a sample size.
This is already performed by the public health department.
Much better to fire those teams and hire “expert” grads from the big4 at three times the cost
There’s cooling towers all over the place in a city and legionnella can travel like 5km in the air.
Might have to get the contact traces from Sydney as the ones Dan Andrews trained were hopeless
> you basically need to have a poor immune system to catch it to start with

It's a good thing we aren't still in the middle of a pandemic, particularly one with an infection that's well known for leaving your immune system in relative shambles once you get through it.
Were the Vic towers in a power plant?
They were likely on AS3666.3 which is where towers can't reasonably be shut down to deal with a count.
There would be very few, probably 0 on .3 in the identified area in Melbourne.
Nearly all run to AS3666.2 which requires remedial action on any detection.
It does but the turbulence caused by the cooling tower and associated pumps will break up any free legionella clumps and allow it to be caught in the sample jar. If there’s a dead leg that has a half decent amount of legionella it will definitely show up in samples, again assuming the system is sampled correctly.
You know they just fired 10% of the public service right? And that health was one of the main areas
Yeah they were in a power station and you're right they couldn't be shut down. 
No idea what you're talking about but you said it so confidently I trust you with my life
They kept the policy experts and got rid of a lot of their technical staff too.
Yeah I'm sure they didn't just close the whole public health department.
For communicable diseases, they sure did! Operating on minimal staff now.
lol you've never been involved in public sector redundencies have you? It will be what ever the latest fad from the "mins office" is and the rest will have been left to rot or fend for themselves
Yeah I'm still sure they didn't just close the whole public health office. 

My point here, in reply to the original comment, is that there is indeed a system in place to contact trace these events (and it is still operational.)

You're getting in a huff about something else entirely.
