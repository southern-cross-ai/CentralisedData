Don't post about it here.
Looks like this happened because the normal price is $5, this one got a special clearance sticker on it that discounted it from the normal price, but then the product went on sale for 50% off which ended up making the base price lower.

Quick Sale would have been because that one individual pack is nearing expiry. That is a discount by the store.

After that and through a completely seperate process, the company has discontinued the product and reduced the price as a part of a clearance rolled out nationally.

Likely no one, that's why it's on clearance.


Product will no longer be around on shelf soon.
