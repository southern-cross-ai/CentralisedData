Looks like you have more than a full team of fielders ready to go
Packed offside.
Is this in Halls Gap?
Not a bad turnout for a Sunday morning match. My team are usually the same, half of them lying down before the games even started
2nd slip looks like he is done for the day
They're waiting for the home team to arrive
Looks like it's the skips vs the wallabies.
Are the clods kangaroo shit, or the cockatoos ripping up the grass?
Just be happy it ain't emus
1 point, 1 gully and 12 skips.
I feel like I'm seeing Halls Gap.
Sorry mate, cricket's off for today.
That’s enough for two teams and a couple of parrots to umpire. Perfect.
Look at that slip cordon and gully region. It’s a Steve Waugh wet dream.
It says here on the schedule that boxing is  to happen at 2, then cricket after at 4
That’s a lot of fielders
Silly mid on is brave without a helmet.
Has Raygun inspired a whole new generation of dancers to storm the cricket fields

[Looks like there is a player on the field already.](https://i.imgur.com/WJFaIKB.jpg)
So do they it seems
I wonder if they could catch a ball in their pouch!
Boxing now
Some lazy players out on the pitch.
Did I just spot Raygun hopping around in that corner?
Kanga says no…
Thats a lot of shit
I bet that team pouches a few catches....
Yeah...nah.
They all came to see RAYGUN!
Get him trying to on drive. He'll find an edge there
Was my first thought too
Yes, Halls Gap Recreational Reserve
I had the same thought!
It's poop. This is what happens when kangaroos get into your garden and eat everything. It's a minefield.
