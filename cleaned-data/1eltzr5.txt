The owners of the Centrepay Card system are old school Nationals, Country Party boys. Nothing to see here.
Well they had  a lot of  party favourites   making a lot of money.
So the corporate crooks were committing crimes and successive governments  said " all okay proceed with being crooked thieves" Much like Robodebt, NDIS and every other government public private partnership that is ripping off taxpayers. Its good to see bipartisan agreement by the duopoly of politicians that this is good governance while they screw voters. Australia is a lost cause, because they crooks run and own Australia.
I remember.
