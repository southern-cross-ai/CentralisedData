Anyone know what this means? I have seen a few full masked guys making this around my neighbourhood, is it street art or some sort of pickup point?
It's a monkey

Just some public art
The nature of Monkey was irrepressible
*Just waiting for a primate*
ape together strong
A signal to guide Tripitaka?
It‚Äôs art, darling
In the worlds before Monkey, primal chaos reigned.  
Canberra sought order.  
But the Rooty Hill Bogan can only drive when its six-pack of VB tinnies has shown.  
The four coasts girt by sea formed again and yet again,  
As endless aeons wheeled and passed.  
Time and the pure essences of Canberra,  
The moisture of the Perth,  
The powers of Bert & Patti Newton  
All worked upon a certain rock, old as creation (or at least Johnny Farnham).  
And it became magically fertile.  
That first egg was named "Oy mate! hows ya' goin'".  
'Winnie Blues and a Big M', the Father Albo, said,  
"With our atheletes, we make the gold medals."  
Olympic forces caused the egg to hatch.  
From it then came a ribbon on a chain link fence!.  
The nature of Monkey was irrepressible!
12 monkeys
You're in the territory of the Monkey Gang. They will expect bananas from you at the start of every month.
It‚Äôs a fence.
These have been around Burnley area in Melbourne for years now. There were a couple other forms as well.
A chimp for a secret pick up point? Mate, you do realise everyone has personal gps devices these days.
Planet of the Apes is starting

For Caesar!!!!

Hahahah the fact that op thinks people are arranging drug deals by first thatching a monkeys face through a link fence to signify the meeting location is the funniest fucking thing I‚Äôve read and then subsequently imagined all week.

*breath*

Thank you op.
Oh wow . 
This is still happening.  
Used to see them all the time 10 years ago around Flemington and surrounding suburbs.
Banksy. Sell the fence
hehe monke
Have we gone so far that we're now afraid of .... \*checks notes\* art?
It's art.  What is wrong with Australians that they don't know art when they see it?
Lancelot Link fence
Rise in the Planet of the Apes, must either be a warning or a declaration of war
At high school, I knew a kid that did "animal tags"

Kieran, that you?
Monke
Guerilla art?
No idea but has Gorillaz band vibe to me
Dicks out for Harambe
I remember seeing them towards the Hoddle St end of the Eastern Freeway and there is one next to Wheeler‚Äôs Hill library that is sadly disintegrating. They make me smile.
A tribute to Caesar
It's very clever I love it
Planet of the Apes. We are done boys
It‚Äôs a Fence. Usually built to keep people out, or in or to delineate a property line
Some awesome ass monkey that some shit cunt will probably rip down because we aren‚Äôt allowed nice things and if they can‚Äôt be happy no one else can either!!!
MONKEY. I personally like the lion on corner of separation St and St Georges Rd.
Saw one at South Melbourne just yesterday

The army of the 12 monkeys.
It was put up for when lion king came to Melbourne to advertise it, there were lions aswell,  some have just lasted ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
People in Australia are so uncultured they ask reddit what street art is‚Ä¶.
It's not the same Mufusa done over and over and over for 15 plus years in Melbourne. Some tosser has done "DANDE" in Ferntree Gully like they're some kind of silver spoon gangster
Looks like Hit Monkey

Wasn't this stuff originally put up when the Lion King stage performance was on?
I thought I was in the Fallout subreddit.

Blender
Planet of the Apes is real.. except currently the Ape Government is in hiding.. operating within shadowy cabals.. this is a sign that thier meeting house is nearby .. good find op!

Sell your house and move to somewhere remote! The rise of the planet of the apes has started!

Repulse Monkey.
Monkey magic!  Or ad for the new Planet of the Apes?
Love these. First one I spotted was on Kings Way, decades ago.
Return to Monke.
It's a meeting spot for a gang of violent drug dealers called "The Monkey Boys"....or y'know, some ribbon tied to a fence. Either or.
Monkey man call card
There used to be a lion in Burnley at the golf course near the roundabout

A warning from monke not to touch grass
Dognappers hun
That is a warning for the Monkegue Bridge which is just to the right of frame.
Yart
If I'm not mistaken, there was a series of these put up as advertising for the Lion King stage show.

There are still remnants of those original ones remaining, and it looks like  some peeps continued the idea.
That's Treemonkey from Reddy I think lol
It's easier to clean than graffiti. To be encouraged.
Haven't seen one of those in a long time.
Looks like a monkey, if I‚Äôm honest.
return to monke
That's a fence.

It‚Äôs like graffiti but on the fence. I‚Äôve seen someone do this too but it was not noticeable since they used yellow strings
Ape Sinistar.

It‚Äôs a fence, they surround most things.
Looks like a fence decorated with some rather cool artwork.

It must be that Nate Higgers I‚Äôve been hearing about. I was even linked to this subreddit because of him.
Fight club

A waste of plastic. 

A person who makes one has to buy a lot of plastic(similar to the old supermarket bags) it then gets brittle due to exposure to the elements before it starts to fall apart and ends up in the stormwater drains.
Imagine needing to post this as a question. You're not very bright are you, op?
Is monke

It's extremely crappy art

it might look like a monkey, but it's really just some junk from a bin blown against the fence by the wind
could be an ape.
Its a fence
I remember 2 years ago these were all over melbourne, even in the suburbs
Thats really cool
Public Art? In Sydney? Better shut that shit down quick
In the worlds before Monkey, primal chaos reigned.
I read this in that voice without even thinking .. wish the reboot had been better.

I laughed WAAAAY harder at this than i shouldve
So there should be a Pigsy and a Sandy nearby?

Gorillaz - fire coming out of the monkeys head   ?
I ran it through ChatGPT and it confirmed it was a fence.

But, it might not be as AI doesn‚Äôt know much about fences or fencing in general because it was accidentally blocked during the AI training.
I'm okay with the typo
Yeah I think they were in cocklands as well
Easiest to spot pickup point in the world lmao
‚ÄòPick up point‚Äô‚Ä¶ like life‚Äôs a video game and criminals use a logo
Sad that I'm old enough to get that joke.
Gorilla art
Gorillaz next album cover ?
yeah pretty sure this is at the tram depot
Stop posting that right meow
No it‚Äôs actually got a meaning behind it, I was told once but completely forgot but if I find out I‚Äôll put it on this thread cause it was many many many moons ago- this monkey had been around for 10+ more years I don‚Äôt know if they do it for the same reason these days though
Ohh. I've seen that. Was so shoddily done, I thought it said "Darude".

Had Sandstorm stuck in my head for the following week.
It's art...
Why are you being downvoted?  What the fuck does the OP think it might be?
That's a lie.  It's not art.
Little monkey fella¬†
looks more like doctor zaius.... or maybe cornelius?
Someone call Bruce Willis and get him outta retirement.
..time to look for The Witness!
Yeah then there is your army of the 12 monkeys factor...
Argh! Get Outta My Chair!!
so it begins.
Nah, just 1.
Mon-KEY
Jumping on the fence
Planet of the apes is finally coming true!
It's a great ape.
Not doing so much these days.   The street art scene scattered a bit over covid.
Pretty sure it's Melbourne not Sydney
The phoenix can fly only when its feathers are grown.

So fenced in?
That‚Äôs your opinion. Regardless of what you think it is it will still most likely end up in the ocean.
Play a record, you‚Äôre talking shit
Damn I miss Monkey News, thank you for reminding me.
Chimpanzee to chimpans A
Bruce started it. Now he's gotta finish it.
That explains it
Phew
The four worlds formed again and yet again.
Wow, nice meta-pickup my bro.
Ooh, chimpanzee that! *monkey news, you ffff*
Time, and the pure essences of heaven, the moisture of the earth, the powers of the sun and the moon, all worked upon a certain rock, old as creation.
Chimpanzee that monkey news ya (strains)cuuuuuuuuunnnt
Elemental forces caused the egg to hatch, and from it came forth a stone monkey...
Steven: ah yes thanks for that rick.
The nature of Monkey was irrepressible!

I would have downvoted if you had excluded the exclamation mark.
