Ezi Magbegor was MVP!
Awesome win by the girls, first medal for them since 2012
What a great note for Lauren Jackson to retire on!
Surely they had better photos than this
The Opals played a killer game! Awesome game from the Belgium players too, was nail biting. They are so good at 3 pointers. 

Sometimes the bronze match feels more exciting than the gold as only one team gets a medal at the end. And you end your games on a high :).

She played a great game and respect to Belgium's Julie Vanloo for a great game too.
30 points

13 rebounds

3 assists

3 blocks

2 steals

At one point I shouted "if we win this medal she deserves three of them!"
I’ll admit I’ve only seen a handful of their games but every time I watch Magbegor always impresses me as a dominant and unselfish player. Awesome player to watch!
So happy for Lauren! 
To come back to the game in her 40s after already so much success and to get another bronze is incredible
amazing to see Lauren Jackson still making waves. what a career!
i’d like to see you win gold
Australia has its best gold medal haul of any Olympics and that’s your takeaway?
Not at all disappointing

Australia’s best ever Olympic result is not something to be disappointed about
Not over yet we got one more chance to catch them in the cycling  
They also have way bigger population and are coming of a home games in 2020, countries after home games always do well, not to mention Japan is good in many sports we aren't and versa
Get in the bin
It's not over. Our cyclists are doing some amazing things right now.
Do you always shit in your tea before you drink it?
I cannot believe she’s 6’4
