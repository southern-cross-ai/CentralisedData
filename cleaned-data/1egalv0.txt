For most people - it probably doesn't matter which one you have, you'll have similar symptoms and off for probably a week as with most other viral respiratory illnesses. If after a few days you aren't getting better, or you're part of the vulnerable population, then you need to seek medical assessment.
The combo COVID/flu/RSV RATs are rather hard to find unfortunately.

Start of the year I had bronchitis.




Had flu vaccine & COVID booster ~ May.





Last month I had COVID (third time's the charm! vaccine + 4 boosters deep. Does this count as 7 boosters altogether?)




Last week I was completely wrecked again. 




* Day 1 started with a dry cough that hurt my ribs, veered into hiccups overnight. The combo was so painful I threw up which cured the hiccups thankfully. 




* Day 2 continued with the cough and a massive headache, felt like my brain was swollen against my skull. 




* Day 3 was constant fever, sweats, just not nice. No headache though.




* Day 4 was regular phlegmyiness, sneezing, coughing. Took one of those combined tests, negative for everything. Blood taken, almost fainted (normally fine with this). Probably dehydrated when needled though. 




* Day 9 (today) working through 2nd dose of antibiotics, blood work came back with nothing there. Still snotty and coughing. I suspect long COVID impact of some type but check back with GP in 6 weeks or at end of antibiotics if not better next week.




If I have to do 3 of these illnesses per year it just sucks all the fun out of life, just wondering when I'll be debilitatingly knocked down. 
RSV felt like it was killing me, totally different from covid and the flu.
Coles and Woolies have them now.
I bought some combo covid/flu RATs off Amazon. Don't know if they also do RSV.
I think I’d be calling an ambulance quick smart. Good luck.
I’m so sorry you’re going through this. 

When I had the CVS the doc assumed I was going up the hospital and told me to tell them she’d given me a covid test. She gave me a script for antibiotics, after which I no longer felt I was about to die (seriously). She then gave me a really strong puffer, and a nasal spray, I came well enough after about a fortnight to start getting fit again.

As you say, feeling like that makes life more effort than fun.
But unless you're not getting better, or you're in a vulnerable population, the treatment is the same - manage the symptoms, and wait for it to run its course. 

I get loads of younger patients in my ambulance with Influenza, RSV, COVID etc all looking for the hospital to give them a magic fix, and then realising that testing positive doesn't suddenly open up a new treatment pathway unless there's a specific indication for it.
Who diagnosed it? Was it done via PCR test?
Amazon does sell a combo test for covid/flu a + b/rsv. Bought some this week.
Just to expand on your vulnerable proviso...


People 70+ do get a magic anti viral treatment if they detect it early enough. 50+ can also get it if they have a couple of [pre-existing complicating conditions](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/factsheets/Pages/mycoplasma-pneumoniae.aspx#:~:text=%E2%80%8BMycoplasma%20pneumoniae%20infection%20can,and%20to%20go%20to%20hospital) (eg asthma). If you are rich you can bypass the eligibility and pay for it yourself: $1100.  


 My GP said that in addition to RSV and flu, there is mycoplasma pneumonia going around. [Responds to antibiotics](https://www.health.nsw.gov.au/Infectious/factsheets/Pages/mycoplasma-pneumoniae.aspx#:~:text=%E2%80%8BMycoplasma%20pneumoniae%20infection%20can,and%20to%20go%20to%20hospital).
Doc diagnosed it.
Do you know the product name?
People 70+ or with comorbidities are considered “vulnerable”. Mycoplasma doesn’t always *need* antibiotics (per your own link) - but as with any bacterial infection if you’re getting worse and not seeing improvement you should see a doctor.
AFAIK One cannot diagnose this based on symptoms alone so the question remains: Did the doctor take a swab to send off for PCR?

The doctor took a swab.
