Could just write the numbers there.
I have a faded memory of one Commonwealth games where BSHS (Brisbane State High School) students had won so many medals the school would've been coming 3rd on the medal table.
The [Australian Olympics website](https://www.olympics.com.au/games/paris-2024/team/swimming-team/) lists all their hometowns (except for one, Joshua Yong). Which gives us these figures for the 45 swimmers:

Queensland - 22  
NSW - 10  
Victoria - 5  
Western Australia - 4  
Tasmania - 2  
South Australia - 1  
Not stated - 1  
ACT - 0  
Northern Territory - 0
I mean Ariarne is down as a Queenslander but she‚Äôs Tasmanian. So is it where they are from or where the now reside?
Kawoonslandahhh!
This map is piss poor
What the fuck is this shit? 

How hard is it to just put numbers ffs?
*where swimmers are based.
Got to out swim those üêä
Well floods do up the practice.
Pretty sure this is a case of people moving to Queensland because that's where all the best coaches, funding, teams, facilities are.
We forgetting that Titmus is from Tasmania?
Maybe all of Australia should just become Queensland? 

  
I mean do you really need all those other politicians?
Now i want to see a correlation with average temperature of home town.
Today in things that should have been a bar chart.¬†
This belongs on r/terriblemaps
Isn't Kyle Chalmers from rural SA?
As someone who was training to be a professional swimmer in Queensland and who moved to South Australia. Yes. This makes sense.
Titmus is Tasmanian.
Is she a Richmond supporter?
A lot of the swimmers relocate to Queensland due to climate. 
Show a map where they were born.
Ah like the Hockey map would all be WA.
Most water in NT is the on the coast and is chock full of massive crocs‚Ä¶RIP
Okay NT has Crocs. What's your excuse Adelaide?
Titmus & Guiliani have repeatedly stated they are proud Taswegians, but that State doesn't seem to exist on this map?
Makes sense‚Ä¶ Queenslanders need to swim faster because of the crocs‚Ä¶
UP THE MAROON! right sport, right?
Well‚Ä¶ if you put the main infrastructure and financial support for the sport in one state, they gonna go to that state. I, personally, know two families who at seperate times moved the whole clan to qld so one of their kids could follow their swimming dream. 

Shit, throw together a map of where beachgoers go to the beach and you‚Äôre going to get a map very heavily weighted to the beach areas.
Using the Queensland Premier‚Äôs definition of ‚ÄúQueenslander‚Äù I see.
/r/shittydataisbeautiful
I'm from QLD, and I'm very curious what the rectangular landmass at the top left is?? 

Is that Bali?
Forcing the children to swim with the crocodiles may seem harsh but this is how greatness is achieved. Bob Katters clandestine training program paying off now, the children are evolving rapidly.
I'm a recreational swimmer in SE Queensland. There is definitely a "buzz" about swimming here - water temperatures are good, pools have been upgraded, there's lots of people swimming at all levels.

There are lots of Surf Clubs on the Gold Coast  & they are a tourist attraction. Swimming & dining.

I was at the Miami pool earlier this year and  there were "learn to swim" classes at 7am on a Sunday. So many enthusiastic kids. Old people swimming laps. The Gold Coast and Brisbane pools are really well patronised. If you go west to Toowoomba its not like that at all.
Because Queensland picks those who can out-swim the crocs.
It's almost like Australia's swimming talent moves to QLD cause that's where the facilities are and the support system to further their career.

Does not make every swimmer a Queenslander.

Just like every olympic cyclist isn't a South Australian.
Too drunk to swim in Adelaide. The NT swim team got eaten.
Thankyou Queensland haha
Queenslanders really do carry the whole country don‚Äôt they? You‚Äôd almost think they are a whole different nation in themselves.
I imagine the best swim schools are up here.
Tassie

Oooh that‚Äôs fresh!
I am really surprised üòØ
Im sure there's a joke about losing somebody every 3 months to a crocodile in North Queensland here
Well yeah. So much flooding there, it's gonna be hard to find someone who can't swim.
Sharks don‚Äôt fuck around - gotta be fast mate
The [inverse of the QLD origin team.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbgShiaal6E)

Old meme but still fun.
Potatoes float
I‚Äôm Australian
QLD'ers trying to out do the USA's participation medal tally
Go the Queenslanders!
We have swimming every week at school in Queensland so this isn't surprising.  Also, a lot of us have pools at home, or a friend that does.
pretty farken warm up here innit
All the NSW elite athletes who show any promise end up on the Australian cricket team.
It's like when they had the high performance stuff for cricket and cycling in SA and claiming all those people were from SA. Just because they all moved there because we base our elite swimmers there, doesn't mean they're all Queenslanders.
Usually the ABS is better at data presentation than this ü•¥. Did they make it, or did someone make this from their data?
Pools come standard with your new home in Queensland, that's actually a thing, they used to give a free pool when you bought a home from developers and builders.
Guess all the flooding in Queensland had an upside after all
Now do hockey
Note that SA and NT are actually two separate places.
'tis beautiful
Fake news
Now Gold Coasters.Break this down even further to show how many you won.
Well, Qld does have a very wet monsoon season...
A bit dry in the centre, I see. Crocodiles, too, of course. We mustn't forget the crocodiles.
When you have to outpace the crocs to survive, it makes sense.
That‚Äôs statist
It‚Äôs too cold to swim in Victoria
You guys realise that Titmus is from Tassie not Qld right?
over half the gold medals in the 2020 Olympics were also Queenslanders. The women of Queensland might put out their back carrying the entire continent so hard.
Queensland no longer get Origin, but they do get the Olympics
Damn a lot of non-QLDers coping and seething in the comments here lmao
Knew there was a reason I am not a big fan!
Yeah well the most successful swimmers we‚Äôve had Ian Thorpe and Emma McKeon are both from NSW so suck shit QLD üòâ

Can we just stop with the f-cking maps already. Jesus!
Queensland is always shady.
[deleted]
Bold of you to assume Queenslanders can read
That's also a fair representation of our sun tan preferences.
These days St Peters Lutheran College would be quite high on the medal table. That's where the Olympic swimming pipeline is.
State High is staked cause they‚Äôre the second biggest school in the state by numbers, and have been #1 many times.
Wow. Over Samoa and Tuvalu?
On the coverage they were mentioning Yong was swimming for Casey sharks I believe which is VIC.
Isn't really as lopsided as the graphic implies then
Swimming Australia‚Äôs high performance centre is based in Brisbane.
That‚Äôs in Queensland!
Queensland hasn‚Äôt got alot else going on
She trains in QLD though?
Well, to be fair, they did include WA. Thats a start.
Give them a break they're from Queensland
was going to ask this. seems obvious that they are not all born in qld
They are indeed based and red pilled
Let a thousand blossoms bloom.....but when a person is being ripped apart by a crocodile every 3 months, we HAVE to swim fast
[deleted]
Time for the *real* unicameral parliament.
Why stop at Australia, the sun shall never set on the Queensland empire
Port Lincoln I think. But he went to Immanuel College which is in Adelaide.
Hawthorn supporter. The hawks have posted a lot of stuff about her on their socials
Sharks.
It's there.  Just insanely light.
Maps maps maps maps maps maps maps!
How are those dentist bills going up there?
About 72% of Qlders drink fluoridated water (https://www.health.qld.gov.au/public-health/industry-environment/environment-land-water/water/fluoridation#:~:text=The%20amount%20of%20fluoride%20that,into%2050%20litres%20of%20water.), and 90% of the population of the entire country has access to fluoridated water (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001393512301719X)
So who is "we"?
Look at that map! Go Maroons!
Can bloody well swim that‚Äôs for sure.
That's not fair. If I use all my fingers and toes I can count to 23. I lost a finger in a horrible banana bending accident.
Or count
Yeah but we can fucking swim.
when you swim this fast, you don't need to know anything
You leave us Australian Floridians alone bud‚Ä¶
Oh, lol!! üòÇüòÇ
Just did the sums, St Peters is currently sitting in ninth on the medal table with five golds, ahead of the Netherlands and New Zealand
I think it‚Äôs more to do with their sports program and out of catchment selective entry for sports
They have an incredible sports program for a state school. Yes they‚Äôre huge but they can‚Äôt reject anyone from the catchment. Achievements exceed anything coming from a private school
Yeah. It was in 1990 IIRC. And it was "only" at one stage in the games, not the end.
On his [page](https://www.olympics.com.au/olympians/joshua-yong/) it say he was born in Brunei, his junior club was in Victoria, and his senior club was in Western Australia. It sounds like he moved around a lot.
Yes, it really is, one state has more than double the next closest, which also happens to be our most populous state, and only one less in total than all of the other states/territories combined. 

That is extremely lopsided. Someone doesn't do numbers very well lol.
Would love to see Queenslands medal count under origin eligibility. Must be in the thousands
Just winning.
So? A Korean medallist in one of the swimming events from a few nights back also trains in Queensland. Does that now make him a Queenslander, too?
‚ÄúHail from‚Äù usually refers to ones place of origin.  I‚Äôve lived in Queensland for 18 years. I‚Äôm still Tasmanian.
I remember in high school a lot ended up moving to Queensland, does mean they are mostly from Queensland, or  just where swimming Australia puts their money.
Why would they include places outside of Australia? Doesn't make sense
Medals per state per capita:

QLD 1 per 398,000

SA 1 per 885,000

Tas 1 per 134,000

WA 1 per 889,000

NSW 1 per 2.7 million

Vic, ACT and NT 0

If you remove team events:

QLD 1 per 864,000

SA 1 per 1.77 million

Tas 1 per 270,000

Tasmania is the real powerhouse of Australian swimming üòâ
Born in Vic. Grew up in NSW. Been in QLD my adult life. Researching WHY unicameral was eye opening. Senate voted themselves out.
He was living metro Adelaide as a adult, he was training at the sa aquatic centre at Marion when he made the Olympic team
Don‚Äôt need teeth to swim good
NO UP THE BLUES
Kinda proving the point. The statement was about Queenslanders inability to read and you referred to a map indicating their ability to swim. No-one said Queenslanders couldn't swim.
You‚Äôd be a quick swimmer too trying to avoid sharks, crocs and box jellyfish‚Ä¶
Nice way to grow up. Beautiful beaches and great weather. But these numbers will all change as all the refugees and landlords from down south invade resulting in the highest population growth "urbanisation" that ruins the relaxing lifestyle. Anywhere in Victoria you want to go you have to pay stupid parking fees just to  go take a walk on the beach. And the parking fees are so high you might as well go to the fish shop and buy fish because fishing becomes too expensive because of the parking fees. Yep, the politicians know how to ruin everything.
They can count to one, for One Nation.
It‚Äôs the webbed hands and feet
This is why this isn't as meaningful as implied. If you're going to compete and you're willing to travel for it, you travel to the programmes.
1/4 of the Australian swimmers come from there. I think the last Comm Games they came second. Behind Australia for which they were responsible for over half the medals anyway.
State High is basically a pseudo private school though. Yes they have to allow catchment students in (and ‚Äúcatchment‚Äù student) but over 1/3 of the enrollment capacity according to their website is reserved for selective entry. The latter two are probably where the majority of the weight of their success is
Look at the scale on the graphic - the range is 1-30 and the dark maroon is only on the very edge of the scale at 30. That is the colour of Queensland, however there are only 22 Qld athletes, not 30.
New South Wales doesn‚Äôt get the Olympics.
I think Titmus would be a QLDer by origin eligibility.

Moved to QLD at age 14, competed in swimming for QLD, and has trained there ever since.
If he can say "wobbegong", he's in.
I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs up to the individual. I‚Äôm from NSW but the minute I moved up here I was a Queenslander. If she sees herself as based here only for training then I suppose people can quibble over it- I‚Äôm honestly not sure why some people are so butthurt over not getting to ‚Äòclaim‚Äô an athlete whose success has nothing to do with them. It‚Äôs a matter of literally zero importance.
Only a Tasmanian would say that. Source - married to a Tasmanian
I‚Äôd call you a Queenslander, you‚Äôve earned it buddy to shed your Tasmanian skin.
That's not something you should admit outloud üòÇ

I'm just kidding. My mum's family is from Tasmania. Proper inbreads too, lots of cousins marrying cousins. I think she even had identical twin great great uncles whose children married each other. I guess that's why she's got two heads.
I‚Äôm happy for that to be entirely up to you- I‚Äôm not about to tell you you‚Äôre a Queenslander if you don‚Äôt want to be called one (especially when sometimes it‚Äôs nice to be able to deny it!)
Ha! The only reason we were originally included was because they found gold in Kalgoorlie. There are a lot of us who think we should succeed.
Fuckin woooooosh.
Buddy it's a great joke, and this is coming from a lifelong Queenslander.

Quick thanks to my friend from Sydney who helped me read this thread and write this comment.
It literally sais its from the Australian Bureau of Statistics lol
I think it‚Äôs more the climate and the length of time you can switch comfortably each year. Plus you learn it at a very early age, but I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs true for Australians in general.
Will happen?
Has happened already unfortunately. I call them interstate refugees. The hordes of western Sydney pollute south east Queensland.
They call their beer XXXX because they can't spell beer.
No it‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs far from ‚Äúbasically a private school‚Äù (I went there). It‚Äôs a very well funded state school. It doesn‚Äôt have nearly the success private schools have these days as private schools throw so much money at their students. State high can‚Äôt do that.   A lot of state high schools have high out of catchment for their specialist programs. That‚Äôs not of itself unusual.
Up the maroons!
/r/nrl is leaking worse than Buzz on a big Saturday night
Nah, it's 13 for origin
>"I‚Äôm from NSW but the minute I moved up here I was a Queenslander."

That's not how it works and you know it.

You may reside in QLD but when talking about sports specifically you are still a Welshman first, Queenslander second.
Ah, the Greg Inglis argument.
Yeah it‚Äôs definitely a Tassie thing but it‚Äôs just a thing isn‚Äôt it? Lived in the UK for a while, flirted with making it permanent had I done so I still would have always remained Australian.
Nah, been here 20 years and still a proud Blue
Cool, I‚Äôll be forever Tasmanian.
Fuck me mate that‚Äôs a cracker. Never heard those ones before!
Might as well, I doubt the east would notice anyway (I'm not from the east btw)
I know right? Guy doesn't understand humour.
He's oblivious to it, they can't read.
To be fair anyone from NSW will factually read this and know that most of the swimmers are from NSW because they are the premier state.
And what does that map have to do with Queenslanders ability to read?
I always thought it was called fuck
To be fair it does like to pretend it's a private school, such as competing against the private schools in inter-school sports
I dont think you know what a private school looks like vs a normal state school then. Basically a private school is accurate enough.
I didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúbasically a private a school‚Äù, I said ‚Äúbasically a pseudo private school‚Äù ie I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs not genuinely but still pretentious like a private school. Reading comprehension is important
Nah that‚Äôs birth based allegiance but there is the first touch of the ball rules that allow nsw born players who played juniors in qld to be qldrs 

Like I was born in Westmead but I‚Äôve lived my whole life in qld
I was born in nsw but my parents are qlder and I‚Äôve been in qld since 3 months old. Am I a blue?
Well, I wasn't joking about the cousins thing, that's actually true üòÜ
Nothing that's why I said it
Piss
Yeah much to the irritation of the private schools
Not true. I went to BSHS and my kids attended elite private schools for a while. Not even close in terms of how they are resourced. Sounds like the usual bitterness directed at schools like Brisbane state high
Yeah, my kids go there, it is absolutely styled as a pseudo-private school.
That's the exception but livesarah wasn't implying that.
If you want to be.
