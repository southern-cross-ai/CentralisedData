It would be great to have something similar to PCPartPicker (which does have Australian retailers), where you can search for items and set alerts for them, but for other things like clothing.

Canelcamelcamel for stuff for sale on Amazon. 

Ozbargain search alerts for everything else. (No guarantee somebody will post what you’re looking for when it’s on sale though)
Ozbargain.com.au
I only know of Camelcamelcamel for Amazon.

There’s visualping (https://visualping.io/), but I don’t find it very reliable. The fact so many websites use popups seems to significantly reduce its effectiveness. 
Shoutout to buy wisely
There is [https://www.ozbargain.com.au](https://www.ozbargain.com.au/) for all things sold

It can also send out notifications when a type of item has a sale
3Camels can be hit or miss for the .au site. Its often incorrect.
That's good to know not to rely on it. It can be a bit spammy for some items too.
I've noticed prime exclusive sales don't track on 3Camels
