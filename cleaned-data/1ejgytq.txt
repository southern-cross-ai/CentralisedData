It's been eight years. If you aren't planning on doing anything with it, demolish it. I certainly cannot imagine anyone wanting students (of any age) to use these buildings after what has happened there. People are suggesting they demolish and replace with housing as the area is in need of it for workers. Sounds better than letting it rot there to torment the victims.
The WA govt seem incapable of decisive action on anything unless Woodside or Santos tell them what to do.
I have no issue destroying the buildings.

Perhaps raising a proper memorial to the victims and highlighting the atrocities & perpetrators for all to see in perpetuity.
I dunno as a victim myself I kind of like the idea of seeing a block of perfectly usable bit of land/building slowly decay with neglect, because that's kind of how it feels to seek justice. Uncomfortable to look at sure, but I have to look at it every day.
Which is weird considering their supermajority. Like, what more do they want before they grow a spine?
