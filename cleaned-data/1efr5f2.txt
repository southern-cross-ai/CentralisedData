Hey 9 can I watch the basketball live - no we have swimming. Oh fair enough, can i watch it on your other channel - no we have bikes on. 

Yeh that's fair enough, what about your other channels - No we have Bill and Ted repeat from 23 years ago and some English Holiday Home show.

You already have internet. Go watch the live stream.
Literally everything is available on 9now to be fair.
Just choose what you want to watch on the 9 app. It's 2024, no need to settle for what FTA is showing.
It’s on the fucking 9Now app. Every event that is currently in progress, is on the app. It’s free and live. Cry about things that are actually wrong.
I can't even understand people who are competent enough to use the Internet whinging about free to air television. Download the app and watch it or get a cheap Chromecast and cast away
Go stream right off the app. What are you actually complaining about?
Bill & Ted are on?  Give me that over Olympics any day!
live broadcast for other events are on the website: [https://www.9now.com.au/live/event-clyqiv7xk000z0hqgzt0de6p5](https://www.9now.com.au/live/event-clyqiv7xk000z0hqgzt0de6p5)

you will need an account for that
[https://www.9now.com.au/shows/2024-olympic-sports](https://www.9now.com.au/shows/2024-olympic-sports)

Choose your sport and either highlights or events.
The year is 2024....

Streaming exists
Get Stan for the month. SO much better. ALL sports, intelligent commentators
Hey we love Bill & Ted! Bogus dude
The angsty hate for FTA TV has to stop. There’s plenty of free options now from 9 online to watch whatever you want, and there’s also Stan as a paid option for the same.
I've been watching the whole game on TV, it's just on their normal channel
9Now (app or website) has been great for watching the olympics, apart from not being able to rewind/scrub through the stream until it's finished, and it's a fairly low bitrate stream.

Everything is available on it as well! You don't even need to sign up!
You're just crying for the sake of crying now l. Surely you have a phone or PC which you posted it on. I'm sure you have a smart TV or chrome cast download the 9 now app and watch everything for fuck sake.
Use 👏 the 👏 app

There’s literally no excuse why anyone should be watching free to air. Stream from their catch-up sites. And I say this as someone who doesn’t even have a smart tv
Them running the olympics on every channel would piss a lot more people off than not running it on one
Just get the app??
Want good commentary? No we have random people talking about how amazing things are with 0 analysis. Worst coverage ever making me turn off
What device you using? I can select any sport I want on TV, phone, or tablet
Live stream is epic every ecent what are you bloody complaining about
The only thing I find annoying is the parochial commentary where they don't even seem to want to talk about the sport but instead spend so much time talking about the athlete's personal stories. I get the human interest element is a big pull, and I like it too, but I think Channel 9 is just leaning a little too heavily on that side of things.
Wish I could comment on the coverage, the damn 9Now app keeps glitching out whenever I connect it to the chrome cast. (We don’t have access to antenna or regular free to air rn)

We bit the bullet and got Stan for olympics coverage. The sports package is wildly overpriced, but you can easily check out different streams and select your preferred sports easily. I don’t know if we’ll keep it post-Olympics but for now it does the job
Ok Boomer.
#firstworldproblems
I mean I watched it live on the TV... Sounds like a skill issue
I had a brainwave and decided to try watching through  9Now on our chromecast. It is possible to watch stuff live but it’s a bit of a battle, you have to hunt around just to find the live action because they’d much rather show you a bunch of highlight reels and promos.  

When you do eventually find them there’s a decent selection (time of day permitting), right now they’ve got basketball, rugby sevens, archery, sailing, dressage, badminton and tennis.
9 Now
Use stan.  The coverage is great.  Absolutely everything and you can even fast forward.
Old mate doesn’t have a smart TV!!!
You can stream whatever you want on Stan
When we went to watch a sport on the 9Now app, all it had was a couple of 2 minute videos explaining what the sport was and how its rules work.
Pretty much every Olympics.  

You wouldn't know there are other sports other than swimming on for the first week and/or if they don't have an aussie with a chance of a medal in it.

This year is actually a bit better.
Now you can understand why I only watch the Olympic Highlights on the News. Past experience!!!!!😩
Grrr. I'm trying to watch sailing tonight - Men's Dinghy race 2. Nine Now is showing a general area shot of the water while they wait for the Mens Skiff race to start, ignoring the fact that the dinghy race is on now.

9Now only has one sailing livestream - does Stan have multiple sailing streams?
Will I get BBQed for being the "elephant in the room" and stating what most other people think, but in this woke world we live in are too scared to say? Dylan Alcott really sucks as a host on TV.

Yes I know he is in a wheelchair and was great at his wheelie sport that nobody cared less about, but he just isn't good in front of a camera. He single-handedly wrecked the AFL Footy Show and put them into extinction and now he is once again trying to be something he just isn't.

What is Channel 9's obsession with this guy? At least give him a higher chair so everyone isn't looking down at him all the time.

There I said it. Prove me wrong.

Roast away guys.
The app! The app! Just get the app! 

The app doesn't work on all TV's/consoles etc. Not everyone wants to stream from their phone. Not to mention the quality issues, freezing etc that many are experiencing with the app. 


We bought Stan. $30 and will unsub after the event. So much easier. Can't get the 9 app on our TV- last Olympics we used the 7 app on the same TV and it was fantastic....
Trying to watch the basketball on 9now is painful when it freezes and buffers every 10-15 seconds. Almost pointless watching.
Missed half of the first quarter because of them
Pathetic
Commentors: "Go watch9now!"

Yeah, the Olympic live stream is currently not working, but the Bill and Ted movie is playing. 

Why can't you convict fucks blame a controlling organisation for their screw ups, instead of taking shots at the peasants? Nice try, though!
The thirst for internet points is strong I see.
If you want to watch anything decent, you have to pay  for a subscription to subSTANdard and subSTANdard $ports
I refuse to watch the Olympics this year since the opening ceremony featured a tranny with "her" balls visibly hanging out of their underwear while they danced around with children.
My tv is too old
9now is kinda shit. Although to be fair, hd tv is also pretty subpar these days
That’s not a great recommendation either.
To be fair, the Boomers game last night wasn't listed on the main menu of what was currently on. I had go through a few menus to find basketball, then the headline started with Spain vs Geece.
Yes the app lets you watch any sport you want live and uninterrupted. I just don’t understand how people are finding this so difficult. It’s super easy to navigate and I have not had a single stutter or failure of video feed.
Yeah, the coverage is actually pretty great. Commentary could be better but this is the best olympics spectating experience I’ve ever had.
Not everything is available. I wanted to watch Alexei Popyrin in the tennis tonight and it was not listed under the live events :(
If you are watching it “live” (it’s not live but only a minute or two behind) but the replays don’t replay the whole sessions which I find bizarre. Surely it would have been easier to just link the whole recording.
I actually didn’t know this. Thank you for saving me from the swimming.
If it isn’t spoon fed to them it doesn’t exist. No one knows how to google anymore.
Remember that these people vote
Most triumphant.
Agreed!!
Best $15 you can spend this month, proper HD (or an extra $5 for 4K), no ads, bit of a shitty app, good commentators, goes alright
Stan is so goated for the Olympics this year. Replays are a big one since the surfings on at like 2am in TAHITI
This. Stan is streaming the official commentary, and the commentators are often athletes/ex athletes in the sport they're speaking to, so it's much more interesting and specific. They also try to be unbiased (unlike the commentary you get on channel 9)
is it on regular stan, or on stan sport? I haven't checked becasue i haven't had much time, and 9now had the opening ceremony replay fully uploaded.
Can you see medal ceremonies on Stan?  I might be completely blind but I can't see anywhere on 9now that is showing medal ceremonies that Australia isn't involved in.  Example Womens Rugby Sevens can see all the games but can't see the medal ceremony!
If you don’t want to sign in?
You think Andrew Gaze doesn’t know what he’s talking about?
It’s a bit of a roller coaster ride. I checked out the windsurfing and they’ve done the audio mix so the commentators are the same volume as the wind, which is a shame because I haven’t a clue what’s happening. Meanwhile the archery has broadcast commentators as well as local announcers in English and French, so you get two people talking at the same time. And then there’s the skateboarding, where they appear to have no commentators with technical knowledge and just two very excitable people who have no choice but to resort to making up nicknames for the competitors to fill the silence.
There’s two lots of commentary. Two streams. Ch9 was great with Gaze.
50c per day for Stan sport is hardly overpriced
No issues here.
Everything is on 9 now .separate channels for each sport
Pick up a Chromecast or Fire stick.
Mine too!
I'm watching the AUS v CAN basketball live on 9now as we speak. It's literally everything live and all the events with Aussies are clearly indicated.

Not sure what else you could want tbh.
But what else is my dad supposed to complain about if he's using the app and having a seamless experience?! Do you want me to lose family Olympic bingo?
Playing back the recordings seems a bit crappy, it buffers and then instead of waiting at the time stamp it started buffering at, it just keeps going in the "background" so when it resumes its missed some stuff. Some weird shit going on to achieve that, but anyway, everything live has been great.
Exactly...compared to the Optus Sport app which is dogsht
Whenever I go on 9 now, it lags, takes ages to load, and is just an awful experience, maybe cos I have terrible wifi (FUCK YOU TELSTRA).
Tried watching the basketball on the TV app and phone app, was getting terrible coverage in HD, kept skipping and kept repeating the last few seconds of play until I went to SD. Just watched it on my phone in SD in bed, the app sucks. FTTN top plan and nodes outside, watch tons of yt and twitch in the house so speed isn't a issue
You have to search for the particular sport for some things
I think they (9now) were only showing the main Philippe Chatrier sessions. Was he on an outside court?
It does replay the whole session for the sports I’ve watched (gymnastics, diving etc). Maybe only for some sports
This was me last time with channel seven.


Not everyone knows (or cares) about free to air or their stupid apps, even during olympics. 


In very happy with their app, I've seen one ad and watched multiple sports over multiple days. Doesn't feel like channel nine providing this, which is awesome.
Saving you from the best and most important event. How unaustralian of you.
Don’t know where you are but surfings the only sport that’s on during the day for us lol
Which is ok bc we all surf
Stan Sport.
I don’t know if they’re all there but I’ve seen a lot of ceremonies not featuring Aussies in rowing, fencing, shooting etc
It's free. Use a throw away account if you care about that
Just make a dummy account? Idk, if you’re using the internet at all ever you’re being tracked by someone so what’s the problem with making an account?
Fuck 9 had Gaze? 9now had some rando dude talking to himself, wasnt great.
Considering it's all on 9now for free, it's overpriced.

What are you actually getting for your money?
Same.
Glad it's working for you. From comments on other threads and reviews on the 9Now app seems I'm not the only one having this issue. Stan, Netflix, iView, Prime all work fine for me, it's only 9Now that's freezing and buffering constantly.
I was just watching Netherlands vs Great Britain in Hockey, what a game!
Replays would be nice. Not having to wait half a day for the replays to be posted when they do have them
Optus Sport and Kayo both love to shit themselves every now and then lol
Foxtel in general is just fucked. I watch the Supercars on my old boy's account, and if you leave it long enough, it'll either disconnect you with an error or drop a "Are you still there?" in the middle of a fucking race! The cunts must think streaming data is a finite resource.
Been using it for years and always found Optus Sport to be really good.
Oh that’s silly. Yet another reason to dislike the stupid app! I couldn’t even find where individual sports were listed but I’ll take a look! Cheers :)
Nah the first couple rounds were at 2am Sydney time I’m certain of it
thats what i suspected. i have regular Stan, but don't need stan sport most of the time.
I’ve got an account. Just saying that is a valid excuse. Throwaways are still IP and device tracked. They can still data match and know who you are.
I’ve got an account, but it’s a valid excuse. You said no valid excuse. I hate that I have to make accounts and be tracked.
Yeah I swapped back pretty quick to the Australian commentary
Reliable HD streams, commentators that specialise in each sport and zero ads. Personally think it is well worth it if you’re going to be watching a lot
Better commentary for a start. 4k footage. Individual event/heat/finals replays. Better navigation.
Given that I’m in the unique situation and trying to make the most of it, my pretty honest review is:

- playback is great

- the overall navigation experience is pretty much on par with the 9Now app, but you can select which livestream you want to watch and I find that the categories are laid out better. 

- commentary is a mixed bag. Yes you get loads of former Olympic athletes and athletes commentating on their specialised sports. However because they aren’t trained commentators sometimes they do get sidetracked. For example,  yesterday the swimming commentators got distracted talking about the benefits of sports psychologists instead of talking about what was happening. While it was a super interesting discussion. It wasn’t really the time or place for that and meant that a portion of the event didn’t have actual commentary on what was happening in the event. 

- a schedule on what events are happening when and an ability to make your own TV guide style schedule for events. I haven’t utilised this much yet, but as someone interested in pretty niche events I can see it being a really useful feature.

- no ads!! 

All in all, not a regretful experience, but we only got this because we had so many (and continue to have) issues with the 9Now app so I can’t see us continuing it after the olympics
Don’t know why people are downvoting you. I have the same issues with the 9now app. Stan works fine. But every now and then I need to reinstall the app because it would just stop working and get stuck on one of the menu screens
Try reinstalling. It usually fixes it for me.
Did you see Germany v South Africa earlier? Ref telling Germany to stop being drama queens had me cackling 🤣

>The cunts must think streaming data is a finite resource.

Technically it is.

Someone's paying for the processing power, electricity and bandwidth. Guess they don't want people putting on a stream in the morning and then leave it running all day while they're at work. Annoying but understandable cost cutting measure.
Wild! Yeah, you’re so right, some sessions have started that early .
Tahiti is 20 hours behind which I didn’t know 
We’ve been watching the morning sessions obviously
Same, I only did the add-on for the 'lympics coverage and will drop after it's done. Totally willing to do that for a one-off $15.
No one cares who you are
Then go back to 1952 and stay off the internet
I haven't watched anything except the archery and basketball, and so far have no issues with he stream quality, commentators and have not seen a single ad.

It's half time in the basketball, and would be the perfect time to run some ads, but they're just playing a live stream from a camera in the boondocks.

If you're happy with the value you're getting from Stan, I'm happy for you, but I don't see anything worth complaining about with the 9now coverage I've watched.

Either way, there are options, and complaining that you (op) don't have access to it is just horseshit.
Yeah, this whole thread seems to be full of downvoters. Apparently theirs is working so just downvote anyone who's experience is different. I've been streaming 9Now via Chromecast and had the same issues both nights.
No I didn't
Your data is worth between $50 - $200 to a data broker. They care
There was a beautiful time when the internet was a free for all Wild West without anyone needing accounts
Samsung TV app for me. I just hate the just stream it rhetoric. Because if it’s one thing this country is famous for it’s reliable fast internet connections
Are they paying you adequately to use reddit?
It’s not really rhetoric as much as it’s the only viable option.. there’s limited tv channels to broadcast on, I remember before live streaming was an option Foxtel launched a billion channels and still didn’t cover everything.
Not disagreeing with you there it’s a better option than we have ever had. But people can still complain that stuff doesn’t work. Or if they can’t get a stream for what ever reason the TV broadcast is shitty. Which by all accounts it has been
I agree, I just think it’s a bit hard on the broadcaster when it’s super expensive and difficult to open new channels on free to air
