How about outlawing the “blacklists” themselves? Any REA can put someone on this list purely out of spite, yes the tenant can fight it, but it still would have insane impact on their life.
They should outlaw rent payment methods that cost the renter money too
Good. It should be REA/landlord who pays for that. Greedy knobs
Blacklisting a person for shelter is just a bit less evil than if a company could blacklist for food or medical treatment
For once, NSW is ahead in something....
I hate how only one state does something good. Why don’t the other states match it?? Why don’t they have a code of law for real estate they can all share??
A kangaroo court process with no privacy controls or the ability to actually review the data and have it corrected the have on you. You have no right of reply or a ability to appeal any of their subjective judgments which could be vindictive or circumstance related. Its really undemocratic and uncivilised in this day and age.
I had  a perfect tenureship record for ten years at my last place but then at the end the REA fucked up the rent (actually they'd be doing it for years) and added on 2k to my "owed money" despite me having the years of receipts saying that I was all paid up.

I refused to pay for their mistake, it being *their only job and me having warned the owners numerous times about the quality of service they were receiving*.

But I did send the REA a sternly worded letter about putting me on the blacklist on the sly because my record was *unblemished* apart from their fuck up. I told them a court case would be ensuing if they agitated against me and my ability to look for a new home.

They didn't but the fact that I was *really worried they would and could* speaks encyclopaedias.
Governments target for Australian home ownership = 1% by 2050
Governments blacklist will be fun.
I had a tenant that destroyed my house over a 6 month period.  They had a toddler in nappies, and their method of disposing of the nappies was to punch a hole in the plasterboard and post the nappies down into the cavity.

They were also sky divers, and they would wash their chutes and hang them to dry by punching a hole in the ceiling and hanging a garden tool hook.  This would inevitably collapse and rip sections of the roof down.

At the point I found out the house was absolutely disgusting.  We had to go through the courts to evict, and then once they were out I had to decontaminate and essentially rebuild the entire interior.  Specialist cleaners were required because of the human waste.  

Sure I was insured, but I would have been out of pocket a solid $60k-100k once all was said and done.

My current tenants are an old retired couple that have lived there for 15 years now.  Their rent is indexed to CPI and that is it.  I know I could double the rent today, but I just don't care as I never ever ever want to go through that process again.  When they finally move out I'm not sure whether I will keep it or not.
Unfortunately some people who rent are absolute human trash and should be homeless 
Bpay is the national payments standard. The law should require it is always offered as an option, no exceptions. Direct debit is not a substitute for bpay. Payments are most safely transacted as a push, not a pull.

No bpay, rent is free needs to be the rule.
They're required to offer a free method
I'm happy for people to be blacklisted for medical treatment. For example those who assult staff.
Company can blacklist for food if you been shoplifting and trashing their place. After all, they operate on a private land, and not public land.

Similar to private hospitals as well.
Because each state has seperate laws that would vary in how much they benefit landlords/tenants. You could standardise the laws, but some states may sacrifice things and the states that better protect tenants may be worse off.
>Its really undemocratic

The unaccountable and privacy-breaching blacklists are fucking awful, but I'm struggling to understand this part of your comment.
 The cost of doing business that has to be insured for. Besides all the losses are tax deductible. Its a business asset operating as a business?

I understand the anguish and disgust but any business that rents out equipment, cars or property will have to face this risk and price in this risk.

  Its not the case that you got relatives or a mate to house sit for you and then you came back and the house was wrecked. Which would be a moral and decency issue.

I am not condoning the scumbag behavior however to me this vandalism risk is no different to a fire risk or any other risk that could happen to any house that is leased out where the risk should be insured for. Risk is part of any business.
I read somewhere that: Intentional destruction of property knowing that bond doesn't cover might be a criminal offense. 

The fact that you were insured means that your premiums would now go up in the future. It isn't your fault and the tenant should be paying full rectification for it.
Unfortunately some people who are landlords are absolute human trash and should be homeless.
What a compassionate soul you are.
They sure do. They make the free method the most inconvenient, like a cheque delivered to the office 
As a nurse, it does depend on their level of capacity, depends what is wrong with them. Is it life or death?. What was their mental state? I am really not comfortable with letting people die, to be honest,
Yeah, if you're committing a crime. REAs are happy to blacklist you if you even ask for a necessary repair lol
I guess since it’s a business there is no problem charging as much as the market will bear and cycling through tenants to maximise return?
Sure.  And I'm not trying to cry poor or foul.  But I definitely think it should be possible to flag a tenant as a risk.

And just like fire risk, flood risk, or any other risks you can take steps to mitigate those risks.  

As for it being tax deductable I'm really not sure how that matters.  I still had to spend $60,000+.  It's not like the tax man gave me that money.  Sure I could offset those expenses against future earnings, but back in 2018 it equated to 4+ years of gross income, and if you exclude the capital gain on the property it would have taken me 10 years to recover those losses.

Of course though the capital gain on the property has been insane, so that is moot, but when I bought the property and went through this no one was seeing the types of increases we are seeing today.
>The cost of doing business that has to be insured for. Besides all the losses are tax deductible. Its a business asset operating as a business?

Im not a landlord, but a real business would be charging 2-3x rental prices for the risk

They would also have a more heavy handed process to vet renters, and kick out renters ASAP
Of course. But they never will be.
There are (regardless of where you stand on this topic) people who are not deserving of compassion. We see them every day on the news.

Unfortunately, they’re just as disrespectful and destructive in their (rented) homes as they are on the streets.
It varies state to state. In Vic it must be a reasonably available method. Cheque wouldn't meet that criteria
Is that not already the status quo though?
Landlords can ask for any price regardless.

Charging 2-3x market price is just a shit business model, which is why they dont.
Sounds like mental health issues- you make a valid point, we should make as many people with mental health problems homeless as possible. They deserve it.
It’s the same in NSW but the agents just shrug when you say a cheque isn’t ‘reasonably available’. It’s not their policy and do you want the place or not?

In the end it’s simpler to pay the surcharge vs the time that goes into getting and delivering a cheque.
they dont because most property are in homes of mums and dads, people have no idea how bad rental prices would get if "companies" come to dominate like they do in yanky land

People dont come to reddit to talk about the under market rentals they have, they only talk about the rental increases they get

possible 2x -3x are extreme, just getting the point across, it can go up much more
Haha funny, except not all problematic behaviors can be attributed to mental health issues. Some people simply lack empathy and consideration for others, and their actions can be harmful to those around them. These types of people include parents who neglect or abuse their children, people who engage in harmful activities instead of fulfilling their responsibilities, and those who cause physical or emotional harm to others - among many other toxic traits.

It’s important to recognize that there are people who, by their actions, contribute negatively to society. They exist, and most of us have encountered someone like this. They don’t necessarily need sympathy or a diagnosis of mental illness; some are just fundamentally inconsiderate or malicious.

The focus shouldn’t be on making these people homeless, but rather on ensuring that landlords and property owners are informed about potential tenants’ behaviors and risk profiles. This helps in making informed decisions about whom to rent to, ensuring the safety and well-being of other residents.

So yeah, we can easily shit on landlords or we can accept that every action has a reaction. Every sign that says ‘no swimming here’ or ‘don’t litter’ went there for a reason just like background checks exist because some people are complete assholes.
What does any of that have to do with blacklisting tenents though?

Milk at the local mum and pop corner store could be $50 a litre but its not because of market value. 

I dont understand the point youre trying to make.
Landlords aren't immune from being assholes. I think if we implement your rule of 'warn the landlords not to rent to bad people' can we implement a rule where a landlord acts like an asshole they forfeit their house to the tenants? 

That way we ensure to punish all the assholes?
you seem to struggle with the concept of reddit conversations running off on a tangent

the person i was replying to, created a false equivalency, i matched it with another view point
I absolutely think we could? And yeah - we should punish all of the assholes 🤷‍♂️

Unsure why you have this unnecessarily snide tone to your comments. Way to be productive 👍
Nah, I think your spaghetti brain just struggles to understand continutiy.

Never mind the fact you created a false equivalency yourself by assuming that mum and dad investmemt properties are by their nature somehow not business/ investment decisions. 

That doesnt make any sense, especially when 99% of them do whatever their property manager advises.
Interpreting tone in text is an interesting approach. 👍🤙🤙🤙👍👌👌👌
If there’s any other way to interpret the comment ‘we should make as many mental health people homeless’ I’m open to interpretation.

As it stands - that’s just how it reads. 👌👌👌✌️✌️✌️
