Mygov sucks and I hate it and I wish the government would hire people to work in branches of centrlink and Medicare and so on to help us in person.
they can easily just make sure the payee name will match.
How? APP announced something is in the works but I haven’t seen anything useable now?

Don’t say Payid because that’s not how it works.
