hello! im sorry if this is the wrong place to post this but i am DESPERATE!

my dad bought this bed frame in Australia 30ish years ago. it has these little gold balls that screw the bed together, and i need to replace some of them.

i cant find any make or brand anywhere on the bed, so im struggling to find replacements! please if you know where i can find some or what this bed is let me know. 
Maybe try r/AusDIY and r/AusRenovation
My parents have this same bed and I am pretty sure my siblings and I were all conceived in it. ðŸ¤£

Can't help with spare parts though, sorry.
You can very likely find screws/bolts that will fit the bulbhole if you take them to a hardware store; I would probably 3d print something to put over the top of the screw and paint it gold.
Check ebay for the exact length and diameter you're after

They look like bolts with a decorative end. If you remove one of the good ones and take it to bunnings, they will probably have something similar that you can use as a functional replacement.

tysm!
Although thinking outside the box, those balls are very similar to lamp components I've seen. Maybe if you search "brass lamp finials" or even "brass lamp components", you might find something compatible.
