J-Attack didn't fare that well against more seasoned competition, losing all three of his group match-ups.

However, he did manage to score some votes from the judges.
What? No roo hop or sprinkler? Uncultured.
Who the fuck decided that would be an appropriate uniform for breakdancers at the Olympics? Looks like what John Howard used to wear when going for his walks.
Why did we dress our dancers like they are about to play ODI cricket?
Now that's impressive.
Man these uniforms aren't doing them any favours...
Pfft, looks like he doesn't even have a PhD.
At least that was real breakdancing.
again with the cricket uniform 🤦‍♀️ what where they thinking sending them out with these uniforms.. at least he can dance well and got some votes
That's redemption as far as I'm concerned. That actually looked like breakdancing.
I liked this kid, he did well. The pressure for what not to be must have been huge! He’s redeemed us, I feel. At least they know someone from Australia took it seriously.
To be honest, that's pretty cool 😎
Lucky for him there was no mixed double competition!
Better than Raygun
Did get he get more than zero points?
[deleted]
Pffft. No spinkler or kangaroo!! What was he thinking!

😂
There weren’t any breakdancing competitions in Australia, so they created the 2023 Oceania Breaking Championship held at Sydney Town Hall, picking the winners to go to the Paris Olympics. There were only 37 male, and 15 female entrants. It was really a local Sydney amateur competition. No wonder the talent was so bad.
The difference between watching him lose a round 1-17, and watching the academic impostor lose a round 0-18, was huge.

This kid is raw and didn't have that expressive a performance, but he had a bunch of the staple moves on lock and looked every bit the B-Boy.

Maybe all of Rachael's endless yawning at her opponents was just to represent the yawning gap in talent and authenticity between her and her male counterpart.
I still don't think it's an Olympic sport but at least he looks like he's been doing it longer than 6 months
Yeah, but does he have a PhD?
Points deducted for not hopping like a kangaroo
Australia's redemption.
Why do all the Aussie Olympic outfits look so fucking naff, it's a god damn embarrassment. I think our skaters might have even been wearing polos?
As a casual who knows nothing about the scoring I watched this guy yesterday and was pretty impressed. He was doing the type of stuff that I wanted to see in the event. 
It’s tragic that Raygun is getting all the press. He’s good and really deserves to be highlighted, but no we’re memeong the hell out of a 36 yo professor who really shouldn’t have been there
I don't get it, he kept taking parts of his body off the ground? I thought breaking was kinda like mopping the floor with your head while crawling around.
Raygun had on her story to scrutinise him as much as we did her. 

Verdict is in;

B-Boy 👍🏻

Raygun 👎🏼
Needs more kangaroo
Yes but does he have a PHD in Breaking and teach at Macquarie Uni?

If not then he's not a real breaker.
What A great performance from a very talented Olympic athlete.🤞
I understand there is athleticism involved, but I'm not sure this needs to be an Olympic sport? Or is that just me?
Forgot his shinguards.
To my untrained eye, this is breakdancing. I applaud Raygun’s effort but it wasn’t of the standard I would expect to see at the Olympics.
Oh man I just the love how the other dancers always have to menacingly circle around the dance floor when it's not their turn
He's got nothing on RayGun
So much better than whatever the hell ‘Raygun’ was doing!
That's refreshing to see after seeing the woman's side on the Aussie team. She was trying her best to replicate a mediocre b-girl circa 1985, Midwest America. This dudes killing it.
The damage has already been done. There no coming back from this
They need to get Jonah from Tonga doing this
According to Raygun, he’s doing it wrong. 🤣😂🤣. Nice moves tho 👏👏👏
Still not great, but 100 times better then that other joke representing australia
This mf actually breakdancing compared to some others. I seen
Cricket has surely changed
Wheres the kangaroo section
Just looks like the Epping boys uniform lol
A bit more hectic then your female rep
Better than Raygun.
Raygun rocked up like "i'm gonna mop the floor with ~~my head~~ you"
Nah ya people cant distract the world from Raygun with this..
See, that's breaking, he got outdone but he is actually good, they just happened to be better. Kids 16 though, got plenty of time to make runs at b boy comps with actual credibility
Just ban Australia from breaking
I still fail to see how this is a "sport'.....
This is so good in comparison to laser gun, I don't know what the fuck she was doing
I have no idea why everyone is upset at raygun. It has provided much mirth for what is a very silly sport. Anyone who is angry needs to take a good hard look at themselves. We are all richer for having witnessed “Aunty” Raygun.
Tbf for all the hate towards Raygun, we were never going to get particularly far in breakdancing
I wonder if anybody showed this to raygun and said see this, this is break dancing…
The irony when you do an entire PHD about challenging gender stereotypes in breakdancing but the male performs better than you at the Olympics…
It's always the Filipinos coming in to sort out the mess
Na give me a middle aged woman flopping around on the floor
It’s incredible to see such young talent representing Australia on the Olympic stage! Jeff's dedication and skill at just 16 are truly impressive. Can’t wait to see where his journey in breakdancing takes him next!
What? No Kangaroo hops? Disappointed.
American Breaker here! Be proud of J-Attack! He went against an all star bracket of breakers and impressed the breaking world! We are all watching for his growth, he has incredible potential to grow even further.
But he's not slowly rolling on the ground. I don't understand.
It's nice to see someone with some musicality. So many of the bboy performances were just move after move without much thought for the music after the initial rock steps
Disappointed with the lack of 🤔 /s
He doesn't even dance like he has a PhD
good on the young fella, actually looks like he gives a shit about what he's doing, the lack of kangaroo moves is concerning however
The kid doesn’t have a phd
Did the aussie team not practice together? This dude could have helped her, shit
I was genuinely surprised when he wasnt awful.
Terrible. Where's his t-rex?! His crawling floor seizure?! Not even a limp arm pretzel... disgraceful.
This only furthers the argument that this is an art and not a sport at all.
Raydemption
Damn he sucks, he didn’t even hop like a kangaroo. Amateur hour!!
Didn’t even hold his chin once. 1/10
I'm definitely not Australian but I was entirely charmed by Raygun's performance, lol. Looked like she was just having a blast with the whole thing. Good to see the other side of things though, homie performed great!
At least he’s better than Raygun. I’m disappointed Shigekix didn’t take gold
Crazy how he looks older than me
STILL CANADA for me
Yeah but where's his Ph.D my guy???
New, flashy, crowd-pleasing steps!
Imagine Bruce Mccavany commentating this
 “ And there he goes with the double clutch bboy funk move into the head spin “
👏 Well done!
‘Cool’
I think this sub really needs to deterritorialize gender in the Olympic scene.
He can blame the uniform for the no steeze. He can break dance though.
where the kangaroo hop at?
That's more like it.
I've taken a physics class, so I know for a fact that this simply IS NOT POSSIBLE!

...but seriously, that is amazing
Not enough jumping.
Usually see this on the sub Reddit “took too much “
He did good, I think he should have won that first battle against Ukraine but he is young and nervous and went a little crazy on the power moves (air flares / windmills etc)
Now that is break dancing.
That's the coolest lawn bowler I've ever seen.
Disappointing lack of Kangaroo dance moves.
If you guys ever seen Lilou win 1st place competition in the past, this 16 years old is not even close to Lilou but just normal.
What's the deal with the second guy walking around?
https://ausbreak.org/

The website.
That's more what I remember breakdancing looking like
What does RayGun think of this kid?
Shame Breakdancing was only a one time thing, would’ve been cool to see it in the 2048 New York Olympics, get a real “come back to where it all started” feel to it, you know?
man what world is this where dancing and virtual games are compared to sports lol.
this was this biggest disaster of the modern age
They really do stick any old shite in the Olympics, huh?
Man you guys aren't escaping the raygun meme cycle by posting this.
BIG L 8 is enuff
Australian redemption arc?
I wanted to enjoy this new sport, but it's all slightly underwhelming in the context of the Olympics.
ooohh he is gettin SERVED
I don't get the sport. The french guy who lost the final seemed more fluid than the Canadian guy who won. This guy seems very good too.
Sad
Needs more Kangaroo
Breakdance in the Olympics was dope. I believe those dancers don't care about laws of physics.
Everybody liked that..
People actually watched this?
Well at least he can breakdance and quite damn well.
I mean it's better but still not good enough. I see kids at the local skatepark break better
Petition to hold Anna Meares accountable for this embarrassment. How bad can you fuck something up, let alone at an Olympic level
I understand ,every move IS designed to kill a type of Spider  XDDDD
When you've seen one you've seen them all
That was cool bro can dance.
Sure, now do it bald
Team Australia uniforms look like they’re lifted from the cricket team.
When did breakdancing get added to the Olympics? It just makes me think of all the early 2000’s dance movies but I guess at that time, winning Olympic gold wasn’t really a goal
Are you guys seriously into dancing as an Olympic sport?
He did a great job!

it requires athleticism... but is it a sport? does it belong in the olympics? does it belong in something else? (IMO it was an attempt at a "get the young n cool kids" to make up for an aging viewer demo. I think lots of those attmpts have been fails - this, some of the skateboarding, for instance)
The lad represented well!
Who won out of the two country’s ?
I don't really have much to comment on the skillfulness of the competitors, but the weirdest thing for me is probably the silence in the background save for the occasional "ohh!". Because at the beginning don't they announce the match up exactly like a show down? For then to be cricket level silence seems like the wrong energy and probably why breakdancing is a bad fit for Olympics in general.

Just my two cents of course.
No kangaroo hop or piking on the floor like a fish out of water.
Finally some real creative DANCING in BreakDANCE
Dr Raygun 4 life!
If I hadnt seen the Japanese guys routine first id be a lot more impressed.
I don’t know much about it. But this looks decent
The representation we need.  well done sonny.
Ohhh so this is what Break Dancing is.
Not as good as Raygun .
You can laugh , but she is on “Dancing With The Stars” this week .
2 points across three matches. The guy is just as bad as raygun.
And they're trying to tell us Raygun was the best female? The delusion is apocalyptic
Sad and funny at the same time
E
Raygun ruined it for me!
We'll comeback in 4 years and win.
lol full kit wanka nerd. But at least this one actually break dances. The other one just kinda squirm around on the floor.
Maybe some ballroom, tango, Cha Cha etc dancing would be better suited for Olympic dancing, this looks a bit naff. How do you even judge that, multiple foot on leg, head drag, spinny thing, left right stomp with baggy trousers , check.
He also managed to, you know, breakdance.
He looks good. Being competitive and beaten by better opponents is no knock on this guy
No wonder, he didn't even throw in a kangaroo or the sprinkler!
Yeah sucks that he got matched up against ultimately the silver & gold medalists and the Ukrainian guy who’s old school… I’d imagine if he was matched against anyone else he probably would’ve won a couple matchups
Well, this looks a lot better and more fluid than what Raygun offered. I know, this is not an easy sport and I don’t want to bash Raygun. 

But this performance from J-Attack was good, fluid maybe a bit to repetitiv . Winning a match isn’t easy at all, so there is no shame in loosing!

But the uniforms are not a boon to the athletes.To clean and every possible mistake can be spotted easily.


Edit: added a „not“
Hey he did a much better job than the chick trying out the fish out of water.
Two. He got two votes.
More importantly he didn't disgrace himself or his Country!
And he didn’t look like he was having a seizure while doing it
He didn't do this thing either :🤔
Lmao pointing at Australia logo on the shirt then do the Kangaroo is peak
The cricket team had some leftover outfits.
I think having the same colour top and bottom was definitely the wrong decision. Cause it makes them look curved when posing and makes it look sloppy and lazy
It's retro man
John Howard had drip.
Should have been an oversized mambo shirt with Maui & Sons loose fit jeans. Long SMP belt just in case.
At least it wasn't Tony Abbots Budgie Smugglers!
It's in honour of Shane Warne
He's got  better moves than Raygun .

Ha ha, brilliant
Yeah at least chuck them a Kangol bucket hat
Theres a delivery/shipping service called black cat in Japan and those are basically the drivers uniforms lmao
ASICS have sold us short this Olympics
Olympics has always been super goofy, I like it.
Unfortunate for breakers but it’s a uniform sponsorship thing which other countries did not have for the smaller sports.
Hot take: the clothing design aside, green and gold is an awful colour scheme combination. There's a reason it's unique and not for good reasons. I wish Australia would don navy blue more often in sports.

Off the top of my head, I can only think of one other sporting team that uses green and gold and that's Norwich City FC in football.
Oh my god it totally does
The best description thanks for the giggle
🤣 hahaha John howard
Aussie kit is embarrassing throughout. The other countries really showed up
Pretty sure the breakers could wear whatever they wanted. No one else had any sort of uniform only Australia.
Cricket is in the next Olympics. Maybe it’s easier to already have a uniform designed?
Because the lawn bowling uniforms weren’t available.
Apparently the group that sends our break dancers to the Olympics is actually a ballroom dancing group that just settled for breakdancing when they couldn't get their preferred comp added. 

Or something like that, clusterfuck regardless.
As a Kiwi, I've always admired how well Australia does at the Olympics, but this has made Australia look ridiculous.
that's what I was thinking
I wonder if he was voted down because of what he wore. 

I watched his set and even though it’s not my thing, he seemed to be good at it.
Tug life. Breaking in Paris on the weekend. Mon to Fri at Subway.
At 16, he doesn't even have a HSC 😭
Bahahaha
Probably most Australians were too heartbroken by then to watch him though.  Unlucky timing for him.
I couldn't name one other break dancer in the Olympics, but Raygunn is going to live on in Australian history for generations....so who's the real winner?
I'm not watching much of the olympics, but this seemed so much better than the ones I've seen shared on reddit... not just the most infamous one.
Same with the skateboarding kit, just looks like gift shop crap. I loved the other skaters fits, they could have gone really wild with it
Australia has always battled HARD with our uniforms in every Olympics.


Green and gold doesn't help.


But yeah. Shocker.
Yeah this looks perfectly respectable imo
Yeah the kid has the entire nations reputation on his shoulders - must have been scary just seeing all the discussion on his compatriot
mixed double is referred to as "bonnie and clyde" in the breakin scene.
I spat my water out at this comment 😂
Someone who didn't learn the skill 2mins before funding applications 😳 This is so comforting. Embarrassment reduce. I was a skater and breaker 30yrs ago. Both have struggled to be seen as legit. Especially in Australia (Xgen skaters will remember being chased off, arrested, beaten and all socially acceptable). Australia finally had a true opportunity for youthful sport (20yrs too late) and we sent....I dunno...Karen's niece cause she filed paperwork(?). Shame 🔔 SHAME 🔔 SHAME 🔔. 
Ps credit to the dedicated competitor seen here. 
Pps defending the female competitor under question for their skills, I feel is kinda sexist. We've got female breakers that'd crap on that performance with 10mins prep.
My dog rolling around in its own shit in the grass is better than RayGun.
That's Raygun, PhD thank you very much mate.
That's Doctor of breakdancing to you... 🤦‍♂️
Ray gun is the true Aussie hero
He got two.
Yes he did
He had 2 judges vote a routine as better than one of his competitors out of his 3 matches. Pretty decisive losses, but he definitely showed that he deserved to be there.
2 out of 54
I love how that's the standard Aussies go for
Respectable performance.
Molly should have won. And even she probably isn’t Olympic material.
Breaking in the Olympics is a contentious topic in the community. Most chose not to enter.
This just further shows how shit the scoring was in the olympics, raygun obviously deserved 0 but this guy should have had more than 1.
So you’re starting to notice the “everything by committee” mentality we have here which is where cool goes to die a painful embarrassing death.
Soccer jerseys seem cook to me
More tragic is that the female breaker from the refugee team is being overshadowed by all this. She’s an Afghani that fled her country when it fell to the Taliban and used her moment on the world stage to reveal a cape that said ‘FREE AFGHAN WOMEN’, presumedly knowing it would get her disqualified. Unfortunately her message hasn’t gotten nearly as much press as Raygun 😕
> we’re memeong the hell out of a 36 yo professor who really shouldn’t have been there

No one made her enter the qualifying...
> Raygun had on her story to scrutinise him as much as we did her.

You are kidding me

>scrutinise

It was to scrutinise the outfit from the aussie bboy. And both are still garbage. Seriously looks like left over kit from the Cricket ODI team
Your just posting outrage bait. She said she hopes the men's outfits gets scrutinised as much as hers was.
I would normally agree, but it’s no less ridiculous than dressage equestrian.
For me it's less about whether or not it's athletic (i think it is) but more whether or not there are developed enough rules, ways of measuring and comparing performance, and depth of judges to ensure the competition has the right level of integrity. 

The vast majority of olympic sports are incredibly black and white in terms of how they are measured and judged. And those that are not largely have a fairly mathematical system to measure and compare performance. 

If everyone was required to perform certain key moves, and there was an objective way to agree on how to score those moves, that would help. Now it feels too subjective. 

Yes I know rhymic gymnastics exist etc but I think for such a relatively new sport, it's not the same and it kind of dilutes the integrity of many of the other sports. 

The Olympics needs a refresh, cool, but stapling on a social media friendly sport is a bit "how do you do my fellow kids"
Certainly not the way they're judging it. Doesn't make any sense.
I imagine they're trying to find thing the kids are into, but the people making the decisions are so old that what they think kids are into is 30+ years out of date.
Probably why it's not going to be a sport at the LA 2028 olympics
"some" athletics is also in downhill skiing and that is in Olympics as well.
It's hard to say, by that metric any competition that requires a panel of judges to determine a winner shouldn't be in the olympics. How is it different to figure skating, synchronised swimming, diving, gymnastics?
It's [not just you](https://www.smh.com.au/sport/insulting-the-sport-dragged-into-the-olympics-without-its-consent-20240715-p5jtu4.html).
Its true as nealy everyone even the gold medal winners will be forgotten but RayGun will live on forever in our memory
What’s been seen cannot be unseen
I don't even care if you send me back to Tonga. There's mad break-dancers in Tonga.
They were both selected from the same qualifying event….
I think it was pretty great, I guess not best in the world win a medal great, but pretty damn great.
only 3 points better really
Still not great? Boy didnt miss a single move. No stale movement and he was very fluid.
There’s a difference between not winning a medal and scoring zero points though
36 is middle aged?
That's his opponent. They move around a bit while waiting. Sometimes observing their moves or making some psych out gestures.
Anna Meares is the *chef de mission* - the team's official spokesperson and main point of contact between the team and the organisers. She has no say in any team selection. The President of the Australian Olympic Committee is Ian Chesterman. If people want someone to yell at start with him.
Which moron selected Raygun to represent Oz?
Yes but Raygun will be remembered for decades to come and he will be forgotten =P
Yeh, but does he have a PhD in breakdancing!?
Now THAT is Hip Hop
Whats the past tense of breakdance? breakdanced? brokedance? brokedanced?
Exactly, young, a bit raw but to get up on a world stage and do this, kudos to this young person! Represented us with dignity and actual care for his sport.
>But the uniforms are a boon to the athletes.To clean and every possible mistake can be spotted easily.

Sounds like you're using the term boon to mean the exact opposite of what it actually means.
I mean men’s breakdancing is much stronger than the women in general. Hiro10s round made it seem like a different event than the women’s section
The amount of jokes I've seen about how awful Raygun is from people who couldn't do a pushup is hilarious, certainly funnier than "Hurr hurr she no breakdance good".

Like don't get me wrong, it is a funny situation we find ourselves in. I myself made a joke about how art makes us feel things and Raygun's performance certainly elicited some type of feelings lol. But there was also sincerity in that statement, and I think people too often mistake clowns for actual morons, which disrespects the work that clowns put in. I acknowledge the possibility that I am mistaking a moron for a clown, but I choose to stay on this side of the fence.
For being a country that's apparently laid back we sure are getting into a tizzy about this
Don't disrespect the raygun!
He only has his associates degree.
So the foreigners don't confuse it with Austria.
From the 99 World Cup
The Hoggy
Just realised it's basically a onesie!
And he DJs like a sick cunt

Edit: I now remember that it’s mad cunt and this is potentially the most embarrassing moment of my life
And that gangster walk, bout to drop 10% GST on yo ass
Could DJ like a mad cunt too.
Mostly post-nasal.
Rizz.

Or should that be skibadee? :)

No cap!

I dunno, I'm retired... and DNGAF.

But in the 80s, breakdancing (as it was called then) was a LOT more like what J Attack is doing than what Dr Raygun did.

Kudos for them both in making the grade, but... seriously, Olympics? What the actual...?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLh9QqAxq9s
I have better moves than Raygun durin the REM phase of my sleep.
Oh, is that why America is suddenly interested in playing cricket.
Ya the more I read about it the more it sounds like the sabatoged this whole thing and think its hilarious. I mean technically it is hilarious but probably not if any tax payer money went to this.
Watch the other dancers routines, what is inherently clear to the other dancers and everyone else when watching Australia’s match-ups is that Australia’s competitors were not nearly as physically fit as their opponents who seem to be struggling far less and executing longer maneuvers with higher intensity.

They both obviously weren’t brand new dancers and you could tell they had experience, but it seems like they didn’t realize the seriousness other break dancers from other countries take physical fitness and body building outside of dancing. Most dancers I know lift, religiously. These were good dancers but they very obviously forgot the “athlete” part of the olympics.
he didn’t score as well because he didn’t have as much musicality and there were some little mistakes (like his hand slipped during a freeze in the video). He was insanely impressive, especially for being 16, and I can’t wait to see what he does in the future
Why would he have one anyway even at 18? He’s from Queensland, it would be a QCE or whatever 😉
They all cringed their way into the closest kangaroo pouch after Raygun
Live in Australian history as a joke and an embarrassment. That's not winning, IMO. If she was deliberately taking the piss then yea sure legend status, but from her statements, she was dead serious about it.
Raygun is at least self aware:

"I was never going to beat these girls on what they do best, the dynamic and the power moves, so I wanted to move differently, be artistic and creative because how many chances do you get in a lifetime to do that on an international stage?

"I was always the underdog and wanted to make my mark in a different way."
Our skateboarders looked like they had to cobble together their own uniform 😢

They did a great job though! So much fun to watch.
Aussie uniforms always look like shit idk why our representing bodies are allergic to style 
I love our uniforms generally, the colours are really distinctive!

But this... this is a polo shirt and the type of pants I wore when I was a kid trying to look cool. Compare it to what everyone else was wearing. It was shitty.
On the other hand, she set the bar below sea level. Even if he performs badly, unless it's actually memeably bad people are just going to keep clowning on Raygun, and if he performs well he's a national hero lmao
You made me spit wine on my sock.
But that's a pretty high bar don't you think?
This is pure poetry.
Raygun for PM.
Good thing she stayed in school, yes.
This is an important point. Breaking is a pretty explicitly anti-establishment culture, and the Olympics is pretty much peak Establishment.
Nah, he came up against a very strong opponent and it was pretty fair. (Not sure if he snagged more points in his following two battles).

What's unfair is that Rachael couldn't get a negative score.
From my quick Google read the points are based on a judge saying they were better than the other person. So a unanimous decision means that person gets 0.
How do other countries do it?
that's probably specific to Australia though I'm sure other countries featured her more
And she knew what would happen her PHD was on this topic so she knew she had no chance. She chose to not just embarrass herself but embarrass Australia. She doesn't deserve sympathy it was her choice.
They literally are. Or they can't read. She said she hopes the men's outfits get as scrutinised as her was. Didn't mention anything about ability.
Honestly if you think you're getting unfair abused asking people to abuse another person is pretty fucked.
On her insta might still be there…
They’re being disingenuous 

She had on her insta that she wondered if people would scrutinise the fact he chose to compete wearing his Aus tracksuit as much as they did her 

Not him. Not his performance.
Or race walking lol, they don’t even follow their own rules
Especially if it's not the horse up on the podium receiving the medal
Or synchro swimming.
Dressage is at least based on Ancient Greek horsemanship and relevant (to them, at the time) military shit. So it sorta fits with the whole concept of the Olympics.

Breakdancing, not so much. 
Hell parkour would've been a better event at the Paris Olympics, but nah...
Each olympics the hosts get to pick 4 (or 3?) extra sports of their choosing. Breaking was one of France’s extras, so it’s not so much out of the olympics as just not been selected next time.
Different judges?
He got beaten by the silver and gold medallists.

The third guy that beat him didn't make finals, but he was the only dancer to take a round against the eventual gold medallist in the entire comp.

I didn't watch, but on paper, that sounds like he got slapped with a damned hard draw.
Dancesport Australia. They traditionally have managed ballroom, which explains a bit. 

News articles seem to be saying they took charge of breaking when it became clear they wouldn't get ballroom the Olympics, and breaking didn't have an obvious existing governing body
I’m just annoyed seeing raygun at the olympics that was my chance, I have never even attempted break dancing but I know I could do better that that rubbish
I want to see the athletes she beat out to make the team
She appointed herself!
Apparently she was the winner of the Oceania Qualifying tournament. Here's the finals: https://youtu.be/MorhA98eK7M?si=XsC69mmbhRrxLFSZ
Eric the Eel says very true.
Nah we’ll remember him as saving Australia from looking like complete idiots. Imagine if they were both as bad as her…
If you’re gonna lose, lose BIG. Lose in style. Lose memorably.
Definitely a bane and not a boon
Yeah I was so confused by what they meant. A boon is a gift, a blessing!
I think he meant 'the uniforms are a booo-urn to the athletes'.
Yeah, honestly most of the women were unimpressive.  Raygun gets all the negativity, but there were a few others that were barely better. 
Still, better than I could do, haha
Better and more deserving candidates were passed over for a middle aged privileged white uni lecturer. People are pretty right to be annoyed at this absolutely shameful display of nepotism make a fool of us on the international stage.
Let the record stand that he DJs like a *mad* cunt.
One of my favourite pictures of all time
* Mad cunt
These Olympics are the culmination of this 30 year plan
Took rotten veg to the face like a champ
Raygun did something more akin to interpretive dance.  J Attack is killing it for his age man. 

 I'm actually interested to see how he'd do in the next few years at other comps (and I don't normally watch breakdance comps).

I don't buy the misogynist argument against Rachael Gunn either.  The other women in the competition absolutely killed it, even Lithuania was smashing it.  I honestly thought Rachael Gunn was taking the piss on purpose [until I looked back on the last few years of her competitive stuff](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrcrlXx4j24) and it was just more of the same.

[Compared to this from 2018 with (FR vs JP) San Andrea vs. Ami](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmoCdid5P2E)

[or this from 2015 Aus vs Phil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2CdPt2W5r8)
When you're losing your religion
My epileptic uncle would have tied with her during a seizure and he would have a chance of beating her if he seized on beat.
I don't know where you're hearing this, but there is 0 interest in cricket over here. Pickleball is about the only thing with new traction over here.
Honestly still pretty funny.
Definitely the bigger difference to me was that J Attack was just firing off moves with very little musicality. Especially in his first battle he seemed to have zero timing for the most part.

Some of the other competitors didn't even need any particularly physical moves but their sense of timing and actual creativity was so much better.
Ohh right, I thought HSC was the generic term for all of the year 11/12 credentials.
Talk of a narcissist asshole, if you can’t do a sport just step aside, don’t make a mockery of it
His competitors won the gold and the silver. So kudos for what he accomplished.
In the USA they just let Nike tell them what to wear, which means you gotta wear useless sunglasses, arm sleeves and other accessories Nike wants people to think are cool enough to buy.
Via committee that don’t have a core instruction to not offend any single person on earth, be inclusive of every single person on earth and basically lead to every out come being so bland that it offends every humans sense of common sense. Basically saying we are now a country that is to scared to take any risks of offending anyone in the slightest that all aspects are committified to death producing outcomes that no one is really happy with.
Nope
That's still some really lame deflection. Own your shit; you were unqualified and the Olympics isn't academia where the right word salad justifies everything. She should take the fucking L and maybe reflect a bit on whether it's appropriate for her to have shown up to Have A Go.
If you dance like that, and interpret the rightful disdain at your supposedly olympic-level performance as "abuse", then you are every bit the dorky white lady cultural tourist people suspect you to be.
Intrestingly the same thing that happened with DanceSport and breakdancing is happening with Parkour. 

DanceSport took ownership once breakdance got included because breakdancing didn’t have an orginisation or any official body. 

Gymnastics is trying to take over parkour so it can be included under gymnastics.
Yeah I'd watch that. Or competitive tag
Different levels of competition between men and women
Just cause he got beat, doesnt mean it cant be pretty great? These are Olympic level competitors
Did Dancesport Australia not consider contacting anyone from the breaking community?
Was it mandatory for them to enter her?
Can you do a meme where is the old cunt from strictly ballroom going you can't do that to Paul mercurio
I've been wondering who the NSO is and that explains it.

Most likely the grass roots where the breakers hang out are not at all connected with the sporting body that Ausport believes is governing the sport.
Hold on…. She is trained in ballroom and only started breakdancing a few years ago.

This is getting weirder.
They were trying to ruin it. 

I’m telling y’all!
Apparently she was a ballroom dance which explains the link to Dance Australia
I just read on an article on this. The Ballroom org, was that just in Australia or was that an international thing?
>They traditionally have managed ballroom, which explains a bit.

I manage neither ballroom nor breakdancing. I'm not involved at all in any sort of dancing. But even to a layman's eyes this was a horrendous disaster of a performance. I would expect to see more breakdancing at a random beginner-intermediate class somewhere in Australia.
Gunn entered in the circuit of breaking in 2010. She is currently managing her job as a lecturer along with her breakdancing. She is also a former jazz and ballroom dancer.

They probably picked her because of her incredible talent 😂😂 and not because she's somebodys daughter. You know how them circles work

Thats the most important point.  A stronger dancer was prevented from participating….
I've never understood fomo until now.  It should have been me.
Watch literally the first 2 minutes of ‘the big break’ on nine now and you’ll see.
Here is the final battle: https://youtu.be/MorhA98eK7M?si=XsC69mmbhRrxLFSZ
He became coach of the national swimming team after that. So we all know where Raygun is headed.
> Nah we’ll remember him as saving Australia from looking like complete idiots.

I guarantee by the time next Olympics comes, everyone will forget about him. There's just no reason for a non-break dancing individual to remember him or the Olympic event (its not repeating)
Calm down. It's breakdancing.


The raygun is much more fun.


We've just had our best Olympics ever, so we can take the hilarious L on this one.
I’m so ashamed. Honestly, just revoke my citizenship at this point.
Oath!, it was always mad.
Oh yeah, shit.
I admit to being unimpressed with Raygun, sadly.

This music video from 2001 has far better break dancing, in my opinion.

[https://youtu.be/gLCduDJVksc?t=124](https://youtu.be/gLCduDJVksc?t=124)

Meh, not my scene, perhaps the scene has moved on a LOT since I was last watching break dancing (sorry, I can't honestly call it 'breaking', that just sounds silly to old retired me...)
Our part time cricket team (seriously the captain is a JavaScript programmer) beat Pakistan once and suddenly everyone in Southeast Asia thinks cricket is undergoing an American renaissance. Meanwhile almost no one in America has ever watched a game (seriously it’s even more boring to watch than baseball).
I think it’s because they are genuinely struggling to physically keep up with the pace of the choreography. it looks random but it’s jus tall delayed, because both Australian competitors couldn’t keep up with the physical demands of their already simple routines. 

Again not saying they are amateurs but definitely should have been more aware of their limitations before representing an entire nation.
Spotted the New South Welshman…

Yeah I guess “HSC” is a generic name for them all but most of the states have “StateName Certificate of Education” as the name for the high school leavers’ certification and NSW is the odd one out. I have a VCE and know people with SACEs and WACEs.
Right? If she wanted to be involved, she should've just tried to help look for an actual breakdancer and sponsor them instead
right? if her phd in breakdancing or whatever is worth the paper it's printed on she'd know NOT to do what she did and let someone more serious take the spot. her ego and glorylust got in the way of respecting the sport she claims to care so much about
Damn that sucks. I'd rather parkour be handled by sport climbing (IFSC). At least they're used to a competition stage that constantly changes.
Competitive tag would be awesome.
Surely the women aren't that far behind...?
Seemingly not.
They are a ballroom dancing body - They have no idea what the fuck they're supposed to be looking for.
They held a competition last year and she won the women's competition for entry to the Olympics.

Some other competitors then tried at an international qualifier competition and came last.

Not sure if our dancers are less experienced at competition, or our experienced dancers just didn't know the competitions were on?
Total conjecture - I assume they could've sent no one, but they may also have had a fair few 'real' breakdancers boycotting them and pickings might've been slim
My understanding was that there was a competition or something to determine who would go to the Olympics, she came first for the women
It wasn’t mandatory to send anyone for the event. 

Breaking was an optional / exhibition event, like flag football at the next games
Raygun has written papers saying she doesn’t think breaking should be in the Olympics and doesn’t agree with how the governing body judges. I’m holding my breath that this was an intentional troll by her to bring attention to the hidden BS

[Link to her paper](https://intellectdiscover.com/content/journals/10.1386/ghhs_00078_1)
This thread took quite the turn here!!
Not really how it works. They held a qualifying event and she won it, apparently because no-one better than her bothered.
phrasing lol
100%

I very much doubt that the established ballroom organisation would've gone out of their way to give voice to breakers
If you look at her Instagram you can also see she won sportsman of the year from Pedestrian TV. She was also featured on the cover of K-zone magazine and had numerous interviews prior to this where she was hyped up. She clearly knows people and has the right connections. I know many people who are much better and have been at their chosen sport much longer and never get a single piece of recognition. 

I really hope someone delves deeper into this as I’d love to know who she knows.
I mean, did you watch her...attempt? It was pretty obvious.
It’s the story from breakin the movie!
World, by the looks - olympics.com/IOC/recognised-international-federations/world-dancesport-federation

So the IOC (Olympics people) recognised world dancesport as the sports overall federation, and Aus dancesport was already recognised as the Aussie governing body for dancesport. No clue if dancesport in other countries were already across breaking or if they just did a better job of consulting people who were
I'd expect to see more breakdancing if you randomly selected some 6 years olds and played them an inspo video
News dot com is cancer.
100% . This is what gets me. She took someone’s spot because she thinks she deserves it. And then she’s complaining about how oppressed she is like stfu
Eric the Eel was hilarious initially but then truly inspirational. He had only ever practised in a 13m hotel swimming pool. There were no swimming pools in Equatorial Guinea. The first time he ever saw a 50m body of water was when it was presented to him at the Olympics. He knew he couldn't do it. South African swimming coach saw it too and stepped in to help him. Then suddenly 2 miss starts and he's doing it by himself in front of the world. The rest is history.

Equatorial Guinea now has a 50m swimming pool. And he's a legend.
I agree with the positivity but that doesn't change the fact that literal thousands of better performers missed out on a HUGE opportunity like this just so that salmon could flop around upstream.
T20 cricket is absolutely not more boring to watch than baseball. Test cricket? I won’t start that fight, even though I love it… but as an Aussie living in the USA, I’ve watched my fair share of both, and T20 cricket is 100% more fun to watch than baseball.
Can we get Red Bull to take over parkour? I feel like that's a pretty solid fit.
They probably are? Breaking is hugely male dominated. And then even if it were equal the make competition would be more impressive due to the athleticism.
Barry Fife says there are NO NEW STEPS!
Probably bombed the shit on purpose because they hoped that something like this would happen and ball room dancing would be picked next.
So how come all of us can tell Raygun is shit at breakdancing?
Many of our Olympians tend to be connected to universities or official bodies. Since there's no official body for Breaking in Australia, unis were the next place to source.

Problem is that the majority of people that Break tend to be from an urban culture that doesn't necessarily overlap with uni in Australia.

Basically, Australia had no idea where to look and no idea what to look for then went to the usual sourcing grounds bam, we have a 36 yr old testament to theory vs practice
Our qualifying competitions are also run by the ballroom dancers. They had to make up a scoring system for a style of dance they don't really know anything about nor care about.
Or our experienced dancers can't actually participate in international competitions due to low level convictions. 

Not a slight against them but something some of our best have mentioned as to the reason they don't bother with the big tournaments
>Some other competitors then tried at an international qualifier competition and came last.

>Not sure if our dancers are less experienced at competition, or our experienced dancers just didn't know the competitions were on?

White people.

They also probably took some money from the government and then did the bare minimum with no advertising so they could pay themselves well. Absolutely a huge blunder on the governing bodies part to let a clear conflict of interest like a completely different dance sport that is culturally on the EXACT opposite end of the spectrum from break dancing run it, they probably were pissed they didn't get ball room dancing and sabatoged the break dancing on purpose.
Makes sense.
RedBull’s BC One which is arguably the peak breaking competition internationally was holding their Australian Cyphers today in Melbourne and other Capitals in the coming weeks, so it’s not unrealistic for our serious breaking talent to have made a calculated decision to skip the Olympics for BC One qualification.

Totally possible that the real breakers boycotted because of Dancesport Aus too.
You can win a national title and not qualify for the Olympics in plenty or maybe all other sports, she shouldn’t have competed at this level
She's also written her PHD thesis on "Intersectionality of Gender and Breakdancing". Exactly the kind of person that would get you hyped up by media and the likes
No, someone who was even half-adept at dance, of any style, would have done better than she did. There was no isolation. No core strength. No awareness of body position. No general control over her movements at all.
Yes. What I mean is the connection between her background as a ballroom dancer, and dance sport Australia selecting her is very odd. 

She clearly is not a good breakdancer so why did she get selected? How is her relationship with dance sport Australia?

Whole thing is just weird.
I reckon they should have sent in Tina Sparkle
I can't stop thinking about this movie because of this situation 😂😂😂

"What's wrong with the way I dance" 😂😂
I can’t be the only deviant who always thinks of this when I hear ‘Strictly Ballroom’ - ‘My steps my way Fran! You know what I said about the dance of love not being real, well it is freal ran! Go with your heart, go with your heart!’ Very NSFW (or 2024): https://youtu.be/3t6Gsg6l_oQ?si=dukDuiRYKikgJ15g

ETA it’s even better because the line where Tim goes *full* Strictly Ballroom is ‘there was a bone of contention about her gender’ and she’s written multiple papers about gender and breaking.
I just wanted to dance at the Pan Pacifics…
And Fab 5 Freddy told me everybody’s fly.
“Your our ringer, see? We just need you to do so bad that it makes everyone on earth unanimously agree that breakdancing isn’t a legitimate sport.” 

“What if my dancing is so awful it ruins Australian international relations for the next fifty years? What if it makes us the laughingstock of the Olympics?”

“Impossible. No one can dance that bad.” 

“Hold my beer.”
There's a movie in there somewhere
These are people that think ballroom dancing deserves to be in the Olympics - Their judgement is questionable.
I don't know about breakdancing, but didn't her act look like a kangaroo getting repeatedly tasered, and transformed into a water sprinkler?
There are very few formal breaking competitions in Australia. We also don’t support it financially at all. And certainly didn’t dedicate any meaningful resources to identifying or developing talent for a one off Olympic demonstration.
well i dont care about ballroom dancing so there
Is that the case though? The Netherlands sent a convicted child rapist, since he already did his time apparently it's ok :/
How do you literally have a PHD on breakdancing and not include Dr. in your breakdance name?
This is the thing that got me. Her absolute lack of core and upper body strength. Each time she'd try a freeze, she just kinda cancelled halfway because she realised she couldn't pull it off and bucked like an angry bronco.
She qualified through the OCE breakdance qualifier
Sparkle Motion would have been a good addition to the Olympics.
Ken Railings would have absolutely killed it
You watch, Mick Malloy will star in the biopic.
Why do they think ballroom dancing deserves to be an Olympic sport?
That’s because as a citizen of the Netherlands he’s also a citizen of the EU and as such cannot be denied entry into a fellow EU country
Someone from the Netherlands wouldn't require a visa to go to Paris.
The IOC think smoking weed is really bad but noncing is fine.
I think she had a breakdance name BEFORE the PHD.
It would just be too much. Raygun is a cool (-ish) name. Doctor raygun is a name for a crappy villain that gets killed in the first minutes of a James Bond parody.
Yeah, agreed. I mean she didn’t bother to even get fit.
Sometimes I question (their) commitment to Sparkle Motion.
I suppose the same reason people think breakdancing deserves to be.
Snoop was there
