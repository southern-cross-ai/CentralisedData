absolutely insane 🥇
Imagine going back to school as an Olympic gold medallist. What a legend
Absolute legend. Had to pull out the big score on the final run and smashed it.

All of the competitors are legends though. Actively cheering each other on and being supportive if it doesn't go to plan. Coaches picking each other up when it goes great. Most positive vibes of any sport at the games.
someone born in 2010 has an Olympic medal, that's crazy I feel so old
Her parents promised her a pet duck if she won the Gold.
Big year for Arisa, she also won two gold medals at the 2024 X-games. Also Australia has the youngest X-games gold with 9 year old Mia Kretzer, who won this years Vert Best trick. 


Hopefully local government see this and starts taking skatepark design seriously.
Holy shit what a little legend, you absolutely love to see it, that was epic.
Unbelievable composure from our 14 year old new golden girl. Well done Arisa.🥇🇦🇺
Wild how it seemed like the oldest person in that comp was 18.
If I had a nickel for every time a half Japanese girl from Queensland won a gold medal in an extreme sport in Paris I'd have two nickels. 

Awesome gold from Arisa was such a crazy run to grab gold, can't believe we're third atm
AND she's riding a Hosoi!
the first skibidi toilet rizz gold medalist?
Amazing performance from Arisa!! 🥇🇦🇺
Worth staying up for!
That last run was incredible.  

So glad I stayed up to watch it live.
Absolutely epic! Another female grabs gold! 

14 year old brings our 14th gold at Paris Olympics!
Absolute legend 🇦🇺
Edit: **gold** medalist 👍
Outstanding run! Amazing effort Arisa.
Anyone got a video link of her competing?
Amazing to see we have a 14 year old gold medalist. Truly remarkable young woman.
One for the Trew believers!
I woke up at 02:30 and couldn’t get back to sleep last night, flicked on the tele and watched this girl. Looked her up by name and saw she was born in the same city as I live in - cairns. How good. She hadn’t even peaked yet either, definitely won a fan in me last night
awesome young lady congrats abd keep up the hard work 🤘
I just heard her Dad's interview on the radio and to hear the pride and emotion in his voice was so beautiful
Australia should put more money into skateboarding, bmx etc. 

If they are thinking medals for money spent, this is a pretty good bet with these sports being quite popular and the games coming up in Brisbane.
Clutched up on the final run. Had to make that single run the best of the competition and she did. Gotta respect that
I remember feeling old when athletes born in the 2000s starting competing and doing well, and now someone born in the 2010s has gold lol.
Specifying 84 days makes me wonder if there another 14 year old with more days with a medal
I’m so happy Japan introduced skateboarding into the Olympics. Glad it’s being recognised as a serious competitive sport!
Makes me proud to be an Australian skateboarder 🥲 I remember getting picked on at school for being a skateboarder about 14 years ago, and being told by teachers at school that it wasn't a real sport. Now people born between now and then are winning gold. Incredible.

 I've ragged on competitive skateboarding in the past and been dubious on it being added to the Olympics, but it's amazing to see people (especially young people) given the opportunity to train and compete at such a high standard. Well done Arisa.
She killed it! What a champ! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
Medals are cool.... but ducks? Ducks are legit
Best part is her folks told her if she won gold she gets a pet duck
This really was awesome to watch! They all did amazing and were so positive to each other. So many achievements for Arisa this year, its incredible
When I was her ag,e skateboarding was the domain of scary older kids that spent their time smoking, drinking and fighting younger kids on Rollerblades. I'd love to know what those losers are doing with their lives now while this kid 540s past them with her new pet duck.
Not only did she win a gold medal, but she single-handedly beat France on the medal tally.
Not only youngest medallist, but a gold too.

Bloody tip tip effort.
Same girl to be the first female to do the 900 on vert now Australia's youngest ever Olympic gold medalist. When people talk about peaking in highschool, it no longer seems like a diss.

Well done Arisa, you have done everyone and yourself so proud.
Heading should read “GOLD” medallist
I'm 30 in October and have done jack all with my life, this makes her even more amazing imo.
Can any skaters explain to me how kids have ended up dominating skating at the olympics? 

Are there better and/or more famous skaters that just don't go to the olympics?
Yeah, the girls!
why did they have to put days 😭😭😭
This was the most incredible moment for me in Australian sport! Absolutely stoked for her and the skate community
Exciting times for women’s skateboarding in Australia
So glad they added this to the Olympics. It was a blast to watch and some of the best sportsmanship I’ve ever seen
Talent
Absolute trooper
Congratulations, Arisa! 💪 🏅
Awesome skater, smashed it!
She's everything I wanted to be as a little girl. How awesome 👊
It blows my mind that someone so young could be so talented they could be Olympic level at 14.
Reading this story made me so happy. What a little champion, she’s wonderful
She’s a local from where I currently reside, the whole town is pretty chuffed! What a feat.
her parents raised her well.
The former holder of the youngest Australian gold medalist who held it for 68 years was Sandra Morgan beavis. Who is my grandma. She is so happy that Arisa was able to win gold and hand over the record to this amazing young lady. I never thought it would be broken. But my grandma always told me that if someone was ever to break it she would so excited and proud of them
Does she still get the payout the 18+ receive for winning gold?
Congratulations
An amazing level of skill, courage and sportsmanship, and Tony Hawk was there to watch!
Damnit I fell asleep after her first run when she stacked it
That's awesome!!
AMAZING!!!!!!
Good gurl Arisa, good gurl!
You beauty!!!!!
Go Girl!!
Wicked! 🛹🥇
Come on aussie come on 🇦🇺🇦🇺
You go, girl.
Wow, she’s absolutely awesome❤️
What did she placed at? I watched a bit & she was fifth
All Olympic skating gold medals in this event are now held by Australia or Japan 
Fuck yes!!!! You go girl. All of Australia loves you!!!!!
So Trew
Oh shit I saw her at Venice beach when she was like 5 and skating the big ass 12 foot drop in bowl
love her
Big ups to you Arisa! Keep going for gold girl, you've got the whole country behind ya!
Best event yet. Bring in the vert next year . 

What an amazing performance by everyone and congrats to arisa
She was awesome
Wat a champion
Amazing story, what a legend!
Well deserved. Cheers!
That’s amazing
Amazing!
And 84 days! 🤣
So good! 🥇🥇
She would make better decisions than Albo....got my vote ya little Aussie ripper
Awesome
14 years old’ 
These athletes are literally half my age and super inspiring!! What legends
Not to mention Keegan Palmer’s killing it in the men’s.

Mental to think I used to skateboard with him 10 years ago at Bondi skatepark in Sydney, and even ran into him a few years later in Currumbin on the Gold Coast outside the Wildlife Sanctuary.
Arisa you’re a shining star! But the aliens want their antigravity machine back 😜
I watched her last night. She was amazing!
The guts in the chick to go all out on her last run and absolutely smash it. I think it's an all time great moment for Aussies in the Olympics
I saw her run, it was so, so, full of confidence. And you're telling me she is 14. Wow.
I think I need to step up my game this girl who's my age just won a gold medal in the most prestigious sporting event in the world I need to get better lol
It was so entertaining to watch those finals!
Well done Arisa 👍😎🤙
Inspirational
Amazing. Just 170 months old.
Little Legend! With a smile that can light up a room :D
I highly doubt it will be the last either.
Imagine going back to school with am Olympic gold medal around your neck
Youngest medalist... mate she got gold...
Arisa Trew asking her parents for a pet duck if she won the gold was adorable. I hope she gets a signature deck released. I'm buying one and hanging it straight on the wall of the pool room.
She should change her name to Toni Hawk
Imagine peaking at 14....
I don't get why the skaters were allowed to not wear national colours.
Bit of a joke really that a child riding a skateboard can win an olympic medal
Huh??? A 14 yr old can get into the Olympics?? I thought you had to be a certain age??
What a little sweetheart. 

Immediately after run, she wished good luck to the Finish girl. 

In fact all those kids were good sports, hugging and congratulating each other.

Glad I watched it.
That was a batshit good run and she deserved to get that medal. Big ups to her and big downs to all the tall poppy's running their mouth about skateboarding at the olympics, at least it's a break from swimming and diving.
She goes to a school designed to take her skateboarding as her main studies.. She trains like 6 hrs a day . It's on the Gold Coast.

Amazing effort for such a young girl/woman. Loved watching the event, they all performed well with great spirit. Youngest Gold medallist in Australian History, I believe.
She's got show and tell in the bag.
Yeh the Olympic street skateboarding events were the same, great to see so much positivity in the sport
Some of them might have the same sponsors and be friends already. Makes the dynamic strange but good to see youth respecting their competitors, because without your competition some of your drive to improve can be lost.
Skateboarding is like that in general. When you watch the SLS comps it looks like it’s just mates hanging out at the skatepark doing cool tricks
Yeah the good vibes from Tokyo is what got me to love watching the sport at the olympics.
I think a few of my shirts are older than her.
Stuff like this makes me think I could have made better decisions in life lol
I graduated high school in 2010 ffs 😭
Duck would probably just want some grapes
She has the right values in life.
I'm extremely invested in whether she gets a duck or not.
Please tell me this isn't a joke? I couldn't fucking love this person I just learnt about more if it's true.
A NINE year old won a gold? They're the best in the world at something? Holy shit.
> Big year for Arisa, she also won two gold medals at the 2024 X-games. 

Also first woman to ever get a vert 900
Watching this now. Incredible how some very young kids are so good at skating. Many of them are younger than the age I started, let alone way better than I ever was lol.
Skate park design is at an all time high down in Victoria!
The female skateboarding competition scene was neglected for decades and there just wasn’t many events or facilities to support female skaters. It’s only really the last 10 years that female skateboarding has been taken seriously in professional competition which has resulted in a lot of young competitors entering the scene. Older skateboarding legends like Vanessa Torres and Lizzy Armanto can’t really keep up with the flood of new talent entering the scene
Skateboarding favours small and light bodies because of the lower centre of gravity and the ease of manoeuvring a lighter mass around a pivot point, which is why so many  skateboarding records are set by minors. It's also an example of a sport that objectively favours female adult body types vs male adult body types on a purely physical basis, but which still shows a strong male predominance for sporting culture reasons. 

Surfing is another sport with these characteristics for the same momentum-based reasons, but it skews more towards adults because of the required endurance component of battling the surf.
Oldest was 20 I believe Bryce Wettenstein, so yeah young girls game lol
Mad respect from all the old head skaters.
thats so good
Gold for the spot
What the sigma
Thanks for the good vibes but try not to call women and girls "females", it's a bit dehumanising.
9 will probably have an on demand replay available on their app sometime tomorrow!
If you have Instagram, Tony Hawk uploaded her winning run on his Insta

Here it is: [https://www.instagram.com/p/C-VkLq5tXsn/](https://www.instagram.com/p/C-VkLq5tXsn/)

Sandra Morgan 1954 Australian swimming gold in relay. 14years & 6 months
I also read she's the first female to land a 720 in competition.  She's so cool.
Doesn't have to. Arisa is the youngest Australian Olympic medallist of any colour, so the headline is correct.
They only really dominate in the women’s event, men’s event has a majority of adults with 1 or 2 teenagers. Competitive women’s skating has only really taken off recently.

To answer the second part of your question, there are “better” skaters that don’t skate at the Olympics, certainly the majority of the most popular skaters don’t even skate in competition and instead film ads and videos for sponsors. That’s not to say the best aren’t competing because there are plenty of skaters who do both such as yuto horigome, Shane O’Neill, Chloe covell ect. 

Pro skating has the same sort of set up as pro surfing where guys/girls coming up usually choose between either focussing on videos or focusing on competition. This is especially prevalent in skating because the most popular form of skating and most difficult is actually skating obstacles that exist in the street.
Because the previous youngest was also 14, just with more days
I love she blitzed Sky Brown thinking she had it
GOLD!
You might be thinking of Sky Brown. She skated Venice regularly at that age.
The AOC doesn’t just throw uniforms at athletes, they consider the needs/status quo of the sport. Skateboarders definitely have more room to play with street style. Arisa is still wearing an official Team Australia top (you can see the logo) and in the earlier rounds she wore green and gold

Another example: In Kayak Cross neither of the Fox Sisters were wearing national colours
She’s got the kit, the shirt is white and green and the black shorts I bet a team branded as well. They just did not have her wear a custom helmet. I think for most sports that need helmets, if they are wearing a green and gold coloured one, they had it custom made themselves
Because skateboarding is one of the events added to appeal to a younger audience, not old fucks that care about shit like "national colours".
Skateboarding is an individual sport. You can wear what you want
The youngest in the event was 11
It’s set by individual sporting federations.
The Finnish girl is also Australian too! She’s dual nationality but grew up in Sydney
This is generally what skateboard communities are like
This is the kind of shit you want to see at the Olympics; competitive and supporting each other.
Yeah. Skating is such a supportive community.

Share the stoke!
People where worried the olympics would kill the spirit of skateboarding, how wrong they where
skating has such a strong culture of mateship IMO, every single time i watch one of the events they seem to be so friendly and smily. Not to mention as well that these girls often go to other places for competitions and the like so they know most of there competitors and are mostly friendly with them
There’s a lot of sportsmanship in skateboarding. Everyone wants everyone to do well and they are all friends too.
And all she wants as a congratulatory gift is a pet duck 🦆🥹
I actually enjoy watching diving.  Also gymnastics, trampolining, kayaking, canoeing, pole vault, skateboarding & BMX events.   Traditional “first to reach the end” sports, like swimming and running just don’t interest me as much.   

I’m glad the olympics moved beyond traditional events.   Far more exciting to watch.
it's the only event I make sure to watch
I agree! I thought her run was WAY more difficult than 2nd and 3rd but the scores were pretty close.
So she goes to the Skateboarding version of Blue Water High!

  
(OMG I am aging myself with that reference!)
I love that her parents support her with this tailored way of learning, instead of stifling her and making her go to regular school.
Welp, that school just became the premier skateboarding school in Australia
That’s incredible, I never thought that would have been a thing, what a privilege.
Is it a boarding school?
Idk man its hard to beat 2005 guinness book of world records
Ah yes, the regular highschool edition of show and tell.
I think it's just crazy cool skateboarding is an Olympic sport,from getting chased out of shopping centres to be an olympian.we have come a long way and nobody wants to wreck it.
Most of these girls already skate in the same competitions around the world (world skate league, x-games etc). They probably spend more time with each other than their own families and friends back home.
Cause really like surfing it’s not a sport but a lifestyle
I definitely have clothes from the 90s.
That reference is older than her!
Hope it doesn’t waddle away
She was on the news earlier, said she'll be taking it to the skate park with her. 

I cannot wait for the skating duck content!!
🦆🥇♥️🙌 https://www.news.com.au/sport/olympics/arisa-trew-wants-a-duck-for-winning-olympic-gold/video/c81297a907b3ee573eae17ab34c3812b
Arisa would have won that event as well but she kept trying to land a 900 (she's the only female to ever land one). Arisa is, in my opinion, the best female skater of all time. That she's going to get even better is amazing.
Any recommendations? The newly built ones closer to me have all been ‘plaza’ parks with the odd quarter that leads no where
Vanessa Torres and Elissa Steamer were everything when I was a teenager in the 2000s. Seems like it really dropped off after then and only picked back up in the last decade or so, but it’s great that it finally has (and the fact it’s an Olympic sport now is so sick, never would’ve imagined)
Also like Gymnastics, small is better for rotation in air and likely balance.
I noticed that one of the older skaters from the Tokyo games is now a coach for one of the younger skaters in these games
Where's Poppy?
dont tell jamie foy this
Don't totally agree with this, skating still requires a lot of power. You see on the street course the very young skaters struggle to make the larger rails or gaps.

Lighter also means you have less momentum to play with, and less ability to influence that momentum.
> Skateboarding favours small and light bodies because of the lower centre of gravity and the ease of manoeuvring a lighter mass around a pivot point

Tony Hawk, the GOAT, is 1.91m tall.
I mean if they were dead weight and never needed to use muscles then yeah. The men’s park final is on now, you can see for yourself that they go faster and get much more air.
This is ridiculously wrong. Females don't have a biological advantage at skateboarding, strength and speed etc. play a large role on how big people can go and how much style they have. 

I wish they'd fuck skating off from the Olympics, especially the people trying to bring coaching into skating. One of the best things about skating is the lack of that bullshit you see in organized sports.
Female surfers lack the power of male surfers to do massive airs tho. 
Dora Varella is 23
You know it!
It’s a huge pet peeve of mine. Female is an adjective unless you’re talking about an animal or plant. She’s a female athlete, not a female. 

Inverse annoys me too, eg “she’d be the first woman president”. No, she’d be the first female president.
It's how we know that the writer is secretly ferengi...
[removed]
I'm outside Aus so probably won't work :/
Love how excited Tony is about the new generation. I remember seeing him watch a young kid do a 900 and he fucking loved it!  

Bloke is a genuine gentleman!
Thanks!
Ahhhhh you’re right! Thank you!
The kid probably thinks it's cool to represent her country.
But then so is tennis, athletics and swimming etc. All of those enforce athletes wearing their national colours. Even the BMX and iirc the other skating event had competitors in national colours
It's the Olympics your competing for your country no matter the sport.
And she only started skating during COVID (Heili Sirviö, the Finnish athlete). Insane progression to reach Olympic skill level in such a short time
Heili is lovely, my son is friends with her and they trained and competed Jiu Jitsu together all over Australia. Her family are very dedicated and she has spent the last 2 years travelling and competing in skateboarding. Great progression and we were very proud watching her last night!
Bruh, why is your username the guy who made Regular show
If she was born and grew up in Australia, why is she representing Finland? That's like Trew representing Japan instead of Australia...
I get the impression with a lot of the newer olympic sports, that the communities are close knit and get along well.  I'm just watching the climbing and they were all discussing together how to get up the wall.
Totally agree. Sidenote, have you seen the videos on YouTube where people will take scooters to notorious skateparks?  Some skaters are fucking assholes.
In fairness, that spirit has been on display all across the Olympics. Sportsmanship left right and centre. Really has been refreshing in the current news climate. 
It feels like diving and swimming has just taken the spotlight on FTA recently, we don't have a smart TV. But Nine dangles three interesting sports between events, then diverts back to the most boring thing. Even some prime time table tennis would be nice.
I’ve loved watching the bouldering - watching the athletes in real time trying to figure out the strategies for the specific walls. It’s awesome.
The fact that there is a real life version of blue water high (in any sport) makes my heart so happy. I was never into sports but still dreamed of going to blue water high as a kid.
Crazy that Arisa was born 5 years after the first episode aired.
Yoooo, I remember that! Used to watch it most days after school on ABC3 (rip)
A little rush of nostalgia 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhxZ0Wtr4bU
God I was literally thinking this myself as I read the other comment and you’d already said it 😂
It’s a common arrangement for countries with government-supported sports training program. 

Instead of staying in regular schools, these young talents attend sports school with access to world class coaches and training facility while continuing their school study.
If it is, Tony Hawk is the Principal. 

Boyz throwing down on the ramp now!
That book would've been half a decade before any of those kids were born
I hate how people on Reddit have to get all "akshually 🤓☝️" about everything, even a simple throw away joke.
Is that show and tell behind the manual arts sheds with Mr Stephens?
I keep thinking that the same. From delinquents to Olympic athletes. It's pretty amazing really.
No…. Don’t make me feel old….
I sang that song to my nephew at bedtime when he was little. He's 18 now!
[There's a part 4 that released only 4 months ago..... Man's voice has not changed a bit.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IV8cnGU6YM)
Waddle waddle
Holy fuck! What an adorable bean. We need to protect her for the future of Australia!!
But worse for so many other aspects. I dont think it is an overall advantage like it is in gymnastics.
Tony Hawk is 6’3”.

Bob Bernquist is 6’2”

Rodney Mullins is 5’11”

People said sprinters need to be on the short side too. Then came Usain Bolt…


Being of shorter statue is probably an advantage up to a point but the real freaks (in almost any sport) are generally above average in size. 


Arisa is of course *tiny* but she’s still got some growing to do. I’ll be interesting to see where she is 4 years from now with some more weight and power in her body.
This is true for spinning, but the greatest vert skaters of all time are actually fairly tall and lanky. Tony Hawk, Bucky Lasek, Moto Shibata, Jimmy Wilkins, etc.
I still watch that Thrasher KOTR series when he took one for the team and wore short shorts for the entire trip. Big chonky boi throwing down rails in tight shorts.
Or Franky Villani
Being smaller also means there's more board to land on. It's why you see little kids throwing down stupid tricks...but not at the amplitude of older skaters.
So does gymnastics, so does figure skating. Yet those are 2 other sports that favour smaller bodies and at the highest levels of competition is mostly younger athletes, at least in the women's division.
Is he the GOAT though? He was primarily a vert ramp skater that leveraged his brand so well that he became a household name. Regular people have no idea who Rodney Mullen is and he invented half the tricks in the book as a freestyle street skater.
I would say that Vert skaters would have an advantage in the pump so this doesn't surprise me.
He's an OG, a legend, skateboarding royalty. The greatest of all time? Hard to say. He was a pioneer of vert skating. People now are skating far more technically and doing more challenging tricks. It's a different context, the floor is higher, the ceiling is higher.
Is gatekeeping apart of the lack of organised bullshit you see in skating?


Yours truly,

An old skateboarder.
There’s nothing worse than a bowl skaters dad at the skate park.
They don’t have the full blown power surfer thing going on. Girls are charging no doubt but the waves still surf them  rather the other way around sometimes.
Yeah no one says:

First man president.
He’s a man athlete.
Another male grabs gold.

But you CAN get away with “man-whore”, and not “male-whore”
But at that point they’re kinda brand new words.
Out of curiosity,  how would you phrase what they were saying?
[removed]
[removed]
VPNs are your friend
The official Olympic’s YouTube channel has her gold medal winning run on it.
So 4.5 years of experience at most? Wow that is ridiculously talented.
I couldn’t believe my ears when I heard that. I’ve been skating ~17 years and originally called bullshit to the extent of doing a deep dive researching her because in my mind that level of progression was literally impossible.      

Happy to confirm I was wrong though. This girl is a freak of nature and indeed progressed from basically nothing to an Olympic standard In 4 years. Absolutely insane stuff.
Following for answers.
A few reasons, since I know a little about this…

Firstly, I believe she was actually born in Finland but moved to Australia at 2 years old or something like that. So yes, spent most of her life in Australia. 

However, for Olympic skateboarding there’s a maximum number of entrants per country, per discipline (3). For starters it’s usually a lot easier to qualify through the European system than the Australian one, because we have more competition here for those 3 places. 

But it also means AIS funding for skateboarding is funnelled to a handful of selected athletes, usually only 4 per discipline, who the AIS deems are most likely to qualify for the Olympics. It makes things almost impossible for those athletes not selected for funding, as they have to self fund travel to qualifying events, training and so forth. In the case of Heili, she only started skateboarding in 2020 which means she was literally learning the sport when the AIS began funding selection for the next round. It would have been really difficult for her to qualify for Australia, even though it turned out she likely would have based on skill. 

She and her family were able to approach the Finnish federation and she was immediately their number one ranked competitor, with prioritised funding for her and the ability to progress through the European system with less competition for places. It made a lot of sense given her circumstances. 

Sky Brown, for example, lives in Japan and is half Japanese, but chose to represent Great Britain for similar reasons. The world’s top 4 ranked skateboarders were all Japanese in qualifying (edit: for the Street discipline) which means the world number 4 didn’t even qualify for the Olympics, since it’s capped at 3 per country.
She has dual citizenship. So she’s a citizen of both countries and therefore eligible to represent either. Same with the fox sisters, they’re French/Australian dual citizens and can represent either nation but choose to represent Australia.
Huh? Arisa Trew's parents are Japanese and Welsh.

EDIT: Heili Sirviö, was born in Finland to Finnish parents. She has been living in Australia since age 6. I think she's got the right to choose which country she wants to represent. Happens all the time.
Heili was born in Finland and both of her parents are Finnish. She speaks Finnish and definitely would identify strongly as Finnish.
[deleted]
I saw the one where they went to Burnside in Portland which is a DIY park built by local skaters. I've been skating for 30 years and even I wouldn't rock up to that park and start rolling around. It's sketchy as fuck.
Agreed, its almost like kindness is everywhere, except politics.
You can watch most of the other sports on the 9now website (or app).
Haven’t watched that!  I’ll check it out.  Thanks.
Turn out there's quite a few real Blue Water Highs around Australia!

IM 18 now AND THAT WAS THE MEME THAT INTRODUCED ME TO SOCIAL MEDIA IM AFOSSIL
Absolutely. Perhaps the most wholesome gold medal interview ever 
haha hell yeh!
🦇🦇🦇
Interestingly enough, the women’s gymnastics medallist ages averaged 22.3 years at this Olympics and 21.4 for the top 8 on each event. There’s a real trend towards “older” athletes and an acknowledgment that the extreme youth of gymnasts in the past played a role in abuse being able to be perpetrated. I really hope that no abuse occurs in skateboarding and the girls themselves are amazing but as a former gymnast I can’t say that I don’t see red flags.
I’d argue the that Tony is one of the GOATs, simply because when he performed a lot of the tricks, he didn’t have anyone else to reference against. When Tony did the 900, he didn’t know it was possible, and had to figure it out himself.

While we see kids pop 900s and other huge tricks back to back nowadays, they were able to watch those who came before them, and break the trick down to figure out how to do it.
He is easily the GOAT. Mullen also is for the invention of street tricks.
He's the Vert GOAT. Rodney is the freestyle/street GOAT (and overall GOAT) but it's fine to have GOATs for different disciplines, especially since Rodney didn't do Vert stuff.
Skateboarding is pretty good at not having gatekeepers in my experience. I think people become more independent and learn to think better figuring stuff out for themselves than just having coaches. It annoys me when they say they haven't had much time to train, I never thought of skating as training, it'd more be not having enough time to skate.

The suggestion that females have a biological advantage at skateboarding is absurd.

Apparently one of the reasons the kids don't dominate gymnastics any more is because the judges now look for things like strength, height, style etc.. trust the tennis subreddit to not support skateboarding following a similar direction..
Another *woman* grabs gold

Give me 4.5 years and all I'll get is probably a broken something 🚑🏥🦴🧑‍🦼‍➡️👨‍🦽👨‍🦼‍➡️🧑‍🦽 😂😂
Start training now for LA. Four years is clearly enough time! 🤣
It took me 4.5 years to do a kick flip and Ollie up a curb, but could never do them together, and I was in good shape, surfing and snowboarding, just could never get it up the curb together (I could go off a curb). But it took about 5 years.
Is a very good surfer too so that would definitely help with skating.
I thought she started at 8?
Fair go to her, obviously lots of hard work at surfing and skateboarding. Attending a sports academy also helps.

However it’s skate boarding not heart surgery. 

If she has a degree or qualification in other than a sports related subject by the time she gets to Brisbane that would be impressive.
That makes sense.. so they represent the country that gives them more of a chance to qualify.
Sky Brown actually lives and grew up in America, funny enough.
They should be representing the country they were born and raised in...  not where their parents are from. If that's the case then half of USA UK and Australia's medals would actually be from China, Korea, Africa etc.
Sidenote, did you know horses can’t breathe through their mouth!
Been to Burnside as well. It's so gnarly.
I agree with pretty much everything you've said. But you've made GOAT a plural which arguably defeats the purpose of employing it

It also depends on the criteria one is using. There's no doubt he's a legend and a pioneer, and nobody has platformed skateboarding to the wider world than Tony Hawk. So if that's part of your criteria, he is the GOAT. But all that being said, I think there's a bit of a misconception for the general public in the type of skater he was in his heyday.
Just skate be have some fun if you can as well :-)
Woman indicates adult. A female 14 year old person is a girl. 

With so many sex predators around, it's not helpful to call female children women.
She is 14 though, so she's not a woman. And girl feels a bit infantile. Probably female olympian is best tbh.

Anyone involved in sports will tell you that's the model. Throw 100 teen-agers at a high risk sport, back it with enough money, and you get 1 gold medalist and 99 hospital beds.

AFL is the same. IIRC the survival rate for 18-21yos is something like 20%. Most are good enough, only some are lucky enough.
Half in USA, half in Japan. The kids mostly went to school in Japan.
So the fox sisters should be representing France (because that’s where they were born) even though they grew up in Australia, consider Australia their home country and it’d be much easier for them to qualify for the French team? 

Na I don’t think that’s how it should work at all.

Side note, did you know Jupiter's storm has been raging for over 350 years?
Hay what?
What?? Tony Hawk was virtually undefeated in the 80's at the pinnacle of skateboarding's popularity. He invented many of the vert tricks the skaters were doing today.
I don’t know if girl is infantile, she is one! Which is what makes Arisa particularly impressive. Plus even our adult women we call golden girls. I think it’s more acceptable in Australian culture, given that wherever you refer to someone as a girl, you’d equally refer to their male counterpart as a boy.
Re-read that statement fam.

She’s not a woman because of her age but she’s not a girl because of her age, so you have reverted to using the term which has already been highlighted as incorrect. Stop playing linguistic gymnastics and accept she’s a girl and a woman. Don’t need a gold medal to jump to that conclusion.


Edit: I can’t read and thought they wrote female athlete.

The Olympic recipe is pretty simple.

Genetic freak plus money plus obsessive work effort plus luck.
Do you have any references for that AFL rate? I always wonder how many teenagers get burnt on the road to play AFL.
Are you blind or can you not read... ? I said they should be representing the country they were "raised in"... She grew up in Australia,  not Finland.
Side note my brother banged our cousin.
female athlete would still be correct, female is an adjective.
Female is an adjective in this case, not a noun.

So all luck?
Sorry no, it's anecdotal, I used to work with an ex AFL player and a family member who works in elite sports corroborated. Happy to be corrected if there's hard data
“Born and raised in” so which is it? Born or raised?  Both the fox sisters were born (and partially raised in) France and immigrated to Australia as kids.

If someone holds dual citizenship they are able to attempt to qualify for whatever nation they hold citizenship in as long as they meet that nations eligibility requirements.
Neither. Your first sentence in your comment above says, verbatim, 'they should be representing the country they were born and raised in'. Maybe you should go back and read what you wrote. So, is it born in or raised in?
side note I have a bomb 🤭💣💥💥
I swear to god you didn’t say female Olympian when I first read that haha. Ah well fair call, thought you had written female athlete.

Different forms of luck, but yes.

The Olympics are an old style circus freak show where countries spend millions of dollars trying to beat other countries at sports that don't matter or where the undisputed best in the world rarely participate because the risk isn't worth the rewards.
They clearly said it should be where they were raised in... and I agree. If you have lived in a country most of your life and used their resources to get you to the point of making the Olympics, you shoukd be representing that country, not the country your parents were from despite having dual citizenship. She should be representing Australia like many of the other Australians who have immigrant parents.
