I just come across this documentary about Chloe and the grub who took her life. My jaw is on the floor! I can't believe the miscarriage of justice in this case, and this was all filmed in 2021, god knows where the grub has set up now! I hope he steps on bindi's every day of his life. 

Tagged NSFW cause of the nature of the case and the details discussed in the documentary. This case all happened when I was still a kid. It reminds me heaps of Ebony Simpson. Wishing the whole family peace and hoping for a change in the laws.

Just found a letter to parliament written by the killer's parents. I'm lost for words!
