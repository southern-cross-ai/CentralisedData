TIL NSW Parliament has a gift shop
Did you take a few swigs from it during question time?
Love Archie Rose their whiskeys are so good
A surprise to me too, I stuck my head in the little gate thing and was asked if I was visiting. As I had no idea that was even an option of course I went in and looked around, this was by far the funniest thing I could buy there and it got even funnier after the question time.
*bottle shop

Not that surprising I spose
Unfortunately I had a court matter later in the day and was not able to partake.
