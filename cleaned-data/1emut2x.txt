These legal cases will invariably arise when the government expects the private sector to provide social/susidised housing.

Why is the government so averse to actually building and owning social housing?
It's almost as if they *want* us to start wheeling out the guillotines.
Disgusting.
Its sad boarding houses exist in 2024.  
They are a small lockable room with a shared bathroom and kitchen.  
Like a share house but 9 rooms (in Vic. anyway).  
The old ones are pretty rough.

All the resident's should be offered a unit and then they should demolish them.

See this story in Vic. for how new ones are treated by councils for all the issues they have:

coz they all have investment properties themselves and don't really give a shit about those who have nowhere to live.

Build low-cost public housing, and surrounding property value might go down.
Both New Labor and Liberal are ideologically opposed to anything public. Muh market finds a way or some bullshit like that.
Government usually stipulates some % of developments be allocated for social/affordable housing. But those are only for larger developments. A four apartment development wouldn’t qualify and I doubt the council would be amenable to changing the planning controls to allow more
Were these boarding house ever considered social housing? Or were they just lucky tenants who managed to find some extremely cheap housing arrangement?
Because the government has no money. It costs hundreds of billions to build housing in any meaningful amount. And whenever the government get involved, the cost skyrockets.
Incompetence. All they can do is repeatably show time and time again they can not run or manage any projects - short or long term.
Pfft. Australians don't protest. We just expect to be screwed over and over and over again.
So Australia shouldn't be building more housing?
Don’t use social and affordable interchangeable, that’s the latest con

> Because the government has no money. 

After WWII the gov had no money but managed to produce social housing so I don’t accept that.

> Under the first CSHA which was in place from 1945 to 1956, public housing stock nationwide rose from next to zero to 96,292 dwellings.

Yeah, the suck it up mentality.

Just a bit of advice. Maybe start reading articles instead of glancing at headlines.
The article is about a developer suing the local council because they denied an application to remove ***32*** residents from a boarding house to build 4 luxury apartments that is expected to house ***8*** people. 2 per apartment
Sounds like the tenants just got a good deal with the original owners. That is very different to community and social housing projects which has strict arrangements in place for affordable housing for planning to be approved, even if they are privately owned.
I worked for a large multinational based in Europe once and one of the research managers was talking about how one product sells really well in Australia despite the high price and he flippantly says "Australians will pay anything, they don't seem to care that it is a shitty product"
Perfect!!!
Is it alcohol by any chance??
No it was dishwashing liquid. 
Haha, it's probably the aussie boomers.
