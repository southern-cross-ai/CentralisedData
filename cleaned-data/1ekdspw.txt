Before I get asked to post this in r/Sydney, they removed this post without explanation.  I guess they wanted it in their daily thread by their sub rules, but I can't post photos in comments.

Not sure if itâ€™s coming from these trees, but there is a consistent aroma in this area of Barangaroo by Crown and Iâ€™m curious if anyone can identify it.

What a strangely specific question I have some insights into. I worked in those buildings next to the crown for 2 years so spent lots of time smelling the area ðŸ¤£

The most likely smell you're talking about I'm sure comes from something (furniture?) in the outside bar restaurant area of the crown, has this strange manmade smell to it and it gets consistent when you walk past it. 

The next strongest smell is clearly a meaty one, I'm convinced it comes from meat and co, but pumped out of the roof, so you only smell it in strange places at street level with certain winds, if you're 50m above it, my god you know all about it, many an early smoko were caused by the premature hunger. 

Happy sniffing ðŸ˜‰
I know the smell. Last time there was a post here about this, it was determined that it's the "signature scent" that the building has pumped through the ventilation ducts in order to have a memorable, distinctive aroma.

It's sort of like a woody cologne, right? But not quite something designed for people to wear as personal scent.
Money being set on fire.
I walked around Perth last week & swore I could smell Thai basil everywhere, it has a very distinct smell.  
Turns out it was a new antiperspirant that when mixed with my sweat smelt like the herb.
Itâ€™s laundry detergent
Since you posted a photo of the trees I'm going to assume the aroma is this: https://youtu.be/aoqlYGuZGVM?si=zadT2r2Bo4aoTrbK
You should have sent a modmail to /r/sydney a year ago rather than wondering for all this time.

Those pictures really help amplify that aroma


The visual appeal has heightened my sense of smell over the Internet, in such a way that has never before been achieved through this medium.
Definitely closer to furniture than something edible.  Best guess would be some sort of word, but hard to place.  Iâ€™m back in the states now and wanted to try it as a diffuser if I can place the aroma.
This. Crown in Melbourne definitely has a specific smell that they spread throughout the building and you can also smell it in the surrounding streets (or at least near the doors).

I would be rather surprised if Crown in Sydney doesn't have that.
It's why we switched to plastic.
LOL, knew that'd be Mitchell and Webb before I clicked on it :D
I thought nobody was interested in answering my question.  I didnâ€™t see the note that the mods removed my thread until I was combing through my Reddit posts yesterday.
You are meant to scratch the picture and smell
