USA 594 athletes  
France 572  athletes  
Aus 460(!)  athletes
Any chance we can stay in the top 3 till the games finish?

2 Rugby 7s
2 Hockey
2 Water Polo
1 Football
At this point I'd say it's likely

Yeah that’ll do it! Still a huge number relative to our population. 
You forgot 2 basketball teams as well
