Does anyone know what is happening here? I cycle past here on the commute to work and it’s usually still water. This evening i noticed a weird slick flowing towards inland and loads of debris floating with it. As i looked over the bridge to where it was coming from i noticed loads of random splashing in an area covering a 10-15m of the water, it went on for at least 10 minutes and was still going when I left, logs seamed to floating around behind it too. I’m very confused of what could have been happening, please can someone explain!! 
I don't know where the sticks and stuff is coming from but the fish are having a good feed. (the splashing)
Not sure on the area (lake or river) But the debris scenario happens quite often with tides. Usually when the tide is about to turn. It's more noticeable on really calm days.
How about you tell us where it is?
Bull shark?  They are often in freshwater, can be many kms inland.

In Australia, juvenile bull sharks have been found using the upper river reaches, as far as 110 km from the river mouth in very low salinity environments.

Murky, dirty water with lots of baitfish and diving birds around.

Play log!
Looks like mullet to me, the debris looks like it is high tide where you are and all of the scum stopped moving. Pretty common in brackish/ tidal waters

Crivvens. With all the other exotic species idiots brought to Oz, now we've got beavers.
If this is where I think it is its either mullet or giant herring having a feed.
Turds from the sky?
it just seemed like the logs and slick and stuff were coming from the splashing, the water is usually fairly clean, i’ve seen fish jumping before and this just felt different
it’s really  inland and quite high above sea level  but maybe
Gold Coast, about 3km inland from the sea, little lake/canal that doesn’t seem to be running water/a river
it doesn’t have a name or anything
thank you i appreciate the link too :)
i’m english lol is this like pooh sticks
My bets is that there's probably just enough wind and water movement to slowly cause anything floating on the surface to drift into certain areas. The lighting/reflections make it look really obvious as well. I see this quite often really early in the morning and at dusk.
High above sea level?

Are you sure as those trees look like mangrove to me?
So GC
We shall call it "Weird Splashy Pond"

Its waters run deep and murky...
Oh you said it was inland and up high.  I was trying to figure out where it might be.

Is it south Qld?
yes i meant like highish above sea level
If it’s connected to the sea, bullsharks can swim a long way in fresh water.
