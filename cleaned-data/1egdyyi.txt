13 out of 172 recommendations. What is the point of a royal comminssion if the outcomes are now ignored and unacted upon. What a complete waste of time and money
The governments response was basically to say they were going to focus on getting disabled people in to work as if the DES (disability employment service) isnt already a shitshow. In the end they only see disabled people as worthy if they can get them in to jobs, otherwise theyll shove them to one side and try to ignore them as usual.

I mean just look at whats happening with the NDIS, Ive heard they were trying to play the "stopping corruption" shtick to the public to hide the fact theyre trying to make it harder to get the NDIS and are giving less money to high-need disabled users of it. Whatever it takes to save money while making it look like their "fixing things." Like someone said, NDIS is becoming the next robodebt. Its always about making money for their mates while screwing everyday Australians, even if it kills people.
ABC have changed the title since posting to:

> Federal government responds to disability royal commission, disability advocates 'devastated'

The article leads the advocates with a Greens senator who despite being disabled himself is a Greens senator first and foremost, I reckon Labor could have cured him and he'd still be bitter. But more interestingly all of the responses from the other actual non politician advocates seem like canned responses, like they don't even reference anything specific or seem to be in proportion with the governments response. 

How is anyone supposed to take their responses to the government seriously when they can't detail the problems? More importantly who keeps listening to them when they just speak in negatives with no details?

Think about it, we expect certain voices/people to be invariably negative now, so why would we even need to hear their opinion when we can just predict it? So if we're just tuning them out, how do they tell us about important details? They can't, not anymore, they've over exploited their advocacy position to the point we just mute them, which might imply a few things about how we got here.

Actually, it says a lot about how we got here, we needed a royal commission to cut through all the 'advocacy' to get to the details and the advocates still couldn't meaningfully comment on the details once it had been all laid out...
They accepted 117 more recommendedations in principle. Did you read the article?
It was deeply flawed, the Commissioners decided to bury the  submission by those that wished to be heard, this is different to the vast majority past royal Commissions including into institutional child sexual abuse. This was the Commissioners decision not the governments.

Given this, as a person with disability, I lost faith in the Royal Commission before it was finished.
You: 

> ignored and unacted upon

Reality:

> "Our government is absolutely committed to the vision set out in the disability royal commission and to enabling policy and delivering services that realises the vision of an Australian community where people with disability are free from violence, abuse, neglect and exploitation," Social Services Minister Amanda Rishworth told reporters in Sydney.

Didn't read the article I guess?
this is the attitude in australia: if you dont work, youre useless. therefore, if youre struggling with rent, food etc then thats on you cos youre a lazy bludger and you deserve to struggle/suffer. this is nothing new.
Just want to add, there are companies taking advantage of the NDIS, but government only care what effects their hip pocket, not ours.
It infuriated me that this of all things is what they’ve chosen to prioritise out of all this. 
Go back and look at previous Royal Commissions where the government of the day accepted something in principle. Almost none of those have been actioned. Some particularly farcical ones leap to mind:

- misconduct in the banking sector
- institutional child sexual abuse
- child detention in the NT
- trade union governance and corruption

Royal Commissions cost hundreds of millions of dollars ($600 million in this case) and have historically not resulted in dramatically improved outcomes.
In principle. Do you understand politispeak?
What article?
>decided to bury the submission by those that wished to be heard


Can you please expand on this?
Or just understands bullshit when they see it.
The government agree in principle to all 227 recommendations of The Royal Commission into the Protection and Detention of Children in the Northern Territory.

How did that go?
Weren't they absolutely committed to fixing housing, deaths in police custody, the banks being greedy fucks and all the pedos in the church too though? Until meaningful change occurs, it's just expensive lip service
Those are issues, not recommendations.  There might have been recommendations related to each that were accepted in principle, and that would be a sensible discussion, but just mentioning broad topics doesn't really add to the conversation since you're not highlighting which recommendations were accepted in principle and then not actioned.
It means:


>Accept / support the overarching policy intent but may consider different approaches to implementation. 


Frankly, people need to read the [government response](https://www.dss.gov.au/disability-and-carers-disability-royal-commission-support-services/australian-government-response-to-the-disability-royal-commission) and look at what was accepted, accepted in principle, and noted (because it's not in the Federal government's remit, and thus cannot be actioned), rather than look at the rage bait 13 out of 172. 


For example, 21 of the recommendations were to create a Disability Rights Act, stating what should be in it. That's something the government put as "Subject to Further Consideration", which doesn't mean it's abandoned. The political reality is that there needs to be public consultation and debate. That's how democracy should work. 


Then there are 11 points on disability discrimination reform, to which the government "Agrees in Principle", which means they're going to review the Disability Discrimination Act, taking into consideration the points raised, and have allocated $6.9 million into doing this instead of passing the recommendations through verbatim. 


The government predominantly agreed with the substance of the report. The article rather distorts what the government is doing. Criticism that the government is perhaps not moving fast enough, or that it is doing can kicking is valid, but part of this will be because parts of it are the responsibility of the States, and another part being that there will be an election next year and there isn't really time to spend on the analysis and community engagement required to craft and pass the legislation (a good chunk of the recommendations are legislative changes). 


You can compare this to the Coalition's response to the Royal Commission into Aged Care (delivered in 2018), where they accepted findings and then proceeded to do little or nothing about it. They promised to pass a new Aged Care Act, which they simply didn't bother doing, and now [this current Labor government is drafting it](https://www.agedcarequality.gov.au/about-us/legislation-and-policies/new-aged-care-act). 


And this is the difference between Labor and the Coalition. Labor is bad at PR, but gets stuff done. The Coalition is good at messaging and then not delivering. 
In principle it will take 20 years to follow through with progress while everything possible is done to ignore those 117 recomendation. Lets see now. The banking Royal commission, the child abuse Royal commission and many other Royal commissions like the death in custody commission all has amounted to nothing. Ah lets not forget the inquiry into aged care with the same result. Private profiteers and abuse institutions always win while clients of the system lose. At worst 117 new donors will be found for contracts and partnerships that costs more than just giving the money directly to the disabled.

And the final question is this. What private rip off provider is in jail or has paid the rip off money back. Ah yes, none! Good governance I tell you!
It must cerebrally feel nice to be both this ignorant and this confident. I genuinely wish I was you.
It literally has the definitions in the article, big brain
Previous Royal Commissions and some subsequent, all submissions are made public. During the Royal Commission there was a change in legislation to allow people to make private submissions.
. 

During a Royal Commission People who want to make a submission can seek protections be immune from prosecution for evidence provided, as well as civil remedies, such as defamation. also if you gave evidence against your employer then they fired you for it, they could be criminally prosecuted for retaliation. What you provide also needs to be true, there and punishment including jail for false statements. This is why Royal Commissions are so powerful.


Allowing people to provide private submissions was similar to the Child Abuse Royal Commissions. However in that Royal Commission people who wanted their submissions made public were, with some redactions. (This is who we know about Pell covering up abuse in the church).

However in this disability RC, there was a blanket rule to withhold from publication people with a disability's submissions. 

Go to the website there are virtually no submissions from people with a disability available. Compare this to the robodebt royal commission. And it is full of personal submissions.

It is extremely concerning to me. Given the Royal Commission was about enabling people with a disability to make their own decisions, to ignore people who want to be heard, and in contrast to how Royal Commissions have treated other people is deeply disappointing.
Of course he does, he's the one writing it.
You want people to have an understanding of both the differences between Lab and Lib, as well as understanding the methods that are taken to enact the changes? On Reddit?

Tell 'im he's dreamin'.
Guardianship Gag Laws have been ignored.


*Among the disability royal Commission's recommendations are lifting blanket gag laws across the country, and overhauling legislation to ensure people with disability are better included in decisions about their own lives.*

Kids kids kids, you're both just awful.
It's not a Labor versus Liberal problem, it actually highlights how our system of government in Australia is no longer fit for purpose.  117 recommendations require the support and cooperation of states and organisations outside of the control of the federal government - negotiating these recommendations will take time.
I'm unconcerned about your opinion.
I think a lot of people (myself included) don't have much faith in an Australian government to enact meaningful change on any time scale, as previous royal commissions didn't fix any of the issues they were created to tackle. The banks are fucked, the church is still full of pedos, and disabled kids still keep getting their funding cut. What purpose does a royal commission actually serve? When was the last time a royal commission changed something meaningfully? Feels like a massive waste of money in place of change
You are dead on, but anything other then complete agreement instantly often upsets redditors, nuance is dead here.
> Government says recommendations on guardianship laws were the responsibility of, or better looked after by, the states and territories.


The r/Trustee_n_Guardian activist movement is in favour of nationalising guardianship, especially financial management by Public Trustees. 


This is where state governments have the opportunity to [slyly profiteer](https://aptagie.com.au/property) from properties sold unnecessarily of clients. The funds are put into secretive investments which state governments (especially NSW) pools their money with, muddying the waters so as to skim the returns.
What are the purposes of the system of governments, and in which ways are they no longer suitable in serving those purposes, and what are your recommended reforms?
Who's a salty boy 😘
Wow your response is unfortunatly not surprising
100% agree with you about the Royal Commissions, they are dead set useless and are created when Governments are bereft of ideas and want to look like they are doing something right. 

I gave evidence at the RC into Aged Care, at the last minute they heavily redacted my evidence to hide the truth. I walked out and said we will have another RC into Aged Care in 10 years. Having followed a few of these RC's, they have been set up with a pre determined outcome and such narrow references that the truth is never revealed.
I don't particularly like Bill Shorten but I am a businessman, I understand the problems. Bill is actually doing a good job here, he has to rebuild the foundations of the NDIS and negotiate with the states, if he can pull it off, I think Australia will have missed out on someone who would have made a great PM
Well Prime Minister Wombat, numerous reviews have recommended an abolishment of the states, removing one tier of government and the consolidation of LGA'S into about 80 economic zones. The productivity boost to the economy would be in the 100's billions. As an example,  the current housing crisis: the Federal government could promise 1 trillion dollars to fix it but they need the cooperation of both state governments and LGA'S and unless it's in their political interests, it doesn't happen.
You tried
Righto 👍
