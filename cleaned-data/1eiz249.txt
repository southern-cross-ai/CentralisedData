It looks like a [Northern Jewelled Spider](https://uk.inaturalist.org/taxa/201614-Gasteracantha-fornicata), particularly the second picture on that link.
Looks similar to a Christmas Spider, we got lots of them down here in Vic but I dunno if they are up in FNQLD
Jewel spider. Tonnes of them here in Mackay too
Gasteracantha fornicata
Def a latest gen Pokemon.
Spiny orb weaver.

Edit: Jeweled spiders and Christmas spiders are species of spiny orb weavers. I think they're really neat. Orb weavers are my favourite type of spider.
It’s happy?
Others have got it. 

They are pretty spiders and you will find them everywhere in FNQ if you pay attention.
If it's anywhere close to me it's a fuckin' dead spider.
Watching a YT video on these guys at the mo by Travis McEnery.
Prove it
You kill spiders that are *outside?*
It doesn’t have to pay taxes. I imagine that makes it pretty happy
Doesn't have to go to work tomorrow either.
