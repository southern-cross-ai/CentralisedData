I am a people watcher in general, in public, mainly because people blow my mind, but recently I have seen so many examples of just utter stupidy, and the inability to follow simple instructions wether written or given verbally, or both. I makes me wonder how some of these mouth breathers manage to put their shoes on every morning.

Some examples lately:

  
**Example 1** - Travelling interstate, flying Virgin and I am seated in row 20 or something, as I am boarding the lady scans my pass and tells me to enter via the rear stairs, as she tells everyone who scans up with a seat at the back, I walk into the tunnel and see the sign that says "Rows 15 and beyond, board via the rear, take these stairs". I head down the stairs and board, take my seat and people watch.

Now the amount of people I watched who board from the front and like a Salmon swimming upstream, slowly, held up everyone, pushing there way to the rear of the plane, then eventually made their seat blew my mind, it was at least 20 people. I thought lets give 10% grace to people who have never flown before, another 10% for English not being your first language, that leaves us with 16 people.

I thought about the numbers roughly in my head, lets say there are 15 rows of seats in the back that take 6 a row = 90 people, thats roughly 17% of people who ignored the stewardess and the signs on the walkway.

  
**Example 2 -** Standing in Line at a Takeaway shop, busy lunchtime to get myself a piece of grilled fish, a good 5 minute wait staring at the Menu board the entire time, finally get to the front, order, pay and take my ticket to wait. I watch the next four people in line hold up the whole process by asking about prices, the first "How much is a burger with the lot?", Lady says" as it says on the board $8.00". Facepalm, I think to myself what was this person doing the entire time in the line?

Second person "How much is your minimum chips" Lady says "as it says on the board $4.00".

  
Third Person "Do you have chicken salt" Lady says "as it says on the board we do, as well as all those sauces and gravies".

There was 10 people in the line and 4 of them asked questions which were clearly visible during the 5 minute wait (some multiple questions). So 40% of people dont know how to read a menu?



Do you have any examples??
I see you've never worked in hospitality/customer service before. This has always been the norm.

We aren't getting dumber by the day, you are just looking at the past with rose-coloured glasses.

There has always been a sizeable chunk of the population who are dumb as a rock.
Yes, the title of this post is the perfect example ðŸ˜€
Is this still available?
Ex-Butcher here. 

Every item in the shop I used to work at had price per kg, cooking instructions as well as a list of general ingredients for the value added products.

How often do you think you'd get the following questions?

"What's that?"

"What's in it?"

"How much does that cost?"

"How do you cook it?"

I find people will have a cognitive overload and shut down mentally if too much is on a board or too many signs are presented at once.

Once you accept that self-awareness beyond one's own immediate needs is rare, it becomes easier to cope with your day to day. I still strongly argue everyone should be forced to serve 6 months on a front line retail job though, it'd go a long way towards solving a lot of these issues.
Aside from people who experience the cognitive burden of English as a secondary language, I suspect COVID did knock a few points off the average IQ
Your post title would be a qualifier, going by the grammar ;)
Uhm, talking about "stupidy"... It's spelled "stupidity".
Some people arenâ€™t able to deal with stairs easily and so will board via the aerobridge regardless of where theyâ€™re sat.
My father in law once told me - there are two type of people in the world, the lookers and the askers.
Just two examples â€¦ one of which is full of statistics that you extrapolated out of thin air. 

It could be argued however, that this post is another example.
"Priority boarding only!"  
[Rushed by non priority passengers, all turned away]
We've always been dumb. It's just that it's easier than ever to hear about these dumb stories instantly.

Evening news and newspapers could only print so many morons per day - now the morons platform themselves and highlight their dumbshit ways.
Someone clearly never worked retail/hospo. People become oblivious to signs and instructions the moment the become a customer. If you tell someone something and it's not what they care about at that instant, you might as well have never told them. You might think those excessive EB sale signs are silly, but I swear to god that's the only way to get the point across sometimes. The number of times I had someone say "so what's the price on product *XYZ* after the 20% off?" And had to say "well as you see on the sign it says 20% of Î´ÎºÏ…ÎºÎ·ÏƒÎ·Î¾Î³Îº, and XYZ is nowhere near the signs, so it's not included".
Dumber? No. IQ is still rising generation to generation.

A better term is intellectually lazy. People are just getting lazy in their thinking, choosing to defer critical thinking in favour of pre-packaged facts" and the comfort of their social media echo chambers. 

And as for signs and directions? There is a disturbing number of people who take a "does not apply to me" attitude. So just a self absorbed view of the world.
Yep, watch idiocracy to see the future.
I once worked in a library and was stunned at the ridiculous questions we were constantly asked.  I suggested we put up some signs explaining the basics of wear the photo copiers were etc.  The senior librarian looked at me. "Oh sweet summer child," she said, "nobody reads signs."  She's quite right. Next to nobody reads a sign.
By the hour
Example 2 is my personal threshold for what defines a "world city". If you go to LA, NY, London, Paris, Berlin, etc, you see pretty much everybody is ready to order &/or pay as soon as they get to the counter (or checkout, or ticket gate, or whatever).

You'll find almost none of the staring, umm-ing and aah-ing, digging-around-trying-to-find-their-card, etc., that happens in Australia, or smaller cities elsewhere - by the time they get to a point where they need to interact with a human or machine, they're ready to go and GTFO.
With the first example, itâ€™s not stupidity, itâ€™s selfishness. They donâ€™t want to walk and board via the stairs and they will inconvenience everyone while doing so.
It's a function of popn growth. More ppl = more dumb
When you title your post like you have, please ensure you use the correct version of there and their.
People get complacent all the time whether it be at the airport, the takeaway, or hell, even the ballot box. It's not that they're dumb (yes, many will fall below required intelligence), but I think it's more that they genuinely don't care or see the bigger picture, and lack overall pragmatism.
If you are ever in doubt about the lack of intelligence of your fellow human, take up a job in IT.
Neither of these issues are new
You need to go to spec savers buddy
Your data collection methods and inferences are extremely flawed.
I have one example. Your first point makes you out to be pretty dumb, so maybe youâ€™re onto something. If youâ€™re (so magnanimously) giving grace to 20% of people, you should apply that to the full 180 passengers. So you should allow for ~36 people to board incorrectly. Sounds like people are actually getting smarter! But your dumb arse failing maths in the back drags that back down a bitâ€¦Â 
The most advanced strategy is understanding that the person running the till is both used to and trained as to work from a flowchart and then assisting them in following that flowchart as quickly as possible. Get your card or cash ready, get your bags ready when required, in and out with minimal fuss.
Well duh!

99.9% of people are morons.

Iâ€™m in the 1% who are not!

It was a statement not a question...
Omg yep. Then they just ghost
Username/post combo haha

I'd have to agree, it seems to have worsened since the pandemic. A lot of people are a little...slower?
The lockdowns didn't help either. It definitely knocked out some EQ points too.
Apologies, punched it out while on the toilet, I will fix up the grammer later for those inclined to focus on fullstops and spelling.
Yes I did this recently but I waited at the back of the line so as to not hold everything up like this example 1
Yes. I'm one of them, but usually I get a seat at the front. If I can't, I wait. #dammknees
Well you donâ€™t know how to spell, so I wouldnâ€™t be critiquing anyoneâ€™s literacy.Â 
My work has signs about our terms and conditions of service everywhere as well as verbally explaining them to every customer- usually while pointing at each one on the nearest sign. We're in the process of introducing a form for people to sign saying they acknowledge that by paying the deposit they are agreeing to the ts&cs because customers don't read or listen.
Nobody reads emails anymore either. I now deliberately keep it short with bullet points, bolding... anything to get their attention.
I'm in a few crochet subs and pages and, when someone shares a picture, I can guarantee you there will several comments asking(demanding) for the pattern, yarn and hook size even when that information is included.
I just want to know where a burger with the lot is $8 these days!
I wouldnâ€™t be surprised if a large proportion of those people had disabilities or injuries that made the stairs a challenge.

Also a fair few people donâ€™t have vision that enables reading a board menu. 

Plenty of people have poor skills or intelligence but OP seems to be ableist also. Increasing and ageing population is a factor here too.
Not the sharpest bulb on the tree.
I got that.
I interrobanged your mum last night.
Besides the population ageing for 4 years (since covid in 2020)... personally the stress experienced during the pandemic plus the after-effects of the getting covid myself made my reactions slower in life. I have no choice to be extra careful what I do everyday.
*grammar
"Are" at the start would imply you are asking a question, though you have two exclamation points at the end. The way you have worded it does not work as either a statement or question however it is read.

If you're going to point out how people are failing in society, don't be rattled when people poke a bit of fun at you XD
I mean, if you're gonna complain about people being dumb, at least get your own shit straight.
I love you.
