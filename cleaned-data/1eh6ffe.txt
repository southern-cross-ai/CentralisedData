And so the great wealth transfer to the legal profession continues...
Why? I've forgotten about the senator and now she brings herself back into it.

And now I remember thinking that the senator was (and apparently still is) a piece of shit.
Really. Reynolds I thought that you would have learned from your counterpart. Suing can backfire.

You should have dropped this.

 You will never win public opinion in this matter.
Dear Sen Reynolds: this is not a publicity war that you can win.
cant be slandered if you have no character of value
Even if she wins (and I hope she doesn’t) she is still going to be regarded as an utter cunt.
Reynolds is a pissant who is intent on preserving a reputation that is non-existent.

 She destroyed her own integrity when she misrepresented the truth in court, only to be caught out in a lie by a contradiction by then chief of staff, Fiona Brown.
The irony. The way Reynolds gets utterly trashed in social media threads like this is possibly the type of evidence she will use to demonstrate how her reputation has been danaged by Higgins’ portrayal of her.
Oh, come on, can you please stop trying to ruin this poor woman’s life, you disgusting people?
"Every fairytale needs a villain' - Reynolds lawyer 


Yes because getting raped in Parliament House is a fairytale - you absolute insensitive asshole fuckstain. Jesus Christ.
Fancy getting raped in Parliament House and your boss gets upset when you’re vocal at her lack of care at your situation and then sues you for defamation.  Reynolds is a POS. Hope she gets hit by the Karma train . She’ll probably sue me next .
What the fuck is with public figures in WA wanting to sue others and in doing so just put on the public record that they're... grubby little shits..?
Well, the LNP attracts the worst type of Narccists. If there's anything they can't let go, it's their bloody ego.
[If you think the person you back is a hero and everyone else is a villain, I'd question your objectivity.](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ExWFm_iW8AIqzxA.jpg)
Reynolds is pathetic. 
Liberal parties motto should be: evil is as evil does
This is a nasty one, the senator is already hated in the public lense and people have already worked out what kind of person she is just based on her own proven actions (sue me for stating that I dare you).

The senator likely has no chance of winning this or getting anything out of the rape victim and likely doesnt care about the optics on her considering she threw the rape victim under the bus.

This is just pure revenge hoping to bankrupt the rape victim with this eating up costs to defend.
🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿
So sick of hearing about this shit. Every single minuscule update gets a swathe of articles and a bunch of nightly news runtime.

And both of those have to rehash the entire story every. Single. Time.
F\^ck me, how much tax payer resources are being jammed up these peoples arses' and chugged. Just put a square piece of rope in the paddock and let them  knife fight, already.
Bring out the popcorn!
This is starting to get weird. The focus on illegitimising Higgins leads me to believe she knows stuff about the Liberals that she should not know.
Another Liberal circus.
Rack off Reynolds
Politicians have been raping the taxpayer's for decades and laws are written to enable it... why is it now considered unlawful Your Honour?
Brittany Higgins lawyer should have a look at this independent news article.

Seriously. Lawyers must be making an absolute motza from these litigious pollies.
Largely from the taxpayer
Fools and their money ...
She’s going back to retrieve her hat.
The Honourable Senator is a piece of shit.

Please use the pronoun that Senators prefer. It’s just courtesy.
She won’t win public opinion, but she probably will win the case (and costs as a settlement was offered) and send Ms Higgins broke.
She doesn't care about public opinion and she actually has a decent chance of winning this defamation case.
Maybe the objective is to beat down the enemy, even to your own destruction.
I would just go back further and it’s not like Linda Reynolds had a stellar reputation to start with in social media..
The same type of comments will be seen after she called Brittany a “lying cow”, and trashed her in a Spotlight interview. 



Those 2 things that Linda did were more damaging to her character than anything Brittany said about her.
Liberal party dont know any other way. Evil is as evil does
This isn’t a Jennifer Lopez thread. Just in case you wandered over.
Well to be fair, it's all they've got...
> The senator likely has no chance of winning this

Of all the recent high profile defamation cases, she has the best chance of winning her defamation case. 

There is actually a decent chance she does win this, though she likely won't get that much monetarily. The lawyers on both sides are the only ones making money out of this.
It certainly seems that way.
Nah, they’re just punishing her for speaking up about rape in Parliament House. That triggered a whole bunch of other revelations like the desk wanking, the way the Prayer Room is used, etc. Good little staffers are meant to shut up and take the abuse from their seniors. Higgins disrupted that and now they’ve got it in for her. 
A bit conspiracyish but the first view of the Higgins matter that seems to make sense to me, to tie all the pieces together.
They will. Higgins will lose the case and be broke from fees and having to pay costs. Reynolds will lose public favour by perusing the case in the first place.
No I don't think that would be amazing at all. Give the one women who got the big payout even more money, I feel sorry for the everyday women who can't even get a bed for the night after DV. 

If you got money to spare and want to help give to some women's shelter or support groups.
That’d just make Ms Reynolds clamour for even more: it was the damages for Brittany Higgins that set her off to start with.
Reynolds is funding her representation by mortgaging her house
Happy to be enlightened if I'm missing something, but what makes you think this defamation litigation is taxpayer-funded?
I hope the lion is hungry again.
Except in this case she has a realistic prospect of winning
I like to think of her as a thin lipped piece of shit.
Lady needs a chat with King Phyrrus
Ahh yes, the old "the surgery was a success but alas the patient has died" strategy...
The objective appears to be working. Her opponent is on the financial ropes.
Libtards are a) not "liberal" and b) shit.
What is this in reference to?
By that logic the plumber and the doctor are the only ones that win when your pipe bursts or when you need a prescription
Good call, makes much more sense when out like that.
Hopefully they take the house.
because Higgins is using the funds she received as compensation to fund her legal team.
She learnt from Bruce’s disaster. 

She’s using Meerkat v Antelope’s precedence in 1994.
Higgins has [reportedly had to sell hers](https://amp.theguardian.com/law/article/2024/jul/22/brittany-higgins-linda-reynolds-defamation-case-sold-french-home-ntwnfb) to fund her defence so I guess that would make it fair
Oh OK, I thought the comment meant on Reynolds' side (my mind went to the govt-adjacent party). 
I’d rather my taxpayer dollars be in Higgin’s pocket than the lawyers pocket. It’s ridiculous
