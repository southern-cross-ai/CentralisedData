Outstanding race against Regan Smith from USA who broke Kaylee's World record earlier in the year. 

Kaylee broke her own Olympic record to grab Australia's 6th gold medal at the games
Great swim. That final 25m surge was ridiculous. Her exit from the turn lead to that extra stroke lead at the end.
Hate when reporters ask questions like “your dad recently passed away, what do you think he’d say to you?”
The amount of gold Australia defending from Tokyo is very impressive. Usually we keep hearing that rarely happens
Another great swim, hit the afterburners 

All our golds are from women, when are the men going to step up?

Hopefully Cook can defend his his gold tomorrow in the 200m breaststroke and get mens first.
"Your brother died in a crash yesterday do you think if you won this medal sooner he would still be around to cheer you on?"
"I know the press training you've received would have prepared you to answer a question with a heart-felt and touching true story, could you please share that now"
>Usually we keep hearing that rarely happens

It is helped slightly by tokyo and paris being 3 years apart instead of the usual 4.
Hopefully tonight. Logan Martin in the bmx freestyle final, Stubblety-Cook in the 200m breaststroke and Chalmers in the 100m freestyle
Why you gotta turn it into that
