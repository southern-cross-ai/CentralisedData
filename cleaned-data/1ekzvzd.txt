On a boring level they do face a lot more recruitment challenges than they ever have before - I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs no such thing as WFH if you work at ASIO, and salaries are not any higher than other government agencies (in fact they‚Äôre lower than most), that alone would cull the majority of qualified, interested applicants.
Look at the work you have to do relative to the pay you receive.

The work is significant in its scope, in that you can sometimes measure a day by lives saved or lost. That's truly fantastic as an idea, and a place where you want skilled people. But the pay is not there to represent it. For better pay, people can use these same skills in areas with lower stakes.
Next minute : ASIO wants more surveillance powers.
You can smell the election coming a mile away.


Both parties and their media buddies are really kicking it into gear:


"Immigrants! Foreign students! National security! Terrorism! Youth crime!



Housing crisis? Cost of living crisis? Never heard of 'em."
Wow it‚Äôs almost like the govt should have spent the last decade funding it better and the department itself should have been preparing for the advanced threats that come with advancing technology
The same ASIO that won't let the Australian public know which politician committed treason
Decades of being ripped off, sold out and left behind has people pissed. FFS my local fishing spots are becoming shanty towns with homeless people. Lot of things you can point to, we bitch about prices getting out of control but that in my mind is a very very strong tangible indication that things are not working any more. If the government actually showed some leadership instead of subcontracting their jobs to consultants then maybe things would improve. Homeless people with FULL TIME JOBS!!! That's how fucked things are.
Trained killers returning from foreign conflicts, a rise of nazis marching in the streets & a constant amplification of right wing voices. Yeah I‚Äôd say that complex.
Quick! quick! the economy is bad! Wheel out terrorism again!
Maybe they can hire more consultants from PwC?
It doesn't help when our predominantly rightwing media keep pushing an ideology that has no supporting evidence. Their "tough on crime" and "soaring crime figures" bullshit, is their default position when the Coalition have no policies.


Imagine the ridicule a political party would receive if it went to an election with "Nuclear power" and "Stop the boats, tough on crime" platform.......oh wait, they are! Nuclear power is 30 years ago, and crime figures are historically low, yet you wouldn't know that from our media.


As for possible terrorist attacks, I¬† suppose it is possible......but it's been higher than that for the past decade, and the only terrorist attack I can remember was the Australian mass shooter in NZ?
Because the pay is shit
who needs terrorists when the gov is doing a perfectly fine job of F-ing up the country.
Ah terror level goes up and the hand comes out for more money. That‚Äôs predictable from a government run department
Having applied for a job requiring a security clearance in the past (not with ASIO, though), I think some of the security vetting procedures need an overhaul to make them more "user-friendly".

For example, when I applied, there was a question where I had to list *every* country I had *ever* been to, even if it was literally in transit. 

Now, a question like that back in the 1970s or 1980s wouldn't be a huge issue for most people - "Yeah, I went to see my Aunt in New Zealand a couple of years ago and I had a holiday in Fiji with my girlfriend last year" - but in a world where you can fly literally across the planet for around $1000 and there are people who treat Bali as their weekend home, actually recalling every overseas trip someone's taken (especially when you have to include "I had to transit through LAX to get a plane to Edmonton") isn't always practical or realistic.

The question is pretty clearly "Have you ever been to one of the 'unfriendly' countries?" and if anyone is lying when they say "No" obviously the security agencies will know, because they know which "foreigners" are visiting these countries.
You mean everyone is fucking livid and it's hard to tell who is hostile and insane, and who is hostile and entirely fucking sane and aware that the juice has not been worth the squeeze for some time now.
Why doesn‚Äôt the media just call it for what it is - Andrew Tate and the rest of those toxic far right influencers are breeding terrorists to point that ASIO can‚Äôt keep track of how many fucked up teens are going to randomly attack people.

These sorts of people need to be deplatformed in Australia by banning access to their channels.

Yes the free speech ‚Äúwoe is me government overreach!‚Äù Whiners will do their usual song and dance.

There only answer to radicalisation is deplatforming the radicalisers. Qanon and right wing boomers get de radicalised when you cut off Fox News.

Same thing will happen to radicalised teens if they can‚Äôt easily watch these violence inflaming far right influencers.
Doesn‚Äôt really seem that complex‚Ä¶ we have more technology and surveillance than they have ever had. Maybe hire people who know what they are doing
It's the targeting of regular people that's the problem. Bomb a bus & everyone unites against you. Bomb Linda Reynolds & the whole country is like, "Maybe the terrorists have some good points".
Seems like government agencies finally learned how the internet works.
It's the Nazis isn't?
Complex in the sense that it isn‚Äôt real?
Safety first and foremost: Work from home. No more high risk public transport or offices. Stay home, stay safe until ASIO give the all clear.
A decade ago it was simple, brown people from the middle-east were terrorists, case closed.  Now it's more complex, some white people might be terrorists.
Perhaps the Australian government should stop sending arms to the genocidal regimes which create grievances in the first place.
These people are our version of the American bad guys who steal all your information
This kind of headline in itself is not good for national security, like really? Is this a "oh China, if you're listening" headline or what?
Maybe they should recruit more ‚Äústrong male role models‚Äù since these are apparently a solution to terrorism ü§î
The perceived 'threats' come from within the filthy grubberment. All by design! You can deal with it..
Thinking about terrorism reminds me of this:

https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/jan/08/homemade-bomb-found-car-botany-palestine-flag-gaza-war-

If no one remembers, or cares, then terrorism is a problem?

Is it terrorism if there is no terror?

My personal experience suggests that ASIO suffers from a lack of transparency and the results are predictable.

The best thing would be to ensure the police are fully accountable, and properly fund and train the police to deal with crime.

Same for the CFMEU.  Fund the police to deal with the crime.

Have mechanisms to ensure they are effective, and accountable.
Government took a huge dump over the last 10 years. All the good people left and the rest are just a self reinforcing echo chamber of delayed projects, miserable attitudes and shitty management just bidding for next FY budgets.
It was a long time ago now, but a fella I used to know got a job as a programmer at asio when his gf went down there to do her phd. He actually made more working at the bank in Newcastle than he did down there which is a bit worrisome tbh.
I‚Äôve been job hunting, and ASIO advertises a lot. While I didn‚Äôt see any WFH, I did see a few remote work officer roles, where you do street surveillance type stuff.
The government is essentially paid training for anyone looking to take their skills private.

Anyone I know who worked for the government eventually went private with the skills they learned and made significantly more money.
The vetting is brutal too, one of my kids applied a few years ago (top grad at top uni) and failed vetting for unknown reasons. He's never been in any kind of trouble or been politically vocal, or in debt, so they have their own high standards in recruiting that obviously limit intake.
Also any history of mental health issues or recreational drug use appears to preclude you. That would be a huge part of the otherwise qualified population you‚Äôd think.
So true ill add that we probably should have thought about these issues whilst schooling was a topic. I have a child nearly ready to enter the workforce who would of been great for this. Flourished in covid with me and is barely scraping through with this education system. Shame cost of living is in shambles, and my health has been ignored by the government too many times to count. We get what we deserve.
Add in needing a clearance that takes 6-12 months to even get the job officially which can fall through for so many reasons
Yep, you‚Äôre not wrong. 
Government jobs are unbelievably poorly paying - at least those in engineering/engineering management that pop up in my searches. 
Talking maybe 50-60% of what is out there in the private sector. 
Like, 37.5hr week is great, but it‚Äôs not worth having my salary for
ASIO just handed some back.

What the government needs is people but the APS isn't very attractive right now.
And money.
Security apparatus generally don't operate to the election cycle. Other than being a bit busier during caretaker since decisions can't be made. 
This is a reaction to the rise of angry right wing people worldwide, America, France, to name a couple. Venezuela is in unrest over the last leader declaring they won the election and ignoring the results showing they lost. Authoritarians are on the rise. Nazis are back in public.
What a reductive take
They mention none of this stuff about immigrants, foreign students, youth crime in the article, you're seeing what you want to see.
And mass immigration
For a good reason, it‚Äôs not just the one.

It benefits them and us more to scare other traitors into slipping up and giving them more opportunities to catch them. Setting the corruption forest on fire to see which shitbags come running out.
Umm, news media had the story for months. Front page even. ASIO comment was an anniversary announcement.
[deleted]
Social media doing a good job at radicalising more and more people
ASIO cultivated actual war criminal Nazi‚Äôs after WW2 in Australia.
The point isn't to identify every country you've been to but to ensure your serious and honest about your background. Inevitably the same question will be asked later on and they will look for differences. They're well aware that people make well intentioned mistakes but they want to see how you respond if you do and ensure no one is making serious omissions.
Haha, just wait until you find out you need permission to travel üòâ
Yeah, it seems that even the metadata retention and anti-encryption bills both #LibLab waved through Parliament wasn't enough.

Hint - it will never be enough.
Can't pay them enough - it's the issue with the entire federal government
That would require the government to pay significantly more to recruit good people. And perhaps give incentives to stay long term, like for example pensions.
So they have more data then ever so that makes it harder. What do you discard what is a joke. If anything things have become harder for them.
I did Nazi that coming.
When was the last time there was a terror incident on public transport or in an office...? This is pretty wild fearmongering.
lol what? Shut down every workplace and public transport? How do you live day to day?
In light of artsrc's comment, maybe what we want is to stop exploiting our natural resources for the good of a few oligarchs, and take some of the wealth to provide a society worth preserving even by those who might become radicalised.

Less money to Gina, more money to services in Alice Springs. Who needs a genocidal regime when we have Gina.
ASIO are incompetent bunglers, protected by secrecy.

Most of the politically motivated violence is from right wing extremists, who pursue their goals with violence, not victims of genocide.  The UK gave us another example recently.

The main problem ASIO has in combatting this terror threat is that ASIO is mainly staffed by right wing extremists, who believe in violence.

So whether we participate in the killing of hundreds of thousands of mostly defenceless people, in a plausible genocide, or not, terror will be a rising threat that ASIO can't deal with.

The solution is to .. not have ASIO deal with it.  Increase the accountability and resources for the police, and have them deal with it.
This is fairly accurate. They also don't prioritise any sort of loyalty and lessons learned from past experience, so they just end up in a cycle of doing the same initiatives and projects every 10 or so years that did not work the first time. But they've gotten rid of all the corporate knowledge, so there's no one to spell out to this cycle's bright spark exactly why something won't and didn't work.
I just wish agency‚Äôs kept up with having more efficient systems. Everything seems so dated.
so typical Australian work culture then, lol.
Intelligence services have historically selected for the duty/service/patriotism types, who would generally care less about salaries so long as they're viable.


I wonder if ASIO salaries are actually viable in 2024, though. But also, 21st century signals and intelligence work may have a level of technical demands that make it harder to be quite so selective on ideological grounds.
banks pay programmers pretty well
Welcome to the federal government - it pays like shit
I mean you're not meant to tell people you even applied to ASIO....
Who's he friends with or travelled to.

Who you know and where you go will affect it.
One of my good friends had the same experience. Nothing super wild in his past, tried a couple of drugs but not regularly and not recently and gambled a bit in his early-mid 20s but wasn‚Äôt currently gambling. 
Failed with no feedback to what the reason was, he was crushed, was mentally prepared to move to Canberra and start this new career.
Probably a personality thing, or too book-smart and couldn't human very well. 

Either way, he's lucky.
Umm, social media catches a lot.
>He's never been in any kind of trouble or been politically vocal, or in debt, so they have their own high standards in recruiting that obviously limit intake.

Could be online activities that were a bit suss or you have someone related to you all that is a high risk person (extreme beliefs, high debts, questionable ethics, etc).  When my dad was getting his last security clearance he needed to provide all sorts of information about my wife and her family despite us not even living on the same continent at the time.
I guess we should pay them less. That makes it more attractive, right?
I've applied for a few APS jobs recently. My old part time retail sales job paid better per hour than them. Still applied because the work is actually interesting, but it's easy to see how someone skilled wont want to move to Rockingham WA for $85k/yr, or have to travel between Melbourne, Bendigo, and Brisvegas for a week every month for the same. I mean shit, I got paid more working at uni and I got to pick my own hours, plus WFH even pre-2020.
Also who in their right mind wants to move to Canberra? Especially if your family and friends are elsewhere. 

Rent there is also Sydney level, but the city is Gelong with a soy latte population mixed with a small dose of Bundy and Burnout people.
Intelligence agencies do have leaders and others with agendas. There are always many opinions regarding the strength and meaning of intelligence. The result of this is that intelligence can be both selective and political. 

It can also be accurate, of course. But as we never get to see the facts we are all too often passengers in what may be a corrupt process.
The US security apparatus clearly are operating to their election cycle, and we operate in relation to theirs, but also ours to a lesser extent. Both are unified in not discussing the actual messiness of the current middle east conflict. It's the cartoon character Nazis that are the real problem.. of course.

The story is kept very simple.. for instance Venezuela where they actually have no true freedom to choose anything the US doesn't like due to the [Monroe Doctrine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monroe_Doctrine), which regards the entire western hemisphere as their own plaything.
I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs Morrison.
Or did they...
Yup, the amplification of grifters and right wing flogs.
Keeping us safe from communists i guess
Also, if you seriously can't remember/figure out what countries you've traveled through, it speaks volumes about your ability to research and adequately look into things. And if you're the kind of person that's traveling hundreds of times a years to the point that you genuinely can't remember/figure out what countries you've been through, that itself is a massive security flaw. Like they're absolutely asking with an undertone of racism, but it's far from the sole reason they treat it as a priority item.
I needed permission to do a particular uni assignment because it was too close to the area in which I worked.
Too many pwc consultants
Steganography works so well when the secret squirrels are so poorly read.
Do you think ASIO issue warnings just to stoke public fear? Avoid the office, avoid the in-laws dinner, avoid leg day at the gym. Don't let the terrorists win!
Hmm, I thought poster was referring to the number of classified documents that were left on public transport by officlal.
I assume the poster likes working from home, and any excuse will do.

This was re-enforced by adding dinner with in-laws:

> more money to services in Alice Springs.

While I do broadly agree with you, I think our indigenous problems have more to do with dignity and respect than with welfare.

There must be some initiatives we've tried before which show some sign of working!
>They also don't prioritise any sort of loyalty and lessons learned from past experience,

Like duh. Why would we spend effort on promoting loyalty when we can just buy it with below-the-line contractors on an as-needs basis /s.
Thanks LNP!
Mood.
Sounds just like the private sector tbh.
That would require them to break tradition and actually award contracts to an innovative provider.
The fish rots at the head.
Yeah, but when you look back over the history of MI5 and during the war in places like Bletchley Park which cracked the German enigma encryption systems and radio codes, they attracted ordinary people. When you look back over history its all these poorly paid people with  fascination with science, coding, mathematics, radio systems etc etc. In many cases they were available housewives! They do it for passion not great wages.

 A good example   is the famous  actress Hedley Lamarr. Few people realise that it was she who invented the concept of frequency hopping encryption systems for military radios and that  later drove wireless networking systems to help avoid interference. So  when you sit on a Tram watching a old lady doing crosswords she may make a better intelligence officer than someone with 2 X Phd degrees in IT and would probably do it for a cup of tea and a timtam!
And yet the public all reckons they're fat cats who are paid too much. Cannot win.
>	failed vetting for unknown reasons.

Perhaps for having loose-lipped parents?
Haha well there you go then!
ITT: Every person and their dog reminding future applicants to not tell anyone you want to work at an intel agency.
And how you act in interviews. I wouldn't be too surprised if they take honesty in the interview a lot more seriously because certain things in your background could be a security risk. Lying on your resume or in the interview, even if it's just a small one, could have had an effect, too.
Oh for sure, but I'm just saying, if he was disqualified I'm sure a lot of other applicants would be as well.
I like it.
Aside from the rents you‚Äôve kinda sold it to me actually.¬†
The rents would dispute your analysis, but yes, stay away.
absolutely alternate media is garbage
Indeed, I should have said Cronulla.

Alice, Alice, I dunno what the fuck to do with Alice. But fat white guys like me have spent a long time failing to solve indigenous social problems, I feel like I should butt out anyway.
Wasting resources screwing little countries like Timor for corporations, donations and job placement! Alexander Downer who then gets a contract  and job with them. But hey its not corruption, its Australian governance!
It's been Labor's watch for over 26 months and they've done little to nothing and nothing effective to stop the rot- which is why heir latest effort to mimic the LNP's terra cries has fallen flat.
shhhh contracts only go to businesses owned by previous employees.
Certainly agree. Problem is, you need a government worthy of admiration to recruit like this. The reputation of the government against the demographic they need is very much tarnished and has been for some time
> So when you sit on a Tram watching a old lady doing crosswords she may make a better intelligence officer than someone with 2 X Phd degrees.

I mean it's a nice story, but it's highly unlikely.
If houses still cost $400 000 we could all follow our passion....
>And yet the public all reckons they're fat cats who are paid too much.

Well all I know is the PM gets paid too much, and that Mike Burgess fella from ASIO still earns more than him. 

Give me 200k and I'll show up to Estimates every four months to tell you we can't tell you what we do to.

Hell, I'd do it for half that. Guy wasnt even showing up to National Security Cabinet meetings for a while there.

(But no. You are correct. People cherry pick examples, often of SES band, but these people are making enormously impactful judgements. And unlike a CEO that might have stock options or incentive payments, SES renumeration is pretty much just a wage + payment a pension for older staff.)
Indubitably
I've been through a few security interviews both for myself and as a representative for others going for positive vetted clearances.  Never had an issue except one time when the interviewer said I seemed evasive when couldn‚Äôt answer certain questions but the reality was I had no idea who he was talking about when he wanted me to talk about them.  With social media presence being so prevalent these days I imagine a PV clearance would be a lot harder to get
Same with me, except I know someone who spent years trying to solve such problems, and she doesn't have any ideas either.
And if you think it's against the public's interest and blow the whistle on our various forms of "governance" then straight to jail for you.
Very true. Modern day Australia does nothing to inspire pride or patriotism in its citizens. In fact people who express patriotic sentiments tend to get labeled as extremists themselves.
I guess they need to just sump up the money then. If the security establishment exists to protect an economic zone where the only criteria of membership is the possession of a little blue book, then the only thing it has to offer is money for mercenaries.
