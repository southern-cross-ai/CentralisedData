So I'm currently sitting in the corner of a non descript pub in Sydney having a beer.

On the other side of the pub is a big group of people screeming at the triathletes on the TV. It's clear they know the Aussies, as well as others from different countries, they're getting excited at random times. 

I'm not really sure what going on, but I feel like I'm in one of those Olympics sponsorship ads. 

I need another beer.
Cheers. üçª

This post strangely says so little for so many words
And......
I'm glad they're getting into the spirit.  
To contrast I was in an airport lounge in Brisbane during the Rio Olympics when Kyle Chalmers surged to his shock gold medal when he was only 18. I was watching with only one other bloke, the rest of the lounge was oblivious, until we both shouted "YES! YOU BEAUTY!!!"
Instead of being a grumpy arse, go and join in the fun.
Deep.
I'm practicing to be a sci-fi / fantasy author
Left the pub, collected the kid from music and starting to cook dinner, about to have my other beer.
Not grumpy, pure observation.
Keep practising
LoL, this is funny. Being voted down for being a parent.
But, why did you share this? There's some people who are into the Olympics, while you aren't. What am I supposed to be getting out of this?
Don‚Äôt think OP intends to convey complaint at the group, or any type of frustration that others are into the Olympics. I read the post as a r/mildly_interesting. Just an observation with no judgement intended
Yep pretty much.
