Similar to what Latitude Finance did previously with their cards for Interest Free financing (Go Mastercard, Gem Visa, CreditLine) ([related discussion](/r/australia/comments/1d89ivn/latitude_finance_go_master_card_harvery_norman/)), Latitude are now [adding the $8 fee to 28° Global Platinum Mastercard](https://latitudefs.zendesk.com/hc/en-au/articles/25970394220689-28-Degrees-Global-Platinum-Mastercard-Credit-Card-Changes-FAQs)

I guess Latitude don't want to retain any customers now. In the last few months, my partner and I have gone from having all 4 Latitude cards between us, to having zero.
> I guess Latitude don't want to retain any customers now.

That’s exactly what they want. They want to get rid of customers who only use the card occasionally when travelling. 
We’re overseas right now and I just read the email from them. When we get home we’ll close our two accounts.
Fuck the $8 fee, the interest rate will be 27.99%!

Holy fuck! Talk about printing money! These cunts really are the bottom feeders of the banking world!
Yeah they're shit cunts, they seem to have completely forgotten about their hack last year too.
Closed mine, I’m now using Up Bank for travel. The app is very good.
Good thing there are plenty of other cards with $0 international transaction fees

I’m definitely closing mine. No plans to travel overseas anytime soon so the only benefit is keeping my cash in high interest account a bit longer if I make I big purchase. $8 per month is ridiculous
Bendigo Ready Credit Card offers much the same advantages without the monthly fee.
Well, guess I’ll cancel mine. They’ve never made a cent of interest off of me so I get why they’d do it.
I cancelled mine today via their website.
Isn’t this the mob that do the one harvey Norman sign you up to? Their target market aren’t those with good financial sense or access to other means  so I don’t think they will lose much money from the customers who do leave over this
Isn't Latitude connected to Hardly Normal?

Given that connection, I would expect to be conned and/or hijacked for every dollar I possess.

I wouldn't deal with them in a fit.
Lucky my price protection claims cover this monthly cost otherwise this card is literally useless
We've had this card for years but haven't used it for a long  time, really since Wise and Revolut became available. Obviously going to close it now. Wise and Revolut are both so much better than any travel card on offer from Aussie banks anyway
Bendigo Bank Ready is the best alternative.
* $0 monthly fee
* No international fees
* Can be opened up under a joint account if you want
* Can have additional card holders
* Includes insurances too
* Bendigo Bank give you a BSB/Account No for the credit card, so you can do fast payments onto the credit card. No need to send via slow BPAY (assuming your bank support fast payments via BSB/Account No)
* I think Bendigo Bank also allow you to setup a PayID on the credit card too, so if for some reason your bank only does fast payments to PayID’s this could be a work around.

Ozbargain has the break down here:

Only catch with Bendigo Bank is their app doesn’t do transaction notifications. Which is odd considering the developers of the app are the same people that make UP Bank. Maybe the more people that sign up to it, can provide enough negative feedback on the app to make the bank improve their app.
I was under the impression that 28 degrees provides the spot rate - is that correct, and do we know of the Bendigo ready card does?
BankWest Platinum ZERO has no fees, NO FOREX fees and a pretty decent app, plus a 6 month 0% BT offer for those who want to get 28° away from Lattitude as soon as possible.
They've been charging me an $8 fee for a while now. Gonna cancel it as soon as I pay it off.
Why TF are any of you using these?  
I have opened a separate cash account with a debt card. I use the ATM in every country I visit, the fee & exchange rate isn't that bad. I keep the amount in there low but if I run out of money, I transfer more in.
The whole purpose of the card three names and owners ago was not paying fees for overseas transactions - if you were ever paying interest on it, it was a terrible card already.
Thanks for the recommendation, will sign up before next trip
There really aren't any with $0 monthly fees. Hmm, I wonder if I should change my daily banking to Commonwealth for their credit card. Or sign up for the Bendigo Bank one...
Latitude is the descendant of the old AGC, later backed by Westpac and then bought by GE Capital.

In other words, they've always been pricks.

No direct connection to HN, except for the last while they've used Latitude (and/or Latitude brands e.g. GE CreditLine, Go MasterCard, Gem Visa, Buyer's Edge, etc.) for their in-store "interest-free finance!!1!1!" packages. I forget who they used before that...
Apply for a new one with a balance transfer away from Latitude.
>Why TF are any of you using these?

Because I make online purchases in other currency and I don't like to be slugged with extra fees.
Grand fathered in price protection insurance. I made thousands back
because many hotels and car rentals require a credit card to make a booking.
Yeah, if you were using a credit card like a small personal loan, and not repaying it monthly, there's much better offers out there.
Yes there is? My ING credit card has no monthly fees.
Huh?  Bendigo and Bankwest Zero.
GE has a policy of only hanging on to subsidiaries that enjoy #1 or #2 position in any market.  Latitude got sold on when it faltered.
You don't need a credit card for that though, many free Debit cards offer it.

At the moment I recommend Up Bank (Bendigo).
"Deposit $1000 per month and make 5 eligible transactions or hold an ING home loan."


I'm in the same position with ING as I am with CommBank. I'd have to change my daily bank to them.
You just put $1k/month that you use for food and discretionary spending. Helps keep everyday spending out of your main account anyway.

Or pretty sure you can transfer $1k, buy 5 coffees, and transfer the rest back. It’s pretty easy to work around if you want to.
That’s the debit card account. The credit card has no monthly fee:

https://campaigns.ing.com.au/orange-one-credit-card
That’s the debit card, not the credit card. The credit card doesn’t have restrictions like that unless you want no international transaction fees.
[removed]
I use 28 degrees specifically for the no international fees. So I'm looking for something similar.
If your current bank that your pay goes into doesn’t have that option then change banks.
