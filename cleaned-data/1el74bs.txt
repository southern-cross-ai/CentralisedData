On various high streets and suburbs, there are random shops with no customers. 

Examples include any computer shop on High Street Northcote in Melbourne.

For computer shops, they have old hardware and old Pentiums, old Athlons being advertised, and the signs are all blue as the yellow ink has faded.

Here is an example of such a shop

https://imgur.com/a/WdJ7kzS

At old milk bars a lot of the products are covered in dust, suggesting that the turnover of stock is not that high. 

Is this some sort of migration by business investment scheme? 

Are these 'real' businesses? In the sense they have customers, revenue, costs etc?

At the other end of the spectrum, we could talk about businesses on High Street Armidale (Melbourne suburb), which are similar but more expensive.

Does anyone have any insight? 

Edit: money laundering is an easy answer. Is it as simple as that though?

Edit 2: great article posted about migration by business investment: https://www.sbs.com.au/language/chinese/en/article/kai-bought-a-milk-bar-to-fast-track-permanent-residency-that-pathway-has-just-closed/36fzo5xys

The bumper bar in Fitzroy st didn’t sell hot dogs. They sold drugs. 
If you own your business premises and your home outright you can get by running a very average business. This happens way more than people realise.
There's a computer shop near me similar to what you've described, bloke who runs it is in a wheelchair and he's told me it's literally just a hobby for him, doesn't need the money just likes tinkering and fixing computers. I take things there for work when I just don't have the time or patience to deal with it

I often think the 10 massage places in a 300 metre strip on the main street open at 8 o'clock every night though... Surely not THAT many people are getting massages with happy endings. That's got to be laundering
The one I know is a bike shop run by a grumpy old bastard who has a low tolerance for idiots.

He could afford to retire but he likes bikes and he likes working on bikes. Take something interesting, unusual, or just much used and cared for, in there and he's amazing. He'll track down that rare part from god knows where and and fix your bike up for a reasonable price. Or he'll tell you to fuck right off with your shitty bike and your shitty attitude. Depends on the day and the bike.

I also had a part time job for a while with a guy who \~1970 bought a shitty rundown warehouse near what's now Green Square in Sydney. He ran a 'business' there and rented out the rest of the space to what seemed like random people. But he had no mortgage to serve so he just needed to get enough 'business' income to keep the ATO and insurance company happy. When he eventually retired he sold the building, bought a house near the beach in Bondi and spends his days playing tennis and surfing.
Rich people with old hobby businesses maybe? Or a lot of online trading
These old computer stores from the 90s or early 00's tend to have a loyal customer base that have been using them for years.

There is no need to advertise recent technology as often they specialise in IT services for various local small business.

Quite often these old stores bought the commercial property the store is located in, often the entire building that they have sublet other offices, so their overhead is quite low.
There are several possibilities. 

1. It's a hobby business, being bankrolled from another source, doesn't matter if it makes money or not. My mother's boss's wife used to own a boutique fashion shop, its entire purpose was to give her something to do during the workday, didn't even come close to paying the rent let alone other expenses.

2. it's true business is the creation job vacancies, thereby creating sponsorship visa's for people to enter the country, with the funding coming other avenues

3. they're actually money laundering for someone/something else. Think of the times you've seen big drug busts in random shops/restaurants.

4. the business owner may be clinging to the hope that things will turn around and is biding their time
Because real estate is absurd in Australia, you don't actually need to run a functioning business if you own a building. 

On paper you will make more money each year just with the property than you do running the business. 

Also, money laundering. 

Basically, the economy is largely theatre, in order to get ahead, you own property or you are involved in rorts of government handouts or tax schemes, or outright criminality.
When I retire and money is not so much of a problem I plan on opening a small C64 computer store. It will have probably one or two customers per week. No one will buy anything. It will make no sense from a financial perspective. But it’ll be my contribution to keeping the spirit of my first personal computer alive. And I’ll love it.
They haemorrhage money until they get replaced with the next boutique franchise.
Those computer stores are doing online sales.
Online sales.  Small but loyal customer base, if they own the building they're in making enough to get by isn't hard. Drugs.  Money Laudering.  Tax write off for the other partners business.   Hobby business supported by other partners income or a trust fund.   The shop is just the "offices" for a business that works on site so you don't see their business because they're off installing computers in a small business somewhere.
There used to be a small bookstore on the main street where I lived that only sold books relating to art and architecture. It was only open for a few hours on Saturdays and Sundays, and quite often it was also closed on these days as well.

You would rarely see any customers in the store and I couldn't find any online presence for the business, so it didn't seem like they were also selling books online.

Eventually I was talking to a neighbour who told me the lady who ran the bookstore was the wife of a very wealthy businessman who owned the entire building of which the bookstore was a part. The store was her hobby that her husband funded to keep her busy on weekends. She apparently almost never sold any books - she just enjoyed chatting to the arty-type customers who occasionally popped into the store.
Imagine you had almost zero costs i.e. you own the tenancy and you work for yourself. If that is the case you only need to make $100-$200 per day for it to be worth it. That could literally be one or two computer repairs.

  
But I have a pharmacy with literally 100-200 customers a day and half my customers say that its super quiet. I staff my pharmacy to have scripts out in under 5 min so people can get on with their day.
Most of them are in buildings owned by the business, otherwise the rent would have killed them years ago.  
There's a shop in Union Rd Ascot Vale called Telesonics that has been there since we moved there in 1974 at least.  
The guy who runs it is old, cranky, and partly deaf.  
He only opened it a couple of hours a week in 2019. 

See video of the shop 2024:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e\_2Ru2HZiI0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_2Ru2HZiI0)
I should add in regards to the computer shop, they might be running more back end stuff or managed services for local business?   
I know my workplace back in the day had a shop front as it was started as a computer repair place but when I started over a decade ago it was more managed services. 

The shop front was still there basically so tons of old cables, adapters that could be sold but really didn't. 

My workplace is so far removed from a shop now lol and even moved locations and has no shop front so this store might be like that but smaller scale. 

Also I actually have that logitech surround sound system pictured on the shelf in the top left hahaha.
Some of them may be migration related ie invest in an australian business to get a visa....that is the end game so doesn't matter how the business does. This might apply to a lot of the crappy black market cig and american candy shops in my area.
Nobody is thinking money laundering?
Rich guys have businesses for the wife to run to keep them busy so they dont get too bored and root the pool boy
What do you mean no customers? 

Your previewing a computer store that sells repairs and second hand PCs. [A](https://www.msy.com.au/) lot of them have an online website, and often the physical store is manned to help assemble things as necessary, process orders, or assist in troubleshooting in generic PC repair. 

Most of that stuff is done in the back and they don't need to wait for customers. 

Customers will come in at their own pleasure and someone will be in front to assist.
This is the international symbol for 'go into the back and ask for Marley's special'.
My favourite has always been the imfamous Camera Shop on Little Bourke Street, Melbourne, which still has the menus on the wall when it was a Chinese resturant back in the 80s.

Open maybe an hour each day for a couple of days a week. A set of dusty old cameras in the display window.

I even went in once just to have a sticky beak.

I've figured with them it might be the case of them sitting on valuable land and just operating the very minimum to comply with some tax laws (or they're just bored)
We have a shop that is empty for most of the month, in Maryborough , Victoria. Customers go in, but no one ever leaves with any of the bootleg action figures on the shelves. Myself and others know it's chop-chop. The shop literally was just a few trestle tables with crappy figurines from the $2 shop down the road, when it opened. It was like that for about 5 years. They've now upgraded to shelving. 

No one is going to go looking down tiny back streets for a small "gift shop". No footpath sign, either, to attract foot traffic. During C0V1D, other shops that were on the main street and had had plenty of good business for years, closed down because of lockdowns and restrictions. Not this one. A lot of locals are wondering how long until bikies torch it.
a lot of old shops own the real estate and a couple of neighboring shops
I run such a business. I have stupid cheap rent. Everyone drops phones and most people download viruses because they get their porn from places other than the hub. Or nearby businesses need help. Customers also tend to come in spurts. I get either gaming & study time or I am slammed with four customers at the same time.
Bored house wife shop front for mafia husband money laundering
Money laundering would make more sense for businesses selling a service rather than goods. A shop with old products on its shelf probably raises suspicion if they are reporting high turnover. Plus why bother buying stock if you are in it to launder. 

A lot are probably older people who own the shop location itself
The number of empty cellphone cover shops in prime locations in my city is unreal... Went to a shitty mall yesterday and it must have 10 nail saloons.. all empty... and a fuckn Pen shop... never seen a sole in there in 10yrs... how many Pens do you have to sell per hour to pay the rent in a mall...
Money laundries
Tax offsets
Hobby businesses
Mostly online sales
There's a Muslim shop in my neighbourhood who I've seen ONE customer in when I go past on a daily basis.

I am sure her husband has coin and basically just funds her hobby
some have residences out back as part of the business cost and renting it to themselves on the cheap.... and other economic shenanigans.  I had several customers doing this.  Some businesses are doing stuff most of the time and have short customer contact for pick-up/drop-off so seem empty.      Lease terms are also a big part.. in some cases it's cheaper (in the moment) to keep trading than cash-out the remainder of expensive and long leases. Some simply can't afford to do it... they try to sell the business, 

On the appearance side.. signage is hugely expensive. Even profitable businesses let their signage fade to avoid the outlay. I used to organise signage for a bunch of stores.  And frankly.. there are some really poorly run retail businesses out there who let their cleaning duties slip and put little emphasis on merchandising or stock presentation.
I once worked for a PC shop that had a front facing store but we pretty much only ever serviced local business computers and networks etc.
Being an optimist these types of business could be a subsidied hobby, led by online sales or have customers that are just in and out quickly
I've never understood how when you walk through a cbd and see these boutique women's clothing shops, and no one is in their, how they survive. 

As for computer stores, I'd say most of them rely on doing repairs, rather than selling new set-ups. I'm sure they do sell computers but it would not be their main income.
I’ve been told that some under-utilised stores are a way of maintaining a job for visa purposes for foreign nationals although that was more super niche mall stores in this case. Fairy-floss embellished salted ice cream anyone?
Fronts for the informal banking sector - big with muslims and asians.
LOL, I had something a bit level same weird in Townsville. Moved here 6 months ago and went to a tobacconist, to buy tobacco. There were six customers in the store and as soon as I walked in the place went dead silent. 

After about 15 seconds, one dude who looked like he hadn’t eaten in months, right arm shaking uncontrollably, very politely tells me “all good Luv, you go first, we are still deciding”. After checking if he was sure, I approached the counter to buy a pouch of tobacco. They didn’t carry my brand so I asked what else they had (I have back ups I am happy with). 

Store owner gave me TWO options. At a tobacconist. I declined both options, bought a $1 can of coke then left. Nanoseconds later, the door was bolted behind me so nobody could come in. The 6 customers all watched me until I was no longer in their line of sight while the store person just stood at the counter staring into space.
These are "small" or "normal" businesses.  They don't have a corporate headquarters and they don't have a franchise model.

Often the business owns the building or has excellent deals on rent.

Sometimes the business is subsidised by other investments or income streams.   Often there is cheap finance obtained by having the family home as collateral.

They aren't "random" and they do have customers, they just don't have "shoppers".

The ads are old because they aren't really related to the level of business; it's 90% repeat customers or word of mouth.

Yes, they are real businesses.
Many random businesses are there for rich bastards to keep their aging wives happy, let them rent out a space (maybe the husband owns it who knows) they can have their random craft shop, clothing store, you name it and the wife runs it and is doing something where she feels useful.
There's a pathway to citizenship through business ownership. Those businesses are also helpful for moving your money out the country you're escaping into legitimate AUD. That's the random $2 shop joints anyway.
There is a significant amount of massage places that are money laundering.  Any massage place with a blue and red led open sign is more than likely a dodgy place.

Also https://youtu.be/9ky8mJNzlcE?si=lDdmdUk8VOHz24nK
Tbh I wonder about half the stores in Westfield malls most the time. They have no customers at all in them.
Money laundering
It's an illogical situation on the face of it. There can be various reasons, but a big one is how commercial property is valued. It's based on the last time it was rented out.

Under normal circumstances, you'd rather rent it out for a measly sum than leave it idle and get nothing, but because of that, if you do rent it out at a low rate, the property is revalued to that lower rate, and then you face the possibility of the bank getting skiddish and calling in the loan.

So, they often stay empty. Or they might do it under the table, and let a friend or relative use the store off the books. 

Other times, these stores are run by people who prefer to be their own boss, even if it means working for less than minimum wage. So they might only be making $50 profit a day.
I want to know who the f is buying sheepskin car covers.. there's 4 shops within a 2km radius of me. 

Money laundering???
They’re sham businesses operated purely for business investment visas. Money comes from elsewhere
There's a shoe store near my childhood home in SE Melbourne that has been going on for as long as I can remember. Same pair of boots in the windows for many years, very rarely any customers and the 2 guys (father/son?) running it are straight up assholes whenever I've gone up to them.

The rumours when I had a job nearby was that was a drug front. So that's my answer, good ol' money laundering.
There is a book store near me, it’s open like 2 days a week and is ALWAYS empty. 

Who knows.
I guess somebody must like those Rooster Roles and must order them online? LOL
Approx 15 ish years ago my friend and I would go to a milk bar near her house that sold dodgy Asian DVDs of the latest movies 

They would look us up and down decide we weren’t undercover and invite us into the back room to select them 

Not sure if they still do this or if they sell something else now , maybe vapes
My three cents is, they own the building and happy to chill, and watch TikTok?
See that green shop next door to that computer shop? 
There’s your answer
I once lived in an apartment and on the other side of the street were two barbers about 25m apart. Both had about four staff and three chairs. Busiest I ever saw them was with two customers at a time. Calculated they would need to be charging $500 a haircut to make a living. Building manager said they survived on selling drugs and the business was a way to launder the proceeds.
There’s a shop in my suburb. Full, and I mean full, to the rafters of used bikes. The back of the building has a yard and shed. There are literally used, rusty broken bikes everywhere even on the shed roof. The old man who runs it puts all these junky bikes out on the sidewalk every day and then moves them back in. There is dust on everything in the windows. I’ve never seen anyone shop there, I don’t even know how you would get inside as a customer. The only thing I can figure is the guy owns everything outright, has some other source of income and is a hoarder. It’s so weird. I would be the one to have to sort it out as the executor of his estate.
If your in Melbourne check out "the Balkan corner" on google maps. Be surprised at the google reviews and then go to it. Eat the incredible food and then wonder how and why and what. Why is the venue so big. If you do go there or have been there recently you'll see an interesting political statement. I'm not sure if the group they are involved with does something nefarious. But I have no fucking idea how the food is so good and the venue is so large but almost nobody is ever there. Where do they get the money?

Hang on, let me get my 8K monitor...
Dude, why you outing my dealers for?
As part of our crazy business migrant scheme all they have to do is buy/lease a shop premise. They don't have to operate or open them. That's why there are so many in country towns.
I’m going to advise y’all of a couple different scenarios, and yes these are real:

-retirement hobby/income: this is why there were so many multi-purpose stores up until the 2000s bc compulsory super was only introduced in the 90s

-retail vs trade: the difference between a place to browse for a purchase vs your go-to to get the specific thing

-storage places for collections bc this used to be the cheap way to store it. See aphrizale in good omens

-I wanted it to exist so I made it. Normally don’t last long unless it’s way to generate losses or actually makes a profit

-low but constant traffic: sometimes it’s get in, get out

-they have a supply or service contract and this is extra money

-delivery exists

-old fashioned pre-order for bulk, pick up, ordered in advance via phone, email, and in the old days mail

-high value items don’t need to be sold as often to to stay open
I did a survey of such not takeaway shops of long standing in my area long ago.  A few were storefronts for business that earned its money supplying to other business etc.. Many were older people who owned the shop and basically lived off past profits. A few were older people whose wealthier children paid for it as a hobby. A couple of people I dared not ask had subtle signals of old money. I very much miss small shops.

All  were born here or had been immigrants for many decades. There was one lady who seemed a recent  immigrant (Scottish) but was not -her husbands retirement produced funds for a little dream shop.
My personal experience from a PC shop in '99/2000.

It was run at a loss to offset tax from a larger business the owner also ran
They split off and sold the PC business based on fake numbers and it collapsed in 6 months.
Those shops with old pc parts on shelf are just too lazy to write down the stock and don’t want to put new stock on shelves for display. 

They usually do most of their business out the back fixing shit.
There's a lighting shop in a tiny coastal town I visit on holidays every year. Have never seen a customer in there. Every year I expect it to have closed down like most of the businesses there but every year it's still going. I'm not sure I've even seen a staff member in there through the window as I'm waiting for my hamburger from the takeaway next door.  
So to answer you: I don't know.
The mobile store in Adelaide Street, Brisbane beside the Police Station always makes me wonder. It is huge mobile store, but I have never seen a single customer in that shop. I have walked by that store 100s of times.
By selling drugs?
They are tax write offs, money laundering fronts, etc etc
Don't you need turnover to launder money?

Like, you need enough clean money to hide the dirty money in, right?
Washing machines.
Money laundering is a good one, but more common: some are fake storefronts for “shipping companies” ie people out the back boxing up baby formula and other nursery items to ship and sell for a profit in China.
The first business pictures is ABAR computers. They've helped fix my personal computer issues a couple of times. 

Diagnosed and replaced some faulty RAM. I'm not sure how they continue to exist but I'm glad they do.
Funny, whenever I'm in Sydney, I always ask this question. Walking around the smaller streets in the CBD, even along York street and the little side streets off there, there are shops scattered around. I have no idea how they survive in such quiet random streets.
I’m looking at you, Moonee Ponds beanbag store
Sometimes maybe rare but there are business migrants from overseas. They need to invest in a business to get PR.. the goal is PR not a profitable business.
Try asking for chop chop or vaping gear , or just gear in general
Normally either temporary owners filling a visa requirement, we had a bakery in our town that generally had ten or so pies to open day and business closed for day when they ran out of pies etc or most likely illegal tobacco
You say "High Street Northcote" like Australia knows where the fuck that is.
90% Money laundering.  Mostly drugs.

10% old ladies running hobby shops at a loss, sponsored by their husbands.
Almost certainly money laundering, or their main business is something more lucrative than shifting cans of drink but needs the veneer of respectability a shopfront provides.
I see a lot of massage shops with no one going in or out - assume they are just easy ways to launder money.
That one looks like an office. But some are business investments for visa purposes. Nothing says your $500k (or has it gone up?) investment actually has to make money.
I have never understood how retail owners can survive, even my own relatives who ALMOST ALWAYS are sitting in their empty store when I phone or visit and even if there are people in the store, I cannot remember anyone buying anything.

.... but they must be making the $$$$ profit each week because they keep up with mortgage, car, school fees and wages payments each week and then the family holidays each year.
Dirty money won't wash itself
And rent is like $400k / yr.   Are these all money laundering operations?  Like the car wash in breaking bad?
Money laundering or tax right offs
The local smoke shops you see around are most likely selling chop chop. There used to be one in williamstown that had a few dusty shelves with random weird stuff on it like old garden gnomes? They got done for selling chop chop. I was always so confused how they afforded the super high rent.
Also there was a pic a place that had a secret menu item selling meth. They got busted too
There's a cigarette shop outside of my shopping centre that's been there for years, and I can't remember a time when I walked past and there was actually someone inside, or behind the counter. Definitely something else being sold there
High st Armadale shops you mentioned are in high end spectrum, so don’t need much traffic to make profits. For instance, There is a piano store with retail prices around 100K. Plenty of designer clothing and bridal  shops over there
Money laundering.😉
A lot own the shop and live on-site.
Probably illegal tobacco.
I'm convinced they are fronts, ways for men and women to support their lovers, wives, children, mistresses, etc by paying them to run a business. Not all, but most.
Lots of people saying it'll be a front. Perhaps in some cases. Plenty of genuine explanations, though.

They may be busy at times you're not passing.

They may do trade online and have a shop front for storage and for shits and giggles.

It may be a lifestyle thing, which basically translates as bugger all income they just do it cos they enjoy it.

They may have some products that are high profit and don't need to move many to make a reasonable income.
Rich husbands?

Money laundering?

Husbands tax break on the losses?
I figure that they must have a huge online business supporting the physical shop. That is, they package and ship online orders along side their physical shop. 

I cannot see, otherwise, how some of these shops could survive. I’ve hung around some of them and not seen customers for hours. How can you keep a business open with only 10 bucks of sales?
It's usually money laundering. Cash transactions and fictitious receipts for goods that don't exist.
I often wonder if some of those shop owners own the building because there’s no chance they’re earning enough to even cover rent
In a town near me, two tobacconists opened within doors of each other on the main street. I remember these south Asian dudes going in and out, I think. One shop was open for like, one day, then shut and cleaned out. The other still has some stock in it I think, but I've never seen it open. So these two practically identical shops were set up, stocked and opened then closed down immediately.  wtf?
There is a shop in blacktown that sells collector coins. I can't imagine that the market is so large that a shop is required. Every time I go past it to go to the dentist it's always just the old man at the counter
The milk bars around me are all so overpriced that rarely does anyone buy anything, hence many products are also obviously expired creating a vicious cycle because even if someone’s prepared to pay through the nose for a packet of chips no one is going buy one that’s old enough to start kindergarten.

The way they *really* stay open is selling under the counter black market tobacco.
And having very extensive arson insurance for when they inevitably get fire bombed.
Upstairs at lakeside Joondalup in perth, literally looks so empty the only stores upstairs that are busy is mecca, a few clothing stores and a cafe then it goes around the bend to the 2nd food court but I usually go up there to dodge the crowds of people at Christmas time
Until it closed sometime around 2015 or so there was a vacuum shop near me and we were certain it was a front for the local mafia, I remember walking past it around 2010 with my brother and stopping for a look and they had vacuums from the early to mid 80s.
A lot of computer places turnover parts online. Not sure about the pictured though.
Steady debt.  House of cards waiting to fall.
Yeah see lot of random shops in Malvern as well which surely shouldn’t survive considering how no one is ever there
Money laundering fronts.
Looking at you Red Rooter
Purveyors of monetary origin concealment and fine non - alcoholic inhibitants.
Money laundering.
There are a few places external but near The Star that are invite only yet seem to be staffed, often by quite few, kind of peculiar
 
Commercial rent alone would be minimum $3K a week
Drug trafficking or/and money laundering
I always wondered about upmarket home wares and gift shop type places. I see them in Noosa that have been open for years, but never have anyone in them. I always figured rich empty nest people can afford it or money laundering.
In some cases, they own the real estate and that's their "job" that they've been getting up to do for 50 years so keep doing it - eg: the milk bar in Annandale opposite the movie theatre which was like something out of the twilight zone for 30 years.  
Mostly, especially with younger attendants and more of the smoke shop or vape shop setting I reckon it's usually money laundering.
Ozarks
I think a lot of those old stores they own it. Unless they are laundering money they have to.

In my tiny area we had a small little comic book store... I can't recall ever seing a customer in it. I belive the guy did own it or have a very old mortgage. He did sell it a few years later. I do see a few of those old computer stores gone now too.
There used to be a pizza place in Parkville near Melbourne Uni called Il Parco. It was like the front room of a house, the curtains were always closed and just a small name on the door. Run by a nice old Italian man who made decent pizzas. Never saw anyone else in there except for one time when two cops were talking to the owner.
Some of them are probably used for money laundering
There is a discount store in my small  town that literally only has cheap.pkastic items visible. However it's been fined  twice for selling vapes to high school students. The owners once told a neighbouring store they turnover $20,000 a week. Everyone suspects they actually sell illegal tobacco  or its a front for money laundering
A few months ago, I had some money to burn and didn't feel like spending another Friday night at home alone, I decided to hit up every strip club in Brisbane.


Of the 10 still operating, I was the only customer at 8 of them. Felt so bad for the women working there, anyone who approached me got an instant $50 tip
Money laundering.
Drugs
I’m fucking sus on Top Dogs Burger Co in Moonee Ponds; there‘s never customers, I don’t see any chefs, two young ladies dressed like Hooters waitresses are at the counter and it seems like they have zero experience, the hotdog I ordered was literally the kind of thing you get at a sausage sizzle, they’re usually not open and these giant musclemen of all sorts constantly walk in like they own the place and go out the back (but they’re not the owner, I saw him when they renovated).

The whole whole situation fires off my Spidey senses.
Must be getting old cause I’d be disappointed to get drugs instead of a hotdog these days
Much like all those Vietnamese pool halls that were drug distribution hubs in the 90's.

Then there was the infamous fish n chip shop in Fitzroy St Kilda where you could order a " burger with the lot" which had a hit of heroine as part of the price.

Lets not forget all the old men coffee shops that are card game gambling dens with a coffee.
I assume the 24hr florists scattered across the northern suburbs are the same.
what was the addy for that place? what type did they sell?
There's a hardware store at the end of my street. Tiny, tiny place but usually have what you need and handy if you can't be arsed heading to Bunnings to save $3.27. Run by a guy and his wife who must be in their 70's ... and their two dogs. It's bleeding obvious they own and live in the premises, make a few bucks extra but most importantly I think for them have something to do and people to talk to. 

  
Love those guys.
There is a man in NYC who runs a business making hand carved custom rubber stamps. In an interview he talked about how if he didn't own the building he could never stay in business, but because he does its not too bad.
Definitely some dodgy places around. But plenty of businesses are legally just sitting on some real estate earning small money and taking the tax write offs.
Fuck yeah if I could own a house and shop like Bobs burgers I’d be living the dream.
Particularly if your grocery bill is tax deductible
another good reason for a land tax.
I was almost going to make a post specifically about all those mysterious massage places. I know some of them are rub and tug joints, but they can’t all be, and there can’t be that much demand for Thai massages. It’s got to be a front for something.
[deleted]
People genuinely want normal massages after work
 So many people have tight shoulders and headaches from hunching at their desks.
Hint: they offer more than happy endings.
Yeah around green square/beaconsfield there are a bunch of warehouses converted into small/online businesses (and about 20 smash repairs places, ha). A handful of large warehouses are sitting empty, likely just waiting for developers to knock em down to build more apartments
My favourite kind of bike shop
Don’t suppose you’re talking about Bike Bar in Fitzroy? Lol
If this is the fuckwit from high street Thornbury, he’s a piece of shit. I’m in the bike industry and have been for 25 years, this guys reputation (if it’s him) is astoundingly poor…. Not to be mistaken for Fufanu, Rays, and other decent shops around the area
This makes me miss Shifter Dan
Other businesses may sell services as well, such as computer stores repairing computers and devices or music shops teaching lessons that make up 80% of revenue. I would definitely not put money laundering past certain businesses
Nah I know somebody like that. Owned the business for 20 years, the actual sales part of the business died decades ago to big brands like Dell/HP. 

They just make money doing repairs, which is usually cheaper than the big retailers who turn their brains off and replace the entire motherboard etc

They bought the place decades ago when property prices were reasonable , so no rent, and the overhead is minimal
That's how it was with one of the places I used to work, it was a performance car parts shop.

We'd have heaps of people browsing but never buying, the best seller we had was car decals.

Most of his income was through Ebay.
And they’ll be likely out in the back room doing repairs.

Customers only need to be in there for a couple of minutes to drop off and pick up.
I've used that Northcote computer shop a few times. They also do repairs and I could walk there with my computer under my arm. I also bought a couple of peripherals from them, because yeah I developed a feeling of loyalty and felt confident they weren't ripping me off.
Don’t forget a lot of their business also includes older people who just don’t have the time or patience to learn about the ins and outs of computers. They don’t care about the new nvidia graphics cards they just need someone to help them recover photos from a broken laptop.
. They do most of their trading online
. They own the building so not much in the way of costs at the end of the day
5. Older person whose had the business for ages and loves the work, they'd rather keep working despite the lack of customers then call it quits and drop dead from boredom within a few years.
Would there be tax benefits I.e. say a wife was running a hobby business at a loss while the husband’s earnings were super high?
5/. OP is overestimating their overheads and they dont have a 100k yearly rental payment or any staffing costs. They could only make 60k gross profit and that is enough for them
Or 5. It's a tax lurk.
Real estate is the only game in town.
Please have some working and ready to play. I miss Skate or Die, Blue Max and California Games
Sorry, but you will probably have MANY customers!
I’d certainly come visit and buy your C64 stubby holder/hoodie or whatever :-)
Nostalgia has value
By 'boutique franchise' you mean 'hope and dream'
This is likely at least part of it. I'm semi retired and look after a mates shop a couple of days a week and can some days sit half or more of the day with no one coming in. I've also noticed people tend to come in clumps, ie you'll have no one for hours then you'll get half a dozen in 15min. Regardless of how many people physically come in, half or more of our sales are online and there's an endless amount of admin work to tend to.
Someone I know opened up a shopfront for their business because it was actually cheaper for the same amount of space than the warehouse they were originally looking at, and they figured that opportunities for sales to walk-ins etc. would just be a bonus.
Know of similar story…but the husband just wanted the wife out of the house on weekends. So he could read the weekend newspaper in peace.
Ha - I knew of a bookstore similar to that…. In Northern NSW…. Bless that lady was the loveliest I’d ever met. Loved her husband too
He passed away recently and [the storefront was sold](https://www.realcommercial.com.au/sold/property-143-145-union-road-ascot-vale-vic-3032-504552796). No idea who to, will be the end of an era when it inevitably gets renovated and rented out.
Not sure which visas you are referring to but I know a few business migrants and they have to show profitability to justify their visa allowing them to stay.
Yet they submit BAS every quarter claiming back thousands they supposedly paid in GST. And get good taxpayer funded money back.

The ATO is useless at enforcement. During the pandemic when businesses were closing and everyone was staying home the ATO failed to question why something like 80,000 new businesses got ABNs. And then failed to question why those businesses submitted BAS returns for refunds totalling hundreds of millions of dollars over the 2 years of the pandemic at a time when very few businesses had a turnover to warrant that type of behaviour. 

And of course they have never recovered 95+% of it and no one lost their jobs.

These 'slow' businesses you see probably all have a large employee list as well. If you're a taxpayer you're paying for the paid maternity leave for all the women who will be listed as having worked the required hours in the year leading up to the birth even though they've never been there.

There are many ways to pay for empty space.
Its illegal, so , no. /s
thats the lazy, channel 7 mentality

There are a lot of reason, many explain here

You'll notice some have been their forever, bought it cheap, not paying rent obviously, and now just half ars'e it

You'll notice these are the ones still around post covid,

Its the same reason for not making an effort to invest in decor
HIS NAME IS MANUEL AND WE WERE IN LOVE YOU BASTARD! 
😭😭😭😭😭😭
I should start a business where I come and root your pool boy for you so he’s not tempted by your missus

Or just gay pool boys 🤔
Seem plenty of them in well-off suburbs or upscale shopping strips. So rentals aren't cheap either.

And I swear 80% of the time it is childrens wear/artisan toys they are selling (the other 20% being womens wear).
r u  serious?
Sometimes; but in my experience those businesses are either snobby art galleries or boutique gift shops.
The old lady who owns it breeds peonies - hence the name “Peony Garden” - my mum’s bought peonies off her.   I figure she’s just holding onto the building until she dies and letting her kids deal with it.
>customer come in spurts
lol when combined with: 
>dont get their porn from the hub
every single 'boutique' in a regional/semi regional area. there's some bizarrely expensive homewares/decor shop in lithgow. LITHGOW.
Might be a pump-up scheme for the mall owner. Makes the mall look better with higher occupancy.
Especially when the sort of people who value quality pens are going to be getting them from an actual stationery shop or high-end department store, and everyone else will just get them from Kmart or Officeworks or the stationery cupboard at their work.
Those seem like real businesses though? They have product and it sells, they have different ranges for Australia Day, Easter, Halloween, Christmas.
Noooooooooooo..........

/s
I suspect they live for Christmas?
Another great question. Sheepskin seat covers aren't as popular as they once were, it seems?

I drive past these places sometimes:

* [Ilana on 20 Hoddle St, Abbotsford VIC 3067](https://maps.app.goo.gl/xfRrqCamLc8SmGzy9). They had a warehouse.

* [Cover Up Car Accessories on 548 Bell St, Preston VIC 3072](http://www.coverupcaraccessories.com/).

* [Car Sheepskin Covers on 174B Warrigal Rd, Oakleigh VIC 3166](https://carsheepskincovers.com.au/)
Old people
Makes sense. I have bought multiple computers and parts from a shop  full of old parts that people assume is closed down. (In South Australia)
Yes money laundering and tax offsets are a thing, but this is old style business that used to common
Yes but you don’t need customers for that
Easy search.  But "High St" happens everywhere and OP is not exclusively referencing a Melbourne suburb.
There must be so much money sloshing around the economy from drugs, if you think about how absolutely common it is. 

Example: all that cocaine sold every week in Sydney. Where’s the money from that end up? The tiny shop in Surry Hills that is never open?
Retail store where you can buy a tarot reading/fortune telling would be the fucking easiest way to launder the less than legal things
Putting my hand up to launder money, fabric conditioner extra.
I have seen a record store on the fringe of the CBD. The guy owns the building, has no children, and gets the bus to work. So survives with few sales.
Lots of places in Moonee Ponds are like this strangely, just down the road a few doors down is a shop that just sells and serves butter chicken and is never open but randomly saw it open at 7am on a Tuesday once.

Absolutely no one is buying butter chicken at that time.
Maybe Not the situation firing off yr senses, but 2nd hand meth smoke.
That's a brothel mate.
I lived a couple doors down from top dogs and the butter chicken shop. They both do Uber eats and top dogs does make a pretty mean smash burger.

The owner of top dogs and the cafe next to it is a bit of an eshay, he’s always hanging around there and puckle st general.

Don’t think they’re selling drugs out of there though
Mafia front. Don't look into it too much
Have a google of big dog diner Frankston or bendigo. Think it might be the same guy.
Strange. Usually fronts have the best food. Especially ones owned by the Italians
I did a trial shift there when they first opened. The owner had no restaurant experience. My interview was me trying to talk to him over the loud music as he set up for the night. 
The "manager/ supervisor " that was meant to show me what to do, showed up 20 minutes late for his shift, while I sat outside awkwardly. I asked him where the hand sink was so I could wash my hands before jumping into it. He looked at me like I grew an extra head. 
The whole thing left a sour taste in my mouth.
I poiletly declined the position. And haven't stepped foot back in the their since.
I'm never comfortable going to that top dog burgers. Those regulars who hang around deter  me from going.
Being charged $75 for a hot dog may clue you in
> Lets not forget all the old men coffee shops that are card game gambling dens with a coffee.

Where might one find such places, asking for a friend.
I swear the one on Sydney Rd got busted for being a front for something, I can't remember what though.
Same thing with a Hardware store in Barkly St Footscray. Its run by a Chinese guy its been there for years. He imports everything himself. Its a disorganised mess and everything looks like it just got dumped in a random fashion. He owns the building so hes in a good position. His good guy, he has had some health issues and on Saturday or some other days his young kids are sitting there in the darkness with no lights on. I have bought a lot crap from him whenever I drive past his store. His house is next door and you will see all the cardboard boxes on his veranda.
Idk there’s a family run hardware store in my tiny suburb they apparently make a lot more than their other one in a bigger town
Sounds like a dream gig tbh
even if you pay twice as much as Bunnings, decent odds that the product you get is ten times better
Love this story
there's a battery shop about 10 minutes from me, old guy, owns the building outright, doesn't make a lot of money off it, doesn't need to, could probably make more money leasing the place out or selling it off but he says without it he'd die of boredom.
a mom and pop store!
I've seen the man you're talking about. It's some little hole that's packed to the rim with stamps and he di snt even advertise anymore because word of mouth is what sustains him. No idea where I saw it but it was interesting.
This kind of thing is my actual dream job.
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTXkrtnfdr4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTXkrtnfdr4)

this the guy?
They pretty much are. They generally snap up low rent properties. The utilities and overhead are tiny. The employees are usually only paid a low wage and then a per customer basis which means it's bundled into the cost. Any extras all go to the employee. They tend to have small customer bases that will come back regularly.

But with extras some girls will make $1000+ a day. 

It's also an offset thing. It's seasonal and dependent on regulars. If you own a couple you can offset costs of the others when they're on lulls. And when they're all in a boom you make bank.
Massage therapist is on the skilled visa list. 

Come to Australia, open a massage business, bring your family and friends or anyone willing to pay over as a massage therapist and get PR.
Nail salons? I'd be lucky to get a walk in appointment at most of them near me since they are all so busy.
The phone repair shops are probably legit. Every bugger keeps dropping their phone or upgrading. 
Don’t discount the amount of repairs a kid can cause for an iPad
Nail salon has Saul Goodman in the back of it.
5 convenience stores in a 10 minute walking distance from mine, with 2 more under construction
I genuinely want a normal massage after work but balk at going into the places that seem a bit dodgy (open late, neon signs, blinds). I'm not judging them, I just would rather have my relaxing massage not in the adjacent room to some guy getting a happy ending. Do these places really get a lot of "normal massage" custom?
OMG there's more than one.
Is he the same one that got Arnold and Dudley drunk then showed them pornographic material?
On a note that is not related to the comment you’ve made to avoid doxxing, any chance you can let me know the name of the bike shop in thornbury so I can know a bit more in my area?
The grumpiest of them all. Loved his shop in south Yarra.
Some guitar stores are like that. No-one in there but you have to wait 2 months to get any work done.
This. Rent and Wages. If the shop is paid off and the proprietor works there by themselves then its do-able.
Yeah, i know someone who owns one of those shitty run down computer shops. He keeps old stock because anybody looking for newer stuff will buy from the multiple other computer shops online/in the area. Most of the company income come from repairs for businesses, specialty equipment and maintenance, keeping old servers working etc
You even see them in dying shopping centres and alley ways along with phone shops selling mobile repairs and bits. I really dont know how they survive paying such high rents for what looks like    a dead business. One of these stores was even a toner ink business. How do you pay monthly rent selling toner cartridge refills when a fast food store would not survive in the same location. Its really weird how long these businesses stay in these 1 locations for so long and survive. Maybe they are smart business people.

My brother owned a disposal store once. He sales primarily came from Xmas, Easter and long public holidays. He  would not sell any camping stuff after  the Xmas New years holiday season until Easter. 

The majority of his sales was key cutting, shoe laces, knife sharpening, blundstone boots, Dubbin, umbrellas and Japaras for winter.  It then died after Easter till xmas. Although in the area he was in he did well with day packs for students and travel  packs for backpackers. Sleeping bags were a top seller as well. He sold it because it was unprofitable and he was barely taking a wage. He always said if he owned the building then he would have done okay. So rent and outgoings was the killer. If you ever have a struggling business offer key cutting, its a non stop business thats a easy way to make money..
Yeah this 100%. Just had to get data recovered from an SSD that failed. Place I went was tiny and looked like the place op linked. They had stacks of labeled drives for repair though and a 3 week wait list.

These computer places that sell stock also don’t really have customers that browse. They come in knowing exactly what they want or to pick up an online order. When I go to one I’m usually in and out inside 3 minutes
Is that one one just near the end of Darebin Rd/High St with the music store next-door?
Yep, sometimes these businesses are actually being run by the landlord who owns the three shops next door. So they are mostly In the landlording business rather than the printer cartridge filling business. Especially those dusty businesses that have been around for 20+ years, back when commercial real estate was a lot cheaper
Or older retired dude is sitting out the back watching porn without his wife looking over his shoulder.
They are laundering their quality of life
Also in the case of fancy clothes/homewares/etc shops you can write off “sourcing trips” to fancy places
Your business needs to be making a profit for 3 years in every 5 for it to be able to count against other income for tax purposes.



The husband could own the business premises which he 'rents' to his wife for negative gearing tax deductions.
This is a common suspicion but it's better to make 50% of a dollar's profit than it is to make 0% of an expense.

Unless they're buying from their own entities, or buying things they want personally, running up expenses to reduce a tax bill is not something anyone actually does.
I have California Games in an original Epyx box. One of my pride and joys.
Genuinely my first thought hahaha. Those things aren't cheap.

What's your price for an FPGA-based clone /u/aurum_jrg :P
Before our era of hypercapitalism we weren't obsessed with maximum utilisation.
Oh, jeez. God bless him.

I think it will be demolished for sure.

Only if you get caught
Are you implying that it doesnt happen because its illegal? 🤣
I mean it makes sense, divorces are costly, and its hard to ignore infidelity as its embarrassing.

Cheap insurance for them to give her a business to run, also helps give her purpose and fulfillment in life, which probably keeps her happier in life.

Cheap for the benefit
Not the OP, but I have seen this occur. Maybe not rooting the poolboy side of things, but definitely get the bored wife into something to do for themselves.  Often in posh surburbs.

And I swear it is often a fancy children's wear/artisan toy business.

Prue & Trude in "Kath & Kim" where kinda a send-up of this.
He is serious, it happened to him
Smart lady if she is :)
true they do that at the one centre... some of these other spots a pretty prime locations
Was thinking something similar for the cellphone stores, they require minimal fitout and a proper one would be making money on repair/refurb or online sales. A retail address is desirable to ship in and out of and having a stockroom is also useful. To a mall you can exit them quickly and an open storefront looks better then empty. On the dodgy side phone cases are an easy high margin item that is easily disposed of when you reconcile your fake purchases against purchase orders and stock levels.
but still are there enough people and margin, buying High pens to support a mall... a lowend one at that... id think not
I've got no idea if any of them break even, I just know that a lot are part of citizenship consulting programs.
I went to a legitimate massage place who when I check in, pointed to a "No Happy Endings" sign. Lady, I'm in my 40s, I've had my hand on my dick for 40 years, like fuck am I paying money for someone to do it for me.
I'm in Sydney and I've seen more sheepskin seat cover shops than actual cars with sheepskin covers... who's buying them?? Is there an off shore black market or something??
Oh, I just meant the images OP linked are huuuuge. They wouldn't fit on a 4K monitor without zooming out, and I was wondering why they were loading like I was on dial-up. :-P
Fuck "easy search", this is r/australia if you wanna reference some random street in Melbourne at least tell us its a random street in melbourne and what its actually like.
True,  but the government gets its cut from these 'cash' businesses so there's no incentive to stop it.
Can confirm their butter chicken is unreeeeal!
457 visa rort, I’d report it. They hand the business over to someone new after they get it to scam the government.
Proof?
That guy is an a-hole!
True, the burger shop I used to go to I was recommending to my friend and I said "bro their burgers are so good they're like crack cocaine" and he laughed and told me he bulk buys his weed there
Or you're at Marvel/MCG
Give it a couple of years
I didn't know Maccas sold hotdogs.   :D
Behind The Bendigo is one of the best kebab places you'll ever go, just gotta hope there's enough stock on hand and the eyeballs of the regulars don't burn through you.
all up and down sydney road, swing a cat and you’ll hit one
The dude kidnapped someone and took them to the shop... and got caught. And then they found the drugs.

Oh yeah! If I had the moolah and the property, I'd open up a business that is tied to something I love and pass the time whilst helping others.
Can’t tell them to look up my damaged goods on the power pass and return it 3 years later though
Little big things you tube channel I think
No
And many cases its investors who buy these properties and either run a massage shop to pay off the building. 

There was one infamous "mamasaan" who was really a crime boss. She  owned like 5 or 6 buildings from where she operated her illegal brothels. She was just one these super rich mamasaan  triad criminal lady gangsters operating these massage shops that have been busted. They are super wealthy people from their illegal operations. When the police were busting these operators and the girls, the girls were found to be smart investors who were heavily invested in local property from their earnings. These cases were widely reported by the age and included operations from Office service type offices in downtown Melbourne. Who would suspect that an illegal brothels operates from a office buildings in Collins St!
Not to mention the insane markup on cases/accessories bought on Alibaba for cents per unit.
Omg the amount I spend at these places.... I wish there were more of them nearby.
Are they the ones full of our if date over priced American breakfast cereal?
Those are for vapes and cheap ciggies
I think the generally accepted test is whether they do health fund rebates. IIRC the insurance providers (or the government) cracked down on R&T joints with HICAPS machines a while back.
Exactly. Pretty much everyone at my work gets a massage at one place or another, but we all avoid any of the cookie cutter white out windows with glowing Open signs until late 7 days a week. Generally speaking if you can't see through the front windows then it's probably for a reason
The shop was called Finnigans cycles. Just found out they’ve closed permanently and the guy passed away. I’ll say no more on the poor old bloke out of respect for him passing ( if this was the shop you were referring to. )

If you need some recommendations for other decent bike shops let me know if you ride road, mtb, bmx, whatever, and I’ll give some good recommendations for stores
Wasn’t it something. I loved that little period about ten years ago when it was both shifter & Northside wheelers. I have lost touch with both Mal and Dan in the years since but I hope both the grumpy bastards are doing well.
it's doable, but if they're in a location with a high rent, they're really just forgoing the rental income (which doesn't show up on the balance sheets of the business, but it's an actual lost income).
>	These computer places that sell stock also don’t really have customers that browse. They come in knowing exactly what they want or to pick up an online order. When I go to one I’m usually in and out inside 3 minutes

MSY dream customer. I can still remember distinctly the audible groans from everyone else in line when someone at the front of the line starts asking the guy at the counter noob questions
Actually I think I got the wrong one now that I look at the pic again. I was thinking of the one across from the Northcote Social Club and up a bit.
And it's running at a loss as a tax dodge.
In Perth - there’s a relaxation shop that sells stuff like crystals and it has survived covid and the GFC.

It’s inside the Hillarys Boat Harbour complex and has been there since the 90s.

The only thing about it that’s changed is that the shop front has either reduced in size or they moved to a smaller shop there.

How do you think they are making it work? Do you think it’s making a profit in 3 out of 5 years?

I don’t think they ever owned the shop space in considering they downsized.
I'm thinking more along the lines of places with very little overhead (own the premises outright and don't have any employees) which bring in just enough revenue that they'd be in danger of actually having some taxable profit every now and then. In that case, writing off a new company car or a research trip to Europe as a business expense would be worth it.
Man I wish this was the tax dodge instead of negatively gearing houses
If you had “original copy” money, I’m surprised money’s an issue now. My goodness, what an absolute treasure
I am the footbag king!
Yeah, that sounds about right. I imagine something similar to what they did with the Metro Woolies further down the road.
Great article, exactly what I was looking for. Thanks!
Good to see at least one case where the initiative worked. Most other businesses are 'profitable' only because the extended family pitches in to cook the books; then it gets 'sold' to the next arrival.
Ofcourse mate, thats like the whole point of things being illegal. Take piracy for example...
No, which is my point. I was agreeing with you.
Are you incapable of cut'n'paste to Maps?  Jeez, lazy AF.
“Butter chicken” is a well-known industry euphemism for bareback anal intercourse.
I'm confused, which part of what you just posted doesn't sound like a brothel? Even the foods on point...
Imagine going back and asking for your hot dog 😂💀
Lots of Melbourne-specific references I'm just not getting at all lol.(I think)
I'm in Adelaide, so alas I cannot enjoy all these places you have in Melbourne and Sydney. I'm sure we have our own sordid little grief holes, but I haven't the courage to ask about them on the Adelaide subreddit.
at a completely different Bunnings store nonetheless
Thank you. I suspect I was doom scrolling lol.
I was going to say this. One person working, charges upwards of $100 to replace a phone battery (sourced from alibaba) and takes them 10 minutes. 

Phone cases have an absolutely ridiculous markup.
Overpriced as fuck, but one of them has American sodas for $2 so can't complain
Ooh that is a genuinely useful tip thank you. I can call and ask if they do healthcare rebates, I can't really call and ask the other question haha
Thanks mate. Good on you, sad to hear about his demise. 

I ride a road, from Preston down the main city radio, around to across the river and back.
I’m still mates with Mal he’s just as you remember him I think he’s mellowed over the years. I don’t do much cycling these days but for a time I adored the Melbourne cycling scene and doing the crits and beach road was the place to be. I even moved to Mallorca for a while and ran a cycling clothing shop of my own. Cycling has always been a series of peaks and troughs, and the characters it creates shine and then dim like celestial moments in time.
I’m guessing someone who enjoys what they are doing and is make some profit (eg fixing computer & electronic devices or teaching music) maybe doesn’t care enough to go chasing high rental returns.
Sometimes gaining maximum income is not the answer 😉
> I can still remember distinctly the audible groans from everyone else in line when someone at the front of the line starts asking the guy at the counter noob questions

I was at the Clayton store once.  Long line, someone went in with a list of parts probably supplied by someone more knowledgeable than them.  Motherboard on list wasn't in stock, customer started asking questions about alternatives.  After 2 questions and a third starting the staff rep said "Please do research or ask friend and come back when you know what you want" then gestured to the next customer.  

This was close on 10 years ago, but it really epitomises MSY, all the customer service of an online store but in person.

I still mourn the loss of parts.pdf
I love going into MSY and having the guy at the desk try and tell me that some randos post on a reddit thread means that australian consumer law no longer applies to whatever I am buying. I always laugh and say No matter how many times you guys get fucked by the ACCC you never learn your lesson. They get shitty with me at that point.
So many ‘gift shops’ near me that keep the wife busy and operate as a tax dodge.
Yep, reasons like that can help keep an existing business open when it might otherwise have closed, for sure.
Metro Woolies was built in the New Ascot Theatre which was a cinema until the mid 1970s, then a reception centre.  
So it's huge. The biggest building on Union Rd.

The next biggest would be Union Hall. That was a gym for many years from the 1980s. Previously various things. I recall them selling carpets in there in the 1970s.  
I think its Paramount Fitness still.

There's a few other old shops on Union of a similar or smaller size to Telesonics that have been converted or rebuilt into shopfronts with apartments. I'd be surprised if it re-opened as one big shop with a refitted interior, but you never know.

The redevelopment has  changed the character of the street as they are bland ordinary modern boxes. If you look above the shops you can see which ones are original and which are new.
Yes i understand now because piracy doenst happen. Ive never pirated anything,
Agreed... just another WTF situation in Australia... and that to the property laundering game
That's the grossest thing I've read on Reddit this week, and that's definitely saying something.
Wow you learn something new everyday.
I'm never gonna feel the same ordering that again! :)
I don’t know what brothels are like, I guess.

I suppose I’m confused because they could just open a brothel… since restaurants and food venues aren’t known for being cheap to run.
For decent bike shops there’s not a huge amount this far north. You can head further out to bicycle centre south morang, good crew in there. Or head in closer and go summit cycles Fitzroy, bike now south Melbourne, total rush Richmond. All those have good experience with road bikes
Especially when their land/premises is appreciating at a fast rate with no effort on their part.
Yep, sometimes it's getting away from the wife/family.

Some people do feel going from working full time to retiring and having your mrs in your ear literally 24/7 unimaginable - that's why plenty of Japanese who have retired from their corp jobs open up a small bar or restaurants. This way they have a plausable reason to be somewhere else and total control of what's goes on there.
I’ve been going to MSY since they operated out of a residential house in Mt Waverley in 1995(before they opened their first proper retail store in East Malvern) when it was still being operated by their founder who would also go to swap meets every weekend to sell his wares. His customer service back then was great but as he took a back seat to actually manning the business and just concentrated on expanding the business, customer service has just kept getting worse and worse.
Pretty sure they actually have a strict policy on not giving advice or recommendations. When they have lines out the door like they do you can’t expect staff to start researching what specific part is going to be perfectly compatible with each and every other part the user wants. They’d get way too many fools coming back being like “but your guy told me to buy this one!” when something goes wrong on their build. 

There’s plenty of other stores you can go to for that kind of service but their prices won’t be as good as MSY.
I genuinely cannot think of a way that would come up organically, something tells me there's a lot more happening in your scenario and them getting shitty at you is for something else entirely.
Just wait to you learn what ordering the "Beef vindaloo, extra hot and double rice" gets you.
You should search truffle butter
Usually the illegal brothels also sell speed/meth for extra revenue and keeping the customers going for longer/paying for longer
What a strange comment, it's really not healthy to resent the people in your life this much.
This just brought back so many great memories. MSY, swap meets, the green guide on Wednesdays? Overclocking, buggy drivers, constant blue screens. All for a couple of extra FPS lugging the tower to a mates house.
Last time it happened to me : 

Walk into MSY to get a 850W power supply with a 16 pin pci5 connector to drive a rtx4090 a couple of days after they were released. Guy at the desk says MSI posted on their forum and reddit that they have had problems with the cable breaking if you unplug them more than 5 times. I respond that's obviously a manufacturing problem that is explicitly covered by australian consumer law. He says the forum post means it's not. I laugh and point out their history of getting reamed by the ACCC.

Seriously, have you ever heard of MSY?

People are just used to having their own spaces. Together 24/7 is just way too different for some.
