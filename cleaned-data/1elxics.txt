And yet we have one of the highest rates of deforestation in the world

[Over 7.7 million hectares of forest and bushland was destroyed by land clearing between 2000 and 2017. That’s an area the size of Ireland. Australia is the only ‘developed’ country on the list of global deforestation hotspots.](https://www.wilderness.org.au/protecting-nature/deforestation/the-stats-that-expose-australias-hidden-deforestation-crisis)
Bullshit. Some of the oldest forests in the world are being cut down right now in Tasmania. The Tasmania government doesn't care and neither does the federal. 

We cut everything down but we've replanted moncrop forests look at how well we're doing! They won't be healthy at all but more forests aye
> Australia has recorded the second-highest rate of reforestation, an increase of 4.4 million hectares of forest area for the decade from 2010 to 2020, that is, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) State of the World’s Forests report published yesterday.

…

> Nonetheless, the world’s growing stock of trees is declining, from 560 billion m3 in 1990 to 557 billion m3 in 2020, primarily driven by competition from agricultural land-clearing.
Correct, if you look at the time frames (2000-2017) in the link you provided. Deforestation in Queensland and NSW was very high in the early 2000s but that came to a halt in 2008. SA and WA forest area has progressively increased since 1989. Since 2008 the total forest area in Australia is increasing which is encouraging. I am cautiously optimistic that the tide is turning.

Metres cubed on a global scale…… why?
There are many different forest types. An acre of African savanna woodland looks very different to an acre of Amazon rainforest. Meters cubed is an easy measurement to quantify biomass or carbon stored.
