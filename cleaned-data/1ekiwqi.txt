We‚Äôve done really well with the past olympics in terms of swimming medals, only managed like 3 golds in London or Rio I think
Since the days of Thorpe/Hackett/Klim etc why does our mens team severely lag behind the women's? Is there much reason for it?
Medals won by Coach Dean Boxall's squad.
4 Gold.
5 silver.
2 bronze.
Stop the Count!
What is it with Australians and swimming? I mean, I'm a Kiwi so I'm no slouch, learned to swim at a young age and grew up swimming in the sea, etc etc. While my wife is from Darwin so the sea was totally off-limits to her cos of the crocs and stingers. Plus which, I'm pretty active while she's bookish and hates sport. But when we go to the pool? No contest. She absolutely blitzes me. It's embarrassing.
Breakdown of medals won by Australia in 2024 Paris



|Medals|Women|Men|Mixed|Total|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Gold|6|1||7|
|Silver|4|4||8|
|Bronze|1|1|1|3|
|Total|11|6|1|18|

In comparison for Tokyo it was 9 Gold, 3 Silver, and 9 Bronze.
Australia is gonna dominate in Brisbane 2032. Best performance ever should be expected?
Team Fox in the white water canoe/kayak events = 3 gold. If only they'd had a brother or two as well.
With China now starting to take swimming seriously, I'm scared that we will start seeing less dominance from Australia now... 

Swimming was literally our cash cow when it came to gold medals, but every Olympics China is getting more competitive and we are now seeing less gold because of it.
The Americans spamming and trolling on the Aussie Olympic Teams Instagram page are atrocious. Sadly I think LA 28 might be our worst Olympics. The Americans are going to be almost unbeatable in the pool on home soil.
The women are killing it
Considering that USA has roughly 12 times the population of Australia, our athletes have delivered a stellar performance
Nice
Great effort Australia!! 10 medal difference between USA and Australia swim teams. Only a one gold medal difference.Estimated USA population 341,814,420.
Estimated Australian population 26,699,482.
Australia doesn't get enough credit for punching far above its weight in a lot of areas.

I work in the video game sector and the same goes for us there, too.
HELLL YEAHH
Well done üëç
Start counting by gold now cunts
YAY
I guess the complaint about the U.S always listing medals by Total rather than Gold is moot now, eh?
Team USA
The USA really own coming second. Good for them.
I don't care anymore.
Population wise we are more or less the best as we bring more talent for our population
The Americans just racking up bronze‚Ä¶.
After all that cheating, China get two golds? Pffft

I want to know why the sport I‚Äôm currently watching isn‚Äôt called ‚ÄúThe Wall‚Äù, and I don‚Äôt know where the Gladiator is.

Happy to see Gladiators in the olympics though.

Also, that Hockeyroo choke was one for the ages.
At what point do we stop caring about Swimming again?
always  pleasure to see you guys failing in every metric after being annoying braggarts
[removed]
Aren‚Äôt all the Aussie gold so far won by women? Cool.
Wasn‚Äôt Rio a particularly tremendous failure from our Swim team? I seem to remember reports that the team culture was completely fucked and heavily contributed to the lack of golds.
If I had to guess it's that there's just more global competition in men's events. Australia has world class programs for both men and women, but lots of countries around the globe don't have anywhere near the investment in women's sports when compared to men's.
Same story as to why the Socceroos hang between 20-35 in FIFA rankings while the Matilda‚Äôs sit on the fringes of the top 10: Early Adopters Advantage. Australia was early to seriously invest in women‚Äôs sport, and we‚Äôve now got many generations of learnings about what does and doesn‚Äôt work in coaching, strategy and approach to competition that other nations don‚Äôt have. In men‚Äôs sports, we have to rely exclusively on the quality of the national program and innovating faster than others since we don‚Äôt have an early adopters advantage. Not to say our women‚Äôs program isn‚Äôt also great, but we don‚Äôt have an inbuilt advantage on the men‚Äôs side.

Even historically, so many of our greatest and most iconic athletes have been female. Fraser, Court and Goolagong-Cawley early on, Ash Barty, Min Jee Lee and all our swimmers more recently. I‚Äôm missing a bunch too.
Because Thorpe and Hackett were insane and basically carried the team. 

In Sydney, Thorpe and Hackett were responsible for 3 gold medals. 400m 1500m and 4x200m.

Thorpe also swam in the gold medal 4x100.

In fact in 2000 and 2004 we didn't get a single men's gold medal that didn't involve those two.
I think it's because countries like China have now started to be more competitive in swimming and stealing some of our athletes thunder.

Before, USA and Australia didn't have much competition. Now China is taking some of the Gold that we had in the bag previously...
afl and rugby
The era of michael Phelps gave us a bit of a dry spell for gold, so popularity wasn‚Äôt quite there.
They had already. That count was old when they posted it, out by a couple of days.
As someone who also grew up in Darwin, the water wasn't off limits. If anything, the risk of cross, box jelly fish etc made us faster üòÑ
Kiwi, now living in Aus - it‚Äôs warmer and you can swim in unheated pools much more of the year.
Plus there‚Äôs a bunch of ocean-based activities that are much more pleasant at 30^C than 20^C
Because for most of the country (I'm making big generalisations) we grow up with water. Each summer it's drilled into us how to behave at a beach or around water. Most schools have a swim program. Most children start swimming before they even hit Primary school. It's just something you are taught that you need to know.
There is usually a build up of medals before a country hosts the Olympics, so I would predict that we will see even more gold in 2028, and in 2032.
Sadly I wonder if we‚Äôve peaked too early for BNE32. Generational talents like McKeown and Titmus will have retired by then.
It will be very difficult to surpass the domination of 1956 in Melbourne.

Australia won 8 golds out of 13 events. Australia were 7 from 7 in Freestyle events.
Like France this year they‚Äôll pump money into Aus athletes to be ready for 2032. I wonder if Gina sponsored a lot of the smaller sports again for Paris? I know she supported the volleyballers last games so they could live.
Unless we find more sports to win Gold, LA 28 might be our worst Olympics. The host nation always overperforms and that will surely be seen in the pool by the Americans.
There must be something..... in the water to make the Chinese swimmers so good.......
They are the very definition of "sore winners".
It was brought on by all the dumb anti American tik Tok videos that the Aussies have been posting.
Especially comparing our gold medals in general to China who have over 1 billion ppl!
Ok, then India and China should be dominating by that logic!
And gold & silver....
Why are you Americans always so insecure lol
I was going to downvote because rage or something, then I realised you're being contrary either for the sake of it, to point out hypocrisy, or simply to provide a form of devil's advocacy. All of which I find myself frequently doing, so... *chapeau*
We're literally still top 3, and yeah I am gonna brag about our performance. Australia is literally less than 12 times smaller population-wise than the US, we punch well above our weight. Would 100% rather be Australian than from the United States of Bronze and Silver
Yeah, Australians online are legitimately really, very annoying. It‚Äôs not like this irl. It‚Äôs just the type of people that congregate on reddit
No.
You got buried for this, I wonder what are people upset about?
Are you insinuating that women are less than?
Yeah, there was wild partying and orgies and stuff‚Ä¶..allegedly.
I also believe that the water (drinking) had people getting sick and the time of the heats/ finals were at crazy times and we didn‚Äôt have enough time to adjust.
London was the bad one. Only one gold in swimming from one of the women's relays. 3 gold at Rio.
This; but also competition of other sports. 

In Australia, athletically gifted kids are more likely to get funnelled into soccer, AFL, League, Union, even basketball.

If you look closer at the medal breakdown, a disproportionate amount of them are from QLD. To start with, genetically, ‚ÄòAussies‚Äô as in British descendant, white kids- are more likely to be of that 6ft tall, athletic build. Attributes that are perfect to excel in competitive swimming. 

In qld, kids are more likely to stick with water sports, because the aforementioned team sports aren‚Äôt AS big there, then say, surfing might be. 

I think (more) boys of the same build growing up in Victoria end up playing AFL, for eg. 

True, the same can be said for girls, but less so. So it‚Äôs more conceivable that a girl sticks with swimming.
Yeah that's true, but competitive swimming is also more emphasised by the "richer" nations anyway that should in theory have less of a gender imbalance. It's totally different to something like women's soccer where the "women don't play football" mentality was historically strong.

Now the gap there is starting to close as more countries are taking it seriously.

We're not a special case on the "women don't play football" front either; just which one was the taboo for girls is different. For the Yanks that meant gridiron, and for us it was Rugby League and Aussie Rules.
Basically you need to have a genetic advantage to excel in swimming, not many of those people around, and after Thorpe and Hackett the yanks found Phelps who dominated men‚Äôs swimming for a while. Now the hunt is on for the next great swimmer
Shit I never thought of that! Kinda like how all the fastest runners come from the countries that have lions.
Here in Melbourne it‚Äôs to fucking cold
And that's especially true for Darwin
And an after effect, as we‚Äôre seeing with Japan currently
Not so sure, because our biggest competitor is USA and it's their home games
Why is that? Better funding?
But new generational talent can and likely will emerge
And even then only came second
Americans will definitely have that one in the bag 300 million people to choose from and they don‚Äôt even have to go far
It's called focus and dedication in raising a new generation. I know what you are 'implying'  by your comment, but you're talking about a nation that has become a powerhouse so quickly economically and in stem fields with their approach to things, it is easy to see how anything they choose to focus on they will also begin to dominate quickly. 

Australia on the other hand has shifted its focus to filling our politicians' pockets and helping the rich get richer, instead of helping our younger generations.
There whole more medals over all thing is funny like come on you know when athletics comes around you come back so don‚Äôt be a little bitch for the first week
yeah it‚Äôs literally all the aussies faults lol blame yourselves for once
I think their population is over 50 times that of ours.
They should!
Yeah America is currently number one in gold, silver, bronze and total medals.
You guys were the ones creaming your pants when you say Australia had more medals than the USA.¬†

It‚Äôs so obvious you guys aren‚Äôt cheering on for love of the sport, but because you‚Äôre insecure losers who want to see America lose. It‚Äôs so obvious.¬†
america has more gold medals than australia does, cope harder
My bad to that one tennis duo Matthew Ebden/John Peers
Inaccuracy, probably. Blokes have won 2 golds I think?
Yeah I was a few days behind in the news! Which is why I phrased it at a question. The upset is giving snowflake üòÇ
Nope. Are you inferring that?
That sounds like the best team culture, how did they fuck that up
I'm hoping it was the orgies though.
Yep also the whole James Magnussen situation
Apologies if singling out ‚Äòwhite kids‚Äô came across as racist.

It‚Äôs more a discussion of genetics, and cultural interests.

The same reason why the Penrith Panthers are incredibly ‚Äòstacked‚Äô; is the proportionally higher population of Polynesian kids in that feeder area.
They're all from Queensland because anyone who's a good swimmer moves there in their childhood. Queensland is the hub for swimming so they'd be shooting themselves in the foot if they don't go there.
No literally I grew up in QLD and I was swimming in same club as Mollie O‚ÄôCallaghan, trained on same tennis courts as Ashleigh Barty and did rowing with trainers who had been at olympic levels. We have global sports stars as our neighbours. I think QLD is the best for sport and only getting better because of upcoming 2032 olympics.
I don't think it's racist. Systemic success in an elite sport is generally due to a confluence of genetics (anyone who says different races don't tend towards advantageous phenotypes for different sports is blind), accessibility and cultural acceptability.
For Victoria most athletes end up in AFL or Basketball. Melbourne is the birthplace of the most NBA number 1 draft picks of any city in the world, including in USA.
I‚Äôm from Melbourne and I played gridiron cause I just don‚Äôt have the speed or build for something like AFL. Kind of jealous of the American schools that have gridiron and wrestling
I think swimming has a significant class element in talent identification and development as well.¬† AFL and basketball seem to be able to take kids of Sudanese descent (among the tallest peoples in the world with a high percentages of extremely tall individuals) and make centers/PFs or ruckman/key forwards/key defenders out of them.¬† Swimming selects for height and I am not aware of any high-level swimmers of Sudanese descent.
Generally yes. When a country is commited to spending several billion dollars to make the games happen, they also put some funds into training athletes up to a competative level too.
I do really hope you‚Äôre right, but I don‚Äôt know about it being ‚Äòlikely‚Äô‚Ä¶ the whole point of ‚Äògenerational‚Äô talent is that it only comes once in a generation (e.g. once every 20 years). It was a long wait between Thorpe/Hackett and Titmus/McKeown. The US was so lucky to have Michael Phelps and Katie Ledecky emerge consecutively over successive olympics.
Huh?

How do you figure that?
A country born of criminals and yet you all get butt hurt over hearing the US national anthem! USA USA USA!
Took 340 million of you all to beat 26 million of us by 1 gold medal ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£

None of us are insecure, im incredibly proud of that output from australia
You're literally more active in r/Australia than you are in any US focused sub. Idk why you're so obsessed with us but it's hilarious. 

We're proud of our athletes, and we're proud of our country. We win more per capita but we don't chuck a fit when we lose, nor do we harass other countries or their athletes. Australia always does well at the start with the swimming then falls off, we all know this. We make fun of the US medals at the start specifically because we know you get riled up about it, you take it so seriously even though it's obvious that we don't actually think we'll beat you at all?

So idk why you're commenting multiple times about this in the Australian sub when we all know this is how the Olympics would go, we'd come out with an early lead then get beaten by the bigger countries once the non-swimming events really kick off. This is the other reason we brag about beating the US at the start, it's because we know we'll fall behind. It's not serious and we're not actually trying to say anything beyond "haha look at the big country, our tiny country is beating them (for now)" - Australian culture generally dislikes actual arrogance/cockyness, preferring to layer any arrogance with a healthy dose of irony.
It's honestly embarassing that you guys took this so seriously lmao, but I guess it speaks to your culture that you'd be so offended by us
Has more school shootings too
I'd care but I live in Australia and not US and that beats all your arguments.
I can‚Äôt speak to his gender identity, but Cam McEvoy won the men‚Äôs 50m freestyle.
Just the one in the swimming but yeah

Mens doubles tennis the other gold for the men so far
Seems an awful lot like you're dismissing the quality of Aussie gold because of who has won them. Could you explain what you meant if it is otherwise?
"You need a qualifying time to attend the orgies" would have me training pretty bloody hard.
Apparently many of them were hungover  on the day of the competition.
They were all too busy trying to not come first I suspect.
The orgies are part of every Olympics, some athletes include it in their training regimen
What did he do?
I 100% get what you are saying but the Penrith Panthers aren't winning because of Polynesian kids. They are winning due to the pathways and development of those kids. A decent chunk of their best players are Nathan Cleary, Dylan Edwards, Yeo, Martin ect.
This, Titmus is from Tasmania and moved to Queensland at 15 for training opportunities. By this measure Summer McIntosh is from Florida (as are seemingly every golfer and tennis player) and even L√©on Marchand is apparently a Seppo.
Slightly misleading fact as one of those #1 picks is Kyrie Irving, an American born to American parents who moved back to America at age 2
Not true. Melbourne is no.1 of all cities outside the US. Chicago and NYC both have more number 1 draft picks than Melbourne.
Australia didn‚Äôt finish with the most in the Melbourne games
Exactly what I was going to say.

350,000,000 of them and this is their offering.

Somehow they arent talking about their performance in shooting either, which really surprised me as they practice on each other all the time!
I‚Äôm an Aussie and Aussies are fkn obnoxious and insecure af. It‚Äôs on full display on this sub all the time
australians dislike arrogance? that's hilarious! you were literally saying you were proud to brag about australias pathetic amount of medals. lol. lmao, even.
the retroactive backpeddling is HILARIOUS

"um, achshually, we didnt actually care about beating you guys. we were just trying to rile you guys up. we always knew we would lose ü§ì"
That‚Äôs awesome. Go them!
Dismissing!? No. I was championing (in my eyes). Does the ‚Äúcool‚Äù sound sarcastic? I genuinely think it is cool. 

Data is cool.
Specifically, the data point that on the 2nd of August all our golds had thus far came via women. That‚Äôs cool!
I wonder if you‚Äôre learning about an unconscious bias you have, because of how you read it? 
No hate here, swear to god.
Haha... Hard
How is an orgy exercise to an elite athlete? Active recovery maybe.
There was a lot of hype around him being a potential multiple gold medal winner but he ultimately didn't get a single one, later on there were reports of¬†poor behaviour before the Games https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/23/sports/olympics/australian-swimmers-at-olympics-admit-to-taking-prescription-drug-and-making-pranks.html
100% get what you‚Äôre saying, it‚Äôs true that the pathways and development of those kids is why they‚Äôre successful today. 

But Edwards (Albury), Yeo (Dubbo) and Martin (Temora) are all from and played juniors in; Country NSW; not Western Sydney. Which traditionally also are hotbeds for League talent (al be it generally white).

I was specifically inferring to the Polynesians To‚Äôo (St Mary‚Äôs), Luai (St Mary‚Äôs), Leota (St Mary‚Äôs)‚Ä¶former players Crichton (St Clair) and Leniu (Minchinbury). The common thread is there.

I know I‚Äôm generalising here, so my point wasn‚Äôt meant to be literal to everyone on the team- but the sentiment still stands.
This.¬† For those who don't know, 3 of those 4 are NSW "Country" players that played their juniors a good distance outside Sydney.¬† They are Panthers because Penrith has put a lot into bush footy to develop pathways and support teams/comps out there.


And Clearly is of course a coach's son whose dad just happened to take the Penrith job when he was entering secondary school/juniors.
We usually stopped claiming him once it was revealed he was an antivaxer lol
Who are the Chicago & NYC Number 1 picks?
In the swimming? Yes they did.

In all sports they didn't come 2nd they came 3rd.
Touch grass seppo
I mean to be fair we did always know we‚Äôd lose I have not spoken to a single Australian who thought we may beat america lmao. We are decent swimmers and have a good rivalry with america and are proud as we are much smaller than america that‚Äôs really all there is to it 

Don‚Äôt you find it slightly embarrassing how obsessed people get with this
Right, I have the bias. I think you're a bit of a loser. Good bye
idk, I am not an Olympian and the only orgy I participated in was kind of a disaster
I dont think the sentiment does stand, though. The Polynesian kids aren't making the team successful. The Penrith system is. If this was the case. Parramatta, Bulldogs, and Tigers would be much more consistent.
**Chicago:**

* Cazzie Russell
* LaRue Martin
* Doug Collins
* Mark Aguirre
* Derrick Rose
* Anthony Davis

**New York City:**

* Si Green
* Art Heyman
* Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
* Bob Lanier
* Elton Brand
* Greg Oden
I was talking overall
its funny, the people who usually shout "touch grass" are the ones who are the most chronically online.
*Cries in proud of be an Aussie woman*
Ok can you give us an outline of what happened?

I almost had a threesome once but didn't understand the situation. Classic case of "Doh!" a couple of years later.
I play league and it‚Äôs just a fact the 90% of the islanders are gonna be better players than the white fellas. Half the blokes I play with don‚Äôt even train, they‚Äôre just fucking talented people
The Tigers are probably the most consistent team in the NRL, in their own way
Ok. It was 3rd overall my 2nd.

OPs tally was swimming only.
I work in ecology brotha my job is to touch grass üòÇ cope harder
Don't worry too much about it. Its mostly pretty awkward
I play league as well. Downvote me all you want. The Penrith development is winning them premierships, not genetics. It helps but we've seen lazy gifted players. They aren't winning comps.
hm, i have a hard time believing that. send visual proof of you touching grass. in fact, im pretty sure australia is so dry it doesnt even grow grass.
Mostly :)
I'm pretty sure any grass that could exist in the US has actually been paved over for another 12 lane highway
Thats because youre an uncultured landlocked American who believes every depiction of a country they see on TV.
Sounds like you're the terminally online one just hanging around random subs riling people up lol there mustn't be much to do in the land of school shootings and fentanyl
