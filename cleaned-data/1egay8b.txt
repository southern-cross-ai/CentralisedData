So we have a sick child, been two days now, and my partner's employer is asking for a sick certificate, not for the kid, but my partner. She is only casual..I looked online for clarity, but really couldn't find anything specific..Any clarity please or links. TIA.

Just want to point out if your partner is a casual, she by law is not required to provide any evidence for an absence. That’s the entire point of being a casual.
You are just after a medical certificate/carers cert. Any GP can write them to include both child & carers requirements.

Pharmacies can also issue absence from work certificates for minor medical conditions as well, check with your local pharmacies, I'm not sure if they can issue them for children though.

If you don't have one already, they are not supposed to be backdated prior the date of the consult, but some GP's may do it for you.

If you can't get a medical certificate they are supposed to accept a statutory declaration.
An employer can ask for evidence for why someone may be absent from work - 

Casual employees or contractors do not get any paid sick or carer’s leave, but can access [unpaid carer’s leave](https://www.fairwork.gov.au/leave/sick-and-carers-leave/unpaid-carers-leave).

* As an employer, you can ask an employee to give evidence to confirm why they have been away from work at any time. However, you might have a specific policy about when it is required. An employee’s [medical certificate](https://www.fairwork.gov.au/leave/sick-and-carers-leave/paid-sick-and-carers-leave/notice-and-medical-certificates) doesn't have to give exact details about the injury or illness.

Are you sure their not looking for a careers certificate?
That's what I thought .But company policy states they must provide a certificate..
> If you don't have one already, they are not supposed to be backdated prior the date of the consult, but some GP's may do it for you.

The certificate itself cannot be backdated, but a doctor can add additional information to the medical certificate certifying that the period of illness occurred prior to the consultation date. This must be requested during the consultation and is always up to the doctor’s discretion as to whether they deem it to be appropriate
Awesome info, thank you kindly.
Great resources, and info. Thanks a bunch.
Possibly, a fellow Redditor has cleared it up for me. I appreciate the feedback, thanks.
Company policy can say whatever it wants, it doesn’t make it enforceable. 

You’re not actually applying for sick leave, as sick leave isn’t paid to casuals, you’re not applying for leave without pay, because you don’t have access to leave regardless you’re giving notice of unavailability. 

If a workplace has issue with this, my first advice is find a new workplace that cares enough to follow the law and not try to bully employees who may not be aware of their rights.
This is accurate. My mother passed interstate while I was temping casually. It was during intermittent covid lockdowns, I was unsure if I could get there, but informed my "employer" that if I could, I would not be there on X dates, and if I couldn't, I would not be here on day of funeral. They came back to me when lockdown was lifted and said "your leave has been approved". Oh honey, I wasn't asking, I was telling you I wouldn't be here.
When I quit, after many different things occurred, I quit first thing in the morning, said I won't be coming back tomorrow. "That's  ot enough notice..." um, please read my temp contract I can leave in 45 minutes actually
I totally agree, thanks for the advice.
