Well they're certainly a type... I think the saying is 'shitbirds flock together'?
Now there's a twist I didn't see coming.

Will this saga ever end?  And who will play old Brucey in the inevitable miniseries?
Why would Lehrmann have documents about submarines in his house?  

Also why doesn't Labor go harder after the LNP about this shit?  Their judgement is so bad that they apparently think it's a good idea to hire a guy who faces multiple rape charges, is found on the balance of probabilities to be a rapist and now apparently might have stolen state secrets in his house, then to run a media campaign to try to support him when his true nature becomes apparent.
> “You would think the NACC would have $2.45 million other things to investigate,’’ she added, in a veiled reference to Brittany Higgins compensation payout.

You would think the lawyer for a man on trial for rape would avoid any reference to another case where her client has been adjudicated as having committed rape.

But maybe that's just me.
I wonder how he feels about a non-consensual intrusion.
>Mr Macgowan has described the allegations as an “insane conspiracy” that he said to a journalist in a conversation as “a joke” that he now understands was recorded.

So... He thought he could say stuff to a journalist and it would never be mentioned again?
When I need a media minder, I too seek out a scruffy bloke in snakeskin pants with a durry hanging out of his mouth.
>”It’s called Operation Ivanhoe. I read it in their notebooks when they were walking around,” he said.

“I’m totally not the type of guy who would leak official government secrets, but here’s the name of their classified operation that I sneakily read off their official government documents while they were raiding me for allegedly leaking offical government documents, which I definitely did not do.”
Wonder how that freak who got Lehman's ugly ass mug as a tattoo is dealing with this....
Isn’t every raid dramatic? 

Bring the sledgehammer forward !
Pity no one has ever tried to answer where Brucey got the copious amount of Columbia’s finest dancing powder that he seems to enjoy so much.
"John Macgowan's snake tank, home to Linguini Pesto the coastal carpet python."  You couldn't make this up if you tried.
Against his will? How fitting

JFC this guy is the gift that keeps on giving. Channel Ten should make a miniseries, broadcast over two compelling nights - "The fall and fall of Bruce Lehrmann" or somesuch.

I'm sure some of you can come up with a better title.
Can we please just make all of these people go away?
Bruce Lehrmanns ‘home’ is the funniest party of this , he’s a broke-ass rapist who couch surfs wherever he can find a sucker.
BL has really screwed things up for us round-faced guys that have a beard and wear glasses. If I'm ever wearing a suit, women cover their drinks the moment I enter a room.
by home they mean pigsty surely (based on his last eviction)
Why is convicted rapist Bruce Lehrmann in the news every other week?
Macgowan’s lawyer is Zali Burrows? That’s scraping the bottom of the barrel a bit.
Get him
So now he's going to reinvent himself as a martyred whistleblower 😂

You can't make this shit up
Womp womp.
Most of this drama could have all been avoided if the dude just learnt what ‘lay low’ means about 3 years ago.
lol
Delicious!
[deleted]
I wonder if they are looking for roofies?
Bruce has moved numerous times since 2020 - Tasmania, Sydney and now maybe his mums in Queensland. 

It’s extremely unlikely he still has any physical copies of any government documents- scanned maybe, but not physical.
If you ignore the hate boner for Bruce, is this NACC going after leaks? What a fucking disgrace, no action on robodebt but happy to go after whistleblowers
He has a home?
I wonder if he has figured out his life is being flushed before his very eyes.
maybe knock before entering though…
Hope they wore full body protection.... Who knows what shit those dumb fuckers used....
Sound of cackling laughter 😆
Convicted rapist Bruce Lehrmann
And how many of the officers did he rape?
I’m totally out of the loop on this whole case (I don’t pay a lot of attention to domestic politics). Was this whole thing an issue of two people going back to parliament offices, where one person said consensual sex happened and the other one said it was not consensual? If so, what makes one person believable and the other not?

Edit: it’s a classic Reddit moment that I’m getting downvoted for this innocuous, genuine question (which neither blames or excuses anyone). Not sure who I’ve offended with the question, but I expect it’ll be people who are in a permanent state of faux outrage.
Rapist or not this guy is dumbest cringiest Aussie ever. He that Higgins deserve everything they get or don’t get lol
I mean, it's practically a Hollywood trope by now, isn't it?

In his early days, Julian Assange kept his hacking software in a beehive.
Can confirm - I have a rellie who works for Parks and Wildlife and the police are *always* calling to request a ranger who holds a damage mitigation permit (i.e. a trained and legally licensed snake catcher) to come immediately to such-and-such address to remove a snake from a tank. Trust me, cops are wise to the 'hide it in the snake tank' ruse - if you're raided and you have a snake tank, it will be the first thing the cops open. You might as well put a neon sign on top saying 'drugs in here!'

Lots of choices since he looks about 20 years older than he is.

> Also why doesn't Labor go harder after the LNP about this shit?

There's so many moving parts here still, I reckon they'd be very afraid to say anything about it in case it gets turned around in the future. The whole saga has been an absolute shit show, everyone who gets within spitting distance of it ends up in court getting sued or arrested or similar, Labor probably want's nothing to do with this right now.
They probably wouldn't say anything that compromises a potential national security investigation or prosecution. Especially given the notoriety of the subject.

Just having these raids reported by the media is probably enough.
> Also why doesn't Labor go harder after the LNP about this shit?

Glass houses and all that?
I’m not a conspiracy theorist or anything but French submarines, Brittany moved to France - isn’t the connection clear 🤣?
Must have gotten her law degree from the same weet-box box as Alena Habba or what ever her name is.
I think the failed defamation lawsuit shows how willing they are to bring up the rape case, even if it hurts them.
Old mate has 10 bucks in the bank, so I suspect he hasn’t got the best and brightest.
Ah yes, the "it was just a joke, bro" defense.
You know the journo had a good laugh in their car before they rang the appropriate number.
He also claims it started from the ‘Twitter Conspiracy Theorists’?
Hey friend,  you misspelled drug dealer 🙂
Hang on what is a media minder? Security? Publicist?
Surprised how far I had to scroll down to find this. 😂
Adding a submarine?
Tony Abbott doesn't really interface with reality so my guess is that he's doing fine.
'*Chilling scenes after dramatic raids across sleepy Sydney suburbs*' would be the icing on any sub-editor's cake.
It's just the tip.
The cops and politicians would have to set up a new protection ring around a new coke dealer then. Easier to ignore it so they don’t lose access.
I’ll give you 7 guesses.
*He later conceded that he could have included in the report more details about inaccuracies in Mr Lehrmann’s version of events between the pair.*

What the fuck is going on in Canberra. This just gets fishier and fishier. Several careers finished, multiple law suits and the Coalition government with their sticky fingers in every pie...

Adjudicated by a Federal Court Justice in non-criminal proceedings, not convicted.

Under the law he’s not guilty of any form of assault, pending his current criminal charges in Toowoomba

**Edit:** incorrectly demoted Justice Lee to Magistrate
lmao even
In the article, the author says they sighted a copy of the warrant specifying that some of the items being searched for were relevant to the submarine deal.


However, it's interesting that the NACC are investigating this. I'm not au fait with our federal law enforcement agencies and their division of responsibility but if there were a true national security angle to this I'd expect AFP to be the ones running it. 


I wonder if the corruption angle is that they were trying to insert themselves into the supply chain somewhere using privileged information.
Maybe they should look for cocaine. There was talk/gossip/rumours/hints in certain circles of drug dealing going on by a certain party to fund a certain lifestyle.
I wonder why the raids weren’t done years ago and if Reynolds even reported her “security breach”
Was it leaked, or sold? I struggle to believe anyone in that article did something for the greater good.
No whistle-blowers in this story, just greedy thieves
A whistle-blower publishes material out if a desire to bring public attention to some undisclosed activity for the benefit of the public.

A traitor would try to sell confidential information to an outside party for their own personal benefit.
The fuck did rapist (on the balance of probabilities) Bruce whistle blow?
> no action on robodebt 

There was no point them doing anything about Robodebt as they don't have prosecution powers.

Referrals had already been made as result of the Royal Commission, so they would just spend time and money interviewing the same people the RC did, get the same information the RC did, write functionally the same report the RC did, and make the same referrals the RC did.
Both of them were Liberal Party staffers, so neither of them is smart or trustworthy.

But ol' Brucey really seems intent on demonstrating that to the world just as hard as he can.
> I’m totally out of the loop on this whole case 

Glad you didn't let this stop you from wildly speculating anyway.

lol
BL first defence (and I believe it’s even his continued defence) was that no sex, consensual or otherwise, happened that night. He claims he went back to the office (and apparently took a drunk BH with him) to “do some work”. 

This is despite, ya know, the security footage and eyewitness accounts. And the whole factor of “who the hell takes a drunk coworker with them back to the office so you can do work and then just abandons them there where they’re later found naked by a security guard”? 

And then when the “well if sex did happen, it was consensual” defence was tried, the judge in the defamation case ruled that BH couldn’t have consented because she was drunk (again, security footage and eye witness accounts). 

There’s also the fact that other women have come forward and said he’s done the same thing to him. False allegations do happen, yes, it becomes harder to disprove that when multiple victims come forward. BL is also *currently on trial* for another rape charge with a different woman.
Lehrmann has said that they didn't have sex.

According to Lehrmann,  they had a bunch of drinks and then he had to go back to the office at 1:48 in the morning to pick up his house keys. He then decided he had super urgent work to do. He left at 2:35am and Higgins was found by security at 3am.

Lehrmann also missed a bunch of phonecalls and texts from his girlfriend and never went back to check up or say bye to Higgins.

And then we find that all that other stuff about the drugs and hookers and the other sexual assault case. It would have been more believable if he had said they did have sex but he kept doubling down on his story to the point where its just super weird.
>Edit: it’s a classic Reddit moment that I’m getting downvoted for this innocuous, genuine question (which neither blames or excuses anyone). Not sure who I’ve offended with the question, but I expect it’ll be people who are in a permanent state of faux outrage.

Its probably because the case is fairly well documented, and rather than going to bare minimum effort of [www.google.com](http://www.google.com) , you instead expect to be spoonfed information.
?
And *this* is how you end up with snakes on a plane.
That (and I say this purely because of a sixth-sense I have in only this area) is Bruce’s cocaine dealer. 
-he’s a reptile guy. 
-he looks like that.
-he’d apparently asked if the sniffer dogs were “cocaine dogs”
Did she bite you when you put your hands in there?

I’m not generally patriotic but your suggestion not only made me snort, it made me proud to be an Australian 😂 it’s a very Australian suggestion
I think a really attractive, young actress should play Higgins at the beginning, but then swap her out with someone bloated and washed-out for the later end of the miniseries.
Perfect choice. Typecast, even.
Fitting yourself into the same single identity as your fellows is part of the demi-fascist ideology. So far they have stopped short if matching Hugo Boss uniforms, though.
Why do I get the feeling they’re not just physically similar, but perhaps personally as well. 

Like Bruce likes raping people on couches. JD likes raping couches.
He doesn't wear eyeliner though.
Belly flop…
Rebecca Gibney is awesome, I'd hate for her to be associated with this turd in any way shape or form.
Reynolds would have 2 defences there.

1. It was in court.

2. The truth defence.  The only argument against him looking "shifty" is that it's a pretty weak term for someone like Bruce, and a much stronger term would be more accurate.
Based on polling trends Labor needs to remind people who the LNP really are and soon.
I think they’re trying to avoid it and hope it all goes away. 

Anyone who gets close gets burned. 

The last thing Labor wants or needs is for an Labor MP to be sucked into this particular vortex
Alina Habba aka “Somebody said to me ‘Alina, would you rather be smart or pretty?’ and I said ‘Oh easy, pretty… I can fake being smart’."
He certainly hasn't. 

She's managed to bankrupt herself pursuing a debt.

I’d say the only difference this time around is they couldn’t cover it all up with support from their buddies in MSM.

Yeah, you can just say "the rapist Bruce Lehrmann" - no need to say "alleged" anymore!
It definitely sounds that way. But 5 years on you would assume they wouldn't have any of these documents lying around still, especially for a failed deal. Even digital forensics could be a lost cause unless they keep old phones and laptops. Probably why Macgowan sounds so confident about it being bullshit, any evidence is long gone.
Yeah but I mean date rape drugs generically
Especially if that person is $$$$$$ in the hole for damages against a certain media network
What was my speculation? 

The only thing I offered was: if two people both claimed sex happened, and they have differing accounts of consent or not, what makes us believe one or the other account? 

In what way is that an unreasonable question? I was not at all stating that there was no further critical information (in fact, I was asking for that info).

Other replies have subsequently indicated that the guy in this case claimed no sex happened (then changed his story), and that the woman in the scenario was drunk, and that there are various witnesses supporting her account. Those are the relevant answers to a reasonable question which I asked, namely that these various elements lend credence to the woman’s account.

As an aside: the rush with which people emotionally react to innocuous questions does a disservice to important issues being publicly discussed. I’m by no means an apologist for abusers, but neither do I think that we should assume guilt out of hand or refuse to freely and fairly discuss things in the public space. Quashing open discussion casts a shadow over the claims of factual victims and provides ammunition to the incels of the world.
Thanks for the summary. That’s what I was after!
Minute silence for the guy who gets bitten on the dick
Yes and no, i knew how to distract her but sometimes she just wanted to bite me 🤷‍♂️
Its just acting, it wont actually need to touch the actress playing Higgins.
Crikey you're right.

That's pure misogyny, dude. Be better.
So you’re saying you would be suitable for the role at the end of the miniseries?
i bet you thought his sounded funny in your head didn't you champ?
So far. They didn't mind cargo shorts and waving tiki torches though
Sadly, one of these is only an allegation
Someone should really tell his shitbox lawyer
Best I can think of right now is "wriggly", maybe "shapeshifty".
Maybe, but there is a very high chance of this backfiring on them, there are probably better angles of attack if they need to go down that route.
Need to bring the “weird” thing over from the US.
Labor are terrible at everything except being in opposition. That's the only thing they remind people of when they are in government.
Probably because an insane number of people blame inflation and the housing crisis on the government when one is mostly international at this point and the other is a problem decades in the making with no quick fixes.
Maybe if Labor reminded themselves of who they’re supposed to be, it would have more impact?
[removed]
There needs to be a book or movie titled "Ali Habba and the Thief."
They did try and sue the media for reporting it
Fixed. Thanks
You can. But you can’t call him *convicted*
Perhaps you're right; I'm unsure as to how diligently Bruce deals with correctly storing and disposing of sensitive information. 


That said, it wouldn't be proper for the NACC to just assume everything is now gone without actually investigating.
The amount of time idiot politicians and public servants get busted due to emailing shit to their personal address is pretty astounding. Ol mate 'rapist on the balance of probabilities' definitely seems like the type to act with the same kind of impunity
Not really... Bruce is going to end up bankrupt either way, so there's no point in making an effort to come up with part of the money - that's just more work for him and more money to his enemies.
You sure have a lot to say about a topic you're admittedly "out of the loop on" and "don't pay a lot of attention to"...
In your defense, if you hadn’t been paying attention since the original criminal trial, thinking it was still a case of “he said, she said” isn’t that strange. 

Putting the whole “government conspiracy theories” thing aside (which I personally don’t believe in), that original criminal trial was a shit show. 

Police were just plain lazy and incompetent collecting evidence (a lot of evidence used in the defamation trial wasn’t present in the original criminal trial), were biased against BH (calling her “evasive”, “uncooperative” and “manipulative”) and the prosecutors arguments were weak as a result (and later alleged they weren’t being supported by the police, even going as far as to say they were being pressured not to pursue the case).
Unless it’s Bruce himself, in which case, hope it renders his rape instrument obsolete forever.
She probably just thought you gave her the money as payment for locking her in a glass case and she didn't want to give it back
He will also play the role of Bruce Lehmanns snake.

^The ^one ^in ^the ^tank
I thought Brucey was found civilly liable?  😅 

In all seriousness though, JD is never going to live it down. Unless something worse comes to light.
As Aussies, we should get away with substituting "cunts" for "weird".
That comment coming from a CJA poster and Joe Rogan fan isn't even sad. It's just lame.
Better him than rape apologists.

Should be a kick off point for some self reflection.
Underrated. This made me snort laugh.
Not yet anyway...
He’s a person of no convictions whatsoever.
Yeah, that was my point.
You're implying that he is a smart, forward thinking man.
I have very little to say on this specific case. 

I have a lot to say about the compulsion to ignorance that seems pretty common in online comments.
It's already been judged in court to be acceptable to call people a cunt (thanks to Danny Lym calling Tony Abbot a cunt).
Fucking drongos should be in there too.

Not all heroes wear capes...
If you can legally call the PM a cunt you know that your democracy is pretty healthy.
I made little comments about the case. I held no view on the case, as I didn’t have a decent impartial summary. 

I made comments about the typical knee-jerk commentary of Reddit and social media in general. It’s like witnessing a voluntary lobotomy.
Some wear sandwich-board signs, and give everyone a wave and a smile.
