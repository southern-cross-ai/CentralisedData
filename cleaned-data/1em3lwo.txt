So I am doing a little market research at the moment and stumbled across the latest thing the Kiwis are trying to steal from us.

Down Under.

I can’t think of a single piece of media in the last 100 years that refer to NZ as “Down Under” whereas we have a clear history of the use of the nomenclature

Are they seriously trying to claim this association so they can be the cool kid on the hemisphere like us?

They are technically more down under than us
I don't mind. New Zealand is basically a state of Australia anyway.
They’re pretty much our funny cousins, they can use it. 

I care less about them using it than Tasmania, who are literally down under the mainland.
I don't mind New Zealand using the term down under considering they are also down under.  God knows Australia has claimed a lot of NZ people as our own.
Care to provide a single example of them “stealing” it? From your (no doubt) extensive market research?
Perhaps we negotiate this - they can use the term if they recognise we were first with pavlova
I don't thinnk you've been looking hard enough. As long as I can remember New Zealand has been referred to as Down Under as well as Australia. Why would it be an exclusive term?
Hardly the latest thing. I was born in NZ in 1940, and the term was commonly used from my earliest memories on.

Is New Zealand not down under the equator? That is all down under has ever meant.
Down Under-er.
It actually was at one point

Very sneaky
I like this train of thought
It's honestly such a bad decision because so many people outside of AUS and NZ think it's 'Drag Race Australia' and dismiss the kiwis all the time it's referenced
How about “Here be Draganz”?
I mean so is Argentina…
I'd need to see a source for that - cos it never was to my knowledge

The Constitution made provision for them to join us - but they didn't
If only you'd said Paraguay...

And they can also claim to be down under. It is not a reference to only Australia

Hard disagree, I think historically this phrase has been specifically for Australia where we see clear examples of it being used for over a century

There are plenty of specific uses of the phrase to categorically say it only applies Australia and NZ, or the pacific island countries
That's what I thought
Call it a provision all you like but this says state

No - what it says has three elements     
Places out of this list   
That are part of the Commonwealth   
At the time this Act creates the Commonwealth of Australia   

New Zealand didn't choose to join - so it wasn't part of the Commonwealth - so it never became a state
