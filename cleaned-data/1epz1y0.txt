Now my question is why dont we have fencers or handball teams?
There's an article attached to the picture, if you click on the OPEN sign. It goes into detail about how Australia gets a pretty easy run to the Olympics and even in sports it doesn't do well in, like track and field events, it's allowed in just to make up the numbers.
God, read the article of this post. It goes through all this.
Fencing qualifiers are a combined Asia and Oceania affair and across the board fencers from China, Japan, Korea made it instead.

Handball it looks like Australia didn't compete in qualification and I'm getting the impression they just excluded Oceania from the process all together?
