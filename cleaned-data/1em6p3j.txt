Looks like a fantastic chance for a gold medal if you're up.

The Men's team pursuit where 4 riders from each team, go round and round in a velodrome  until 3 finish 16 laps of 250m (4km total).

I randomly stumbled upon the heats 2 days ago, and I must say it was quite enjoyable. Very simple to understand and exciting too.

Cheers for the info! I've always found track cycling fascinating. The speed and precision are incredible. For those who haven't watched before, keep an eye on how the riders swap positions to conserve energy. It's like a high-speed dance.
Thanks for the heads up! Setting my alarm now. Love a bit of late-night Olympics action.
I saw that too. Will definitely be up, bleary eyed, watching.
Go you good things!
As an Aussie in the UK. It was great to watch :)
This was a good reminder btw, cheers. Double checked the time of the race before bed, set the alarm, watched it on my phone and rolled back over straight to sleep haha.
...looks like I picked a bad night to get a half decent nights sleep :p

*sets alarm*
