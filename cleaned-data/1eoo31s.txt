If you fuck up on a delivery ans it's your fault, do you get penalised in any way?
My delivery never turned up. Delivery driver claimed he handed it to a guy standing outside my house on the street, obviously he didn't confirm the name or order details or take a photo. 
I've already been refunded after filing the complaint, but does the driver cop a penalty for being incompetent? If no penalty they could just do dodgies and eat people's food until they get banned as a driver then move onto a different delivery service? Haha
They get kicked off after a few fuckups. Doesn't really stop them.
Give them a bad review and if they get enough they get booted from the parasitic platform. Then go pick up food yourself to put the rest out of business.
Get the food yourself, bypass these scumbag companies.
Only the highest standards are acceptable. There are people lining up for this prestigious position.
Probably depends if they have enough drivers or not
the must need a lot of bad reviews.  Recently ordered food (I was sick) and the delivery driver had around 80% rating.   I was thinking how can it be that bad... just deliverying food

  
I found out.  it was dropped four doors up (91 not 99)
