Better idea: close all of them forever.
Oh no.

Anyway ...
Good
No loss.
Great. Horse racing next please.
Can it close forever? Please?
I thought the Greyhound race track in Cannington was replaced by the bunnings there.


What did the bunnings replace then?
The track was moved down the road in 2014
Ah right thanks

I rarely parked at the end of Carousel near the racetrack so I didn't fully understand what happened.
