So self defence that he needed a hatchet and a kitchen knife to protect himself for 14 minutes, causing 35 separate injuries..

I'm calling bullshit on this one.
>"Crown prosecutor Mark Gibson told the Supreme Court Ms Perera suffered 35 separate injuries to her head, face, neck, arms and abdomen in a 14-minute attack."  


>"Mr Kurera also denies striking his teenage son with the hatchet, causing injuries to the head and leg."  


>"Mr Gibson said Mr Kurera wore dark clothing, a hat and gloves and arrived at the property armed with the hatchet, a jimmy bar and a 10-litre can of petrol."

"iT wAs SeLf DeFeNsE!!!"

What an actual piece of shit.
Showing up to your ex's with a hatchet for self defence. I hope he gets life.
POS
> Ms Perera's screams of "Help me, help me" were captured on a recording on her watch, which was played to the court on Tuesday.
This gutless POS is putting his children through the hell of a trial while he insists he's not guilty. I hope he rots in prison, then in hell.
Wasting the courts time with these lies should work against him
35 seperate injuries over a 14 minute attack certainly doesn't sound like self defence to me. What a fucking disgusting piece of shit. How dare he try to blame her for his murderous rage. He breached court orders by going there. Clearly he was a threat and hence why he wasn't allowed near her. But we all know a piece of paper and a slap on the wrist does nothing to protect women who are domestic violence victims. We need harsher penalties even for "first time" offenders because we all know it's not really their first time, just the first time they were caught. Women deserve better than the current system gives them.
Excellent. If he’d plead guilty he might have got a reduced sentence.
Now he’s gladly called out that he has zero remorse or self reflection and deserves the maximum sentence applicable.
Yeah, I went there in dark clothing, with an iron bar, a hatchet, and a can of petrol and broke in so that I could defend myself!
Cool and normal. 🤮
I know it is not new but I feel sorry for women involved in this ongoing domestic violence epidemic. The amount of just absolute piece of shit men. There needs to be more done to identify them and marginalise them from society.
Credible self defence would have kept this Rambo out of his ex's kitchen.
Good lord, and here was me thinking the ridiculous "ballet leap" defence during Simon Gittany's trial for the murder of Lisa Harnum was a corker, but this tops it. Yep, goes to her house with a hatchet and attacks her for 14 minutes, but sure, it was "self defence." Sounds legit /s 
Who's his defence lawyer, Lionel Hutz from The Simpsons?
May she rest in peace. And may he rot in hell.
How does his lawyer sleep at night?
Let’s see how the woman basher gets along with fellow inmates.
I guess he can put those self defence skills to work in supermax?
A hatchet that he brought to the house with him…
Bit fuckin cynical aren’t you?


/s for the dense.
An actual dumb piece of shit too, if that's his defense. Shoulda saved everyone time and plead guilty, if that's the best he can do.

Self-defense doesn't work as a defense if you put yourself in the dangerous situation in the first place, and physically breaking into someone's house will do that.
I would actually endorse execution
Yep
Which watch does this?
And all the preparation -

> About two days after he flew home, on 3 December 2022, Gibson said Kurera went to Bunnings Warehouse and bought a 30cm crowbar and a fibreglass hatchet.

>At about 10pm, Kurera went to a petrol station and bought a lighter and a 10-litre jerry can which he filled with petrol, the prosecutor said.

>The court heard that Kurera then drove to the family home in Sandhurst, in Melbourne’s southeast, used the crowbar to break through the fence while wearing dark clothing and gloves.

>“Mr Kurera, under the cover of darkness, approached Nelomie, taking her by surprise as she was about to have a cigarette on the back patio area,” Gibson said.

>He alleged Kurera then struck his wife in the head with a hatchet and their two teen children ran down to their mother’s screams.

>Gibson said the family then moved to the living room where the estranged couple argued before Kurera again hit Perera with the hatchet.

>He told the court that the pair’s 17-year-old son tried to run for help, but Kurera chased him and hit him with the axe.

We need whole of life orders
That’s how desperate the defence is to justify this.
"Your honour, I submit that all of the deceased's injuries were self-inflicted!"
He was defending his *honour*, not his person. He probably thinks they are the same thing. So it was, in his eyes, self defense. I want to make it clear I don't share his view, and I hope he never gets let out. I'm just explaining the mental perspective in rationalising murdering your ex wife. NOT approving of it.
I hope he finds multiple lovers in there.
And the can of petrol to fill up the motorbike.
Once the person isn’t a threat and you keep slashing them with your hatchet, the whole self defence thing falls apart too.
sometimes you're just going to jail so you try for the hail mary
Apple Watch and surely others. I believe it was a voice recording.
Idk but see this

That's so fucked up. His defence won't stick and it's just disgusting he's putting his children through a court case when he clearly should just plead guilty.
Reminds me of this classic cross-examination:

Q: "Doctor, before you performed the autopsy, did you check for a pulse?"

A: "No."

Q: "Did you check for blood pressure?"

A: "No."

Q: "Did you check for breathing?"

A: "No."

Q: "So, then it is possible that the patient was alive when you began the autopsy?"

A: "No."

Q: "How can you be so sure, Doctor?"

A: "Because his brain was sitting on my desk in a jar."

Q: "But could the patient have still been alive nevertheless?"

A: "It is possible that he could have been alive and practicing law somewhere."
Even Nadia Comaneci couldn't match the mental gymnastics domestic abusers use to justify themselves.
Right? It's so absurd it reads like a post from The Onion.
I think you’re right, he’s got nothing to lose but evidently enjoys causing more suffering.
Honour culture is deeply fucked up. IMNSHO.
Here comes the 4 year sentence with "parole" after 12 mths and ice cream delivered daily to his cell
