My partner and I had planned a honeymoon to Port Douglas and purchased flights through Virgin. We had everything booked and paid for only to find out my partner who is pregnant had a related medical condition that means she cannot fly.

Initially I was just going to wear the cost and try get some of the money back through credit card insurance but my partner convinced me to reach out to Virgin. I did so and got a speedy reply with them allocating the entire fare to a travel bank fund, even though our fare in no way entitled us to such a thing. This was all while they are also supporting those impacted by REXs collapse.

So don't be afraid to at least send an email or submit a request form before giving up. Sometimes the airlines aren't so bad or at least they're willing to play nice if you play nice.

I hope your lovely lady and bub are alright.

Great news that you were able to get a refund.  Personally, I think it's all dependant on the induvial staff member you end up speaking to.  Some are great, some can't be bothered, while others follow the rule book.
I think your thanks go to the specific staff on that day.

All Airlines, regardless of brand, do not give a shit about you ✨🌈♥️
Every comment about airlines is anecdotal. They're all the same in the end.

My Virgin story is a brief trip with my 5 year old daughter to Brisbane last year where they cancelled multiple flights, rebooked us on other flights with my daughter in a completely different section of the plane. Long service queues, long hold times. Didn't transfer luggage purchases to the new flights.

Then again, everyone hates QANTAS, but I fly almost exclusively with them for work (at least 50 flights a year) and I have never experienced a delay longer than 30 minutes.

As I said, anecdotal.
Nothing but good experiences flying Virgin. My wife and I along with our 2 kids flew to Sydney on January, it was the first time we'd checked baggage for like 12 years.

We printed our things but then had no idea what goes where and what we need to keep or whatever. We must've looked confused enough because one of the Virgin ladies came up and asked if everything was OK. We explained we haven't flown for years, and she was so super sweet talking us through where to tag, which bit to keep, then took us to the baggage drop off before seeing us off.

She didn't save our lives or anything, but we felt so silly not knowing what to do and she was just so nice about it.
I’ve always found Virgin to be reasonable in terms of their service and helping customers out in a pickle.

Jetstar on the other hand…
That's a great response by Virgin. So glad they assisted you. Years ago my partner was found to have a DVT in the leg area. Air New Zealand was excellent in changing a non refundable airfare to NZ to a later date of our choice 👍
Similar experience with Virgin. 

I’d had surgery a few days before a flight and wasn’t up to it. Didn’t think I’d get a cent back but they credited the entire fare. 

Super impressed.
I injured my knee a week before I was supposed to fly to south korea earlier this year, was advised not to go by my doctor, called Qantas and they refunded our flights. No medical certificate or anything, didn't have to through insurance.

Thank you they're doing great, just some complications that mean we need to play it safe and postpone air travel until the bub arrives.

Yeah I agree, it seemed like a mixed bag from all the responses I saw on here but I thought why not let people know that it's at least worth a shot.
Yep this. I was travelling with Qantas domestic a few years ago and had a vertigo episode. The lady I dealt with was amazing - rebooked my fare at no charge which I was not entitled to, made sure someone could collect me, found my bag. I’ve also had the opposite experience with jerk staff in both the call centre and in person. It often is just down to who you speak to.
I lost a fight credit because although I had used it to rebook a flight, I was diagnosed with cancer and had to do chemo so I called and cancelled that flight. I would have had 2 days after my treatment to use it but was told I should have planned better. 

I don’t normally call people in call centres rude names but that day I did.
Yeah I think you're the money there
> I think your thanks go to the specific staff on that day.

Does this mean that, when you don't get the outcome you want, you can blame the specific staff you dealt with?
Had a 45 min delay with the one time I flew qantas last week. But they did explain that the pilots were coming from a diff flight which was late and you could physically see them crossing from one gate to another.
Oof that is brutal. We had a not so great experience with them a few years ago too.

I guess the main reason I posted was so that other people at least do what I did and ask the question, if you don't ask you don't get and it only took 5 minutes of my time to submit a form.
Not really surprising that you weren't able to be seated together if you were a last minute transfer from a different flight, though that doesn't make it any less frustrating.

I had a 1 hr 50 minute delay with Qantas last year, made my international connection very tight. Then a similar delay from Virgin the following month and I did miss the international connection. Both cases were because the plane needed repairs - maybe they need to do a bit more preventive maintenance.
Yeah unfortunately like a few people have responded I think it's the luck of draw depending on who you speak to. Sorry you got shafted.
Great to hear Mum and bub are doing well.

I guess in the worst case scenario, that's when you go to your insurance.  But as you said, if you were prepared to wear the cost and that does happen with some tickets.
I hope the person you replied to sees the selection bias in holding whichever party is ultimately responsible to be outcome dependent. If you blame all bad outcomes only on the airlines while attributing all good outcomes only on individual staff members then of course it makes the airline look bad - that’s the conclusion reality was twisted to reach.

It’s a simple worldview because the reality is somewhere in between.
