Played with guts but Spain were just better. So proud of the girls
They had an amazing tournament, especially considering their ranking coming in. Knocked over some big names and played with so much heart. Gabi Palm was absolutely incredible.

Congratulations team!
The mighty Stingers!
But I thought that silver and bronze medals were nothing more than participation trophies that didn’t deserve to be celebrated…
Spain were very very good. 

The Stingers will go one better in LA 28.
