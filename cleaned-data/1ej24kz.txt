Pretty impressive Olympics thus far for Oz.

I was just looking at the history of Australia at the Olympics - what happened in 1976 tho, where we didn’t win a single gold?
[deleted]
The Aussie tennis doubles just took our twelfth gold

it was an intensive match, they really deserved the win 

I am so proud of our athletes and amazed by their success
I'm not even Australian...I'm mexican but i just wanna say I'm proud of Australia 
Your country is really amazing

Good for you
Genuine question: how come we're not as dominant in rowing as other water sports? We've only got one medal so far and even past Olympics we don't dominate it as much as swimming for example. Otherwise we'd legit be first at this stage if we had a couple of rowing golds!
Had to check the BBC and NYT websites to check this wasn't fake news. 

BBC also had Australia at number 2 on the medal table, behind China.

 NYT website has USA first, France second, China third. 

Aussie women are the real heroes with gold it seems. Women have 6 of the 7 pool gold medals,  2 gold in canoe (verses men zero), 1 gold in bmx (men zero), 1 gold in cycling (men zero). Out of 12 gold, 10 are from our womens team. Incredible stuff. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Dudded myself thinking I could watch the AFL and get back to the doubles in the early games of the 3rd set
So...

Australia could end up atop of the list in Brisbane 2032?

Totally doable.
Senior just won his boxing match and is guaranteed a medal, can't wait to see which colour tomorrow i think

Shout out to Butler in Perth
Stop the count!
Your country' results are really impressive, and it's even more impressive considering the total population. Love from France
Well this didn't age well
Just let us finish in front of England!
I’ve been to Australia so many times, it’s like a second home to me. Go Australia!
Isn’t it always like this until track and field
I can't ever recall being 2nd overall this late into the games

What an achievement
I’m from the US and I’m very proud of the athletes from OZ. Well done, mates. 💪🏼
Love seeing my Aussie cousins at the top end. Hoping it continues and my beloved Britain can keep it up too ❤️
Australia is always ahead in medal count … then all the swimming events finishes.
Settle down the athletics is about to start.
Don't care where we finish.


Just want to see us break our Gold Medal OR of 17.


It's defo on the cards.
For what? This is how it is at the start. Then the other events are held.
Damn this thread is realllll quiet now. RAHHHHHHH🦅🦅🦅🦅🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Love to see the seppos struggle
How's that going rn
Also well done in the women’s hockey so far! 💪🎉
Oh thanks, quite frankly it wasn't that hard for me.
Yooooo, we got some staying power this time around! Smashed out the swimming and keep on rocking
Great results so far.
I think we get penalised a gold medal due to the sheer number of the stupid Aussie Oi Oi chants during the tennis.
[deleted]
But Merika has 45...
Day 8 and we’re still in the top 3?! That’s incredible. America hasn’t dropped the ball like this in a long time.
Punching above our weight once again! Showing the world that they can't underestimate us in any regard!
Yes, but this tally is wrong, America has twice the number of medals as Australia. They have been double as good /s
I was thinking this this morning.

There's usually a lot of noise about how well we are going to go in the swimming and them we get there we fall short. And then don't do much else.

This time there wasn't as much noise and they've done even better and they've picked up even more in other areas.

Well done indeed.
Can it be my turn to post this tomorrow?
It Waa good for bit there.
This is so cool!
I'm really proud of our country right now!
This is impressive.
Maybe China can lend us some of their PEDs
Tf did we do right?
I never make it about only gold medals. When so many competitions are decided by the barest of margins, often only a thousand of a second or millimeters, to say gold is the only measure is absurd. But Australia has always done incredibly well in the summer Olympics and usually been in the top ten for total medal count and team size. Yeah, we do pretty f#%king alright.
Why don't Australians win virtually every medal? Y'all are practically superhuman with that whole living on a continent with the worlds deadliest... pretty much everything. Spiders, snakes, sharks, jellyfish, octopi and even those near impossible to kill (even with an army) birds the mighty Emus.
👍👍👍👍👍 Impressive performance!
Oh sweet, we're up to second place now!
Oh okay, we've gotten higher
We’ve gotta beat those commie c*nts, come on aussies!
Itll turn around this week.

Edit: Yep, France and the US have now leapfrogged ahead.
Who run the world?
PRC doesn't count cos they cheat.
Wow Australians are obsessed with America lol
Americans on social media are SO pissy about this.
Good job Australia. You guys are killing it this year. Especially in swimming
Of course in the US they do the rankings by total medals…so the US is first in the tally…
Holy shit look at us go.
McKeown is GOAT
Pretty impressive
5th overall.
I thought we were all supposed to be dead by now because of how many of us were vaccinated for Covid???
[deleted]
Nice! 2 more gold to beat the Chicoms!
Americans: WE’VE GOT 45 MEDALS!!!!!
This was the Olympics that kick started Australia’s investment in its sport and propelled our athletes forward. It actually was a blessing in disguise!
[deleted]
I was around and I can tell you that everyone was devastated. This was the time before drug testing and the East German and Russian swim teams deztroyed everyone else. It was the most drug affected games ever. A lot changed when we got to the LA games in 1984. (Moscow Games in 1980 was a joke as well)
The USSR and East Germany had a fantastic doping program.

And Australia hadn't really professionalised our sporting institutions. Now we spend lots of money on it.
NZ beat Oz at that Olympics 

Led to AIS
So, we have an official silver surfer?
Sure,  but if it’s not two golds I don’t want to know about it right now.
[deleted]
Got emotional watching the medal ceremony with the Aussie flag in between the US flags, having to beat both higher ranked teams to snatch gold. That is some next level legendary stuff.
I feel the whole thing reflects well on me personally.
Thanks mate 🫶🫶
The rowing campaign has been well below expectations. Medal predictions were 7 minor medals, actual achievement was just 1.

The approach of trying to win the men’s eight has caused problems.
From what I've seen, pretty much every race is dominated by the Dutch.
[We used to have the Oarsome Foursome. We used to be a proper country.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlG1I7OEfUE)
This is my theory. 

Everyone learns to swim at school, so there's a huge selection of young swimmers to choose from when looking out for talent. 

Most other sports are only played for a term here and there at school or require extra-curricular support. Rowing, for example, needs a lot of buy-in from parents. There's the cost of renting or  purchasing boats and oars; you need to be in reasonable proximity to a river; and you need to wake yourself and your kid up early in the morning for training.
It's because we don't have the Oarsome Foursome anymore
An completely uneducated guess, but rowing is associated with ivy league and old money universities like Harvard and Oxford. Although we have teams, we don't have big rowing rivalry events like over there.

“In which year did a Harvard sculler last outrow an Oxford man at Henley?" Langdon had no idea, but he could imagine only one reason the question had been asked. "Surely such a travesty has never occurred.”

― Dan Brown, The da Vinci Code
We have been alright in rowing other years, you just go through ups and downs over the years as talent retires and newer people come through. Swimming is really just an outlier for us where we are always competitive.
Too many sharks and crocs to bump into. That benefits us with swimming though cos we learn to be faster than them.
It is a bit of a curious question. As it's one of the sports that aunty Gina directly funds. You look at swimming, Gina also directly funds it and we have been doing very well in swimming. So it's definitely not a finding issue.
[deleted]
So proud.
Of course American news outlets go off total medals rather than the number of gold medals like the rest of the world - it lets them put America at the top.

[NBC News even posted an article](https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/olympics/are-different-olympic-medal-counts-know-tally-rcna164477) trying to explain that doing that is the norm rather than the exception.
Can we stop turning this awesome news into some men vs women bs, it shouldn’t even be about genders. Would be saying the same thing if it was the opposite way as well. The women are doing fantastic, let’s celebrate that and not turn it into a weird us vs them.
Check it out, you obviously care very much about which gender gets more gold medals as you’re comparing it to both genders for what ever reason. It’s about countries not genders.
Haha that was me watching eagles and the boomers Friday eve
Love the spirit!
England? They too scared to go it alone so grab a few neighbors for help.
Sorry they'll just claim a moral victory
England is competing as part of Great Britain, they don’t have their own team.
I mean, if Aus sends 133 more athletes than GB you'd expect to right?
Exactly, it’s just a static moment in time.
Will probably change now the athletics has started.
Bit premature don't you think? US struggled in swimming, performed well in all other events, with arguable their most successful events (Athletics) coming up still
I mean, I their defence they have the most overall 🤷
I also watch the Olympics out of insecurity and not for love of the sport
Such a bogan comment
[Cope and Seethe ](https://olympics.com/en/paris-2024/medals?utm_campaign=dp_google)
No, they’re the loud tenants that won’t shut up when everyone’s trying to sleep.
It’s literally the opposite. Americans think they’re better than they are in all instances. Per capita the US is a third tier sporting nation. In absolute terms second tier.
if you're this obsessed with proving youre better than the americans, then that's just pathetic. you should be cheering for the australians because you love the country, not because you just want the americans to lose
Yes because clearly 50 bronze is better than 49 golds!!!
Everyone knows the real score is gold divided by silver divided by bronze.
[removed]
Yeah sure, it's so dangerous here... (dont tell him we have no bears or mountain lions, basically anything that will kill you on land)
[deleted]
They're just better at sports.
A few years from now when the testing catches up, PRC will drop a few medals and nobody will even know.
[deleted]
Sorry what?
We always start strong with the swimming then fall back in the medal tally when track and field starts in the second week. 

Way she goes.
You alright? 

You've got a track record of shitting on our Olympic Achievements
61, and 2 more golds than Australia
61 :)
AIS waa created after Montreal. Montreal was a national embarrassment
[deleted]
What if it's a gold and three more silvers?
Gold, silver, bronze. The best three humans in the world at that particular task. Are you in the top three people of anything on earth? Didn't think so. Don't rip on silver just because you're jealous of its shine ✨
As a swans fan I think you were safe watching something else after Q1
Did the USA beat Australia 2 medals to 1?

Again?
Yeah we didn't do too well in the men's eights today. What do you mean about the approach?
we got not enough canals
Peaches and apricots
Junior rowing is pretty much exclusively a high end private school sport in Australia; swimming, as you mentioned, is within reach of a much broader range of socio-economic groups. So at very least a larger number of athletes to select from. Swimming is also a very visible and very well funded sport by comparison to, say, track and field
Not only do we learn the swim at school, but this year at the NSW PSSA (Primary Schools Sporting Association) meet a 10 year old girl swam under 30 seconds, meaning that if they entered the mens 50m freestyle, they would not have had the slowest heat time.

You could rock up to any high school meet and most likely find children faster than the best swimmers a number of countries could find.  Heck, I was sub 30 seconds in High School, and I was 130kg back then.
Wouldn't this be the same for other countries though? And I feel we have a pretty strong rowing culture in Australia don't we?
The yanks are counting medals overall, and they're doing it for a very obvious reason. They have the most overall so if that's how they measure it it puts them at the top
I mean they can't even get dates right. Let alone medal tallies
Unless they were doing better if you organized it the way everyone else does of course.
Yanks play in NYC, and Americans are currently beating you in every medal category. As usual.
It's not *everyone* that does it that way; while many do, there's a number of other places that do it on total medals
It’s not to let America be at the top. [Here’s](https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/day-16-2022-winter-olympics-medal-count-update) an NBC article about the 2022 winter olympics where they have USA at fifth — even though sorting by golds would have us at third
This did NOT age well
Yes it LETS Americans be on top. Totally artificial. See you back here on Aug 11 when the games conclude!
Given the historic* poor treatment of - and under-investment in - women's sports, I think it's worth noting. 

*and some would say, continuing
The comment you're complaining about IS celebrating the fact the women have done well. Try to comprehend what's being said before tearing someone down
It’s about the best people in the world competing against the best people in the world. We should invest in the best people in the world in our home country. 

What this shows me is our women athletes are better than their competition than the men’s athletes are better than their competition. AiS and Sports Australia need to figure out why. Then boost that for all Australians as a feeder program over the next 8 years until 2032 in Brisbane.

Kids that are currently 12-16 will be the next Olympic athletes in Brisbane, so understanding why the competition is so unequal between genders is literally a job to investigate so you can replicate and boost all sportspeople.
[deleted]
As an Englishman, couldn’t be happier about this approach to the games. The sporting prowess of Ireland, Scotland, and Wales, considering their size, is unbelievable. Only really matched by NZ, and good to be on their side.
The US struggled in swimming and still managed to beat Australia. So, the Aussies *lost* to what was the worst US swimming team in years. What exactly is being celebrated here?

Well done, you only needed 310,000,000 extra people to finally get there
Per capita tho
Less than a 30% win rate? Is that something to be proud of these days? 

Being beaten by china again.
Cope harder slime! RAHHHHHH 🦅🇺🇸
Yes because clearly 21 gold is better than 20 gold, 20 silver, 20 bronze
Because it's the most tired, worn out joke since "LOL AUSTRALIA IS UPSIDEDOWN".
Because we’re all over those jokes. If it had included an upside down joke, it would be the perfect trifecta of eye roll
The funnel webs are downvoting.
I got it
Yeah it's really easy to brave the wilderness when you can take out the deadliest threat with a good stick lmao. Although with that said your chances of accidentally stepping on a bear that was hiding in your boots is pretty low.
I was going to congratulate them but was surprised to see most of this thread is just xenophobia. Pretty sad
Americans on Twitter told me that all the vaccines and lockdowns would make Australians die or at least be too sick to ever participate in sports again.
We never start this strong though. It’s been an insane week.
Last time Australia was no. 2 in Gold 8 days in?
And track has just started.
[deleted]
I think that was the one the kiwis at work gave us stick about it for ages afterward. Putting up charts with number of medals per head of population etc. It was fun but embarrasing too. The kiwis always punch well above their weight at the Olympics.
Yes he's a comic character mainly showing up in Fantastic Four. He first appeared in comics before you were born in 1966 and his last movie appearance was in 2007's Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer
Silver Surfer was created when your dad was a teenager
Yes it's a marvel one from the fantastic four
Why downvoted for truth? We have one of the smallest populations in the world and we’re #2 in the olympics
USA also won the Women’s 100m sprint by two medals to one over St Lucia.
They stripped other men’s events to build the eight.
You can row on rivers.
Like Yarra River and Parramatta river
We only have a strong rowing culture if you hang around the high end private school set, with the odd other school also competing. Most people growing up would have been absolutely nowhere near rowing. That automatically significantly reduces your athlete pool. 

Even rugby has a wider potential pool given it’s at least played a bit in country towns and some potential to recruit from league.
Lol why would we have a strong rowing culture? That's for snobs in western countries.
United States best at being 2nd or 3rd best at sports.
The very obvious reason they're doing it that way is because that's how it's always been done in the US even if they're aren't on top on total medals. Not sure what you thought the reason was
[deleted]
We have been doing that way since the Cold War. Everything was a competition, and having our asses handed to us by Commies was bad for morale. We just never stopped ranking on overall medals. 

I don’t understand what different it makes. We look at the table and can see where the gold medals are going.
Are the yanks not going to win it in golds as well? Otherwise this theory makes no sense.
This aged well 😂
Yeah they’d be counting golds like everyone else if they were winning in that department lol
Aren't china counting Taiwan medals as China as well? Im sure they do it on their own local news at least
They also drive on the right side of the road!
[deleted]
Nah. We’ve got more gold medals. Means we’re better at winning. Second and third aren’t wins.
>Aussie women are the real heroes with gold it seems. ***Women have 6 of the 7 pool gold medals***, ***2 gold in canoe (verses men zero)***, ***1 gold in bmx (men zero)***, ***1 gold in cycling (men zero)***. Out of 12 gold, 10 are from our womens team. Incredible stuff. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

  
The things I highlighted at my issue, why do we need to bring down the men to bring up the women. It would be pretty ironic you saying the poor treatment of the women's sports would make it ok to start to treat the men athletes with disrespect.

If OP just had removed the "verse men zero" bs that would've been fine, you would be saying the exact same thing I am now if someone posted about men beating women and them having zero medals.
They’ve gone out of their way to write (men zero) next to every category.. you don’t need to put our male athletes down to support the women.
Yeah whole trying to shit on the efforts of the men in the same categories, like the other commenter said, maybe get some better glasses. I'd take a wild guess people would be saying the exact same thing as I am if people said the same thing but reversed and so would I.

  
I am not even saying don't celebrate them, because we should but let's not put down others because they haven't had as much success.
Male athletes tend to focus on footy in winter and cricket in summer. Lot of money if you can make it professionally after a few seasons of NRL or AFL
TBF the UK is a country, England isn't.
Each country is allowed the same amount of participants.
Wait, so a country with a population of 30m is ahead of a nation with 300m in the Olympics and the former is coping? 😂😂😂
Yeah. It's a stereotype. But we do project many of these ourselves.
🤣
Well, so far, that makes about 8 of us. 😊
Xenophobia hahahahhahaa
Grow up ya sooks
The AIS is part of a network of state and territory institutes now which also helps. Fundamentally the AIS should have been built in the Gold Coast rather than Canberra.
I admire the kiwis, its not just the Olympics,  they punch well above their weight in a number of sports.
He got a mention in Deadpool and Wolverine too.

Ill spell it out. He’s being buried with downvotes for jumping to personal attacks and armchair psychology over one of the most blatantly facetious jokes I’ve read in a hot minute.
Well done Oz! New Zealand is always knocking on the door for the best country per capita as well
And, how awesome is it? I remember growing up being proud of us being in the top ten just for tenacity alone against the odds. Its inspiring to see our modern heroes performing at world - peak standards. Aussie Aussie Aussie!
Too many people are openly projecting they're second best in their own life it seems.
Oh my god they are SO good!!
Definitely a missed opportunity then considering the amount of events there are for rowing
Should train the slalom in the Brisbane river, dodge the bullsharks for great training.
To be fair there are public schools in towns on major rivers that do rowing as well.

The big thing is the limited amount of areas to do rowing as a sport. You need the funding for the equipment and the right body of water nearby to be able to do it. It's also not recreationally done at all.
This aged well 😂
What do you mean "saving young talent"? Are you seriously suggesting they are holding back people who would otherwise be in this team..?
What will they lie about?
No, the list says People’s Republic of China. Medals won by Taiwan would be listed separately as either Chinese Taipei or Republic of China.

Even in their local news, medals won by Hong Kong would be listed separately under HK, China.
To be fair, the majority of countries do drive on the right hand side. We're the weird ones here haha
We know what you bogans call us. “Yank” is the most polite one even if it is incorrect.
We don't anymore, the track events have started.

Baffles me why the US do total medals when they know they'll catch up on golds anyway
I'm going to return to this comment every day until the Olympics ends and just chuckle. And I love Australia! Didn't even know this kind of circlejerk one-way hatred existed, very fascinating.
"You may have five bucks, but I have a hundred pennies, so who's the real winner here?"
Might wanna double check your numbers there 😘
Do you?
Right, probably think I hate women for saying that even though I ain't saying we shouldn't celebrate them. Like why did that person even do that, trying some weird as culture war / us vs them crap.
I mean sure, but to win at the Olympics you need to have as many equestrians at high levels as swimmers, as runners, as skateboarders now.

How many hammer throw activities do we have in athletics in school in comparison to team based sports? 

That sort of discussion is the requirement to change the idea that if you can sprint good, your job is now to learn to tackle so you can sprint with a ball in xFL/xRL. Instead, kids might find they love sports we currently don’t play in school, so to what point we can get schools to show those or invest in 3rd party groups to do so.
Impressively how you don’t see having a bigger pool and bigger resources to draw from is a huge advantage. If I had to select 10 runners from a pool of 330,000,000 people I’d have a better team than selecting from a pool of 25,000,000.
Australia is not ahead. Not in swimming. Not in golds. Not in total medals. You are the one currently coping.
[deleted]
AIS have a facility for paddle sports based at Mermaid Waters on the Gold Coast.
Silver surfer is 58 years old. Being 42 and “old” has nothing to do with being unfamiliar with something.
Think you got it the other way around
Up the kiwis! Fuck the ditch rivalry on the world stage everyone underestimates us the same way, lesgooo my Black Cap brethren!!!
Strayaaaa
Yeah I had those examples in mind when I said the odd other school. But those examples are still fairly small in the scheme of things, particularly as you say once the equipment and cost issues come in.
Obviously they are stopping them from ageing so that they will still be ‘young’ in 4 years time
[deleted]
It’s all Napoleon’s fault. He changed France to driving carts on the right and it spread from there.

That said, we do drive on the ‘right’ side of the road factually speaking. The vast majority of people are right handed so it makes sense to have cars designed so that the dominant hand remains in control the wheel when changing gears, playing with radio, cracking open a traveller etc.
[deleted]
Yeah, I hadn’t checked the tallies when I wrote that.
Maybe it means its not some egotistical ploy to save face like this sub thinks it is. Unless the sarcastic accusation is that thecountry that is confident it'll end up first in BOTH leaderboards is just super insecure because hurr durr reserve currency big military...????

The snark doesn't even make sense, unless the US never wins on golds and only on total medals.
That doesn’t make any sense or else China and India would win everything considering they each have a pool from 1.4 billion people to pull from. At the end of the day, the number of Olympic athletes is such a small fraction of total population of any country that it’s a pointless discussion. For example, Noah Lyles could’ve been from anywhere. He just happens to be from the US. Usain Bolt was from Jamaica. Athletes from smaller countries can and do win in the Olympics if they’re good enough. The athletes Australia sent just aren’t as good. 

If you want to argue that the US has better resources to create these better athletes, then I won’t argue with you there. The fact remains that they are better. Obviously better training helps with that.
Other western countries sure. 

Eastern bloc countries had sports institutes for decades. They were decried for the unfairness of taking children away from extended families to train. 

They smashed the west in sports where youth counts alot like gymnastics.
That’s only one sport. Arguably the AIS is a white elephant in Canberra - it would have been much better utilised in the GC than it is now. The climate is much better suited.
Yeah, I’m 46 and I’ve heard of Silver Surfer!
Ayyyy
[deleted]
Athletes would do better in 2028 if they competed in 2024, the experience is irreplaceable.
My skin isn’t thin. You’re the ones being sooks over the way we count medals. 

I’m aware of where the term “septic” comes from. “Yank” isn’t much better. Our way of counting medals is a holdover from the Cold War, when our national identity relied on not losing to Soviets. No one gives a shit about it now except you guys.
Come again?
>Noah Lyles and Usain Bolt 

Lyles was born to two track and field athletes and was heavily involved in high level gymnastics and track programs his entire childhood and young adulthood. If he was born in a country without these processes, he’d be a nobody. 

Bolt is a genetic freak, more so than Lyles, but even he is the product of a massive sporting endeavour. Jamaica had an enormous cricket and athletics development program when he was young, he attended sporting schools and had access to coaches **and government lawyers** who helped him compete and ensured he had the best coaching and development programs available. 

Both Bolt and Lyles were involved heavily with youth athletics programs and both of them competed as children with some of the best running coaches on Earth. Jamaica was (and still kind of is) a powerhouse of youth athletics - both coaching and faculties. 

So, leaving that stupidity aside -  China and India **would** win almost everything if they had the economic and cultural systems in place to properly fund and invest in sport across their populace.  But they don’t. India is too poor and only cares about a few sports, China is too recently out of urbanisation and their cultural and economic systems don’t prioritise sport at all (beyond a few niche examples). I’ve been to China and I can vouch first hand that they really aren’t a sporting country. There’s both financial and cultural reasons for that, but that’s a discussion for another day. 

Having 330,000,000 people who are almost all above the poverty line and almost all have some level of access to sporting facilities and coaching is a huge advantage. This is why the US wins the most medals. It’s because it’s the biggest country on earth that funds sport properly. 

So yes - if and when China fully adopts a financial and cultural emphasis on sport - they will win the most medals. 

I won’t read or respond to you any longer because i think you’re likely trolling as you shouldn’t need such simple concepts explained to you. It’s either that or you’re an idiot.
[deleted]
> They were decried for the unfairness of taking children away from extended families to train.

Mysterious, the way of the jedi may be. Train great warriors, it does
and you sound like you have zero luck with either of them.
What is the point of this comment? I don’t need an explanation as to why Usain Bolt is great. The point is that he isn’t from the US. Australia has plenty of resources to train athletes similarly. Jamaica has a population of 2.8 million. Australia just doesn’t have anyone as gifted as Usain Bolt or even Noah Lyles. Has nothing to do with population of the country. Your argument is never gonna work as long as all of these smaller countries continue to win medals.
Yeh, they were definitely different. 

I just love the irony where we used to look upon their medal hauls and say - yeh but they are cheating with their institutes and then we said - fuck it lets do our own institute. Start em young. 

A bit like when we used to laugh at china about their surveilance cameras. a decade later i get the sense we are going down the same road with seat belt cameras etc.
