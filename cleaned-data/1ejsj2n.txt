Found two shotgun shells on my front window when I came home from coles. Not sure why anyone got an idea got told to post this here
You should probably let the cops know just in case.
Usually it's a threat
Thank you to everyone who has given me plenty of advice tonight, and shown concern appreciate it a lot. I know it might seem stupid to a lot of people, and people might know what the obvious choice is regarding matters like this. Never been in situations like this, nor do I intend to again. I’m pretty young, and just want to do my studies, and work. I wish everyone a wonderful night, I’m staying at a mates tonight so should be okay.
Uh yeah I'd be slightly concerned...

Probably some stupid prank but also could well be a threat of some sort.

Maybe give the cops a call. They likely won't do anything but it's worth reporting in case things escalate.
It's a drive by shooting. Due to gun control laws, best we can do is throw empty cases.
Yeah mate. I would take it as a threat....get out...
Maybe tell the police as well...one it protects you if something happens and 2 kind of protects your room mate...
But I wouldn't be sitting around right now...

Protect number 1...YOU
I would be getting a new roommate.
Leave. Right now.

 There’s two there for a reason.
That's a target load so avoid walking around with anything ceramic in your hands for the time being.
Who did you piss off
Someone hasn't paid their tick
Gotta look at it from both perspectives if someone left shells on my window I’d be thinking oh yeah someone’s definitely coming back and they mean business, now if I was leaving shells on someone’s window I’d want them to think oh yeah he’s coming back and means business. 

Never know those shells could be linked to an unmarked gun (this is a stretch) we have good gun laws but people are very unpredictable best thing to do would be hand them in so they can trace it too the gun it was fired from and maybe potentially find out who could have done it
Mate! Glad you took the recommendation to post here :) stay safe
Shit ain't safe no more, don't clown about this y'know and check your surroundings/get real with your roommate or better still play safe and switch sides.. best wishes, be solid ✌️🙏
How old are you? This shit sounds like something might have happened to me when I was 19
*The next one is coming a lot faster!*
Next ones will be airmail probably
It's most likely a prank by some wannabe wankers but it could a threat as that used to be the old way mobs would threaten someone, "one for your knee the other for you head," as my pop put it. Perhaps give the old boys in blue a ring just incase.
Probably best to get the police involved.

If that guy is actually your friend, you should be worried and help him.
I was about to say sounds like a day ending in y, then I saw which sub this is.  I’d report it. That’s creepy.
Tell your roommate to pay his tick…
Yep. But that in itself can’t be read into. If it was my house I would be tooling up or leaving ASAP.
Gangs have signs that they'll leave as warnings like knives in freezers. I'd say this is a warning of some sort and get out of this guy's life as fast as you can.
The roommates odd behavior could mean it's gang related so moving outs a good call but he could also be suicidal so calling the cops either way is a good idea.
Whatever you do don't touch them and take to the cops immediately. 
100% not a smart move picking them up dude.

Next time you see something like that, **don't** touch it.
Kind of lame that there's a threat on someone's life from a motorcycle gang and the response from the subreddit is just to largely let the criminal get away with the threat.
Can we have an update in the coming days? Hope that you and your family are roommate turn out okay
File a police report. If your housemate has a firearm of access to a firearm definitely go somewhere else for a few days and tell the police. This shit can escalate quickly. Goes from weird to confusing to shots real fast. Probably nothing but best to nip this in the bud in case it is. A lot of big issues could have been solved by dealing with them when they were small issues. Don't want you to have any regrets. Good luck. Stay safe.
do you own a cigarette store in Melbourne
Looks to me like you've got a Bowerbird starting to build a nest in your front yard. It's the only logical possibility here.
Time to buy security cameras
Better put on your nice suit, your getting married congratulations /s
Is your roommate a bit creepy? This is something I've seen done before as a warning to rock spiders
Do you go away much, or your house look unoccupied (trash lawn).

It could be a check to see if anyone is in the house. 

Drop conspicuous item, drive by later and see if it's still there...
Bird offering a trade for food
About 24 years ago, I was renting a house and had a neighbour who lived next door and offered to do the yard work for cash. I declined because I don’t mind doing the gardening myself. Left the house and stayed overnight at a friends house, returned home and the front door was wide open, house broken into, nothing missing (I had nothing worth stealing) but 2 shotgun shells were left on the kitchen counter. Rang the police, made a report. They advised to change the locks, which the landlord refused. I started looking for another place to live. Every time I saw the neighbour who offered to mow the lawns etc, he’d give me absolute daggers and scowl at me. I was out within a fortnight. Fortunately, the 6 month lease expired and I moved on. Some people are just nuts. Couldn’t work out if it was the pissed off neighbour or not, but didn’t hang around to find out.
Yeah I would be concerned it could mean that they could of had the shot but decided not to so a warning was left
Think positive… you have new shot glasses!
Any updates this morning OP? Is your mate still alive
That's concerning, it's like someone is trying to give you a warning or threatening
That's a warning. Someone in that house pissed someone off
Hey dude just checking in, you all good? The police say anything? Had any other sus things happen?
Usually left with a note “the next two will be coming a lot quicker”, yes I’d be very concerned
I used to live next to a rental, new neighbours moved in and 2 days later they knocked on my door saying they found spent shotgun shells in their letterbox. 

Over the coming weeks and months we saw more noise from that house in the form of physical alterations, yelling and late night visitors than I have ever heard, there were always hero’s doing burnouts out the front of our house and they threw loud parties all the time. Never found out what the shells meant but the family seemed like the type of family that might have people leaving shotgun shells to send a message
The unpaid tick bites
!remindme 48 hours
I wouldn't have touched 'em, you should have called the police and maybe they could get a finger print off the primer base and you could have whoever left them in trouble.
Are you still okay this morning? I saw your post before I went to bed last night and forgot to comment. I hope you got out of there safely.
Good job you didn’t leave any fingerprints on them when your roommate turns up swimming with the fishes.
Why would anyone know why or what you or your room mate have been up to?
That’s weird really. These are inert and just rubbish, essentially a piece of plastic attached to some brass. Spent shells are either scrapped or thrown in the bin. These could’ve fallen out of a bin somewhere.
Probably shouldn't have touched them. Did you at least take a photo of where they were?
Back in the day that was used as a warning, that the next one will be moving a lot faster.
The magpies are sending a message before swooping season starts
Pay ya tick..... 🤣
Can I have your stuff?
Someone was inspired after watching the Olympics.
Probably shouldn't have touched them, fingerprint evidence may have been left behind. 

But cops may not do much either.

Talk to your roommate, ask them what the fuck have you gotten yourself into by just being within his vicinity
If you lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas
It looks as though the ends are unpacked. Could mean they aren’t live rounds. But generally, if someone is going to waste live ammo by leaving at your house, they are going to to have the follow-through. Life is good until someone gets hit with the gauge. Those rounds don’t play.
Does your roommate have a gambling problem as well and any affiliation with the Rebels? Best case scenario; An enforcer rocked up, nobody was home, left the shells to let you know they'll be back. If they wanted your roommate dead, he/she probably already would be, in this regards, them fleeing to Qld is extremely ominous and if this is bikie/gang related them running absolutely shreds any potential mercy they had left. 

Worst case scenario; your roommate owes some random unpredictable dealer, or some person big money, several grand at least. 

Your roommate owes you a big explanation and a very big apology... Also being young I'll forgive your ignorance but there were signs something like this was gonna happen, there always is, I'm not gonna lecture you on what to do or anything, you seem capable of handling that but maybe once you find some peace and sanctuary, look back on the time proceeding this and look for the signs, your roommate was in big debt, is smokin choof and rackin up...(what else they doin?) Noticeably withdrawing to their bedroom... There would have been way more, you would know. 

Your so young its both heartbreaking but promising, learn from this and gtfo and get your shit together, do everything you can to get your own place, you got the time, do it, make your life easy. 

Where I came from, it was filled with drugs, death and despair, saw shit like this and people like you all the time.

Once upon a time there was a man who owed somebody a stick, that man went to somebodies house to tell them they did not have the money or even a bit of weed so the somebody bashed the man's brains out with a cricket bat and propped him on the couch. covering him in a blanket like he fell asleep watching tv, whilst his brains drooped onto the carpet. That somebody murdered the man's gf too because she saw. I've got many more stories like this, if you like I can keep going...

 Be careful, be smart, keep your head on a swivel, stay sober - last thing you need is to be ambushed whilst high af. Keep a low profile, good luck, I think your roommates fucked.
Gardening
Report to police. Move out. Do not leave forwarding address.
That is a 100% a show of threat to the occupant of the house. Your room mate sounds like a doggy as fuck cunt and seeing he has left from being worried he was probably in way over his head in debt and what not and it’s probably a genuine threat I’d say towards him. 

Will someone come shoot you in the middle of the night? Doubt it but never 0% chance.  I’d have your wits about you and I’d just take note of any people or vehicles that keep popping up or around. I’d say they are scouting for him. 

If he rings you and asks has anyone come past or you see anyone you just deny seeing anything and play it off.  Don’t get yourself involved any more than you are by living there. Then get your shit together and leave.  Because if someone does come to collect the debt. If you’re a witness regardless of beating killing or anything you’ll be the second half of it
I only just seen that this is r/Australia...
I was about to be like... "Just another day somewhere in USA...". 
Yeah I'd be worried.
Stop touching it. Cops need to get prints off it
That is super worrying. Hope it turns out to be nothing.
Its a sign.. like a warning.. you did not piss off anyone by any chance do you?
Screw the police in Queensland, they can't even get youth crime under control!
You should not have handled them. They were probably placed there as a threat.
They haven't been fired by the looks, maybe show us the bottom of the one U handled to check the primers.

They're Rio target loads. 

Opinion?
If you have a gun or a knife, the best time to let anyone know is when it hits them...

The person who bought those originally will probably be a reloader, in other words they produce their own shells. 

Most tough nut wannabes ain't reloading, despite the thought it might be easier to acquire shells that way, there is a lot of outlay in equipment etc to reload, and frankly, thugs don't shoot enough people to justify that, not to mention knowledge. You still need a licensed to buy shells, without projectiles or primers.

They would be buying a box here and there off a friend of a friend.

The only scenario that I see reloaded shells being used by thugs is if a shooter of a sporting or professional nature was in pocket to some heavies. Still unlikely tho.
I don’t understand why you didn’t ask your mate if he was ok or if anything was going on.
Just straight up left.
Keep on mind I can be wrong on this, but they look like buck shots to me. However I would recommend for you to get in contact with the cops, and move in to an other friend/family to tie over till you can find an other long term place to live.
excellent job touching them and putting your fingerprints all over them
Why is this nsfw?
American here-  those rounds are for clay targets and small birds like dove or quail.  A 20 gauge shotgun is something a child would use for quail hunting.  This does not feel threatening to me
Forgive my ignorance, but is gun control a significant problem in Australia?
Just bin them. They’re empty and it’s just a shell. Notify local police you found them if you want but it’s literally plastic and a ring of brass
I thought this was normal in Australia?

Kinda like finding a a croc in your swimming pool, or a snake in your engine compartment.
Most likely from my experiences, it's either someone marking your house for a Robbery, or someone has committed a crime and dumped it far away
*target load* 😏
[deleted]
[deleted]
Yeah definitely will
Let’s hope we don’t see any news tomorrow morning of any drive by shootings
I thought so I’m guessing it’s to my roommate
Yeah, the next ones will be coming a lot fucking faster.
Warning to keep your clays inside.
Wouldn't live rounds be more intimidating?

EDIT: Also maybe buckshot, IIRC you'd have a hard time hunting small game with those.
>Usually

Is there a precedent?
For an update 2: my roommate woke up to a skull of an animal in the tree, and left Queensland. I have no idea where he’s gone, or what he’s thinking. I am not going to get too involved so I don’t end up in the crossfire. Police are having a look around, and will keep me updated. I just asked that I stay as uninvolved as possible
>I know it might seem stupid to a lot of people,

I don't think anyone here is thinking that, you're getting some pretty sane comments in my book. 

If this is directed to your old roommate, and he's been acting pretty sketchy, getting the hell outta there like you have is the best move you could have made. 👍

Let the cops deal with it - last thing you or your girlfriend want is to be in the crossfire of someone else's poor decisions.
My roommate was freaking out earlier, and mumbling some stuff that I couldn’t make out. Locked himself in his room so confused. Glad I’m moving out tomorrow I’m not getting involved
Thank fuck
That’s a good pun I’ll give it to you
Yeah I am I’m about to be at my mates
Yeah that’s why I’ve been planning to move out for a while. I was actually leaving tomorrow
I’d be wiping my fingerprints from the shells first.
Probably will have to soon.
Yeah I am got my bags and heading off I’ll be back later way too much has happened recently
Understood, thanks mate
Can you please explain what’s wrong with ceramic? I don’t understand
No clue I don’t think it was me never been around any gangs really. My roommate though has had issues with cops, and various gangs I think he still has drug debts so this could be what it’s about??
A clay target shooter apparently.
OP's other comments say their roommate is into nose candy... And weed!
Yeah exactly I will be very careful I don’t want to be caught up in anything. I’m just trying to finish my studies while working
Can you even trace shotgun shells like that?
As far as I know you can only trace bullets because the rifling is unique to each gun?
An empty shotgun shell doesn’t indicate what gun it came from.
Yeah I really appreciate it with my friend now it means a lot mate. Way over my head with all my stuff going on
Cheers man I just don’t want trouble I’m trying to finish my studies and focus on work
I’m 17. I’ve never been involved with drugs, gangs or police. But my roommate has so that’s got me a little on edge
Raylan Givens, as I live and breathe!
Lmao, you’ve been downvoted for a good joke because everyone’s more interested in virtue signalling to OP repeating the same comment about going to the police, moving out etc.
As long as they end up in the same place I don't care!
Yeah I’m staying at a mates for the night glad I was already planning to move out tomorrow all my bags are packed
Yeah I better mention I accidentally touched them to the cops
Yeah I just needed to get some advice I first thought it was my roommate randomly leaving it there before going to the pub. Then his reaction plus some peoples comments got me stressing plus my friends, and girlfriend. I don’t have intent to die young if this is what could happen
Would you advise OP pick a fight with an armed bikie gang?
What, realistically, can be done?
Oh thanks I’m so happy haha
It doesn’t really look unoccupied since my roommate does work on the front lawn each day, and by that he fixes up the garden with new rocks and new plants
I would actually be down
Yeah he’s alive though he is still freaked out. He left Queensland this morning I don’t think it was the best move
Yeah my roommate did from the looks of it he fled Queensland this morning. I spent the night at a mates luckily I was moving out today anyways so everything was packed
I’ve been good. Been at my mates hanging out going for bike rides and cooking. Nothing bad has happened thankfully I have asked to not be any police reports. I’ve been fine my roommates still god knows where. Nothing out of the ordinary has happened. Thank you for your care and consideration mate
He talks about it with his friends
Yeah I did I only touched one I thought they weren’t real at first I didn’t immediately think shotgun shells
I have a phone and $15 dollars that’s it so sure
Turkey inspo
They're definitely empty shells, see the end is opened up.
Yeah I won’t mess with them, got no intent to piss people off why I am with another mate for the night. And I checked the ammo it was empty, but didn’t make me feel any better
Yeah I’ve already got my shit together tbh, and that’s not me ignoring your advice. My family are out of the picture, and I have to do everything myself. I can’t find my own rental due to my age. From what I knew my roommate wasn’t having drugs, but had debts before he quit. I genuinely had nowhere else to go I was sleeping in my footy club gym for about a month. I really appreciate your advice, and your understanding just been a lot. 

Also yes my roommate has a gambling addiction but from what I knew it was only at the local RSL, and footy
Yeah I was pretty dumb with that I’ll be talking to my mates friend who is a cop first thing tomorrow morning
The other scenario is thugs using stolen shells
The bottom isn’t exposed it’s flat, and sealed from what I remember. I only took a few minutes to look at it last night not thinking much about it at first. 

My roommate got freaked out, and in the morning an animal skull was in the tree he left Queensland. Not sure where he’s gone, but yeah. 

Thanks for letting me know about reloaded that’s interesting
They're target loads, nowhere near close to buckshot, not that it matters.
Yeah I’m with a mate for the night thanks a lot mate I just want this to go well
I touched one, and I thought they weren’t shotgun shells at first. I haven’t seen any ammo, or guns in person before
and plus it’s already been shot Because the top folds are up
Yeah, where is the b00bs.
Fair enough I just felt odd about it I took advice of others and decided to stay with another mate for the night. Plus a bullets a bullet wouldn’t want one in my general direction ever
The limited access to firearms means crooks will use whatever they can get.
No, but there also isn’t zero guns in Australia. There is still some legal gun ownership including shotguns, it’s just uncommon
The sum of parts
How oblivious 💀
So you don't think it could be a threat against OP? As in "the next ones will be coming at ya a lot fuckin quicker" sort of thing??
I was just after some advice that’s all man I’ve had a lot going on recently
Yes, you are confused, and you thought wrong.

Run along now, Chad
Controlled, not banned. People still have licenses and own firearms, it’s just far far less common. The only people I know who have guns are farmers and they are purely for farming and pest control. The type of gun you can have is very controlled, based on where you live, what you do for work, etc. I would guess that “self-defence” is typically not a good enough excuse to get a license here
Do you like fox news
If you didnt handle them much Police might be able to get prints off it.
Yeah, and make sure you put your fingerprints ALL over them so they can't find the person who put them there.
Luckily we won’t my roommate left Queensland though no idea where
Maybe this was an attempt and they wildly misunderstood the concept
Might be time to get a new roommate so that you aren't caught in the crossfire when the hit happens.
Unless you’ve got two roommates one of those shells is for you
LMAO is your roommate a dealer?
Cunt, the fuck are you doing leave that house find a new place yesterday.

The fuck kind of roommate do you have ?
Why the roommate?
Did they say anything about targeting or shooting cause that’s forked up?
Great movie.
Amazon Prime
His what? 🤔
Still wouldn’t want to be shot at all
I bet it still hurts though
Buckshot will kill a man, the only problem you would have hunting with it is that it's not very accurate depending on the choke
The target rounds let you know the person has a shotgun. They can load it with whatever they want when they come for you.
Well that escalated quickly....hope you're ok mate. Stay safe
That's (skull) fucked. 

But seriously, glad you're out of there!
Holy shit, I was reading this thinking you’re in America. Ahahaha my guy you’re in my home town, it’s not live rounds the amount of effort to even get a hunting licence is ridiculous. I can almost guarantee if you tell the police about it and show them the rounds it won’t be that hard to find. 

And if you’re doing sketchy shit you don’t want to admit to, stop just stop ahaha before someone hits ya with the servo milk crate. 

You’ll be fine my brother. It’s to expensive to shoot people here.
Yeah I really appreciate that man, I never expect to come home seeing that sort of crap
Maybe get a motel tonight.
Yea he definitely pissed off some gang, luckily you moving out tomorrow because I wouldn’t wanna have to deal with that
Just a heads up. Mumbling incoherently and sudden threatening behaviour can be consistent with acute paranoid psychosis. Does you roommate actually happen to have access to any weapons?
Is your roommate Jordan Shanks?
Yeah, that's generally a threat... Someone associated to you is in the firing line..
Probbaly not the name of the politician, but I'm sure it is close enough.
How is that a pun
It’s a joke, not a pun.
Sweet as mate...turn your snap off as well mate if you have that....or location....

Just learnt that today about snap chat😂😂😂....
Damn technology dag nabit
Here's a thought, how about you leave right now while you're still alive?
Leaving tomorrow seems like a very sound plan... good luck, hope it all works out for you.
Was it a coincidence you are moving out tomorrow? Or did this send you over the edge ?
Probably should I thought it was a joke at first
Be careful when you come back to get the rest of your things. Have someone else with you, try not to hang out too much near the front of house or in the front rooms… drive by shootings are wacky and usually it’s innocent victims that get hurt.
Good, take it easy man - that’s a hell of a lot to deal with.
Target loads generally have less oomf, you're looking at about 75 yard max range to the projectile distance. The pellets are tiny and they're generally used when trap, skeet, or sporting clay shooting. These sports involve flinging a clay disk (bird) and shooting them to break them up, hence the not really dangerous unless you're ceramic.

Edit: not saying they cant be dangerous but it's less dangerous than hunting loads or buck shot.

Source: i shoot 5 stand, sporting clays, and volunteer teaching kids how to safely handle/respect firearms.
Target loads are for shooting clay targets.
Just mb it’s ur roommate
There is your answer probably but because there is two . If there is only two of you living there its a warning to both of you
There for a 12 gauge
Yeah, you're right, shotguns are essentially untraceable if used nefariously. 

I'm also not sure if OP should be super worried about things, sure, number 7 target loads would still fuck you up, but also a great indicator that whoever put it there isn't exactly well armed. Especially as they couldn't afford to leave a still loaded cartridge.

It sounds like a crackhead has scoured a clay pigeon range for a discarded shell to me to be honest.
>  you can only trace bullets because the rifling is unique to each gun?

[There's increasing evidence to suggest this is not the case.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-field-of-firearms-forensics-is-flawed/) - specifically, with how modern firearms are made, rifling will be identical between batches, because they're using CNC tooling that doesn't have the variance that older manufacturing processes might induce.
Tbh I’m not going off any good source of information as far as I’m concerned the way our laws are set up the way they are is probably to make people believe everything is traceable from ammunition to parts to firearms themselves, I know gun owners and every time I’ve spoken about guns with them I’ve always been told everything is traceable and that police know how many homes in certain areas have legally owned guns and what guns they own also, so pretty much the way I’ve had things explain to me maybe they don’t know the exact gun it come from but they can have an idea on what type and this case a shotgun they hold information that could possibly identify who’s responsible and in this case again they know every shotgun owner in one area. Police also don’t need to a warrant to search your property if you are a legal gun owner (there’s more details to this just trying to keep it short). Say a search is conducted and you have a shotgun with them same shells found this doesn’t mean your guilty right off the bat but your going to have a hard time proving your not guilty
[deleted]
Alr, I guess you know what to then, from all the little words of advice everyone must've said y'know
Justified should be a better known show.

"Who in the hell are you? The undertaker?"

*puts hat on* "I might be undertakin' a situation right here"
I don't get it, so I googled it, still don't get it, never heard of that that show. 

I thought it was from an Aussie movie.
It's not really a joke, that is literally the message.
Yeah the mumbling to himself bit suggests he knows more than he's saying. Good luck .
No I advise that the police do.

If anything the post has had enough attention that the police should already be investigating it irrespective of OP.
The OP is basically already aware of who is responsible. Hence it is imperative that the individual gets police knocking on his door.

Organised crime should be investigated and prosecuted for every little instance of this rather than just tolerated as a fact of life.
People could assume he's a landscaper and not someone who lives there
Better than having a shotgun pointed at you in bed at 2am I guess
Lol oof =P
Gobble gobble.
I hear you. If there is even 1% chance of you getting lit up, then retreat is the only answer. If you aren’t packing something hefty yourself, AND residing in a Stand Your Ground state of the US, then hightail it out of there and live to live another day. Good luck friend.
Speaking from personal experience, the gambling makes everything 1000x worse and gets them into so much trouble. They lose money trying to win to pay debts, borrow money to recoup losses, repeat until they dig themselves too deep, you'll notice huge mood swings after a return trip from the pokies.

So shit its turned out like this for you, he sounds like an awesome person for helping you out, not many people are like that. If your in the Sydney area I can help you out with food/groceries but that's about it, dm me if you need it. 

 Just to clarify, when I say your roommates fucked, I don't mean personally, I mean in a deadmeat kind of way, as in he's seriously about to get fucked up. 

Hopefully it is the bikies/gang because when they did this to my brother they just gave him a real belting. Shit can be scary and they will fuck you up for just being there. 

I wouldn't go back to that place if I were you, if you have stuff there or you have to go for whatever reason try getting a group of friends to go with you, won't guarantee you safety but better than nothing or 1 person.. If not then you be rollin the dice, is what it is. Keep your shoelaces tight, or be ready to fight.
If so, then using them for something as trivial as intimidation and linking themselves to another possible reported crime is very foolish and severely lacks foresight. 

Missing shells carries a lot more naughty corner time than threaten/stalk/intimidate.
No guarantee on accuracy of info, just my best guess.
Yeah like I said. I can be wrong.
All good, and I hope for the best for you.
Don't touch the other one, get cops to come and take prints, it's unlikely but they might get a print off the other shell. But I also would just move and leave your drop kick room mate from what you've said.
Yeah I only touched one not both
I only put my hands on one I wasn’t really thinking. I’ve never seen ammunition in person before so I thought it just looked like it. I showed a friend, and he said they were real shells
Not of a coincidence that, eh?
Sometimes that isn't easy to do.   The roommate has tenant rights, i imagine.    

I don't like to involve police but I would have a sit down with the roommate for sure and mention that if my life is at risk, I will involve them.  But, I don't know enough about their situation.  roommate could be loco
From what I know no
Dude I already left yesterday plus I was moving out today anyways.
Shotties are good, mate!
I watched the bank robbery scene last night, crackup
I hope you two are talking about Tongan ninja
They are clay target shells. Used for shooting clay targets. It's an Olympic sport, if you look up clay target shooting or skeet shooting you'll understand.
Yeah I will be it’s messed up
Yeah I’m not sticking around if anyone wants to see it I have a picture too
True true. Also I’ve never done anything illegal, or questionable. Hell I’ve never even jay walked man. So that’s why I got so confused, and thought it wasn’t real shells turns out they were
Don’t be so quick to assume… The motorcycle gangs in aus have plenty of firepower.
Stay safe. 👍
Yeah I’m going to go to my mates now I am glad my bags are packed
Yeah exactly good thing I’m leaving. I’ve never had any issues with gangs. Most people know me to be too nice to get in trouble
Not that I know of, but in our footy club there is a bikey that has been known to give guns out so there could be a potential scare there
[deleted]
Yeah I have my Snapchat location disabled except for my girlfriend only she can see it so should be okay thank you
You know I’ll take that advice my bags were already packed I’ll go to my mates
Thanks so much I’m glad some people are taking this seriously. I was wondering if I was stressing out too much but my mate got incredibly worried. Not to mention my girlfriend
Coincidence, I was planning to move out, and he was giving me my two weeks to leave on the day I was telling him I was going to move out.
Bad idea to wipe the shells. Even though your prints are on them, the police will be able to distinguish yours from the other people’s. If you wipe it clean then there’ll be no clue who left them on the ledge in the first place
Cheers I was lucky that everything was in suitcases and bags already so I left absolutely nothing
As someone who doesn't like guns at all; 


Thank you for doing your part to promote gun safety and encouraging those interested in guns towards avenues that aren't associated with violence. 


My hope is that one day most people will associate guns with sport, not death, similarly to how we view javelin and archery. Thank you for being part of that. 
I saw his post on r/weird too, and I said here in Italy a situation like this is a serious warning left by the mafia. Two shells don't indicate two targets, but a double barrel shotgun, which is the traditional gun the mafia uses to eliminate people. How's crime over there in Australia? If it's serious I would be concerned as fuck if I were OP
Good point I’m not sticking around
Thank you so much for the concern, and the advice. My mate is a friend of a cop so I’ll be talking to him first thing tomorrow morning, and see what he says. I appreciate this tons
Yeah exactly also my girlfriend was freaking out on top of it so I went for the safe option
Well I found it funny, either way the comment got downvoted for no reason
Yeah he always seemed off, I originally didn’t want to move in with him, but had nowhere else to go. Now I have some options, and I’ll be taking them
True, but if it was a person wanting to talk they could leave a card. Not shotgun shells, and a skull the next morning
Cheers mate, yeah I’ll make sure I’m safe. Just want to do my studies, and work not deal with potential gangsters, and hitmen
Understood I really appreciate it. He’s had small wins like $150 bucks here, and there, but he’s had more losses I doubt that money would help at all. My bags were already totally packed so I’ve left nothing behind. 

My roommate seems to have cut contact with everyone I wish him the best, but I won’t get myself caught between literal guns, or any other sort of weapon
You think intimidation is trivial?
And in the bottom, the small circle maybe 4-5mm wide, did it have a clear, single dint in it?

I wouldn't worry about it.  Getting fingerprints is way more rare than people realise.
I'm in no way 'pro gun' and dont own one, but I find it fascinating that you have never even seen ammo before? I can only presume you have had a very city-centric life.
Not shady at all. Roommate probably went on a spiritual retreat
No good getting the tenant out, they think it’s where they live. Time to pack up and visit Aunty Mabel up north.
Good. Did you tell the room mate about the shells?
Thank god you’re out of there
Two hands
HA. HA. Very funny, but we all know "skeet shooting" is a juvenile euphemism for male ejaculation, nice try buddy.
Ah, thank you. I wasn't sure what to even type into google beyond "clay" lol
Maybe leave a note on the door “Dave’s gone. If you see him, tell him he owes me rent”

This lets the bad guys know he’s not there, you don’t know where he is and you’re likely to be pissed at him to.
I saw you said you're moving out tomorrow (now today?). Might sound over the top, but can police be present while you do that? I'd be wary of being there alone.
What sort of skill? Let's see
If the Police told you to not be involved don't be silly posting photos on the internet.
Will do thanks man. I’m cleaning up after I made a cake last night with my mate to chill and relax
Best of luck to you and your room mate
Wait, that's the perfect cover for a bike gang enforcer! You monster!
update us when u out bro
Use it as a dildo
Have you seen you roommate after he locked himself away? Also, in the days leading up to this, has his behaviour become increasing erratic/just plain weird.
All of this is relevant information which should have been provided in your initial post to provide context.
>Don’t say things you don’t know about.

I was violently attacked by my half brother, who basically bashed up my whole family - including my grandmother, before the cops arrived. 

To this day I will never forget realising there was obvious signs he was losing the plot. Including mumbling to himself incoherently and locking himself in his room.

How about you follow your own advice?
Might be good to take your own advice there champ..
Found the roommate
All good mate..be safe
👍
Imo go crash at a mates place for the night if you're moving out tomorrow. I'd still take a drive to the station and report it. Just for the sake of your room mate.
Guns are dangerous and I hope one day people will stop seeing them as toys and start seeing them as a dangerous item that needs to be handled with care. You can have fun with guns, personally I find sporting clays to be a very relaxing sport, but you should never treat any firearm as harmless and too many people seem to view them that way.
See in the usa where I lived for a while it was a bullet for each person . . Dam straight id be worried
Live and learn lol. In a few years it will hopefully just be a funny story to tell.
I just saw that you are in Australia - what state may I ask?
If that is the case and you got somewhere to live now than you got off pretty easy tbh well played on the escape, you probly could not have timed that any better!
In terms of possible sentences and likely profitable outcomes? 

Yes. 

I absolutely do.

If you're unclear on where I stand, I am saying, from a criminal perspective, in the majority circumstances, intimidation is about ego or hard-ons than profit or staying out of cuffs.
Hmm yeah like in the middle of it not sure exactly how wide but sounds right
I hear you, and I am not going to pretend to be an expert with this kinda thing, and will defer to someone that does. Sounds like you are.
I didn’t downvote you, but I consider OPs ignorance of ammunition to be a great point of pride for Australian society 🦘🇦🇺👍
I haven’t really lived in the city I moved every 6 months to a new place, and my mum wasn’t the type to hang around anyone with a gun no matter the reason.
Didn’t need to he freaked out when he saw them. I posted in the comments some updates if you wanna see that
Clay pigeons
Yeah I had left last night with a mate of mine. My roommate left this morning, after waking up to an animal skull in a tree out the front of the house
That was before man.. I was so lost, and thought my roommate put them there at first then everything just spiralled
You caught onto me damn I’ll leave some shells by your window
Yeah I’m out no worries. I have a comment somewhere updating everyone
Besides staying in his room more often not really. He hasn’t come out of his room yet, but he sounds stressed
stop trying to diagnose a third person via leading questions in an internet forum. You are displaying symptoms of obsessive fixated munchausen by proxy... How often a day do you try and diagnose people based on a sentence?
I've had drug induced psychosis and your comments are spot on for what to look out for. Thankfully I didn't hurt anyone as I wasn't violent.

Don't need to tell you but just in case anyone else was on the fence I figured I'd say something.
By the way really appreciate your advice and warnings it means a lot
I’m sorry about that I hope you are okay
Will do thank you a ton
Yeah I will do thanks a lot plus it’s not a very good neighbourhood lots of junkies around, and plenty of bikies so I’m heading out now
Absolutely agree on every point
Surely in USA you'd think that someone misplaced two of the bullets they carry on their person at all times.
Usually the "traditional" mafia is only active in Italy. I highly doubt the American mob would waste their time enforcing these traditions. It was probably some wannabe gangsta who wanted to look scary
Queensland. I heard I’m pretty lucky not to be in Melbourne
You don't know the meaning of the word, clearly.
Honestly it is a big part of our pride especially compared to America, and all the gun violence there
Certainly not a criticism, but for many of us living in rural Australia, seeing shotgun shells around is somewhat common. To be a presumably young adult and not know what it was I found interesting.
Birds aren't real

/s
Guylian ones would be nice thanks.
lol
A large conch would look nice in my dining room if your still offering?
Probably hasn’t paid his tick
Does he abuse drugs ? Specifically meth ?
Maybe call the cops on his behalf once you're in a safe place? It sounds like your roommate is not in the best place to advocate for their own welfare or safety.

Not that it's in any way your fault or absolute obligation, but there's a slim chance of preventing a tragedy and/or getting an acutely psychotic person help.
Do you know if he’s been eating and sleeping decently?

Do you know if he’s been eating and sleeping decently?

Edit: Have to bail for the night. But for PSA and for what it’s worth:

Generally someone close, or in, psychosis will neglect personal cares. They won’t bother to eat, shower or sleep. But may still drink grog or do drugs. Neglecting these things will make him worse, very quickly.  

If you are genuinely in fear of your life, and in context or the shotgun shells, it may not hurt to ask to cops to welfare check him. 

If you are dealing with someone in psychosis avoid sudden and unpredictable movements. Literally and causally announce what you intend to do, before you do it. Avoid blocking an exit, but also make sure you have access to any exits before they does (e.g. don’t block the doorway to a room, stand near the door to the side). Try to remove any potential weapons outside of their sight, and avoid turning your back on them.
All the time. Like right now - you. You’re suffering from being a twat syndrome. 

/s
👍
What suburb is this?
Thats what Im thinking there for a 12 gauge there lead free shells and cheap
I think you will be alright bruh. Just do what you have to do to remove yourself from a situation that to all accounts sounds like nothing to do with you. Live long friend. Goodnight from SA
Someone made U a bitch huh
I’m 46. Lived in western Sydney most of my life, and now in a rural location for 7 years. I have never seen ammunition. I have only seen police guns. I really don’t think that is uncommon. I would have worked out it was ammunition, but probably after picking it up without thinking- I mean, weird thing to find on your window sill
Bunch of psychobabble! They’re made of porcelain.
Puts seashells back in pocket...sad Mario walks away
“You know I’m good for it!”

Roommate in room sweating bullets; sober as a judge: ‘fuck… I’m not good for it’.
I don’t know if he has had meth but he has had cocaine lots of it and weed he has written on a door in the laundry to quit weed
Yeah I don’t want him to suffer, he’s helped me when I’ve been in such a tight spot with being nearly homeless so I’ll make sure he’s okay. I won’t leave him on his own totally, but I am with another mate for the night
Do not do this, it's a terrible idea. The likelihood of police involvement at this stage actually improving outcomes for anyone is basically slim to none. If he's having a legitimate mental health crisis sending some shit kicker patrol cops over that A Have zero effective mental health training and B He absolutely doesn't want there, will not help his mental state at all and the options basically go from stress increase to severe and potentially permanently debilitating repercussions (seriously look into the outcomes of some police welfare checks in this country).

Plus if he's doing anything shady there's a solid chance the cops won't give two shits about his mental health and will be more concerned with either arresting him or using him to arrest other people. This doesn't help him either (obviously if he's the one arrested) but also possible retaliation by criminal elements. 

  
A good rule of thumb is to never fucking call the cops about a mental health thing unless you genuinely believe it's necessary to prevent an imminent and palpable threat of severe death or injury, otherwise you're expecting a cop to function effectively as a mental health professional, they're not so I fail to see any possible reason for thinking they even could let alone expecting a positive outcome for the patient.
He barely ever eats but drinks lots of VB, and stays out drinking till 4am
I'm not Australian, and I don't know what's going on there. I just know that in Italy this would be considered a serious threat by the mafia. I hope OP's gonna be fine
Thanks man have a goodnight too. Yeah I don’t think it involves me, and I’m sure they are fine letting me walk away as I don’t have anything to do with it just wrong place
Ego got the better of you?
Definitely concerning
Oh nah hey hey come on. Those are really nice shells man! Got any blue ones?
Yeah I know my roommate is bad for money I found out two days ago he hasn’t paid his mortgage nor his rates in 2 years
😂😂 no shit
Coke isn't cheap. If someone is after him, I'd imagine he owes them for this. Or more likely, he's been dealing for them without paying upfront, and he hasn't paid them their cut. Adds up real quick. I had a boyfriend when I was much younger who did this and within a month or so he had sold and/or used 10k of coke, mdma, speed, etc but spent the money and owed his dealer thousands. Thankfully, his dealer was lazy, drug dependent himself so kinda useless, and definitely not in a gang.
Holy shit you need to stop getting all your news from TikTok.

There's fucking shotgun shells left outside as a threat. You don't want an unarmed case worker showing up and getting caught in the crossfire of some thug with a shotgun.

You want armed police.
So don’t call the cops. What should he do?
Right. So don't call the cops about the shells, which might be related to OMCG or other criminal syndicates? What a dumb comment.

Also, you sound like someone who's been scheduled by the police or ambo. Probably well deserved as well.
Well yeah that'll fuck you right up.
That can make you quite ill, similar to scurvy if you get all your calories from alcohol and not food. Even bread has nutritional supplements added at the bakery nowadays, but it's as if your roommate is eating plain white bread for all his calories without even the supplements. 

Probably need to get him a health check-up as well or at least recommend he take some multivitamins if he is against the idea of a doctor.
Depending on where OP lives, it could be the Italian mafia (Western Aus. or Victoria) or the Lebanese mafia (New South Wales)

OP did mention a biker gang, though. Maybe the Rebels?
I believe its called fuck around and find out .
Seems like a reasonable conclusion 👍🏻
Happy Mario music intensifies
Oh in that case it's just the CBA manager leaving a gift for your housemate
Yeah I don’t know who it is, or who their affiliation is, and I don’t want to know I’m not involved. I’ve never even seen drugs
You need to stop watching movies/TV. 

Stop being so fucking dramatic idiot.
Maybe they’re the person that left the shells. /s
Common sense! I thought you were dead.
>There's fucking shotgun shells

 spent target load shells. When you say "fucking shotgun shells" people think live buckshot and those are neither live nor buckshot, but I digress

> left outside as a threat

Indeed, to whit, they wouldn't be leaving shit around as an intimidation tactic if his actual life was in any immediate danger. So if he's having some kind of psychological episode there's clearly time to address that in a way that's actually helpful and not likely to completely alienate the person you're allegedly trying to help while shitkicking their already low poor mental health.

And honestly, a couple of kids might have found some spent shells and thought it was funny and old mate might be going through some entirely unrelated. We don't know. It could very well be a drug debt but going immediately to calling the cops without any further information or discussion is insane.

>You don't want an unarmed case worker showing up and getting caught in the crossfire of some thug with a shotgun.

Because the only possible scenario is a case worker showing up to the house? They're the only non law enforcement figure that can potentially help? No, they wouldn't even be there at the most likely times for that to happen if it's actually likely at all.

>You want armed police.

To deal with someone potentially having a psychotic episode? Would you let an Orderly operate on you at a hospital?

Maybe you should watch less Tik Tok sonny jim, I don't even use it due to being old as dirt, which shoulda been obvious from the extremely longwinded posting.
* Contact Family
* Contact Other friends
* Contact Mental health professional
* Contact Social worker

Just off the top of my head...

EDIT: This one is the most obvious but I can't believe I didn't think to write it first but for sure try to actually talk to him or at least asses his mental state before calling the jacks.
>Right. So don't call the cops about the shells

Not immediately, never said not to call them at all, just pointing out that if he's genuinely concerned about his roommates mental health immediately calling the police and potentially escalating the shit out of the situation based on zero hard evidence is a terrible choice. 

>which might be related to OMCG or other criminal syndicates? What a dumb comment.

Maybe, I can't unequivocally say it's not, But it's not exactly hard to get shotgun ammunition so jumping to direct involvement of bikies or some other organized crime entity based on finding two spent target shells like that and nothing else of substance is pretty dumb. 

>Also, you sound like someone who's been scheduled by the police or ambo. Probably well deserved as well.

First of all: Rude. Second of all: The Ad hominem really weakens your position, it's super obvious when it's in it's own paragraph at the end. Third: Objectively false, I don't even know what being scheduled is and the one time I've been in an ambulance I was the model patient. Finally: There's no causal connection between being a proponent of not treating the police like some kind of deific paternal figure that can benevolently solve all of our problems and criminality (which I think is what you're imply with this comment) but states that have widespread social acceptance of that conflation are often leaning pretty heavily in the fascistic direction.
As I said: I'm not Australian, I'm not familiar with crime families over there. I was concerned for op, since here in Italy that's a very serious threat. I really hope he's going to be fine
He said he doesn't have anything going on with gangs, so it was probably his roommate
