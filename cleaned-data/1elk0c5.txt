Went to the hookers, charged 250 for 15 minutes. 

Caught her resetting the clock for 12 minutes. Doesnâ€™t matter that I finish in 1 minute. I paid for 15 minutes she can sit there and listen to me cry for the remaining 14. 

Used to be able to get 15 minutes for a pack of Winnie blues during seniors day at the local.
