\*internally screaming\* 

One of the multitude of reasons the NBN was and has been an absolute farcical rollout in Australia is because NewsCorp lobbied hard to reduce the impact of streaming services on it's payTv business. God damn, we could've had a brilliant, world-class network but noooooooo
We gave up Foxtel 20 something years ago mainly due to shit shows and the number of ads.  Couldn't believe we had to pay to watch ads.
I've been trying for years to get my now 80 year old dad off Foxtel, it's costing a fuckton just for him to use it to watch 90% free to air channels and a bit of sport that is usually available elsewhere.
The only thing worth watching on Binge is the content they licence from HBO. With HBO looking to enter the Australian market themselves, the writing is on the wall for Binge.
Selling it off? Isn't it almost at the point of _writing_ it off?
How anyone still pays for this is beyond me
I feel like we have reached a generational tipping point
> Seven West Media and Foxtel have confirmed they have secured the AFL media rights from 2025 to 2031 in a historic deal worth $4.5bn.

So Foxtel paid the AFL $4.5 billion over five years. Where does that money come from? They'd need 2 million subscribers at $50/month just to cover that cost. Advertising revenue is in the toilet for all the media outlets with the exception of gambling adverts but the government is under pressure to curtail that boom. Yep, that's why Murdoch wants to shed itself of Foxtel, the end is nigh.
Who'd be stupid enough to buy it?

Seriously. The only reason I keep it is for the sport - because Kayo sucks. 

Subscriber numbers have been trending down for years now because of the pure crap that most of the "channels" play on endless repeat (same shit, 8 hour cycle, three times s day).

If Kayo was anything but a steaming pile of putrid dog shit, I'd ditch it completely.
 problem is why would someone buy the Foxtel product without raising the price or putting even more ads into it 

Both options will just drive more people away,
I've got Foxtel for NFL, NBA, WWE etc, but the price is ridiculous. Was so much better in the early 00's when we got the gold card from the market and got everything while only paying for the basic plan haha
Any one want to buy an old broken terminally ill dog. On its last legs. A few years to go. Going cheap but has ongoing costs.
I'm still baffled how they still existed. foxtel became obsolete to me 10 years ago
Tell 'em they're dreamin'
I've been trying to get rid of Foxtel for a few years now and every time I call, they keep giving me deals to retain me.

I now have the platinum package for about $40 a month. That's the only reason why I still have it.
You'd assume it'll be snapped up of only for Kayo. Ditch or heavily cut back on Foxtel, drop hinge once the hbo content drys up and just focus on pushing the sport.
If a byproduct of this means that they lose their stranglehold on Formula 1 and F1TV is -finally- allowed to operate in Australia, I'm all for it.

Somehow though, being one of their most valuable 'properties', I doubt it... :(
Well this is one way to find out Foxtel still exists.
No idea why anyone would buy Foxtel. Binge and Kayo Sport are viable. 

I think someone will buy Foxtel just to get access to various content that is currently in the hands of Foxtel
Can they just run it into the ground. That foxtel is cancer.
Moved to Fetch and never looked back.
That's ok, just save Colin from Accounts
Anyone else remember when it was called Austar?

my family's had foxtel for years, even back in the austar days, but we're getting sick of the lack of good shows, constant replays, and amount of ads on this PAID SERVICE. the ads aren't too big of a deal since we mainly watch recordings and can fast forward the ads. the fact that it uses a satellite dish instead of internet is nice, because when Telstra craps out we can still watch the telly.
Only reason I have it is because the parents love their sky news and footy, I've tried convincing them to get rid of it but they need their daily dose of Murdoch propaganda
Fuck paying for shit 

Join me at f movies and sail the seas yarghh
Kayo is a cursed application which  angers me on a daily basis - whoever buys it please understand I only watch AFL, and will probably only ever watch AFL. I dont need to see Peruvian Tiddlywinks Heats - as you should know I have never watched it. It must be the only app where I am crying out for an algorithm.
I think the only suiters would be some sort of existing service provider i.e. telco or electricity providers so they can sell Foxtel with their service and get the margins they need. 

I hate Foxtel, shitshow, but I do hope all of those Australia jobs in media, sports coverage, tv studio shows etc make it through this.
Finally, in the public eye, there have been rumoured discussions in the industry for years.
Have to admit I am not that old and have Foxtel. But it's for the sport, and I'd rather pay $55 a month for it and have a stable, reliable broadcast unlike Kayo. I also like the stuff like Selling Houses Australia, Love It or List It...and that's about it. But as others have said, once they loose HBO, WWE and whatever our scraps they have, they are toast in their current iteration 
Binge is the worst fucking app. Did a trial. Never again
I’m looking forward to watching the various HBO shows once my money would no longer be going to that evil man.
does this mean i can get kayo now?!
does this mean no more sky news? 

or will it just become a free to air channel now?
FOX has gone down hill since they got rid of the EPL, press red FOX FOOTY and Press red Weather channel.

Gone backwards in technology somehow
It's so hard getting older folk to adapt to new things after a certain age, especially tech. But I reckon if today's 60somethings are learning how to use streaming services then foxtel is well and truly doomed in the next 5-10 years as the older generation leaves us. They shot themselves in the foot a little with Kayo but I'm guessing that's what earns the most money nowadays
I’ll give them $1
Just a coincidence that the footy will be on the 7 app lots more next year. HBO is a matter of time before they launch max here. Haha newscorpse its deserved after the nbn sabotage!
They wont sell it because nobody needs to buy it. Terrible news for AFL and NRL.
Why I am laughing at this!
He said he wanted about tree fiddy...
woof. Foxtel gotta be on life support right now hey. I give it 2, 3 years before it has a pillow held up to its face.
Thank you Tony Abbott. Thank you Malcolm Turnbull. Thank you Coalition voters.


Now we'll spending billions of dollars we should have spent building the NBN properly in the first place, slowly bringing fibre to the country over decades. 
NewsCorpse are reaping what they sow. They are struggling to stay relevant in a digital world that they sabotaged
| Kick this mob out |
Even ADSL was gimped with its low upload speeds.
Yeah how quaint, now we pay to see ads on Amazon prime and Netflix
I Gave up foxtel when they scrambled my dodgy card 🫣
Tbh it's moderately decent now they gave a lot more per package - I get movies


Saying that, all I watch is sports and discovery channel  - or abc news which is free anyway
Isn't this who Kayo is for
Let him be, he’s happy with it…my old dads the same , he would know how to figure an app out and then also pay for unlimited internet.
Oh god another fucking subscription service? Wasn’t 38 enough?
I can't remember where I read it, but their agreement ends this year. Once that's gone, what's left?
Maybe it’s Warner buying Foxtel….
Do they have succession on binge
They've also lost the rights to a bunch of premium UK drama shows from the BBC.
Works fine streaming on stremio or Kodi+ fen. 
Would rather pay $5 a month then pay those fuckers.
I’m always pissed when I go to check JustWatch for say 80s cartoons for the kids or some 80s action movie and binge has the license!
The only reason I ever briefly pay for binge is HBO content and I hate having to do it. I refuse to call HBO Max though! 
Yeah give it/donate it to the ABC to run properly, but they would rather cut off their nose to spite their face for ideology.
Elderly people who either don't know any better, or aren't willing to make the leap to trying something new will still pay for Foxtel. I stuck a Google TV onto my parents television and signed them up to Tubi and a bunch of freeplay streaming services, and it works fine, but it's a lot of effort to make things convenient.
Uh, I pay more than I'd like but it's great for sport.
Sport

i always do wonder if foxtel went free for there base channel if they be a better position
I recently rented a cabin that had foxtel and the amount of utter crap on it, I felt ripped off and I wasn't even paying for it.
Seven is paying the lion's share of that.

Anyway if Trump doesn't get in, Newscorp is cooked - the Dominion Voting case will completely drain the business.
Apparently they (foxtel $100pm and kayo $35pm) have 5 Million subscribers....
Really depends if you get the licenses to what's on Foxtel. Maybe someone like Stan or whatever streaming services we have here want to have them to bolster their sites
[deleted]
Same, except I’m with Telstra and they sent an email something about a loyal customer and got everything for cheap including multiple tv screens. First time Telstra has ever done anything for “loyal” customers.
That's pretty good, I'll have to try and bargain for that when I make the call
Same
Or wait until the HBO stuff dries up and get it for even cheaper.
They'll be losing their content soon anyway as Max will be launching here eventually
Kayo and binge are owned by Foxtel? They are specifically mentioned in this article which implies they're part of the sale.
Well, Binge and Kayo is owned by Hubbl which is owned by Foxtel, so they'll just remove Foxtel eventually and you'll be paying the same amount for 7 streaming services under Hubble anyway (not me though!)
[deleted]
i've tried kayo in the past - it's rubbish when it does work.
Austar was a different business that did pay tv people outside of the metro areas, foxtel brought it several years back.
Actvid .rs also says hello (no signup or anything, better UI imo)
Mate thank you Australia. This is what the people voted for. Same as franking credits. Same as negative gearing. Same as the carbon tax. 

I still haven’t forgiven the Australian public for doing Shorten as dirty as they did. 
To be frank, I was in your camp until recently. Look at the mess Albanese and Shorten did on NDIS and Immigration. If NBN had gone ahead as per the Labor’s plan, we would be begging to pay the fees!
Just go back to pirating it’s so much easier and faster now.
To be fair, Amazon Prime is mostly for free shipping with Amazon. Prime TV is an added benefit.
The only reason we have Prime is because partner has paid for something special with Amazon (can't remember what, maybe quicker postage).  And I've only looked at Prime maybe 4 times.  I went looking for my favourite shows only to see that a couple of them were there and were 2 or more seasons behind.  Kind of defeats paying for the service.
[deleted]
Pay who? See what now?


Nothing like that on my Plex server.
 O Ads on my Netflix
I'm more of a TV series person.  And have zero interest in sports.  I fully understand those who are interested in sports and are willing to pay to watch it - it's just not my cuppa tea.
my main problem with dad isn't so much the content available, its that he simply cant learn how to use something new, he has parkinsons and mild alzheimers so if I teach him how to use a new app or remote hes great for a day, then he has no idea how to do anything the next day.
Then they need to pay for unlimited internet. My old day has a basic internet plan for a little surfing of news and email…apart for him not knowing apps he’d also have to pay a lot more for internet.
Now you can buy Hubbl, yet another service to aggregate them all!
The reason streaming became a thing is because people complained about the cost of bundling everything together on cable. But why would HBO give their content to netflix for free? Photorealistic CGI dragons cost a shitload of money to produce. If you want everything on netflix you're going to end up paying $110 a month for that.

Sub to a service for a month, watch everything you like, and then move to another service. Stranger Things will be there in 6 months when you cycle back.
Sport and News
That’s a good call even if only from a subscriber base perspective. That’s your Max audience already. The Max app has also recently been rebuilt after many criticisms. Hubbl/Streamotion’s Binge app is quite flawed. A sale to WBD would simply be Foxtel’s database moved to a new app. Foxtel as a whole would also give WBD instant access to sports, lack of which has really impacted their bottom line recently from a US perspective.

Not sure what anyone would do with the actual Foxtel pay TV part of the business. That kind of pay tv model never realised its potential in Australia.
So no Death In Paradise anymore?
This,If you can teach them how to smart TV it helps. my parents also ended up discoving the YouTube app and found a bunch of stuff they enjoy there which is cool.
Yes, but they're a dwindling market so they're selling it before it starts making a significant enough loss.
I doubt they’d find much they would want to watch on Tubi…yes it’s free but it’s terrible.
Kayo, or full-blown Foxtel?

I don't know, the people in this thread talking like Foxtel is strictly a liability based on the main brand's antiquated ripoff of a service offering might be overlooking the fact that the company still aggregates a pretty significant collection of broadcast rights under its banner, and some of its subsidiary services (e.g. Kayo) are still probably pretty relevant and successful. Recently I was asked by my dad to look into sport streaming services, and found that there really is no replacement for the Foxtel group. They have basically everything, and they have the rights to really big things like F1 and UFC locked up.

I have to imagine that some buyer ought to be able to turn the Foxtel ship around.
AFL, Supercars, F1, MotoGP, NASCAR, plus all support categories for each of the racing ones.

I don't trust my internet enough to stream (fixed wireless), and I see enough bitching about Kayo turning to shit often that I'm glad I've got a dish.
But its sad in my case how my parents who were nice and thoughtful people who just got turned into monsters by Sky news. 

We used to have to great political conversations before they watched sky news, now speaking with them is just horrible once they switch into "fox news echo box mode" hating and whining about everything.

 I really never thought I would witness a truly brainwashed persons or people in my life. But here I am looking at my parents who speak "fox news hate and stupidity" whenever they see a certain brand of politicians or political subjects from that side. The endless nonsense that they heard on fox news just comes out their mouths like Pavlov's dogs like someone flicked a switch. And seriously they are my parents.

 I avoid discussing all social  and political matters with them because of fear of the " fox news propaganda echo box" conversation and rants. I just switch to food, the weather and stupid subjects to avoid anything political because of their brainwashing.
I think that's why they're looking to dump it - the licensing is expiring shortly for a lot of things, and I suspect it isn't likely to be renewed in more cases than they want to admit.

With the demise of the cable/HFC network, Foxtel in general is just a streaming service now anyway - and both their "set top" boxes and app largely have huge numbers of bugs or annoyances that just piss people off.
Unfortunately, that doesn't appear to be the case.

It doesn't have the V8's in its "Motorsport" category, for example.

Interesting infrastructure, though. It appears to have local exit points for its streams - less than 15 ms away from me on the ones I tested - I wonder how they manage to avoid the wrath of Murdoch for rights infringement?
Does it have reliable AFL streams though?
Is there a tv app so it’s as simple as normal Foxtel or streaming services?
Does it have 4K 50fps streams of football? lol
You don’t call up to bargain, you call up to leave and let them bargain you into staying. If you just say “can you do a better deal” you will be get pittance at best.
You should see the comments on Facebook when they lost BBC.

What content apart from sport, has Foxtel got?
Buy Foxtel to get Binge and Kayo. Close Foxtel and keep Binge and Kayo. Foxtel are already making users responsible for satellite used to access Foxtel
Buy Kayo and Binge - get Foxtel for free (plus don't forget Flash News). 

Also curious where does Sky News AU ends up? Still owned by Newscorp??

Foxtel looses the rights to the Sky name in 2026 (a decade after Newscorp sold Sky UK).
Problem with Kayo for me is that they don't have international cricket matches.

Kayo still has AFL, NRL and BBL
I get ESPN channels on my Kayo, along with some replays and minis. Not sure if there is extra ESPN content missing though that you are referring to
makes sense.
Rudd's original NBN plan would have been finished by 2017 if he stayed in office instead of Abbott
NDIS was introduced in the same year that Labor lost power. Then it was neglected for almost a decade. Blaming Shorten for that would be like blaming Harry Potter's parents for giving him a bedroom under his aunt's stairs.
No it's not, don't listen to this guy.


Do *not* google how to set up your own media server with Plex and autodownloads via Sonarr (TV) and Radarr (Movies) just by using an old PC. Don't do it. 
☠️🦜
This is me, I do lots of shopping on amazon, the prime subscription is definitely worth it.
Yeah, Prime is probably the best value. 

Free same/next day shipping, a streaming service and Prime Gaming which gives out free games and extras for select games if you play them.
I have Prime but since everyone gets free shipping over $59 I'm a bit skeptical about it as an actual dollar saving - some of my orders would still be free anyway and most that weren't could have been consolidated into larger ones.

Could well still be worth it for convenience, deals on Prime Day, Prime Video etc. of course.
Plus the ad-free version is only like $2 more than the ad version anyway.

I'm also on the ad tier of Netflix and am pleasantly surprised at how few ads there actually are. Even watching it every day, multiple episodes of a show or a movie, I see like 2 ads a week. I've recently watched 3 movies in a row without a single ad the whole time. When binging shows it's like one ad every 6 episodes or so.

No doubt they'll probably increase the number of ads over time. But for now I often forget I'm even on the ad tier.
Watch The Boys. It's ace.
That’s not unique to Prime. Seasonal licensing agreements are a joke. In some cases seasons are split between services

And in others we’re just perpetually a year OR MORE behind the US
The worse one is that not all the shows they show on offer actually are, there's quite a few that if you want to actually watch it you have to dish out an additional rental fee, I've never had it and I never plan to as Amazon is a straight up evil company ontop of the constant greed stacking.
Back when we did sign up for Foxtel, it was the one and only pay tv.  And there was only the odd ad for other shows / movies.  Then suddenly, the ads became more frequent and longer.  Half hour shows became an hour as it was filled up with ads.

I just went to the library yesterday and walked out with two tv series, and two movies.  The choice at the library is pretty limited, but in recent years, their quality of tv shows have been great.  I also frequent the local Salvos store and Ebay for secondhand DVDs.  Still cheaper than Foxtel.  And no ads.
Yep I think fox are quite aware without them putting AFL behind paywall they'd go broke !
I guess that's one thing we need to hand to them, that remote has been essentially the same since the 90s
And give Murdoch all your viewing data.
I need a service to aggregate all these aggregators.
I don't get Hubble, isn't it just the same as an Apple TV box? Or does it actually put all your subscription services into the one "interface" to select whichever show or movie? Or is it just a way for boomers to pay all the different subscription services in one spot? N

 I'm not going to buy one, but I haven't actually seen a decent review or run through of this device on YouTube, though I haven't looked for a newer review vid in the last 5-6 months. 
I don’t even care enough to do that. I’m all but done chasing TV shows - I’ll just watch whatever is on Prime or the services we’ve borrowed. Not putting more money, time or energy into this chaos.
Still airs on the ABC
My parents gave me back the media PC I bought them for Xmas as they preferred the set top box so it doesn't always work
There's plenty of old classic films, true crime/forensic shows, and older/schlock horror releases. If you're elderly or not interested in all the newest exclusive shows it's fine, especially for the price.
 Full blown foxtel via satellite. I watch Golf, F1, MotoGP, AFL, NRL and others. It just works and has reasonable 4K on multiple channels. I'm happy with it but would like to just pay for what I watch. I wonder if its bought out by another company they'd offer A La Carte and gain a larger viewership and thus not lose revenue compared to the current offerings.
least it isn't 9Now. that thing is an actual steaming pile of shit. thing is Kayo has a catch up to live button
this is true. but if someone else buys it they might do something about that
It's an absolute sewer. It was three hours straight the other night ripping on Kamala, purposely getting her name wrong, suggesting she's the least popular candidate in American history etc. 
  
All with that smug, know all, shit eating presentation these grifters all default to. 

And they're beaming it on free-to-air straight into the regions. It's a serious fucking problem.
Happened to a few people I know in their mid to late 60's (though I don't know too many). They were all already conservative voters, but you used to be able to have thoughtfull conversations with them. Now they don't trust sources unless it agrees with their preconceived notions.
Been watching the V8's on YouTube all year, VPN to the US to join the channel and that's it, don't need the VPN again. ~$11/m and you get the full day live or catch up.
Exactly this.

Tell them you want to disconnect the service as you can't afford it, and they'll throw offers at you like crazy.

Mine started out with free movies for 6 months, then rang back to cancel, then got another channel set at a discounted price and just kept doing it until I got the platinum.
It's going to be 24x7 Selling Houses Australia and Gogglebox
HBO, Taskmaster and WWE.

Only things I can think of atm.
Too bad Rudd made the wrong move according to his party when he suggested mining companies pay tax.
>*original NBN plan would have been finished by 2017*

Unfortunately it wouldn't... But it would have been completed by 2022 and cost under $43 Billion compared to the MTM lieberal shit show that is going to cost us $74+ Billion even after their own Senate hearings stated it wasn't fit for purpose...
I definitely preferred Rudd's vision, but I'm sceptical they would've finished that quickly.
We dont talk about usenet either bro!
You should definitely not Google how to do this, and you should also definitely not Google how to setup Stremio + torrentio + realdebrid. 

Stremio when paired with realdebrid is an absolute game changer. I have introduced total technological luddites to it, and even they can use it. 

Fuck Foxtel. Fuck Murdoch.
And definitely don't learn about Docker so you can use Overseerr to request new content in an automated fashion either!
Definitely do not use streamio with realdebrid. I heard it doesn't need an old pc.
r/oddlyspecific 

As i typed this there is an r/oddlyweird , wonder if its new.
Too late! Yarr harr fiddle di dee!
Or using kodi

Haven’t looked at Prime gaming. What’s it like?
Iirc they gutted the extras, there's very little there now, mostly free games.
I should also suggest GenV the spinoff. Watch it after season 3 and before you watch season 4
That sux.  And frustrating.
Yeah, it just takes one popular sports to stop any of them from going under.
took him a year to get used to the newer Iq's home button where pause used to be!
Well selling of foxtel would include all of the things foxtel owns I.e hubbl, kayo, binge etc etc
At this point, pirating is the easier option by far
One interface. Just like how Foxtel boxes do it now I assume .. like when you search a show it’ll come up no matter what service..Foxtel, Netflix etc.
Kayo doesn’t have ESPN either I believe so can’t watch ufc, nba, nbl or nfl
$11 a month sounds a lot for just v8 Motorsport.
When I had austar/foxtel on 15years ago, they tried saying "we can give you fox sports for free," told them I'm not interested in sport, the response was like I has committed blasphemy
No Gogglebox. New owners of Paramount will probably rip Gogglebox away from Foxtel
Bet there's heaps of Poms tuning in for the soaps like my folks
Wwe is available on Stan as well. So HBO and taskmaster
It was on track so even if it went over it would have been long finished by now. Imagine FTTP everywhere
USENET!!!

ah newsgroups.
Most people only have a laptop and not a home PC, it's nice to fire up Plex from anywhere - even from your phone. 


Plex also manages all your media like a streaming service, it turns piracy from a meh experience to a seamless one.
In all honestly it used to be better than what it is now, but it's still fine for something that you're getting in addition to something else that you're paying for. 

You'll get a few free (exclusive) skins/packs for Apex, they give out Destiny packs with exotic engrams and currencies, Battlefield 2042 gets weapon skins and camos. 

Stuff for Runescape, Aion, Brawlhalla and other sorts of games. 

The bigger games they giveaway are usually on GOG so DRM free but they'll give out Epic/Steam codes too.  

Up until a few months ago, they had a deal with Riot so you would get a lot of stuff for LoL/TFT/LoR/Valorant.
Yeah the extras have gone downhill, but point still stands that it's extra value to the Prime service
Yeah GenV surprised me with how good it was. I was so disappointed that Chance Perdomo (played Andre) passed away. He's been great in everything I've seen him in.
They’ll probably stick around. Maybe even multiply once they start cannabilizing foxtels content. 

Either that or they’ll recombine everything into some monstrosity of a streaming service and charge like $100/month
It's not viable. too many attack sites and too many loud mouths spreading them on public forums for reputation so they get shutdown.
Ah Righto. So not exactly revolutionary, the AppleTV app in the atv box does that on a limited range of streaming apps. 

So it's really just a box for boomers to pay for foxtel, streaming etc on their Telstra bundle I'm guessing. 
Kayo definitely has ESPN and you can watch all the sports you listed and more
just checked, Kayo has ESPN and ESPN2
Kayo has ESPN. Get all those sports. It's why I like it so much, means I can watch NFL
A lot less than Kayo.
It's a co-production. Paramount has no money either and is looking for a buyer so they have their own issues to worry about
Only found out he passed away as I was checking the names of the people in it. there is ment to be a 2nd season about to come out along with another called voight rising featuring solder boy and liberty.
Lol at this point a tech nerd (or really just someone who can follow a youtube guide) can diy a system more convenient than the actual streaming services can offer, for the cost of hardware only.
Eh, I disagree, Pirating is always viable, and always will be. Private trackers and usenet are still mostly untouched, but even then we will just switch to a different service.

Im setting up a fully automated media server that pulls all recent shows I have selected, and movies from imdb list i feed it, and have not had any issues finding content.
Yeah, and Google TV has done this for ages as well.
Paramount is just waiting for the ink to dry on the contract
It's because the streaming services are still getting their revenue. Once they suffer a glut, they'd apply more pressure for law enforcement and sites can get shutdown quicker. Maybe at some point, they might actually get to the storage providers and are there enough of them around to keep one step ahead.


Or are you saying the ol' torrents are still around. I thought they'd disappeared in favour of the web based ones.
> Or are you saying the ol' torrents are still around.

Yeah this one haha - torrenting is stronger than ever after so many people have switched back due to this exact reason.
I torrent shit all the time. A little harder to find quality 4k content since rarbg went down last year, or things encoded well for that matter, but I can find high quality 1080p with high seeders of basically anything - new or old - no worries. I just re-encode it to h265 myself (best format my TV can easily run and has low storage requirements), then reseed until I hit a good ratio, as everyone should, then clear off anything that I've done a conversion on. Keep seeding anything that I keep as is for perpetuity.

I know it's not too much effort to set up plex server, but this works well enough for me that I don't need to bother. I have 4 streaming services anyway, this is just for anything not covered by those.
100%
