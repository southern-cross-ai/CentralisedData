Did I hear right that it hasn’t been done by an Aussie in 104 years ??? 
Well done Maddie. 👏
Just watched it. Great effort! 

The only sport where you get to hot tub with your friends.
Go Maddi! Australia’s first ever medal in Women’s 3m Springboard!
Good thing it was on Friday night, I could actually stay up and watch this event.
This was so good to watch!! Go Maddie!!
Usually it’s very hard in diving because the Chinese divers get gold and silver.
