A lot of people have mentioned the points below so apologies for any repetition.  I just want to chime in with my thoughts. 

I feel like there is more to Krishank’s story than what’s currently known. The theory that he ran away due to a breakup is speculative and may only be part of the picture. There could be multiple factors contributing to his decision, and only Krishank knows the full truth. Given this, i think it might have been better to keep sensitive information about his breakup confidential and share it only with the police to avoid potentially complicating the search or embarrassing him.

Several aspects of the interview are a red flag to me:

1. His mother’s derogatory remarks about Krishank’s ex-girlfriend are troubling. At 16, dealing with a breakup is challenging enough without it being in the public eye. Publicly disparaging the ex-girlfriend by calling her a “loser” and comments like “you’ll get a better girl than her, mate” are so unnecessary and could have negative effects, not just on Krishank but also his ex. These situations need to be handled with compassion, delicacy and maturity. 

2. The Father’s remark about seeing a “different father” upon Krishank’s return was a little out of the blue and in such contrast to his mother’s message. To me it suggests there might be more underlying issues. This statement could imply that the family is attributing his disappearance mainly to the breakup, possibly to deflect from other issues. For those asking, here is a link to the interview: [interview](https://youtu.be/uOUzECM80Ww?feature=shared)

3. The brother’s statement saying “It’s hard because I can’t cry because I don’t want to make my mum cry” also speaks volumes. His younger brother must be around 13 years old.  The brother’s remark indicates he is carrying a significant emotional burden, possibly feeling pressure to stay strong for his family, particularly his mother. Children, regardless of their age, should not bear the emotional burden of maintaining strength or stability for their parents. It is important for adults to provide emotional support and guidance to children, ensuring they feel safe and supported. Period.

Unfortunately, many South Asian families still struggle with creating environments where children feel safe discussing their emotions and experiences, often judging mental health based on academic performance. It’s a sad reality, but hopefully future generations will break this cycle and foster more supportive and understanding family dynamics.

I hope Krishank is safe and finds the help and support he needs.
>”When he failed to return home from school on Monday afternoon, Krish’s mother Shobana Karthik began calling his friends, who told her Krish had not been to school in weeks.

>While it appears as though the teenager had planned to leave, his family said they have no idea why.”

I mean, it could be any number of reasons these days, but not knowing that your grown child hasn’t been to school for weeks doesn’t speak too well for your relationship with them.

Also, why weren’t the parents informed by the school if this was the case?
The selective school he attends is known for having bright ethnic kids who end up with mental health issues. I have heard of past tragedies at that school as it’s too much pressure for young people from the western suburbs. Very sad.
Ok, but it’s not like he’s 5. He’s 16. He’s not hiding, he’s bought a new phone, backed a suitcase etc. made plans and carried them out. So he’s of sound mind. 16 is young to leave home, but it’s not unheard of. 

Feel like there’s important information missing from this story.
imma bite the bullet and say that the kid was almost certainly under an unfair amount of academic pressure. everything points towards it, how the dad says he'll be a better father, he was going to a selective high school which are pretty notoriously terrible for mental health and he has asian parents.

his family and peers are probably devastated, but since he seemed to have planned this out pretty thoroughly, good for him for taking initiative in his life, assuming that it was by his own accord and wasnt groomed or manipulated.

Based on news interview reckon he wanted to date someone mum and dad didn't like  - cultural reasons maybe?


Poor kid


Hope parents have learnt from this experience, and hope kid is safe / things work out.
I’m sure he got his reasons
This is bizarre
Hope he’s alright.
Poor lad. I hope he’s ok.
Lots of young people leave home. I left when I was 16. I was never on the news. And sorry to say, but you can guarantee if it were an aboriginal kid it wouldn’t be a news item. But a smart kid from a (seemingly) good family? That’s completely different! 

He’ll be ok. He knows what he’s doing.
Some news outlets have now reported that he has been found and reunited with his family.
I feel so sorry for this kid. His mother stating in the first interview that any problems can be worked out shows something was going on. There is no way he would run away if he’s not running away from something. It seems like he has had a miserable upbringing with overly strict parents and raised in a country where this is not the norm. Parents need to understand that there’s nothing more important than mental health honestly. 
Maybe meeting his girlfriend
This is exactly how south Asian people speak - the massive guilt tripping and overdeveloped sense of responsibility. The poor younger brother can’t feel his own emotions because this immature joke of a woman can’t handle her own emotions properly. I feel so sorry for this kid and the toxic double chinned trash he has to grow up with.
Fucking called it that this was just a kid getting away from overbearing parents, got perma-banned from r/melbourne for that.
Seems he is on vacation and people are going crazy
His parents are the root cause for this south Asian parents are over bearing on their kids the pressure they put on the kids are ridiculous, I have had colleague who’s daughter too ran away from home, however it was not on the news, but cops where involved and she was found within few of hours after they filed the missing report. Now they have moved back to India to get away from the drama, I bet his parents will be thinking the same now.
I wonder if this was a blonde blue eyed kid people would be annoyed at the amount of police resources…..
Also, in one of the earlier missing person posters, he’s family put the line ‘your mother hasn’t eaten in days’. 

Seems kind of like the mother might be at the very least extremely overbearing and require the kids to shoulder the emotional burden for her wellbeing.
Omg… that interview, what a POS mother. Who says such horrible things about a teenage girl, calling her a ‘loser’ etc. That’s fucked up and I see why this kid ran away. I wish him luck getting away from his family because if that’s what they say on national tv then I worry what they say behind the scenes.
Often parents don't know why because they aren't good parents.
Honestly, the family sounds awful and no doubt is responsible for him running away.

Kids run away from home because of shitty home environments, not because of break ups.
When I first heard about the disappearance, it really reminded me of Tej Chitnis who is still missing to this day. It seems Tej had a better family but he had told his parents he was going to transition to medicine and it turned out he hadn't attended uni for two years before his disappearance.
The dads comment is very telling.

Also the family are focusing on the breakup but I feel like it was whatever he was doing during that 2 weeks he didn’t go to school that is more relevant.
He had signed into the parent’s portal to mark himself as excused absence. It says so in the article (or the article it links to).

People are jumping to all number of conclusions about his motive based on the fact that he planned to leave and it references him being sighted as emergency accomodation - I have found nothing to state that he is a *client* of the accomodation and the fact that we have the CCTV released to us implies Vic police are imploring people to search for him and that emergency services aren’t currently in touch.

Edit: whether he has a “genuine” reason to flee his family is irrelevant. The authorities need to get in touch with him - he’s sixteen. If he’s found emergency housing and can live independently, they’ll let him. The government is obligated nonetheless to find out if he’s ok. On the other hand if he’s fleeing his family because he’s been groomed online or is in trouble otherwise, the police can investigate. To encourage people not to highlight his missing persons report is mind boggling dumb.
When I was in high school, my mum and stepdad were both leaving for work by 730. I would forge their signatures on absent notes lol they had no idea because it was being marked as an approved absence. They would get home by 4, so me being home at that time wouldn't have seemed weird to them.
I went there, graduated only last year. 100% true. I even remember a suicide about 4 years ago - tho not sure if it was related to academic/family pressures
Reminds me of that other kid tej from several years back, they never found his body
This. I know this sounds harsh but I don't know why so many police resources are being put into this when he is obviously a runaway. He will come home if/when he wants to. He obviously knows people are looking for him. Meanwhile there are hundreds (possible thousands) of missing Australians who have never been spotted since they were reported missing.
16 year olds can still be vulnerable; mental health issues, victims of grooming etc. not that that’s what this necessarily is, but you never know.
Yes my son did it, to get away from his mother. I separated from my wife a few months after that and he lived with me for most of the time through covid.
Where did you find the interview of the dad? 7news?
Man on a mission. Let him cook.
Exactly bro
I find the statement by the father interesting, he said in the interview "when he comes back he will see a whole new father" which makes me wonder if the family believe he has left due to something behind the scenes with the family that they are not revealing at the moment. Why would he need to be reassured he would see a improved father if he returned home?

What if he broke up the girlfriend because he knew he was leaving?

I dunno, teenagers are crazy but somethings up.
He had a girlfriend who broke up with him recently, like Friday or something. Parents didn’t know, they found it bc he went missing. Very possible they wouldn’t have approved but I don’t know why that would make him run away after they broke up
Source?
Thank you for the update! Just saw the [news article](https://www.news.com.au/national/victoria/news/missing-teen-krishank-krish-karthik-found-by-police-and-reunited-with-loved-ones/news-story/71b30b8ddada2c4c2890c49de0d7568e?amp)

Even though he has been found, something still feels off. I’m relieved he’s physically safe, and although I’m not sure we will ever learn the full story of what happened, I just hope he is able to get the support and care he needs to overcome whatever challenges he’s facing.
Was about to say I heard he got found, I suspect he nicked the dads credit card and was able to track him with it
Plenty of Anglo kids have gone missing or run away and have had heaps of publicity and police resources lmao. If anything I’m impressed they’re treating this as equally
That sort of phrase is directly out of the South Asian parenting guidebook right under the massive section of guilt tripping
Emotional blackmail
Also saying she’s not going to look for him is weird too.
And if the kid himself is reading this, at 16 years of age, in most states it's unlikely you would be forced to return home (regardless of your parent's wishes) \*if\* you have a secure place to live and a way of supporting yourself financially (this includes Centrelink benefits). You may be able to find support services to help you set those things up, and explain your circumstances but it depends on where you're located but you could try something like the youth advocacy centre - [https://yac.net.au/legal-info/moving-out/](https://yac.net.au/legal-info/moving-out/) - or youth law for starters - [https://yla.org.au/](https://yla.org.au/nsw/topics/at-home-parents-and-family/when-can-i-leave-home-or-move-out/). This means that you may, if you look out for those things, be able to contact police and let them know you are okay and safe, and prevent further resources and uncomfortable news attention. Authorities just want to ensure you're safe and secure as a priority.
It looks like he's at the DCJ Housing office, which means the timing in the story was off, since it says he was spotted at 5am. The office isn't open at 5am, and in the photos it looks like daylight outside. It's still full dark at 5am in August.
I was more speaking to the idea that if the parents have absolutely no clue why he would leave then they either aren’t paying enough attention, or have a very distant relationship with him. Obviously this can - and probably does to some degree - come from his side too.

As for the login thing, that’s a pretty huge hole in the system. I wonder how he obtained medical certificates or whatever else to justify that. I would also think the school would contact the parents directly after “weeks” of his absences, but also appreciate how under resourced they are.

Anyway, I’m sure neither of these underlying issues will be addressed as usual and everyone will blame TikTok or some bullshit.
Definitely pressure from the kids parents who focus on retaining cultural values such as academic excellence. Creates a competitive environment. I remember that kid was the school captain :(
Yes.  Very sad 😔
No doubt there’s some private stuff going on with the family. He doesn’t sound like an erratic kid. Quite the opposite, he sounds sensible.  It appears he has a plan. I hope things work out for him.
Definitely, family issues if the father is saying that.

It's probably an oppressive and controlling environment. Kids dont run away from home if everything is rosy.
Wow that’s sad and telling if true, I did not hear this in any of the news reports I’d seen.
I don't think that's the case, I think the mum is using that as an excuse to divert attention from the rumours about his parents putting too much academic pressure on him
I always felt that there was some pressure put on by his family and after the last interview the parents gave I am
now sure
It’s definitely got to do with his girfriend and parents not approving either due to caste issues (very Stone Age Indian thing that parents cannot get rid of ) or due them thinking it will impact him acedemically 
Mother did not look sad at all and father he said ‘you will see a changed person when you get back ..wonder what he is like now …hmmmm

Something stinks
He’s mum said in a news interview they found out he had a girlfriend on Tuesday and then they broke up on Friday. I reckon they made him break up with her and that’s why he’s taken off.
That whole family needs therapy. The parent’s attitude towards his ex girlfriend calling her a loser is just cruel.
He is a kid, if the mum thinks she has no responsibility then why go on TV to say that? Weird.
This. If you’re reading this mate at 16 you can self place in most states. You can also access Centrelink and there are services set up to help with this.
They also won’t force you to return home if you report legitimate fears for your safety.
Kids are amazing at hiding things.
I think you overestimate the ability of parents to know what their kids are up to. Kids of that age aren't as simple and transparent as they were in primary school - it's quite possible that they had what seemed like a good relationship but that he was hiding things from them for whatever reason.
I went to macrob, the selective school for girls in the city. Two of my peers took their lives during my years there — one in year 10 because she couldn’t handle the pressure and didn’t want to ‘shame’ her family by dropping out (also, she was worried they’d take her overseas and get her married if she didn’t stay at macrob) and one just at the end of year 12 after she had received a scholarship to Monash because her parents were upset she didn’t get one to Melbourne Uni. 

Honestly, going to macrob fucked me up. For a long, long time (and even now), I felt that I had to keep studying to feel fulfilled in life. Did bachelors, honours, two masters and now doing a phd. The stress has given me two autoimmune diseases along the way. I am slowly working myself to get out of this vicious cycle.
this whole case makes me think of tej chitnis who went missing in basically the same exact circumstances in 2016 and has never been found. Whatever reason he had for running away to another state and selling his phone, I just hope he comes back and things get better for him.
Idk. She looked devastated in earlier interviews and in the latest ones she just looks angry- which I totally get, id be livid if my child did this to me unprovoked. I think it’s just easy to jump to conclusions because they’re Indian and Indian parents are known to be very strict.
Or he broke up with her because it was part of his plan to leave.
>were upset she didn’t get one to Melbourne Uni.

MHS student here (boys equivalent to Macrob, also in the city). I see the academic pressure but that's just fucking vile.
While I absolutely hated macrob (dropped out halfway through year 12), watching my peers it’s kind of hard to say what percentage of fucking up was the school and what was going to happen anyway due to their families’ expectations.
Undiagnosed neurodivergent sent to a top selective entry program in my state. The psychic damage was truly immense. In my thirties and still recovering! Hope this young person hasn’t fled home for similar reasons :(
I’m so sorry, please know your worth is not determined by (some seemingly socially or culturally significant) piece of paper. You contribute worth to the world by just being here. I promise you.
I hope you're well now, that sounds like the worst way to have a childhood. It's scary that this is so normalised
Omg please take care of your health and live a fulfilling life doing what you truly love , find hobbies , meet new people.
Same. Tej chitnis was also in a selective school (Melbourne high) like this boy and his parents wanted him to do med once he got to uni. tej was my senior when I was in Macrob (the girls’ selective).When he went missing, we were all very disturbed and the school got in a wellbeing coordinator to talk about academic pressure etc.
Ironically, her dad has now started a Facebook page in her memory condemning selective schools. He definitely regrets his actions, but it is too little too late to bring his daughter back. 💔
The parental pressure is definitely a big part of it, but putting hundreds of girls from similar backgrounds/ academic pressure together just adds fuel to the fire. It’s like there is no semblance of normalcy, neither at home nor at school (the two places students tend to spend most time during those years).

My parents were pretty chill once I got into macrob, but the academic peer pressure is what did it for me. I also knew of a friendship group that broke up because some girls didn’t want ‘bad company’ of girls who were getting comparatively lower marks.
Every time I hear stories of selective schools I’m incredibly glad I suffered brain damage in a car crash at 14, I went from massively clearing the entry requirements for QASMT and top 2% of the state to average-just above average with short term memory issues.

I fully believe I’m happier now than I would have been if I went to QASMT just after it opened.

I also became capable of creative pursuits that I couldn’t do due to my ASD prior
It’s crazy how long tej got away with lying about being in uni. It was just sad it all ended up happening on his dad’s birthday. I do believe he took his own life. rip tej
I guess you only appreciate something (or someone in this case) when they're gone.

Selective schools aren't the problem, it's the parents.
