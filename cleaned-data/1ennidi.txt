Ginaâ€™s also gone and paid for some good old bot accounts judging from the 95% of positive comments on a [news.com](https://imgur.com/a/SwhggoF) article that was on Facebook reporting on/promoting that cruise she hosted for the Australian Olympians.
Saw this vomit inducing self promotion abomination during the Olympics last night featuring it and one of its paid minions referring to it lovingly as Mrs Hancock:

She complained about her painted portrait  in the nga  and then puts out and advert showing her wearing a mining helmet on which looked even worse ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ . Biggest be thankful for me and my tax dodging ways ad campaign yet
What's with her accent on the new ads? Does she think she sounds classy? Because I think she sound like she has early onset dementia.
Isn't Hancock Prospecting primarily an iron ore extractor rather than fossil fuels? I know they do have coal operations, but I'm pretty sure 80% of their business is iron ore.
The Hutt family strikes again.
I don't think we'll be able to wean ourselves off fossil fuels. The pursuit of perpetual rapid economic growth requires cheap energy. And fossil fuels are the cheapest.

 Until we've used most of them that is, and what remains would cost more in energy to extract than what you would get back from burning them.
Fantastic. Great job. Well done ~~Angus~~ Gina.
"**Our civilisation is based on rocks**" is going to become a meme, isnt it? ðŸ¤£
The co ordinated swimmers in the billabong has to be fake. That is so surreal ðŸ˜‚
No lie detected.

I wish I could say it were absolutely bizarre this were downvoted except, oh right, we're living Don't Look Up except on several fronts.
