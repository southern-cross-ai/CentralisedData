Not the worst snake I've come across at work. Worst walked on 2 feet
Solar powered rodent control.
King ?
And here I am thinking I'm safe to go hiking in winter

Is it early this year? I wouldn't expect snakes for another month or so.
What a beauty
Cute
Beautiful animal.
Dangernoodle loves sun and scaring hoomans in winter
Never heard that one before, brilliant, I'm stealing that!
Yeah that was my first thought. Stunning snake.
Lol
I got this from r/whatsthissnake:

>Tentatively an Australian Copperhead, *Austrelaps sp.* Due to a very close match in head scalation. Venomous.

They ruled out both Eastern Brown *P. textilis* and Mulga/King Brown Snake *P. australis* due to inconsistent head scalation (namely below and behind the eyes).  *P. textilis* was further ruled out due to seemingly large and non-overlapping dorsal scales.

I honestly thought Eastern Brown, though, I never once thought Copperhead. \^\^;

Theyâ€™re still getting around, just nowhere near as active. Theyâ€™ll take advantage of warmer days and you can find them sunning even in winter.

Found a marsh snake a couple weeks ago in my garage.
Snakes will come out during winter if it's warm enough, generally just to drink though. They don't hibernate like bears.
What a beauty !
They had a snake committee meeting and decided that just after tea time is the best time. But of course Sandra objected.

I've learnt something. I thought they hibernated all winter.
Yeah same. Here I was feeling nice and safe. Anyone know what the deal is with hibernation and whether this is normal?
