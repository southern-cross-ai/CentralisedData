so this happened, a first for me - my parcel ended up in \*drumroll\* ... Austria. Does anyone have experience with what happens now? Is it likely to be redirected to Australia now?

  
UPDATE: I messaged the seller and they replied that it was their mistake and they will send it again - fingers crossed that one will make it first go!

You'll probably get it in a few extra weeks with a stamp on it saying "missent to Austia"


....maybe a few stamps.

Yes it’ll be redirected. I had this happen last year.  I contacted USPS but they never found it and it still made its way to me. 😊
so im thinking normally what happens is the majority of parcels are run through automatic machines that look for barcodes.

Once your barcode got scanned the machines usually take a picture and the system will try to read the address. At this stage the information has been read incorrectly and that wrong address will be associated with that barcode through any system that uses the same system. 

What should hopefully happen now is it will reach the facility before its final delivery and a human will actually realise that its for the wrong country and get it returned to their overseas mail department.

There's a good chance you will get your parcel (very late :[ ) with a new barcode covering the old one. 

I'm a tech for australia post but this is a very simplified version of how it works and im just assuming most of europe is run similiar to here for mail and parcels.
Mine was lost in Austria forever, I had to get the company to send another one out. I always wondered what happened to my Harry Potter book box set 20 years ago
I had one go from the USA to Germany and stayed there for a month. No updates and no response from the courier. It wasn’t anything critical and I assumed it was never gonna arrive, imagine my surprise when my own item arrives like a surprise gift from me to me.
A lot of places still use manual sorting. And it's pretty easy to misread Australia as Austria...

Maybe we should just start calling Austria by its actual name in German , ie Österreich. This will end the confusion once and for all.
Before automatic scanners there was a longtime a rumour that the reason international parcels took so long to get to Australia was because they all went via Austria…
I am from Austria and this happened to me several times as well. Best greetings from Austria 🇦🇹to Australia 🇦🇺
This happened in reverse years ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/2kka7r/austrian_people_problems_xpost_from_raustria_by/
This happened to me a few weeks ago. Parcel ended up back to the sender and they reshipped it the next day and it arrived a couple weeks ago
All these people from Austria commenting makes me wonder if they also mis-typed the country name lol
In 2017 or thereabouts, I sent a package to myself when was on holiday in Singapore via EMS.  It ended up in Brazil and after a 3 month delay it finally got sent to me.  I did get a refund on postage which is something I guess.
Not Austria, but I’ve had a parcel get accidentally sent to a town in Texas that had an extremely similar name to mine.
Why did this just get recommended to me? Im austrian
I live in Austria, and mail was sent to me from the US, and although they actually wrote the address as “Australia”, it still found its way to me. Took some time though.
ha it happens in the other direction also!

i'm from austria and had it happen to me if ir remember correct 4 times over \~9 years - and everytime it got reroutet to me to Austria (with a "little") delay in Australia

  
i hope it works also as well in the other direction and you will get it soon
Hi Fellow, I thought this only happened to us (Austrians) that sometimes our parcells end up in Australia. You will get it, quite late though but you’ll get it eventually. Good luck!
Well that sucks

greetings from austria
Austrian here, I once got a very late package with a stamp saying missent to Australia, the fact that there is a stamp probably means it happens quite often. I bet you'll get it eventually
You won’t even believe how often I had to tell randoms “No kangaroo, just Schnitzel!! Austria not Australia”
I had it the other way round, from America to Australia. Was rerouted to Austria, a few days later it showed up in Australia again. It took about 2 month until my package arrived here in Austria
austrian here! i had 2 of my letters/parcels delivered to australia on accident over the years. mine always arrived eventually, it’ll just take about 2-4 weeks longer
I live in Austria and the opposite happened to me, my parcel was sent to Australia! It got redirected and arrived to me with a bit of delay.
Austria and Australia both have 4 digit postcodes, meaning there is lots of overlap. AU and AT are both easily confused as well… At FedEx in Vienna they spend around 1 hour every morning sending ‘Missorts’ from Australia, back to Australia from Austria. This happens to around 10 Australian people every day I would say.
My company had a large package to be shipped to Perth, WA. At 2 weeks late it was returned to sender saying there was an addressing problem as there was no town called Perth in Washington State (USA).
It happened to me one time, but I'm living in Austria, and I'm Australian. A friend in Finland sent me a letter and it went to Australia. We had a good laugh.
Can they not tell by the street address something is up? Like Hartnäckerstraße?
Recently had a work parcel  where tracking for what should be a 2-3 day fragile road shipment say it would be 6 weeks. Checked the tracking which showed t was well on the way to South Australia. However there was a glitch on their map feature which does the time estimates- it was interpreting every SA address as being  Saudu Arabia.
This has happened to me but other way around, i always make sure to write EUROPE in big letters when adding the address lol
Pro tip for the future: "Austria - Europe" works fine for me to avoid having parcels sent to your country. Maybe you can add something similar to your address in the future? 
I once had one go from Germany to Belgium instead to Austria. I could understand if it went to Australia, but Belgium?
I once sent a letter to myself in St Lucia in Brisbane, but it came via the West Indies, which took a while. Lots of post marks.
Normally it should be redirected ... eventually. Might take a few weeks though. I had the same problem in the other direction. My parcel made a detour to Australia, before it reached Austria with a 5 weeks delay.
Your Mail order bride taking the scenic route.
Happened to me exactly the other way around. Parcel got delivered to me anyways.
Finally something wholesome on Reddit
NO POLITICS HERE

NO POLITICS HERE 

😂

BUT Austria and Australia meant to be together 😚😚😚
Austria is beautiful, you should check it out
My package ended up in Australia and i live in Austria lol
As an Austrian whose parcel got delivered to Australia once, I feel your pain..
I had to contact the seller for further instructions.
I live in Austria, and had a parcel end up in Australia. It took a bit longer than expected, but in the end it did get forwarded on to Austria.
A few weeks ago a customer of a customer of mine wanted to send me a parcel from Sydney to Vienna. I think somewhere a fuse was blown because the package didn't move from the first logistics Center for three weeks...
There is a special counter at the Viennese airport just for people who accidentally landed in Austria instead of Australia. I am not even kidding
My last parcel to Austria (yes intentional) just disappeared during attempted delivery....
It already happened to me but the opposite: ended up in Australia after being in an unknown location for 60 days. I later realized it was in a ship. They just sent me another package and left the one there in Australia
Lets do one thing- lets split the flight costs for my wife and me half/half and we hand-deliver your parcel ;)
I’m an Australian living in Austria. I bought a pair of shoes online in Austria and they accidentally sent them to Australia. That was a good laugh. They gave me a refund. Austrian tourism shops have a t-shirts they sell saying “No Kangaroos in Austria”
Yes and the other way round. I am in Vienna, and several packages got rerouted to Oz. Also - even Google when it first started, gave out results for Australia instead for Austria - that was in 2001.
r/austrialia
Haha, feel my pain from living in Austria. 🤣 How often I had to explain to people that I am in fact not from Australia. 😆
I live in Austria, a relative from the us once sent me a package which was accidentally sent to Australia. The address was written correctly and everything, I guess someone at the post just misread the country? It’s weird cuz the zip code is different than in Australia as well. it took about 4 weeks longer than normal to arrive.
(Sh)it happens all the time!  I paid for Express Post to an eBay seller in Tassie. Seller got the little town’s AusPost employee to address the satchel. and inexplicably she addressed it with suburb of Toorak, Vic. I lived in Tallarook, Vic. at that  time so it was delayed by over a week or so (arrived Toorak then got returned to Tassie!) wasting my payment for Express.
Living in Austria, had this happen though the parcel was sent to Australia. It did eventually arrive with a kangaroo sticker on it.
Wouldnt be surprised if it‘s gonna get forwarded by the austrian postal service itself if it‘s labeled correctly. Actually the australian postal service has an own office to redirect austrian post which did land my mistake in australia
This also happens regularly the other way round. Usually it ends up coming to Austria but it takes a loooong time sometimes.
Austrian here: I've had three parcels missent to Australia by the US post. Really annoying. One of us should probably rename the country.
Ukrainian? Post service to australia still works there?
Well it will go back to the person who sends it, or if the oeople in the post office are smart they will see the mistake and send it to Australia.

We get a lot of Mail from the usa with a stop in Australia 😀
Had this happen once with vehicle documents. I sold an imported skoda octavia, and skoda sent the papers to australia instead of austria. The packave was redirected and sent across the globe, finally arrived weeks later with a dozen stamps on it. Idk why, but they sent it to hawaii, norway, australia again and germany before it finally arrived.
In Innsbruck they sell t-shirts with a roo on it and "No Kangaroos in Austria"
My family accidentally fled to Austria. When they arrived they were greeted with mountains and tons of snow
I've only known this over as a joke... never thought it would actually happen. Greetings from Austria (the one with the Alps)
Business owner from Austria here 😄 I purchase a lot of raw materials from the US. It happened about 3 times now 😄it‘s not that uncommon that people mix up the two
They sent my bachelors degree to australia instead of austria...
I live in Austria and have had an order of mine sent via Australia! 😄
Can I have the one that's in Austria? :3
I live in Austria and had the opposite happen lol...some years ago I ordered something and it ended up in Australia. After contacting them they just refunded me and the package was marked as "lost", for some reason they didn't want to go through the hassle of sending it back from Australia so they sent me a new one altogether. I wonder who ends up keeping these "lost" packages.
I wonder if we have one for "missent to Australia"
I love that this is such a common occurrence, it gets its own stamp.
thank you
Had a similar thing happen to a package we were sending to Germany. Team member booking the pickup must have scrolled after selecting the country and it wound up in Ghana. After it made it to Ghana they couldn’t reconcile the address (understandable) and we updated the online system. 

That package bounced around Africa and Europe for another 6 weeks until it found its rightful home.
Oh, that was you. Thx for the books 😇
fascinating, thank you
Do you expect people to handle umlauts, really?
Make it Ostrich to replace Turkey :)
We could just take back our medievil name: osterrichi- no Umlauts

Greeting from an a bit laughing Austrian :)
Please no, I don't want all the english speakers trying and  failing to pronounce Österreich correctly!
I'd be fine with officially renaming us to Austria. Embracing the chaos 😈
I was suggested this post on the basis of "similar to r/Austria" ;)


In a related note, I was suggested r/Germany based on "similar to r/NichtDieTagesPresse". 
Same lol
Similar to r/austria because they put austria in the title
No kangaroos, only Kuhlimuhs
ja, ich bin gespannt ob es nun hier in Australien landen wird obwohl die Absenderin es falsch adressiert hat oder zurückgehen wird.
And the other way round? Australia - Australia?
Put in Österreich (Austria)


When I addressed mail to Spain before I just put


C. Turull 22 2r 2a 


08192 Sabadell 


España (Spain)


Made the address up but you get my point.
The Germans always try getting everywhere by going through Belgium
World dominion!
Again? Been there, it is beautiful.
**Transforms into parcel**
I would say worth waiting a few more weeks for a free kangaroo sticker!
You do. Cheers from Austria.
Yes, basically every country has them.

I am from Austria, but have been living in Australia and Indonesia for a few years as well.

So far I've gotten:
"Missent to Australia" once while still in Austria
"Missent to Austria" 3 times while living in Australia
"Missent to India" once and "Missent to US" twice while in Indonesia.

And the funniest was, I got one "missent to Australia" and responded with "good, that's where it is supposed to be."
The address on the package was my australian address.
It got there eventually with stickers for Germany, Japan and Canada as well. Origin was New Zealand...
Yes, you do (Source: received it in Austria)
If I am not mistaken, the main airport in Austria has a counter for people that accidentally ttavelled to Austria instead of Australia.
Sure 🫡
Yes. Same package. 2 times. Greetings from Austria :⁠-⁠)
You do
Source: first hand experience 
Best regards, an Austrian haha
To be fair, Austria isn't a billion miles away from Ukraine.  And I suspect their international post may be some what hindered.

They might just yeet a bunch to places in europe and have them on-send it
TIL : umlaute in english are called umlauts
You could learn ;)
I mean, they don't have to say it, just write 😂
Türkiye did it, didn't they?
Chad agrees
End result would be pronunciation as Osterreich, just like when they say "My Foorer" in WW2 movies. 
Underrated comment 😂
One hell of a movie plot...

Back and forth...and...

Wo war's am schönsten bis jetzt? Also Destinationtechnisch.
When your orders get to see more of the world than me. But hey, it’s nice here in Austria 😄
LOL seriously? The counter should be labelled "mistravelled to Austria"

Edit: wait no way. Your boarding pass gets checked at the gates
That’s [an urban legend](https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2023/10/26/austria-australia-airport-counter/) thanks to a rather clever marketing campaign run by a private company selling interphones.
But do they have a stamp? To be applied on foreheads?
There was a story a few years ago about a UK couple who accidentally booked a flight to Sydney, Nova Scotia, Canada instead of Oz.
I ordered one of those stamps of the Snake Island dude flipping off the Moskva from Ukraine. That one arrived fine.

Kinda obvious, I know, I just like telling people I have a stamp from Ukraine of a dude giving a Russian war ship the finger. Makes me laugh every time.
Well, could... I had to. Gonna have my German exam relatively soon:)
They get so weird when there is an Umlaut involved. If you listen closely, 99% of the time it's not "foorer" but "fjoorer". Where does the "j" sound come from?

Also I once saw some american food youtuber make a video about döner, and he kept saying "duner"... I get that they don't understand that ö is an actual letter and not just a fancy o... But why "duner"?? At least pronounce it similar to "donor" that at least would make sense. Shit's driving me mad.
If the mistake happened when the ticket was bought...
Good luck with that! Fingers crossed 
"Fjoorer" is basically the way U is pronounced in "use" or "dune". So these things exist. Though looking through some some dictionary words, its not like it is the *norm*.

As for "duner": Maybe the thing feeling closest to "Döner" for them? Like when people pronounce "ü" as "i" from hearing. Or when I pronounce Russian ы as as ü.
