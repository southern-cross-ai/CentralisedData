Was looking at some coins i found in a jar. I know they are not worth anything but they are cool nonetheless.

1966 2c
1967 20c
1968 10c 
1970 50c

I’m confused aren’t the 10c and 20c coins still the same design?
Looks like my pocket money - after lunch

I learnt about wage indexation, CPI, and cost of living increases very young - my pocket money was pegged to the cost of an Airfix model kit
Don't say they aren't worth anything - they're worth eighty six cents.
There’s an app called Maktun that can tell you roughly what the price is and details of the coin if you can’t identify it etc. it’s pretty fun to use. 

It also databases what you got. Like I know I got a 1911 2 heller bronze coin from Hungary somehow.
That 50 brought back memories
It's almost a full set except for the 1 and 5 cent coins.
If they are still legal tender then they are worth the face value
Ordinary coins, nothing special
They are not old and still legal tender. LSD is old money.
I scrolled past, though maybe it was a round 50¢, scrolled back and was disappointed 
OP is commenting about their age, that is, the dates on the coins 1960s etc
Those were smart parents who indexed your pocket money like that!
Not necessarily. For example, the round 50c are perfectly legal tender, but they are worth maybe ten times their face value (depending on condition.) You can pay a $1 bill with two of them, but maybe get a few dollars from a dealer for them.
1966 was the first year of decimal currency. So they’re interesting from that point of view
That makes sense !!! Thanks
Teachers.

The rate was just *slightly* more than one model kit a week - but if I splurged EVERY week - there was nothing for paints and glue - or the movies, or lollies. So much being learnt, without me feeling that I was being taught something
Sure, but half of them aren't even from 1966!
