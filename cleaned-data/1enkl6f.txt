Listened to a bit of what he had to say on the way into work.

Keating sounded like a out of touch old man.
His comments about Taiwan were insulting and the comparison to Tasmania was nonsense.

Complete failure to acknowledge the importance of Taiwan's semi conductor industry to the rest of the world.
Complete failure to acknowledge the shit the PRC is doing.

Suggestions of isolationism, because of course that's a great idea.

Paul, mate, we're in a new cold war. Whether it ends hot or cold, what do you want the world to be based on?
Western values, or Chinese-russian authoritarian ones?
Honestly, at this point with China being the bogeyman in the room, and very much throwing their weight around in SEA, we’re kind of at a cross-roads as to who we align ourselves with, and given the current political climate, and foreign relations stance we have with the USA, it was always going to be the US. That doesn’t bother me honestly, we have a lot more common bonds with the US than we do with China. 

Given the choice I’d not opt to be tied to either, but we are too much of a strategic centre not to be put in the middle, and so given a choice I’d always opt for the US. Not that America has a great human rights record, but China literally has human concentration camps for minority ethnic muslims, and a very draconian social policy of control over their own populace. 

Keating is saying we’ve sold out. Okay, what is the realistic alternative for Australia, in a growing bipolar world where you’ve got the US on one side, and China on the other? 

Russia invaded, raped and murdered their way through Eastern Ukraine, and the US threw sanctions at them but China still traded with Russia. 

There’s a laundry list of things China does and is doing to subserve the ~~metrics~~ status quo of how democracy in action should operate, that lends me to think we’re much better off with the US. And given that we’re not really in a political or power position to set our own terms in SEA, I think it’s the only option that aligns with Australians cultural and moral trajectory. 

I don’t have anything against Chinese people, it’s their government that is very much operating a locked down social system and telling countries in SEA, who and how China will let them operate. 

Of course this is all just my opinion. I want good peaceful relations with everyone, but given any military co-opting to be done, IMO we definitely want to stick with Uncle Sam.
Keating is arguing a strawman. No one is seriously arguing that China poses a credible threat to Australian territory. It does, however, pose a major threat to our allies and other regional neighbours.

He makes it explicitly clear that he considers Taiwan nothing more than a province of China and views the potential US and allied defense of Taiwan as more offensive than a Chinese invasion.

>**Paul Keating:** Because that power has no strategic – no strategic designs upon Australia. What this is all about is the Chinese laying claim to Taiwan. And the Americans are going to say “no, no, we’re going to keep these Taiwanese people protected” even though they’ve got, they’re sitting on Chinese real estate.

>**Sarah Ferguson:** Although it’s, well let me, let me just stop there on the Chinese real estate. What about Taiwanese real estate and the wishes of the Taiwanese people?

>**Paul Keating**: Yeah, well the Chinese real estate is part of China.

>Let me make the analogy. It would be like the Chinese saying, say to us:

>“Look we think Tasmania has been forgotten and poorly treated for many years. We want to keep the sea route down the East Coast of Australia through Bass Straight across to Perth and the Indian Ocean open. So we’re going to put some frigates there, and we will economically support the Tasmanian people should they wish to secede from Australia…”
All this is only possible when the opposition neglects to oppose. It's the case with Stage 3 tax cuts, with AUKUS, with the covid largesse and will be the case with a GST increase - which is only possible with bipartisan support.

It breaks democracy when the left leaning party has the same positions as the right leaning party.
I used to admire Keating.  I was born in 1961, so I  saw him at his peak. 

Then he became an outright China shill.  I've long since lost all respect for him.
Keating has basically been a useful idiot for China for years now.
Same thing that Keating always harps on about. He has a view on China that the rest of the government and by all polling indicates most Australians also don't hold. 

Like we know the US has vast influence on Australian military doctrine, we didn't fight in Iraq and Afghanistan for no reason and the current situation is more personally spooky to Australians than those conflicts ever were.
Paul Keating is a clown whose policies as treasurer and PM destroyed unions and working conditions for future generations 
Bad-faith nonsense.

If you want to throw Taiwan (and our other liberal democratic partners in the region) to the wolves - say it with your chest rather than hiding behind things you know to be falsehoods. Taiwan is not equivalent to Tasmania.
> “This is a sellout.”

i don't know how keating can accuse albo of being a sellout with a straight face, the man sold off Qantas and the Commonwealth bank, The Accords made australias unions redundant and inadvertently killed them, combine these two with his horrendously unpopular dedication to multicultural immigration and he managed to alienate the 90s working class to such a massive extent it put John Howard into power for a decade. He's literally the biggest sellout the labor party ever had. He was even gonna sell off Telstra, he only backed off because he was rapidly becoming the most hated prime mister ever but it didn't work because no one even believed his promise to not sell it off anyway.

Really starting to feel bad for albo, hes stuck trying to fix like 40 years worth of fuckups.
I love the Keating era of government and the reforms he introduced as treasurer and then PM, including his insistence that we embrace our Asian future, but I think he's being very disingenuous here...

He would know full well that AUKUS and our other arrangements with the US are a continuation, not an escalation, of a very tight alliance.  As a member of the Whitlam government he would know how influential the US has always been in Australian politics, defence and foreign affairs... We sent troops to Vietnam when even the UK declined!  To suggest this is a departure for a Labor government is ridiculous and his often personal attacks on people like Penny Wong and Richard Marles is so disappointing. 

Whether continuing this alliance is the right move is obviously up for debate, and he has to acknowledge that he's probably wrong on this front.  And maybe his employment on boards and advisory roles in China, tied to the Chinese government, might not just be informing his opinion but also influencing it.

The obvious challenge our successive governments are trying to navigate is realpolitik... Australia "has to pick a side".  We're too consequential in the region to pretend we can be non-aligned.  There's no version of this where Australia maintains some form of splendid autonomy and maintain good economic and diplomatic ties with both the US and China.  That may change in time, and has been the case historically, but for now that's not feasible.
What Keating and those who make this same argument tend to miss is that there is 1 state on the planet that presents a strategic threat to Australia, and that's the United States.

Being as close as possible to the United States IS what's best for Australian strategic security because they are the only state that has the military capacity to threaten us.

The argument that Australia is painting a target on its back with AUKUS yet simultaneously there's no one capable of threatening us is self contradictory.
His whole argument is based on the fact that he views Taiwan as a Chinese vassal state. If that is not the case (as the majority of the world can plainly see) he’s thesis is completely useless. Dude gets too much credit as a former statesman, he’s as responsible for the housing crisis as anyone else. Thought it was a great idea to use housing as a vehicle to wealth. No foresight, no morals.
>**Paul Keating:** Because that power has no strategic – no strategic designs upon Australia.

>**Hitler, in a speech at the Sportpalast in Berlin, claimed that the Sudetenland was "the last territorial demand I have to make in Europe"** and gave Czechoslovakia a deadline of 28 September 1938 at 2:00 p.m. to cede the Sudetenland to Germany or face war.  
  
"Crimea is not a disputed territory. **Russia has long recognised the present day borders of Ukraine.**"  - Putin, interview with ARD TV, 2008.

Trusting totalitarian dictatorships, what could go wrong. 

>Let me make the analogy. It would be like the Chinese saying, say to us:

>“Look we think Tasmania has been forgotten and poorly treated for many years. We want to keep the sea route down the East Coast of Australia through Bass Straight across to Perth and the Indian Ocean open. So we’re going to put some frigates there, and we will economically support the Tasmanian people should they wish to secede from Australia…”

If Australia put Aborigines into internment camps until they could become more "Australian", if Australia's government was never freely or fairly elected and tanks smushed over protestors forty years ago in Canberra near the Parliament House lawn, if Australia had a huge military buildup rivalling the US as the second biggest budget...

then... no one should have anything to fear? That's a complete analogy, which of course he didn't make. Also that Australian boats are bullying New Zealand's smaller vessels and trying to kick them off their home waters.

>  
An invasion comes in an armada. With satellites today you see the armada formed, you would see it leave its harbor. You see it for 10 or 15 days come to Australia, and you would sink every one of them on the way.

>You don’t need the United States to defend Australia.

>Australia is quite capable of defending itself.

We have the firepower to... sink the whole Chinese fleet? Every one of them? 252,000 active personnel (2024) **680 ships** (2024) 198 aircraft (2024)? This is just straight up delusional.

Paul seems like he lives in the 90's world where China is a benign (relatively) developing economy and has paid 0 attention to developments since then.
Shill. Enough said.
He probs has lots of money invested in China..
Ukraine need US permission to use specific weapons supplied to them, do you think the US will let us use weapons on the subs if we need to without asking them?
Who really cares what this mouth piece for China says. It's so obvious that Paul Keating does anything possible to suck up to China.
Why do we keep giving this old man air time? He's been dining out on the 'Labor Icon' status for decades and he has never accepted that his time is past.
Please stop giving this shit stain column inches.
He is surely on the CCP payroll. Given his comments about Taiwan as well. What an idiot. 
I kind of agree with China and Taiwan. Why should Australia protect it. Australia and it allies better of encouraging there chip companies to relocate. Even take there citizens. If there is a fight over Taiwan wont be much left of the island once it is over. And if China is this big threat why is Australia selling them iron ore to build their military which they will use on Australia and it allies.
Keating is correct, the US has dragged us into multiple wars that have destroyed nations and brought shame to Australia, yet everyone wants to pretend China making artificial islands in the South China Sea is the greatest crime any nation has committed since 1945. It's ridiculous.
This sub oscillates around aukus being the biggest waste of money that could of built enough homes for the very real fears people are experiencing to aukus is right partner to ship it with and you dont turn your back on fam.
AUKUS is a terrible deal and Keating is right.
The man has one goal, follow the money. He does some good things as treasurer/prime minister for the people, like compulsory super, plus he brings more countries to the table with APEC to get us trading and talking more. 

He also sells off a bunch of our government-run infrastructure like Qantas and Combank to make bank. A fuster cluck we're still paying for with so much of our country privatised and nothing to stop big companies exploiting us left right and centre.

After politics, he continued to follow the money, was an adviser for a few banks, including the CCP Development Bank...

He argues we're turning our back on Asia to appease our American overlords. Ignoring the fact we actively work with multiple Asian countries all the time, despite warnings from China.

His comparison of Tasmania to Taiwan is awful. The only comparable thing between Taiwan and Tasmania is that they are both islands.

He simply does not want us to disrupt the cash flow from China. Damned be the other political factors. Treasurer knows best because money money money.
John Menadue quoting Keating. Jesus, there's a combination.
He's right.
Keating is usually on the money, but his attitude toward Taiwan is outdated.
China/Taiwan is not our backyard. Beijing is closer to Berlin than it is to Sydney
I can't believe that so many people are happy to have a shooting war with China over Taiwan. This isn't about protecting the people of Taiwan, it's about America staying as the top dog in the world, and maybe about protecting their access to chips.

It could go nuclear, and with U.S. bases and ships all over Australia we would be a prime target to be nuked.

Personally I agree with Paul Keating on this one.

This modern Western obsession with propping up Taiwan on the basis of maintaining 'human rights' and 'democracy' is nothing but the latest iteration of the centuries-old, racist concept of the 'White Mans' Burden' which insultingly assumes that non-whites are incapable of self-governance and must be instructed as to how to live their lives and construct their societies.

Ask yourself how the communists in China, which originated from uneducated, dirt-scrabbling rural peasants, aided only by the marginally better off Soviets, were able to oust the Nationalists (who were led by the wealthy and overseas-educated Chiang Kai Shek, controlled all major cities, and supported financially and politically by the most powerful nation in the history of the world) and send them packing to Taiwan? It's because the Chinese people chose, and they chose against the continuation of the status quo that had led to China being a shithole for the vast majority of the Chinese people throughout most of history.

Most Australians these days quote Taiwan's current liberal democratic values and their political alignment with the West as key reasons that Australia should intervene militarily in their defence (as a lackey of the US of course) but also conveniently omit the fact that the US has been threatening China with military intervention over Taiwan since 1950, a full 30-something years before Taiwan made the transition from military dictatorship to western-style democracy. So let's be clear in our discourse and acknowledge that this is not about Western ideological supremacy but rather cold-hearted cost-benefit analysis as to the political and economic value of keeping China out of Taiwan and preventing Chinese reunification.

On a more fundamental level, almost all individuals if queried would respond that people have the right to self-determination. Well it is an immutable, objective fact that the Chinese people's right to self determination was cut short by the red-scare, interventionist policies of the United States. In the interim, the Taiwanese people have had time to develop their own culture and way of life, which would undoubtedly experience significant upheavals if China were to take control of the island again. In the end, as with most international political disputes, I suspect that might will make right. While we wait to observe the outcome, I, and I'm sure many others, would appreciate it if Westerners could do away with the smarmy, self-righteous commentary that always assumes that white people have a monopoly on morality and human rights.
Why does no one want to listen to this old mate? TF is wrong with our country?
Arguing that Taiwanese are sitting on “Chinese real estate” is like saying white Australians are sitting on white real estate and should either execute or deport aboriginals in the 1800s. What a genocidal cunt.
Who cares what this out of touch wanker has to say? Nobody should be giving him a platform. 

The man who gave us the J curve and 17% interest rates.
I've interviewed a few older men for a podcast. They really struggle to stay on topic and communicate concisely. They have so much information in their brains from having a long life, but seemingly it just gets harder and harder to draw clarity from all that information.

Keating seems to be a bit of a China hack - or at least, the media are only interested in putting out his views on China as they generate clicks.
How dare you question the integrity of Saint Keating? HE DID NOTHING WRONG, EVER!
He's in the pockets $ of CCP, especially his comments about Taiwan. An old, bitter, irrelevant man.
No he's absolutely right, Taiwan is not our problem. It's a regional problem that dates back 70 years. America can play world Police if they like, but once they don't need Taiwan for chip fab, they will pull out of the south China Sea, and since we now tied ourselves into this punitive actions against China when America pisses off Australia will be the target.

All this Taiwan posturing is one man's ego when he passes or gets to old to lead this Taiwan nonsense will likely die.

  I don't see him saying we adopt isolationist policies only that we seek to be dependent on our own defence rather than allow America to use our country as a staging ground for aggressive posturing.
Why are we in a new cold war? Because Beijing has continued to claim Taiwan as their territory....something they have always done.

Also Taiwan's semi conductor industry has zero relevance to the issue of its sovereignty.

What "western values" would they be? The 4.5 killed in the War on Terror? The current West-backed genocide in Palestine? The insane economic inequality that makes it impossible for anyone not born into money to own a home?

The Chinese aren't perfect, but they've brought 800 million people out of poverty, and 96% of them own their own homes. 

The "shit the PRC is doing" has been mostly in response to the "Pivot to Asia" and its predecessor the East Asia Strategy (2009). 

And anyone who's actually been to China knows the country isn't the dystopian hellscape presented in the western media. Hell, you can go there yourself and see it with your own eyes now that there's visa-free entry. 

What exactly do you do that you think you couldn't do in the PRC? 

This argument is absolutely laughable.
>Whether it ends hot or cold, what do you want the world to be based on? Western values, or Chinese-Russian authoritarian ones?

Oh, please. What sort of hysteria is this? 

Edit: Apologies. I didn't get an opportunity to elaborate. I was busy reading about the West's tepid disapproval - even encouragement - of systemic violence and sexual abuse carried out by a nation professing to fight for Western values.
> Keating sounded like a out of touch old man. His comments about Taiwan were insulting and the comparison to Tasmania was nonsense.

Explain how? If we were "China" and Tasmania (Taiwan) wanted independence. You think we'd accept a foreign power ie. the US telling us how to conduct our own national affairs?

> Complete failure to acknowledge the importance of Taiwan's semi conductor industry to the rest of the world.

Not for long, why do you think they've been accelerating building fabs in Japan and the US?

> Complete failure to acknowledge the shit the PRC is doing.

Which is fine, because it's not relevant / not being done to us?

When China placed embargo's on us a few years ago (only recently lifted), do you think during the press conferences they were like "yes we will not be importing an Australian product because ASPI came up with propaganda about the treatment of Uyghurs being in camps..." ??? Get real 🤣

> Suggestions of isolationism, because of course that's a great idea.

Yeah because it's not as tho we're geographically isolated... oh wait... Does that mean we can't have relations? Of course not, it just means we need to be more selective about who we have relations with and the gravitas of each specific one.

> Paul, mate, we're in a new cold war. Whether it ends hot or cold, what do you want the world to be based on? Western values, or Chinese-russian authoritarian ones?

You're misrepresenting him (on purpose?). He didn't say we should do nothing about China.

He simply stated if this is about the defense of Australia, then the military capability used to back up any action or counter action should be Australian owned and controlled.

We know the US sub building capacity is waaaay underprovisioned, to the point they can't even meet their own demand let alone ours.

Which means the AUKUS deal will devolve and instead our own subs crewed by Aussie personnel, we'll get US sub "patrols", and it will be pitched as a good thing (ie. you don't have to train naval officers, blah blah blah), when in reality this is just about the US military having additional supply depots.

Assuming the conflict with China goes ahead (and there's no reason to think that it won't, since it's being engineered that way) not only do we get the privilege of being a target because from China's perspective we are essentially a US beachhead, but also should the US lose (a firm likelihood) then when they piss off back over the Pacific, we're stuck here with the consequences...

It's koo koo bananas.

A nation state should *never* outsource its own military to another foreign power, much less one that has demonstrably sucked ass in achieving outcomes in the +90% of conflicts that have happened since the second world war.
Insulting to whom? Other Australians?
Western values?!?  FMD
>Whether it ends hot or cold, what do you want the world to be based on? Western values, or Chinese-russian authoritarian ones?

I'm not sure we want the answer to that question.
I don’t think it’s a crossroads. Australia can play the middle ground for a long time.  With our financial future hinged on China, the time will come to also trust China as the guarantor of regional security in the way we do / previously did with the US, but that trust will probably take generations of diplomacy to actually achieve.  Lurching one way or the other at this stage is folly and Australian leaders have a responsibility to understand the value of diplomacy and, when necessary, brinkmanship. The Australian population have the responsibility of not electing anyone ideological enough to push too far in either direction.  We just need to always maintain a balance.
This interview bordered on elder abuse.  Did 730 have someone pull out so they just grabbed the dottering old crazy guy?  I vote left but Keatings lost the plot re: china.  Does he feel the same about ukraine belonging to Russia?
Keating has gone off the deep end recently. He was always in favour of closer relations with China, because it's the obvious practical approach to take considering the region of the world we find ourselves in. But his position has hardened *a lot* over the last decade or so and he honestly just sounds like he's repeating CCP propaganda talking points these days. Just uncritically taking the Chinese government line on things and admonishing uppity Australia for not knowing our place.

It's sad. Not least of all because I always used to admire Keating, but because more than anything right now, during these polarizing times, we need respected voices bringing some nuance to the conversation over Australia's future in the region.
Yes I've heard a lot of people lately, often from think tanks rather than anyone with national security experience, talk about an 'echidna approach'. Ie a complete isolationist self defense doctrine of just the physical borders.

However, the reality is that we're an island nation who relies on imports and trade routes. No one serious is actually proposing China would physically invade our borders --thats a strawman argument put up by Keating -- but they (or anyone else) could completely cripple us by blocking off our trade route pathways if desired.

A blockade or even just instability in the general Indo-pacific area (ie Taiwan) is bad news for Australia no matter what way you paint it.

Is Aukus the answer? Maybe, maybe not - I honestly have no idea. But I feel like Keating, someone who I generally respect, is just completely strawmanning here.
> He makes it explicitly clear that he considers Taiwan nothing more than a province of China and views the potential US and allied defense of Taiwan as more offensive than a Chinese invasion.


I don't understand this line of thinking- hasn't Australia been supporting the one china policy for decades now? What am I missing here?
Imagine if he made this same statement about Ukraine and Russia. He's been extremely aggressive on aukus, which makes me think he's been bought and paid for in some way by China.
How many Australian soldiers are we willing to send to die for Taiwan because thats what Keating's argument comes down to.

He's happy to turn a blind eye because its not worth it for us to get involved.
> He makes it explicitly clear that he considers Taiwan nothing more than a province of China 

What's Australia's official position on Taiwanese sovereignty?  Do you know?
Yes Taiwan is part of China. The fact that you don't like the Chinese government in Beijing doesn't change that fact. The analogy with Tasmania doesn't work as well because Australia hasn't had a civil war where the losing side retreated to Tasmania, but if they did and China acted like Tasmania is a sovereign nation then the analogy would fit like a glove.

Dutton and albo are arguing China poses a threat. Both governments allow American soldiers to rape Australian women and refuse to persecute them. Just a reminder America overthrew our government and has sold us out repeatedly.

Oh and American soldiers won't be charged after raping  Aussie women. Dutton and Albo agree on that .
The current opposition are the ones who brokered the deal in the first place.

One day, I would love to know what exactly happened, what deals were done under the table, when that all went down
It doesn't break democracy at all. Sometimes the two parties share a position and some of those instances it's because it's the correct position to hold.

The opposition doesn't need to reflexively oppose everything a government does.
> Like we know the US has vast influence on Australian military doctrine, we didn't fight in Iraq and Afghanistan for no reason

Yeah... we fought it so the US military industrial complex could launder $billions. Which is in part why they got so mad at Assange.
I dunno I quite like my Super Annuation tyvm
A lot of the comments in this thread seem to be coming from a bunch of arm-chair generals who've played too much CIV 6, not read enough history, and are vastly over-estimating Australia's significance and capabilities.

  
Keating being pro-china is irrelevant, reading between the lines my take on his argument is Australia as a small country of 30m people should try to stay neutral and avoid getting dragged into a conflict between an established super power and a rising super power, When it comes to the military and alliances the focus should be on defending the Australian mainland and not projecting force. Seems pretty reasonable to me.
"Let's throw Taiwan to Beijing." Is something Keating basically has said and did say in this interview, you're just adding the characterisation of China as "wolves".
How many Australian kids are you going to sacrifice for that goal, tough guy?
What I find interesting is his instance on how we could just sink any invasion fleet. While he's probably right, the reason we could is precisely because of the weapons technology we have, and in future we are going to acquire as part of this deal.  


Collins class? American torpedoes.
 
Destroyers? American harpoon missiles  


Helicopters? American 


Jets? American 


Tanks that we have to make them need a bigger and more vulnerable fleet? You guessed it, American.

You're saying that we're subservient to the americans out of fear?
Australia has been at war with more countries than the evil totalitarian PRC has. And you can't criticise China by bringing up our treatment of our indigenous population, the most heavily incarcerated ethnic group in the world by most measurements. It's so strange how hypocritical or just blind some Australians are when China is discussed.

>then... no one should have anything to fear? That's a complete analogy, which of course he didn't make. Also that Australian boats are bullying New Zealand's smaller vessels and trying to kick them off their home waters.

How about Timor Leste and their natural resources we tried to steal from them?

We have abused human rights at home and abroad many times, and the fact that we are a democracy doesn't excuse any of it. In fact it just makes us more responsible for our government's abuses, and it should make us more motivated to lead by example and make human rights a real priority.
More like China have a lot of money invested in him.
Half a trillion dollar investment for some scuba gear?
The US was providing military aid to a country at war with a nuclear power, while trying to avoid being dragged into said war. We would be using weapons we purchased ourselves, in a war where the US would likely already be involved anyway considering unlike Ukraine we are actually allies with the US. It's a completely different situation.
We will be allowed to use them provided we use them in service of US military objectives. These submarines are not about the defence of the Australian homeland. It's about extending the reach of the US in a region which is not ours.


Given that the US's Virginia class submarine program is *already* running below projection (producing only 1.2 submarines per year instead of 2.0), it's highly likely that if we're actually allowed to buy a second hand submarine, it will be sold with the proviso that it be used to run missions for the US until they somehow acquire more submarines to fulfil their own needs. 
He is fool way beyond his use by date. People like him and Biden give us license to make fun of old people.
1. Australia send iron to China

2. China builds Toys

3. US sees toys, convinces congress to build new toys

4. US sells second hand toys to Australia

5. Australia cuts Healthcare budgets whilst importing iron back into Australia in the form of wealthy Chinese people.

The global economy is freaky place
That's not a statement of morals, merely one of capacity
The US just stole half a trillion dollars from us, but China bad!
>The man has one goal, follow the money. 

If he wanted to do that he'd be working for the american arms companies the scott morrison is. He doesn't want Australia to be controlled by the US and doesn't want Australians dying in wars we don't need to be in.

A comprehensive assessment.
And if Australia didn't follow the US lead and tried to continue trade with China in the event of a China-US war, do you really think the United States would allow us to continue shipping coal and iron ore and rare earth minerals to China? 

Or do you think they would militarily end that?
He was a neoliberal flunky who robbed Australia of the largesse of a 30 year mining boom - putting us in precisely the position we are in. We could have been Norway or Qatar wealthy - with the ability to defend ourselves - instead we're just a serf of far worse governed countries. Calling us the 51st state is generous, because we have no rights.

All you needed to control Keating was to get someone to make him "Treasurer of the Year" and he'd do whatever you wanted. Sell the commonwealth bank, telstra, CSL for peanuts or implement a regressive tax like the GST.

On this he's right though - but far too late.
>and supported financially and politically by the most powerful nation in the history of the world

This isn't entirely true, american lend lease to china essentially ended once the japanese were defeated because the americans thought Chiang Kai Shek was too corrupt to bother with. Nationalist china was on its own vs communist china backed by the soviets. It was actually a pretty big scandal for the americans when Nationalist China fell.
You've said a lot and nothing at the same time. 

The Chinese chose the CCP? Sure, they did. No one is disputing PRC mainland sovereignty.  Taiwan has moved in the polar opposite direction. They have become more liberal and democratic. They have decidedly NOT chosen the CCP. So your point is irrelevant. Defending Taiwan is defending that choice of self governance. 

Your last paragraph is honestly just completely irrelevant. If you think that wanting to avoid an absolute bloodbath, which the people of Taiwan would suffer, is white people expressing a monopoly on human rights, then honestly, I don't even know where to start.
So the CCP originates from the same school of central hua minzu / chinese nationalism as the KMT and were formed from the KMT following the May 4 protest movement on Tiananmen Square of dissatisfaction with the Beiyang governments performance in the Versailles Treaty negotiations (somewhat simplified)

Is the dirt scrabbling thing from Mao's red book or something?
Because reddit is filled with dead internet and CIA psy ops
Aligned to your point, there were a couple of times in that interview when Keating ended a point with a huff or a sigh as if to say "well all of this is self evident, and therefore needs no explanation, and neither is there a possible counter to what I have just said".

No Paul, that's not how it works.
Hitler seizing Europe was a regional problem. 


Japan seizing half of China and all of the Phillipines? Also a regional problem. 


Putin seizing parts of Ukraine? Another regional problem. 


Do you see any issues with this logic?
You mean like they've backed out of ukraine?
Fuck me it's like arguing that Hitler taking Czechoslovakia and Poland was only a regional issue.
Perhaps by allowing America to use us for it's aggressive posture we are securing our defence?

There is one country that has the capacity to threaten Australia's strategic security, and that is the United States.

Being as close as possible to our only threat IS what's best for our security.
Because Taiwan isn't the only part of the region they claim is actually their territory. Just ask any country with a coastline on the South China Sea.
The semi conductor industry is a highly important factor to its sovereignty. It was a strategic choice on their behalf, used to secure many countries backing Taiwan's independence.

Having such a large percentage of the world's production means many countries are dependent on Taiwan for much of their technology. 

This includes phones, cars, weapons systems etc.

Now imagine if China was in control of said production, able to compromise almost any device across the world via inbuilt backdoors and programs. 

Taiwan's independence is required for countries like the USA to maintain their technological lead.
And The Republic of China has always claimed mainland China as their territory, this is none of our business.
Because Beijing is seeking to upend the liberal democratic world order that has enabled historically unprecedented levels of peace and prosperity since 1945.
Sure.... Huawei was removed for a number of good reasons. Its not good to have dual use technologies from an aggressive foreign power inside you country if you can help it.
If China plays nice with everyone they would have continued to get those access. What they are doing in South China Sea isn't. Pre Xi, things were generally ok. They were totalitarian but they kept their politics internal.
They disappeared in the west but continued to sell into other countries and have now built up their supply chains in China to the point where they can make new phone models again (albeit a year or two behind the western companies for now).
Few here seem to want to address this. I guess it’s easier to regurgitate ASPI talking points and imagined threats under the guise of Western moral supremacy (challenged by any honest and critical analysis of history). 
Truth be told, with sufficient investment in domestic military industrial capacity, Australia would probably make a pretty decent neutral state (ala switzerland). But we all know what happened when Gough Whitlam floated the idea.
>I don’t think it’s a crossroads. Australia can play the middle ground for a long time. With our financial future hinged on China, the time will come to also trust China as the guarantor of regional security in the way we do / previously did with the US,

China has maybe the worst demographic situation on earth, It lacks energy and food independence and doesn't control the shipping lanes for its imports and exports.

The US is more powerful than it's ever been in its history and is in a great position with regards to economics, demographics and geography.
Keating presumably isn't privy to current national security briefings on China?  And he, like the rest of us, can't predict the future.  He is basically proposing that we completely ignore one plausible possibility (Chinese military aggression which threatens our interests) and just put it all on black while alienating our major source of military security, the US.

The only thing I kinda agree with is that it's risky for Australia to be too beholden to the US.  But that's because of Trump and the far right there, who might send them in a radically different direction that is inconsistent with our interests, or just abandon us completely.  In those scenarios we need credible defence from (a) our own resources and (b) other alliances/agreements.  That does not mean that we should ignore the risk of military aggression in the Indo-Pacific - to the contrary, that's exactly *why* we have to take care not to be too dependent on the US.  

Personally I think Australia needs a strong alliance with the UK/UK/EU/NZ/India/Japan and smaller Asian neighbours, but also needs to invest heavily in anti-shipping and drone warfare so that we have a credible asymmetric, defensive military capability.  I would *much* rather see the submarine money being spent on that.
Keating has always had the same view. He isn't pro China or repeating CCP propaganda. He is and also has been pro Asia.

Keating's vision is an Australia that is fully integrated into Asia because he believes that geography isn't going to change. There will be a day when the US pulls out of Asia and other players like India and Indonesia and China will be the ones making all the major calls. He's always argued that we should get our foot in the door as early as possible so we can have a say in the policies and development of the region rather than get caught off guard when the US pulls out.

He wants Australia to be like a regional mediator like Switzerland or Qatar where we use our historical and cultural ties to the West but geographical and population ties to Asia. That doesn't work when we're seen as an extension of the US.
>But his position has hardened a lot over the last decade or so and he honestly just sounds like he's repeating CCP propaganda talking points these days.


It sounds more like he is entrenching his ideas he's held [since the 90's](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/43475045_The_Middle_Power_Concept_in_Australian_Foreign_Policy) that [Australia should be an independent 'middle power' in Asia](https://johnmenadue.com/asia-america-or-independence-australians-have-decided-will-politicians-listen/).
The fact remains that it is not remotely in our national interest to get involved in any conflict over Taiwan.
>No one serious is actually proposing China would physically invade our borders

Fear mongers in the media and arms companies do like to heavily hint at it though to average punters. 

> could completely cripple us by blocking off our trade route pathways if desired.

If they wanted to cripple us they'd just stop all  trade with us immediatly there would be no need to blockage us.  The fact is our relationship is mutually benefical.
We can imagine the worst case scenario for a blockade.

What's the best case?

We can produce all of our own:

Food
Aluminium
Iron/steel
Helium/hydrogen


I think for cars we could probably use a lot less and keep the current fleet running for five-ten years.

Planes, specialist mining vehicles, other special vehicles, military vehicles ; probably not.

Assume internet cables would be cut.

We can produce electronics, but not modern computers; but overall, a trade blockade would not be as bad for us as it would be for a nation like mexico or Germany...

But if we assume China is the one blockading us and we assume the USA is on our side, China suddenly finds herself with not enough food to buy on global markets, and having to look elsewhere for all the other stuff they buy from us.

Anyone who blockades our trade also blockades our trade *with them*.  We feed 65 million people, mostly in south east Asia.
> A blockade or even just instability in the general Indo-pacific area (ie Taiwan) is bad news for Australia no matter what way you paint it.

Be for real, they don't even need to do that, they're our single biggest trading partner, literally all they have to do is just stop the imports and export and they'd cripple us near instantly, no amount of submarines is going to fix that.
Why do people talk about blockades like it's something done so casually? A blockade is a literal declaration of war. China is our largest trade partner. In fact almost everyone in our region has China as either their no.1 or no.2 trade partner. If they wanted to inflict economic pain they'd just stop trading with us. Sure it'll hurt them too but it'll be infinitely cheaper than sending literal warships and submarines to block all sea routes to and from an entire continent...

Most of the China rhetoric is honestly just an "us vs them" narrative to encourage us to stay part of the US hegemony/sphere of influence.
On paper yes, so does the US and pretty much every other country in the world, including Taiwan. In practice however a lot of countries including Australia and the US treat the two as two separate countries, and everyone knows it.
One China is a tatic acceptance of the status quo. Australia (and most of the world) treats Taiwan as an independent country for all intents and purposes; but officially we don't recognise them so as not to antagonize China.

Both China and Taiwan were mostly satisfied with this for decades; but China under Xi is another beast.
>Australia been supporting the one china policy for decades now? What am I missing here?

Only officially, so we can have trade and diplomatic relations with the Peoples Republic of China.

We unofficially recognise Taiwan as an independent country, and deal with them as such in all aspects except officially.  And we don't call them the "Republic of China" which is what their "official" name is.
Yes.  The Internet pretends we don't though because that's more entertaining.
To be fair a lot of people have been aggressive on Aukus. Malcom Turnbull also isn't a big fan. Even people in favour of Aukus in theory have a lot of doubts the US/UK will actually deliver. They're not even building enough for their own military needs but we're expecting them to build state of the art subs for us?
Yea, cause clearly our other PMs have never been bought and paid for to sign a US sub deal while fucking over an existing sub deal with another country, then fuck off to work for a US defence firm. [A deal where we might not even get the subs](https://asiapacificdefencereporter.com/aukus-no-refund-for-9-4-billion-gift-to-us-uk-submarine-companies/).

I swear the amount of rhetoric about China in the past few years is getting ridiculous, anyone remember the[ major Newpaper headlines that we could be at war with China in two years?](https://www.9news.com.au/national/australia-faces-threat-of-war-with-china-within-three-years-experts-warn/9c757e9c-d0e7-4b33-9a0f-70546858c736) Thank god we have these subs that are expected to come in to service by late 2030s, that finally deterred China from launching their full-scale attack next year?

But I guess calling out any of this hyperbolic bullshit is gona get me labelled a wumao, because china=bad is about as complex and nuanced as discussions get when it comes to China.
>which makes me think he's been bought and paid for in some way by China.

He was on the board of the CCP controlled China Development Banks.

I believe he's since retired, but suspect he's still on the payroll.
If there was a civil war and the government lost and fled to Tasmania, would you still consider that to be part of Australia?

Imagine if China spent decades arming and supporting this group. Would that make it easier to accept it's independence?

Keating is a realist and his whole shtick is that we shouldn't be getting involved in disputes that don't impact Australia. He's been completely open about his stance on China which is that we should form a coalition of regional neighbours, including China, and build consensus in the region to force China to heel in a diplomatic way instead of using guns and force. China is an Asian problem and so the solution needs to be based in Asia, not in US policy.
>which makes me think he's been bought and paid for in some way by China.

Or he just doesn't want Australia dragged into a regional war and wasting our money on american toys for that.  


The money we are spending on this subs is enough to give free university, free dental care, and fix our hospital staffing issues.
Australia and the United States both consider Taiwan to be part of China.

China invading Taiwan would not be a violation of international law like Russia's invasion of Ukraine was. 

That being said, it's still in American, and I believe Australian, interests to defend Taiwan, and so that is what we will do.
>He's happy to turn a blind eye because its not worth it for us to get involved.

And fair enough, the ADF should only be used on relief missions over seas, we shouldn't have been in vietnam, or afganistan, or Iraq.
The answer is lots, and it is worth it.

Taiwan produces 90% of the worlds advanced semiconductor chips.  TSMC produces the chips used in the F35 for example.  While TSMC has recently agreed to build a new plant in the US, that plant doesn't currently exist and is a long way away.

On top of that TSMC produces the bulk of the high power chips used for AI development.

Now add to that, the importance of the Taiwan straight to shipping.  The Taiwan straight carries an incredible amount of Australia's exports and imports.  \~1200 cargo ships pass through there a week.  If China annexes Taiwan then they will be able to claim the straight as their territorial waters, giving them the ability to decide who can pass through there and under what conditions.  For example they could close the straight to ships carrying goods to or from Australia.  The impact of which would be colossal.

So in short, Taiwan is critical to our economic security, our trade security and our military security.
Would Tasmania not be a sovereign nation in this scenario though? Especially if mainland Australia was a genocidal authoritarian panopticon, and Tasmania a democratic nation?


Turn those tables and fuck yeah I'll support the Independent Republic of Tasmania.
Yeah, if Tasmania was a democratic nation formed after an Australian civil war by the remnants of the losing side, now facing mainland authoritarian Australia. 


I would expect the rest of the democratic egalitarian world to back Tasmania in that situation, so no, it doesn't track.
You got a source for that one?
[Nuked: The Submarine Fiasco that Sank Australia’s Sovereignty](https://www.mup.com.au/books/nuked-paperback-softback) by [Andrew Fowler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Fowler_(journalist\)) goes into this in some detail.


Basically, there are a whole bunch of pro-US spruikers in the Australian public service who hated the French plan. Primary amongst these being [Andrew Shearer](https://www.ussc.edu.au/Andrew-shearer), who worked to overturn the decision. They worked with Morrison when he became PM to ditch the French program (Morrison hated it from the start). 
AUKUS was announced on 15 September 2021.

You can't call the current opposition "the opposition" when they were in government at the time. They were the government. The LNP were doing LNP things.. but where was Labor?
Ok, which is the party I can vote for who isn't champing at the bit for a confrontation with China. Even the Greens love it.

Much like in the US, which is the anti-war party? There is none.. despite pretty much nobody wanting war, that's what you'll get - a choice between war or super war.
Do you like Negative gearing? Because it was under their government that it was introduced. The seeds of the housing crisis were laid in the last century.
It is reasonable, except we are a small population with an enormous coastline that is dependent on maritime trade. Unless you want us to spend even more on defence than we currently do, you should support us having very strong allies in the region to help in our defence.
>A lot of the comments in this thread seem to be coming from a bunch of arm-chair generals who've played too much CIV 6, not read enough history, and are vastly over-estimating Australia's significance and capabilities.

The fact you're already trying to insult and denigrate people because they hold views that don't align with your own just says all we need to know.

>When it comes to the military and alliances the focus should be on defending the Australian mainland and not projecting force.

For Australia, force projection capabilities are the most important thing for our defence and it has been something neglected for far too long. AUKUS is one of many sorely needed corrections.

You may not like it but it is what it is. Just because our population is only 27 million doesn't mean that our national security policy should consist of being a bunch of limp dicks who roll over at the first sign of trouble, which is effectively what Keating is promoting. Your standard of reasonable is flat out ridiculous.
Metaphor. 


A metaphor is a figure of speech that, for rhetorical effect, directly refers to one thing by mentioning another. It may provide (or obscure) clarity or identify hidden similarities between two different ideas. Metaphors are usually meant to create a likeness or an analogy.
China is not sending their best, you are the most obvious shill I've seen in a while
I wonder if our allies will say the same thing if in the future we become the target of a powerful regime ?
We also couldn't sink any invasion fleet. We don't have enough ships or subs yet. We could make it absolutely suck for the invader, but not stop it.
>are you kidding when's the last time we spent 300 billion?

It's an amount being spent over the course of 30 years. It's very clear that many here don't understand how Defence presents their spending.

When you actually take that into consideration, there's a lot that we will be spending hundreds of billions of dollars on over such a timeframe.
I think frank acknowledgement of the reality that they are still by far the most powerful state in the system is part of the calculus, yes. 

Being on the side of Godzilla is a lot safer a path than trying to walk between Godzilla and his enemies.
Interesting, so CCP PRC is currently invading India, Bhutan, has conflicts with Vietnam, Philippines, Japan and Taiwan. The CCP has been to war with the ROC, Vietnam, Korea, Australia, New Zealand, UK, Canada, Netherlands, France, Philippines, Thailand, South Africa, Greece, Belgium, Luxembourg, Ethiopia and Columbia and the USSR.

Australia has been to war in Iraq, Vietnam and Afghanistan, being generous here, maybe we can count Malaysia and East Timor.

I can't even be arsed to count all the countries the CCP has been aggressive towards.

No idea where the idea that the CCP is not aggressive comes from in reality. In fiction it is a manufactured peice of low grade CCP propaganda backed up by nothing.

I wish people would stop repeating their slopaganda.
>Australia has been at war with more countries than the evil totalitarian PRC has.

I mean... they have only just begun their expansionist pathway. They had no military to speak of or economy until just now. Why would they have started a war? Show me on a map where Tibet is and where Papua New Guinea is and I'll give you a comparison of how expansionist our two nations are.

>How about Timor Leste and their natural resources we tried to steal from them?

By agreement, not by shoving our ships into theirs. One is morally bad, but it's not a breach of international law.

>And you can't criticise China by bringing up our treatment of our indigenous population, the most heavily incarcerated ethnic group in the world by most measurements.

We aren't putting whole ethnicities in mass concentration camps for just being x religion or x ethnicity. There are real social problems that need to be discussed, but if we take your approach, we don't criticise any country in the world... if we ourselves have any type of issue here? That's complete baloney.
Lets go through the list of countries that China has been a war/attacked militarily since 1945:  
Australia, United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Philippines, Soviet Union, Tibet, India, South Vietnam, Vietnam and Taiwan.
Uhhh, China has **one million** Uyghurs in concentration camps. That's just a little bit worse than our own terrible current treatment of Indigenous Australians. 


Just because we've done bad things doesn't mean that we can't call out China for being severely authoritarian, Orwellian and genocidal.
I wonder if some of that "scuba gear" will be named HMAS Harold Holt?
>The US was providing military aid to a country at war with a nuclear power,

It's a good thing china doesn't have nukes

> the US would likely already be involved

then let them deal with it, the money is being wasted supporting their ambitions when it could be fixing our hospitals and giving us free dental.
To be fair there are legitimate issues with US weaponry being technologically limited both for export and use. For instance (can't find the source right now) there's a rumour that all F35 offensive and strike mission planning needs to be done by a US Air Force unit that's stateside.


It's why South Korea's arms exports have been so popular, cutting edge technology for a pretty good price that the Koreans are more than happy to share.
The fact of the matter is that the ABC et al know that when they interview he can be relied on to bitch and whine about the current leadership and it makes for headlines. He's the political equivalent of Alan Jones talking about the Wallabies.
Which goes to show China's real crime is that they are not as weak as they were last century.
Well you can't assume anymore 😛
Thanks for the pick up, I'll edit and fix it up
There won't be a China US war. It's in neither of their interests and they both know it. Sure there's lots of posturing but there's always lots of posturing. I'm more concerned about us giving up our sovereignty to the US. AUKUS is just the start of the US using our country as a pawn.
Wait, so who did he sell Australia to?
I've said everything that need to be said.

What you don't (or won't) understand is that it is only through US interventionism that Taiwan exists as a defacto separate state today. If not for the US threatening to move their big gunboats over and intervene militarily in 1949 we wouldn't be having this conversation. What gives western states (or any state) the right to interfere with another people's right to self determination? Are you going to argue on the basis of morality and human rights as I mentioned before? Then where was the big powerful US in 1933 when Japan invaded China and caused millions of civilian deaths? Or where is the US today when there are numerous insurgencies and civil wars around the globe? Could it be that they don't actually give a shit about human rights and only advance their own political agenda? Nothing wrong with that but don't give it a bullshit veneer.
You’re missing the important context that both the governments in control of Mainland China and Taiwan claim to she the rightful rulers of both Mainland China and Taiwan. Comparing expansionist imperial campaigns with an unresolved civil war is arguing in bad faith, or at the very least, ignorance.
false equalivances. Every country recognizes taiwan as the PRC, not an independent country. Or are we going to forget the government of taiwan was the government of china before fleeing when they where deposed. There isn't even legal justification for anyone intervening if china did decide to invade as no international law would be broken, so yes it is in every sense a very local regional problem.

and can we all stop pretending we actually care about the taiwanese, it's all a pretext for the chip fab, same reason china wants them besides dictator poo's ego.
Only one of those three examples have any direct impact on us.

We're a middle power at best, why get involved with somebody else's problem? If we can accept that one of our allies in the middle east is in the middle of an invasion and openly annexing land for years but we're doing jack shit then what makes Russia or a potential Chinese invasion worth intervention?
Apples to oranges, has China invaded Taiwan?
Has china invaded taiwan?
Would you go die to protect Taiwan?
Or when the US invaded Korea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq. Aussies have been dying for the American Empire for decades.

Plus let’s not forget that Taiwan was part of China until the fascists were kicked out after the civil war and fled there to become puppets of the US. Now, this does not mean that China has the right to take it back now, but it is certainly not the same thing as Hitler invading Poland or the other examples that have been mentioned.
Thats certainly a take. You're forgetting the part where america antangonizes china into a position where they become directly aggressive themselves and once america no longer has any interest in taiwan, we're in line. america is several thousand more kilometres away.
Maritime borders are another issue, and many nations pull shady tricks to expand their EEZ. Including us.
I'm imagining China controlling semiconductors instead of Taiwan. Nothing's happening. We continue to do business with China like always.

>Taiwan's independence is required for countries like the USA to maintain their technological lead.

That really doesn't sound like a Sovereign nation, It sounds like Taiwan is integral to American economic supremacy. If that's something America wants to concern themselves with that's their business. Don't care if we have to buy semiconductors off China.
The concern isn’t the USAs access to high performance semiconductors, that would not be meaningfully affected by any reunification.The issue is giving Chinese technology companies access to high performance semiconductors.
Is that the world order that has collapsed ecosystems globally and may well collapse society as well?
1945 is an interesting starting point for Taiwan, the time when it was governed by the Republic of **China**. And before an Massacre in 1947. Also before the time both the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the Chinese Communist Party both were both claiming to be the legitimate government of China. There might be some history behind the current China /Taiwan disputes
We have waged war in Vietnam, Korea, Malaysia, Iraq, Afghanistan, and other military actions, during this time of unprecedented peace. The people's republic invaded Vietnam for 3 weeks, brawls with the Indian Army using sticks, and entered the Korean war after warning Macarthur multiple times not to let his divisions to approach their border.

You are living in another reality if you think we can act like we spread peace and prosperity and China spreads war, or that we defend liberal democracies.
... For us. For other parts of the world is unleashed horrors beyond most Australians comprehension. 

That being said, because it's been so good for us, I'm in favour of maintaining this order and backing the United States.
Except all the countries involved in war initiated by US interests.
I wasn't even scratching the surface either. 

Frankly, everyone who believes in the West's "moral superiority" should go and inlist now. 

This sub is as ignorant as the other one.
You can make the argument for a better spend, but let's be real - Keating advocated for the US pulling out of the region, that if the US wasnt around China wouldnt try to expand, that 75 years of Taiwan independence means nothing, that leaving china/taiwan alone would let it 'sort itself out' in a couple of years (see hong kong but with guns on all sides and no attempt at orderly transition) and that somehow the centre of chip manufacturing in thevworld has no strategic interest for us.

Oh and that we dont need the US because we could use our own spy satellites (??) to beat the chinese in a war.

Its mean, let him sleep.
>needs to invest heavily in anti-shipping and drone warfare so that we have a credible asymmetric, defensive military capability. I would much rather see the submarine money being spent on that.

We actually are investing heavily into both fields.

Submarines are one of the best anti-shipping platforms a navy can have. The submarine money is an investment into anti-shipping capability.

Also, the RAN and RAAF have drone programs running right now. AUKUS itself even outlines joint R&D into drones.
Maybe he should have done more to foster ASEAN and make it a regional power block when you know, he was the PM? 

I guess this is all on brand for him though, since he had no problem cozying up dictators close to home. https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2008/01/labo-j31.html
Those same dorks trying to pretend that Keating is some CCP shill will completely uncritically parrot US state department propaganda while convinced they're the only "clear thinking" individual in the conversation, it's odd to watch.
When they stopped buying Australian coal it actually hit them worse than it hit us long term, as we eventually found other buyers and they had a coal shortage that caused massive blackouts across China which massively hurt productivity.


Now that isn't going to be true of all exports to China, but iron iron ire would be another example, it would cripple many of their industries.


There has been a lot written about how that attempt at a trade war didn't go how anyone expected it to go.
>Most of the China rhetoric is honestly just an "us vs them" narrative to encourage us to stay part of the US hegemony/sphere of influence.

and most of what the chinese Media Pedles is an us vs them Narrative as well :/
Either we support the one china policy or we are lying. You can't support something "on paper". 
That's really not true though, I think?  We have no formal diplomatic relations, for example.
No. The change came on the Taiwan side after the Sunflower Movement in 2014. The PRC position essentially has not changed since 1950.


>Xi is another beast.


People keep saying this. What exactly has Xi said that is different to what every other Chinese leader of the PRC has said? 
Malcolm Turnbull is purely against AUKUS because it killed off his submarine program with the French, it's an ego thing for him.

>They're not even building enough for their own military needs but we're expecting them to build state of the art subs for us?

The Americans are making new investments into their shipyards and have more than a decade to sort themselves out in time to sell us the three Virginia class interim subs.

The RAN's SSN-AUKUS subs will be built in Adelaide, so they're not reliant on UK shipyards.

I think people underestimate the timelines we're working on here.
Turnbull doesn't like AUKUS simply because the submarine deal he made was poor and didn't work. He could have proposed buying the inferior French nuclear subs but he didn't. He wasn't interested in defence.
>I swear the amount of rhetoric about China in the past few years is getting ridiculous

I sorta agree, but at the same time you can't simply ignore that (a) there's at least a possibility that the US (and possibly others) would defend Taiwan from a Chinese attack and (b) China has repeatedly and openly stated that it intends to militarily take Taiwan if it won't surrender peacefully.

Like... how do you ignore the world's second superpower openly promising to invade another country?  Last time a large military power threatened to do that it then did do it and now we have the Ukraine war.  Back then people were also talking about 'alarmism' about Russia and alleging that the US was hyping up the risk of war for political reasons.

I think the 'rhetoric' about China was partly designed to shake Australians out of our 1990s/2000s complacency and make us realise that a war is a non-zero possibility in the 2020s and beyond, and so we need to plan accordingly.

Of course China could address all of this by simply clearly promising that it will not invade Taiwan and respects Taiwan's independence, and then ceasing its relentless military build up.  But there's rarely any criticism of that from the same people who blast AUKUS.

(To be clear I think the submarine deal is stupid).
[removed]
> I swear the amount of rhetoric about China in the past few years is getting ridiculous, anyone remember the major Newpaper headlines that we could be at war with China in two years? Thank god we have these subs that are expected to come in to service by late 2030s, that finally deterred China from launching their full-scale attack next year?

It's much like every economist "predicting" that China will collapse every year, year after year, since the 60's at the very least. People seriously swallow literally anything negative about China without even a hint of critical thought, they also pay literally 0 mind to the fact that the US has a -very- vested interest in painting China as some monumental world ending regime - whereas in reality, near everything the US accuses China of, it's doing in a much worse fashion.
>If there was a civil war and the government lost and fled to Tasmania, would you still consider that to be part of Australia?

I'll make it easier: if the Tasmanians decided, *right now*, that they wanted to secede from the mainland, I would have no problem with them doing so. I don't even understand why we would care. (Since it's probably a pertinent detail, yes I am a mainland Australian citizen.)

Similarly, New Zealand was invited to join the federation. I think they showed up to one or two meetings on the subject in the lead-up to 1901 and then decided they weren't that interested, and everyone got on with their lives. Australia even granted Papua New Guinea independence coming up on half a century ago. I could say a lot of negative things about the Australian national ethos, but I doubt I could call Australia at all revanchist.

>Keating is a realist

The rest of the things in the paragraph are not things that a realist would think. A realist would pessimistically posit that diplomatic consensus-building among a coalition of regional neighbours is all so much fluff against a regional hegemon with an overmatch in actual hard power. A realist would insist that said hegemon will, in pursuit of its own self-interest, inevitably optimize its force posture and power projection capability to coerce the other states in the region into compliance. The realist would then go on to outline an extremely expensive asymmetric force structure which, in their mind, provides the capabilities required to resist said coercion.

I think you could reasonably call Hugh White a realist. Keating is not a realist.
False equivalence though, Australia is not an authoritarian country. Tasmania has been part of Australia since the Commonwealth was established in 1901 and has been under the rule of central government since. There is no desire of the people of Tasmania to become independent. The shipping lanes through Tasmania do not make up a significant portion of world trade. Tasmania does not produce specialist chips that would severely disrupt technology throughout the world should they be taken by an authoritarian nation that is building up its arsenal faster than any other country. There are other reasons China wants Taiwan and that has a lot to do with the optics of having a successful democratic China (Taiwan) next door. They don't want Chinese people getting ideas about the party.
Taiwan was never a part of China.
[deleted]
The United States does not recognize or consider Taiwan to be part of China. They consider Taiwan's overall status as unresolved.


Australia takes a similar position.
>Australia and the United States both consider Taiwan to be part of China.

Only officially.  In practice, we treat them as an independent country.
Exactly.

This has nothing to do about the independence of Taiwanese people and their protection.

It is about securing arguably the most important resource in the world right now, semiconductor chips and the means to fabricate them.

Oil, natural gas, coal, iron and basically every other resource we depend on can be found across the globe. Semiconductor supply right now is effectively constrained to Taiwan.

Semiconductor fabrication is extremely difficult and requires specific expertise and billions in investment.

If China gains control over 90% of the world's semiconductor supply - they gain a massive economic and technological advancement. They'll have the best military equipment.
What makes you think we wouldn't buy chips if China was in control? We have no problems working with other dictatorships.

>The Taiwan straight carries an incredible amount of Australia's exports and imports. ~1200 cargo ships pass through there a week. If China annexes Taiwan then they will be able to claim the straight as their territorial waters, giving them the ability to decide who can pass through there and under what conditions.

Somebody post that utopia clip
Dude what are you on about?

Yes TSMC.  One assumes that they would still make silicon chips for AI.

Lots of these chips are sold to China, and packaged by Chinese companies into servers and products.

Yes, there are military implications of course.  That may or may not be worth thousands upon thousands of corpses, but it's a subjective matter.

China claims to enjoy "sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction over the Taiwan Strait" and regards the waterway as "internal territorial waters" instead of being international waters, this means that the Chinese government denies any foreign vessel having the freedom of navigation to cross the strait without Chinese official consent. - wikipedia.

They already claim the strait and already decide who may pass.  You're describing the Panama or Suez canals, both greatly successful.


And if people had to sail their ships on the other side of taiwan "OH NO", international shipping would cost a little bit more.  It's not a choke point like the strait of Malacca is.

> Taiwan is critical to our economic security, our trade security and our military security.

No it's not. How much of Australian trade passes through there which is NOT for China & Taiwan?  Because they wouldn't need to close the strait to stop trading with us.  China is more critical to our economic security than China is.

What's the difference between trade security and economic security?

Our military security is sponsored by the USA, not by Taiwan.  F35s and fancy Chios are for us to attack with.  None of this is what stops people invading and occupying us.
>The Taiwan straight carries an incredible amount of Australia's exports and imports

Most of that trade is WITH China lmao, you're saying we need to prepare for war against China to defend our trade with China?

You're not wrong about the chip manufacturing which is why the US is on-shoring the tech and ramping up local production. Soon that won't be an issue, definitely not something worth going to war over.

  
The only signfiicance of Tawain is the ideological side, as in is the west willing to allow a free, democratic nation to be annexed by a communist authoritarian state.
No it would make Tasmania a vestige of a civil war that China interfered in for their own strategic reasons. Also we have committed genocide before, so are we no longer entitled to our nation? In this analogy Tasmania would have a government more aligned to China's values and mainland Australia would keep to our more traditional political values, so imagine if we were a democracy and Tasmania was under single party rule.

>Turn those tables and fuck yeah I'll support the Independent Republic of Tasmania.

It would be the People's Republic of Tasmania and it would defend itself with the People's Liberation Army Navy.
Then you're not supporting international law and the "rules based international order"

Ultimately I still support defending Taiwan, but if the Chinese invaded Taiwan it wouldn't be a violation of international law.
Yeah I was interested but I ain't spending 30 bucks when other sources have covered in great detail. You got a source that isn't trying to build outrage to sell a book?


I have no doubt that the contract is completely not in our favour and the Liberal government completely fucked over the French, we all know Morrison couldn't tell the truth even if his life depended on it. I have no doubt he took a few bribes because the bastard was blatantly corrupt.



But by many accounts in the RAN seem agree that nuclear powered submarines are far better suited for the requirements Australia has and the submarines we were getting from the French just weren't going to cut it long term. The disadvantages of diesel-electric were just too great for what the navy needed.
I agree.  Where were Labor?  Why did they just accept it as is?

Hence my comment about the deals behind the scene.
Nobody wants war, so you should ask why China continues to provoke confrontation in the South China Sea. Look at the 9 dash line, their continued harassment of the Filipino Navy, border spats with India.


There's a reason why Vietnam now hosts US warships and just signed a US arms deal - the Vietnamese Communist Party knows China better than just about anyone and know that the US is zero threat to peace in Asia-Pacific.
> Even the Greens love it.

[The Greens do not love it.](https://greens.org.au/campaigns/no-nuclear-subs) Some Greens members don't like the nuclear aspect, other green members think it's a poor allocation of public resources given existing issues like medicare, housing, infrastructure, NDIS etc, and some (like Jordon Steele-John) share a position very similar to Keating where they think it undermines our sovereignty in regard to constructing our own foreign policy and interests.
None of the three parties you've referred to want conflict with China. The two majors believe that our interests and peace are best preserved through deterrence of Beijing and cooperation with our allies while the Greens believe them to be best preserved through appeasement.
Placating Hitler did well for people. /s You're being naïve thinking just because you don't want war, it does not happen and even if you're not directly involved it does not mean your life isn't affected. We aren't some tiny island nation that we can be neutral.
Don't run your perspective as, an election is like a restaurant and the parties are set menus that we have to choose from, or you'll get dismayed and hopeless.

The parties are going to represent the majority of their electorates and the government is going to be constrained by a majority of electorates. So the goal is to influence your neighbors (in a literal, physical sense) and to participate in a network that will influence neighbours around the country (such as a political party, or at the other end a media company). 

That way, you get to choose what's on the menu. And the election isn't a chance for the country to choose, but an opportunity to see what they've already chosen.
Negative gearing was introduced in Australia [in 1936](https://www.westernsydney.edu.au/newscentre/news_centre/more_news_stories/what_is_negative_gearing_and_what_is_it_doing_to_housing_affordability#:~:text=When%20was%20it%20introduced%3F,in%20housing%20and%20increase%20supply)
We need a version of Godwin's law, but for genitalia.
>

> For Australia, force projection capabilities are the most important thing for our defence and it has been something neglected for far too long. AUKUS is one of many sorely needed corrections.

Important for what, against who?

> doesn't mean that our national security policy should consist of being a bunch of limp dicks who roll over at the first sign of trouble

Roll over against who, and even with the subs, what change do you think it honestly makes?
Yes, in your metaphor 'throwing Taiwan to the wolves' means throwing them to China.

Keating has said that in so many words, just without the poetic language describing China as a wolf. So trying to make it sound like Keating is dancing around the issue when he directly said Taiwan is Chinese real estate is stupid.
That's how these conversations inevitably end. If I'm bad at shilling then by all means, point it out. I don't accuse people who support AUKUS that they are US shills despite how it's an agreement that involves giving hundreds of billions of dollars to their government and they'll think about giving us a submarine if they have any spares.

I'm aware I'm expressing a pro Chinese position on these issues. That's because I believe it's better for Australia. Why do you disagree? Do you even know?
That's all you need to do. Make it suck so hard that the invading force suffers negative setbacks at home.

>Vietnam

China invaded for less than a month, Australia was there for a decade.

>India

Armed with sticks on remote military outposts. The Sino Indian war was also a few months long.

>Philippines

China is being unreasonable by ignoring the maritime border treaties they have signed and the Phillipines attempts to go through UN arbitration. Doesn't count as an act of War though.

>the ROC

There was this thing called the Chinese Civil War.

>Korea, Australia, New Zealand, UK, Canada, Netherlands, France, Philippines, Thailand, South Africa, Greece, Belgium, Luxembourg, Ethiopia and Columbia

The Korean war wasn't caused by the PRC.

>Australia has been to war in Iraq, Vietnam and Afghanistan, being generous here, maybe we can count Malaysia and East Timor.

You counted maritime disputes China is involved in but for some reason the Malay emergency which we deployed troops to and featured mass deportations among other war crimes. Very generous indeed. 

>the USSR.

Again, these were border disputes that had a few hundred casualties at the height of tensions between the two nations.

>I can't even be arsed to count all the countries the CCP has been aggressive towards.

Is "aggressive" just any dispute?

>No idea where the idea that the CCP is not aggressive comes from in reality. In fiction it is a manufactured peice of low grade CCP propaganda backed up by nothing.

You listed two real wars (Chinese civil war and Korean war), one of which was a civil war, the other was caused by Koreans along with the Soviets and US acting like old school imperialists, and Macarthur ignored China's warnings about approaching the Yalu river. Other than that, border disputes that lasted weeks or months hardly compare to the years or decades we have spent at war with different nations. Maritime border disputes are common, we have our own history of them. The 9 dash line doesn't win China any friends in the region but it's not comparable to war.
>I mean... they have only just begun their expansionist pathway. They had no military to speak of or economy until just now. Why would they have started a war? Show me on a map where Tibet is and where Papua New Guinea is and I'll give you a comparison of how expansionist our two nations are.

Oh right I didn't know you were referring to things that haven't happened yet. Tibet has been controlled by Beijing since the 1950s, it was recognised as part of China by everyone except Nepal even before then. I do not know what your point is about PNG, but we once occupied that region too until Japan invaded the region.

>By agreement, not by shoving our ships into theirs. One is morally bad, but it's not a breach of international law.

Actually we illegally spied on them to steal their natural resources. What we did was both morally inexcusable and explicitly illegal. China has acted illegally to push their territorial claims in the South China Sea which they have strategic and economic reasons to do so.

>We aren't putting whole ethnicities in mass concentration camps for just being x religion or x ethnicity.

https://www.iwgia.org/en/news/4344-aboriginal-people-in-australia-the-most-imprisoned-people-on-earth.html

Yes actually we are. Or at least it looks like we are to every other nation. It's actually a very complicated issue that I want our nation to keep trying to correct. Almost every nation has some shameful abuses, and every nation has the right to work through their own issues. If you think China, just simply locks up people for the religion or their ethnicity, then you don't understand their legal system, and I don't believe for a second you care more about fixing racial divisions in China, more than the average Chinese person.

>There are real social problems that need to be discussed, but if we take your approach, we don't criticise any country in the world..... if we ourselves have any type of issue here? That's complete baloney.

Correct, let's focus on Australian issues. Why do you care about internal Chinese problems? What about institutional racism in Malaysia? Or the creeping islamisation Of Indonesia? Myanmar is a mess, Bangladesh is in chaos, India has increasing racial tensions. I could go on and list every nation in Asia or the rest of the world and bring up their problems. What would be the point? Other than looking like a massive hypocrite.
I don't know when China attacked Australia or the US or the UK or Canada. Bringing up Vietnam is Rich, you're aware we had a little military adventure over there as well right? Except We spent a bit longer than 3 weeks "helping" Vietnam. Tibet is an autonomous region in China, not A sovereign country. India and the Philippines have disputed borders that result in border clashes with sticks instead of guns and various fishing or transport vessels being damaged in contested areas. The border conflicts with the Soviet Union were close to a real war.

So when you take the border conflicts off the list you're left with a 3 week intervention into Vietnam in the 1970s. If you consider that a warmongering nation then I don't know what to tell you.
There isn't even 1 million indigenous Australians. No, that's reincarcerate indigenous Australians at a higher rate than China imprisons uyghur Muslims? Also I'm Australian, so what my government does is morally more relevant to me than what China does?.

>Just because we've done bad things doesn't mean that we can't call out China for being severely authoritarian, Orwellian and genocidal.

That's actually exactly what it means. Are you familiar with the concept of a hypocrite? Every country is full of nationalist blowhards that criticise all other nations. But there's not a lot of people who care about their country enough to want to acknowledge and fix its flaws.
That figure was plucked out of thin air by Adrian Zenz, a looney tunes fundamentalist Christian (see his book) employed by the US Government funded "victims of communism" foundation.

Repeating a lie often enough does not make it a truth.
>Uhhh, China has one million Uyghurs in concentration camps.


Those camps have been [closed and retrofitted (Sky News)](https://news.sky.com/story/whats-happened-to-chinas-uyghur-camps-12881984) and [another source (Voice of America)](https://www.voanews.com/a/blocked-roads-crumbling-camps-as-china-moves-xinjiang-detentions-out-of-sight/7261026.html). As for the million number, that is nothing more than [an estimate](https://qz.com/1599393/how-researchers-estimate-1-million-uyghurs-are-detained-in-xinjiang) made by a group that [happens to be based in Washington](http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Human_Rights_Defenders) by a country that also happens to be China's greatest economic and geopolitical rival.


Fun fact - not a single Islamic country has objected the treatment of Uyghurs, and lots of them actually supported it. 

[https://thediplomat.com/2020/10/2020-edition-which-countries-are-for-or-against-chinas-xinjiang-policies/](https://thediplomat.com/2020/10/2020-edition-which-countries-are-for-or-against-chinas-xinjiang-policies/)


As for the [UN Report](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/countries/2022-08-31/22-08-31-final-assesment.pdf) on the matter:


> While it did not mention the word “genocide”, it found that “serious human rights violations” had been committed, and said “the extent of arbitrary and discriminatory detention of members of Uyghur and other predominantly Muslim groups … may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity.”


**Edit** instead of blindly downvoting me, maybe try to disprove the findings of the United Nations instead
China does have nukes tho
>To be fair there are legitimate issues with US weaponry being technologically limited both for export and use.

There really isn't.

>For instance (can't find the source right now) there's a rumour that all F35 offensive and strike mission planning needs to be done by a US Air Force unit that's stateside.

A rumour, wow. One that doesn't even make any sense.

Very convincing.

>It's why South Korea's arms exports have been so popular, cutting edge technology for a pretty good price that the Koreans are more than happy to share.

South Korea is an operator of the F-35 and is a major customer of the United States. Not to mention a lot of the equipment they do produce uses American systems.
Oh yeah having an authoritarian state with no checks and balances on their actions be as powerful as the US is something I'm dying for
AUKUS isn't the start, it's the continuation. 

We've been American pawns since we stopped being British ones. 

If you truly believe there will never be a war over Taiwan, that sets you apart from the consensus thinking which is that there is a very real risk of war between the US and China over the island.
Can just look at the major shareholders for the privatized companies.

Blackrock and Canadian Pension Plan are usually there. And it also set the stage for other privatizations like toll roads and airports. "Asset recycling" as the libs call it.
>Every country recognizes taiwan as the PRC, not an independent country. Or are we going to forget the government of taiwan was the government of china before fleeing when they where deposed. There isn't even legal justification for anyone intervening if china did decide to invade as no international law would be broken, so yes it is in every sense a very local regional problem.


The vast majority of developed countries, including Australia and the United States, do not recognize or consider Taiwan to be part of the PRC.


Taiwan has never been part of the PRC. There is no legal justification for the PRC invading another country that has never been part of it's territory or under control of it's government.


Taiwan/ROC is a sovereign and independent country within international law.
It is absolutely. Hitler used historical claims to territory as has Putin now in Ukraine, as have the CCP and Taiwan. 

Taiwan has the same historical claim to China that China has to  Taiwan. In fact, if they were to abandon that claim and outright emphasise their total serperation and independence from China, they would likely accelerate an invasion because then the CCP can't publically see Taiwan as a rogue province.

They are a successful liberal democracy, they are not the facists of the past.
US invaded Korea? When did this happen? Are you referring to the time they lead a UN force to *defend* South Korea from an invasion from the North?
Let's not forget that life was so terrible under the ROC that people were dying at 32 years of age. Mao was able to win the revolution precisely because it was the will of the people who were sick of living under a government that had sold the country out to the Angloeuropean colonial powers.
I think fundamentally the US will be interested in Asia for a very long time to come, Taiwan is the focal point, but not the reason why the US is interested in China. 

The US cares about Taiwan because it cares about China, and it cares about China because it's a peer competitor, the same reason it cared about the Soviet Union, and China it's already a lot more powerful than the Soviet Union ever was. 

And if the Americans leave? Well, we can chart our own course then, when they're less interested in us.

Australia is one of the most strategically secure countries in the world, the US is our only plausible threat for the foreseeable future.
Google the 9 dash line and tell me how in any way that can be considered a totally normal claim.
[deleted]
Interesting you portray our involvement in Korea as "waging war" while justifying China's involvement? You are aware that we were not supporting the aggressor in that conflict right? And that China was, just because of the excuse that they felt "threatened" by American armies in another country (gee where have I heard *that* excuse recently?).
Yeah, agreed with all of that.  He was in power in an era where China was mostly an exciting economic opportunity, and doesn't seem to have updated his thinking at all since then.
It really is worrying the number of people who simply dismiss him as a shill, whilst providing no counter points or discussion.


But we aren't a country that values education - if we were, we wouldn't have a teacher shortage, nor would we have an economy so lacking diversity that we are essentially a mining country with a housing market attached.
> When they stopped buying Australian coal it actually hit them worse than it hit us long term, as we eventually found other buyers and they had a coal shortage that caused massive blackouts across China which massively hurt productivity.

That may not be the projection in the future because one of the difficulties China apparently didn't seem to calculate was finding new supply routes amid the pandemic. They had alternative countries lined up, what they didn't have were stable supply routes.

We were always going to find different buyers when you drop the price low enough but that's isn't ideal either.
>There has been a lot written about how that attempt at a trade war didn't go how anyone expected it to go.

I agree but, that's all the more reason why they wouldn't do a blockade of our trade routes.
100%. Yes both countries engage in similar propaganda. I'm certainly not trying to paint China as some innocent party, that's equally naïve. In geopolitics, the people are just pawns.
Have any examples?
Sweet summer child
Australia has a "one China policy" that does not agree with the "one China principle".


There is a difference between the two.
I think you're right.  We agree that Taiwan is not the legitimate ruler of all china, I think that's the general idea.
It's not what he has said, it's what he has done. The military buildup on the mainland side of the strait could be posturing and geopolitical maneuvering or it could be a genuine threat.
I thought the official line was “peaceful unification” and now they say otherwise
I know the proposed timelines, I'm judging it from the fact that both the US and UK are already extremely behind on their own timelines for various projects (see the progress of the proposed constellation class frigate for the US as a recent example, which has already experienced several delays, and has most recently been estimated to be delayed by a further 3 years). Things move really slowly in the world of military procurement. A decade is not as long as you think it is.

>The RAN's SSN-AUKUS subs will be built in Adelaide, so they're not reliant on UK shipyards.

They haven't even yet been designed...

I think nuclear subs are the right direction for Australia, but there are few reasons to be optimistic of the AUKUS deal IMO.
>Like... how do you ignore the world's second superpower openly promising to invade another country? Last time a large military power threatened to do that it then did do it and now we have the Ukraine war. Back then people were also talking about 'alarmism' about Russia and alleging that the US was hyping up the risk of war for political reasons.

I'm not, but again I think the geopolitics and historical context that exists between China and Taiwan is completely different from Ukraine and Russia. That doesn't mean I agree with what China is doing in SEA and they should be called out for their BS.

But I also think this isnt our fight? Like I understand why the US wants to keep Taiwan out of CCPs hands and I can understand why China wants unify Taiwan by all means, but honestly what's in it for Australia to be involved? Did we learn nothing from Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan?

And has anyone thought about the potential consequences of using the same subs as the US if there is military conflict? Do we really think the Chinese (or any other hostile) navy, if they manage to detect a sub, know which nations subs it will be? At least with different subs there will be different signatures. By going with AUKUS we pretty much guaranteed to be dragged in to the next Asian conflict regardless of our stance. I feel like that's the part that Keating is worried about.
When did I say they were friends?? Stop assuming I'm pro china just because I'm calling out the bs fear mongering/borderline propaganda.

Our current Aukus agreement is basically a pinky promise by the US at this point, go read the actual interview I linked, please enlightened me if I'm wrong based on the evidence I provided, I'm happy to be proven wrong on our current agreement.

My criticism is with the aukus agreement and how it was done, behind closed doors, by a PM that surprise surprise has started working in the US defence industry, instead of a normal reterdering process.

My stance is we don't need a nuclear powered Sub for what is our primary mission, coastal defence of Australia, but that wasn't my original point. I mean if only China had all of the following oil, hates freedom, and WMDs, we might be justified joining a collision and invading them.., else this reeks of the yellow peril 2.0.
We’re not talking right now, we’re talking about Tasmania not even declaring independence, but claiming sovereignty over all of Australia after one side in an Australian Civil War loses the war and flees to Tasmania
>False equivalence though

So just to be clear, if Australia was an authoritative country, you would accept Tasmania independence especially if that independence was enforced by a hostile foreign power?
> False equivalence though, Australia is not an authoritarian country. 

Let's ask Papua New Guinea, Timor, Iraq, Afghanistan, Vietnam, Libya, Syria, etc... how they feel about that, because we were absolutely complicit in the US pushing their authoritarian bullshit upon these countries.
The Qing dynasty ruled over the island of Taiwan from 1683 to 1895. The Qing dynasty sent an army led by general Shi Lang and defeated the Ming loyalist Kingdom of Tungning in 1683. Taiwan was then formally annexed in April 1684.

If we are going to discuss this stuff it's important we don't make blanket, absolute assertions that are false.
Literally both the ROC and PRC disagree with that statement
Germany's largest trade partners in 1938-1940 were Poland, France and the Soviet Union. Close relations won't stop an authoritarian government that is fundamentally opposed to you.
Your example tried that with Russia,  every winter on queue Putin would threaten to cut off gas oil supplies. Look how it stopped Russia invading and land grabs.    There hasn't been war between ... Listen to this because it's important.. rational stable countries is because they are rational and stable enough to recognize mutual benefit over self.   Russia above is authoritarian dictatorship which is not rational and needs conflict to survive. It sees any attempts to intertwine as merely giving ropes it can wrap around necks and choke for control.  China is no different.  Could a mutually beneficial system like the EU be setup in Asia sure with the rational non abusive nations.  Not China.
America's official policy is that they agree that both China and Taiwan have a one China Policy.
The one China policy is literally about recognising Taiwan as de jure Chinese territory even if de facto it is not.
No, we don't, we interact very carefully with them. 

And at the end of the day, de jure we consider Taiwan part of China, even if de facto it is not, and the de jure aspect is what defines international law and it's violations.
Just remember that's only talking about advanced cutting edge Chips.  If we are happy with circa 2020 (2015?) chips then we can continue.
Go and have a look at the actions China has taken with the Philippines recently, specifically the CCG-5901 coast guard ship.  That is the total and complete behaviour of a bully that knows their opponent can't fight back.  It is also completely in keeping with the Wolf Warrior Diplomacy China tried to deploy through out the 2010s.

Are you seriously telling me you think China wouldn't take similar actions to bully literally any other country, including Australia, if they thought they could get away with it?  

If they take Taiwan they control a huge portion of our trade routes, and control the supply and manufacture of critical components of our defense industry.  And no, I don't think we would be buying chips to the F35, GhostBat, JDAMs or any other military equipment from China.  FFS we didn't allow Huawei to be part of Australia's telecommunications backhaul network because they were deemed a security threat.
Approx 28% of our trade that is non china destined passed through there.

China claims lots of things.  But that is why the freedom of navigation missions are carried out by the US and other militaries including Australia as we do not accept that claim.  In the same way we do not accept the 9 dashed line claim.

The do not decide who passes through the straight.  At all.  

China does not represent an invasion risk to Australia.  I never once said they did.  Also if you think F35A is for attacking then you clearly don't know what their capabilities are.  There is no way for our f35 fighters to get in range of China.  They would have to be refueled in the air close to china and well within their interception range.  The f35s might be stealthy, but a KC-30a sure as shit isn't.

Closing the straight of Taiwan would effectively close the south china sea.  It's not a just a little more money to ship our goods.
Firstly yes.  That is exactly what I am saying and I genuinely don't understand why people struggle with that concept.  Through out history there have been countless examples of two countries or groups who manage to trade with each other in a balanced way while being wary of each other.  But if the power imbalance becomes too great then the situation collapses and the one with power takes advantage.  This isn't some weird concept.

Secondly the Taiwan straight carries all our trade with Japan and South Korea, which when combined represents 28.5% of our exports vs China's 29% (by value).

Finally the US is a decade away from having chip manufacturing on par with TSMC in Taiwan.  They literally haven't even started construction.
You're missing the point. Supporting democratic egalitarian states in their independence is what other democratic egalitarian states do. Opposing an authoritarian surveillance state in its designs on a democratic nation is not a bad thing, even if China says it is. 


We cannot adopt their values just because they say so.
Why not just buy French nuclear subs?
Australia's defence has always been a bi-partisan issue. 

Both Labor and Libs supported sending Australia to Iraq twice and Afghanistan. While both parties vary slightly when it comes to broad foreign affairs issues (just look at the difference between Penny Wong's handling of international issues and what the previous government was doing), signing defence pacts and treaties, and generally cuddling up to the US has been a bi-partisan issues for several decades now. 

I wouldn't be surprised if the US government has had an active spy/positive relations network set up in many government departments/ministerial cabinets to sway decisions towards maintaining these good relations.
Ninja edit making me look bad but ah well who cares about internet points.

Well it's the right of the government to propose, but the responsibility of the opposition to oppose. The answer to why is that Labor doesn't hold any core Labor values anymore - they don't know what they themselves stand for, they're just an empty vessel to be poured into. Not to worry, the US has a plan for Australia - we get to fight China.
Ok so let's say they come to an arrangement with the Philippines and Taiwan votes to rejoin the mainland or even just pause things.. they sort something out with India.

Are we good? I really doubt we are good.
Deterrence from what? Moving up the value chain into 1st world jobs?
That's pretty much the calibre of the debate.. everyone is Hitler.

The actual situation is that the US needs to start something right now - because even if China offered 100 years of the status quo it would not be accepted, as at that stage China and India will be the entire global economy. They win by waiting. I'm not sure who is Hitler in that scenario - but we should sit it out.

In WW2 the US abandoned their own territory of the Philippines to the Japanese, to fight in Europe. They don't have the best track record.
I look at it as there are national interests that people aren't allowed to vote on - for instance going to war in WW1 or WW2, choosing to dismantle American hegemony, or in our instance - choosing to stay neutral even when it is the only thing that could possibly save us being the meat in an apocalyptic sandwich.

In pre WW2 Australia, anticipating the limits of empire would have been smart - even though our betters had already decided we were in all the way.
Your source also says abolished in ‘85 and reintroduced in ‘87.
>Important for what, against who?

Australia against adversaries.

>Roll over against who, and even with the subs, what change do you think it honestly makes?

Are you seriously telling me that you cannot comprehend how the Navy not having submarines to replace the Collins class would negatively affect them and our national security as a whole?

Don't reply if you intend to continue being this brain dead. It's honestly too late at night for your nonsense.
>That's how these conversations inevitably end.

For good reason.

>If I'm bad at shilling then by all means, point it out.

The key to shilling is to actually win people over. You're bad at it because you have an extremely repulsive personality.

>I don't accuse people who support AUKUS that they are US shills

You have done this in the past. I know because I've been one of the people you've made this accusation against in the past.

>despite how it's an agreement that involves giving hundreds of billions of dollars to their government and they'll think about giving us a submarine if they have any spares.

You couldn't be any more disingenuous even if you tried but that's par for the course with you.

>I'm aware I'm expressing a pro Chinese position on these issues. That's because I believe it's better for Australia. Why do you disagree? Do you even know?

I love how you act as if not being pro-CCP s some kind of unnatural position to hold.

The answer to your question is pretty obvious, many people do not believe that being pro-Chinese like you and Keating are is good for Australia.
>Yes 10 billion a year, for context it would only take 4.3 billion a year to make university free.

And the defence budget and the education budget are two separate things. Write to your local member if you want an increase to the education budget.

>Yes and most of those are better uses of money.

What you consider to be "better use" is subjective. Plenty of people consider the ADF to be important and have no issue with this expenditure.

Don't pretend that you speak for society.
Did someone just agression-splain every single time the CCP has attacked other nations

Especially the time they attacked the Socialist Republic of Vietnam because it was mad that the Vietnamese were dismantling the Khmer Rouge.

or the time the CCP went to war with the United Nations to install a monarchy. The CCP PLA attack on the United Nations of Korea added 3 years to the war and by the looks of it the CCP is responsible for all Australian dead as we only suffered 7 wounded against the north koreans.

smol bean border dispute (Sino-Soviet Border Conflict) where the CCP decided to kill Soviets so the CCP could conquer more land whose last tenous connection to han suprrmacism is that The Great Qing (daicing gurun) imperial heavenly mandate extended there once

I'm entertained by the idea where as long as it's not a reddit act-of-war(tm) or a reddit real war(tm) that the CCP is goody two shoes. It can kill and maim hundreds of people at a time but if it doesn't declare war it's not aggressive. Good magic trick, I'm sure the party bigwigs at zhongnanhai have taken good notes and that's why they shout "improtectingmyzhuquanandterritorialintegrity" while they rip (people's liberation) fingers off Armed Forces of the Philippines personnel and break their equipment. It's like piracy but because they have a party-state flag it's not.

All in all, just indefensible behaviour all round, but I mean, check this above comment out
Your defence of the Chinese "legal system" (a country which according to any metric has 0 free or fair judicial process) is very strange, almost suspicious... you are either very naive, do you know anyone or have you lived in a totalitarian state? Or you have some sort of agenda...
Just glossing over the korean war are we?
Geez, I've pissed off the tankies today for even bringing up that **China has placed an ethnic group in concentration camps in the 21st century**. 


Christ do you people even listen to yourselves defending this shit?
Haha so the concentration camps are closed, great work China. Just don't ask about the plummeting birth rate: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/12/chinese-uyghur-policy-causes-unprecedented-fall-in-xinjiang-birthrates
Yes that's the joke
We don't have any checks and balances over the US. The US has used Their military dominance very irresponsibly, China has done nothing but piss off their neighbours. I'm not that keen on any nation becoming a superpower, I just don't want my taxes paying to build America (and British) more submarines that we might not even get to use.
Well the dismissal happened because Witlam wanted to close Pine Gap so you're probably right there, as for the consensus thing, I guess I'm a glass half full guy. I firmly believe Taiwan will go the way of Hong Kong. Politically, from within.
you might want to be more confident before boldly stating such things.

you are dead wrong about how the international community views taiwan, i'll save you time, since you're so determined open those thinks and ctrl f one china policy. 

i am actually for taiwanese independence, i know and am friends with many taiwanese-australians, but wish fulfillment and reality are distinct. Taiwan is a government in exile and still maintains "Republic of China" in their constitution. So again, if china invades, their is no legal justification for international interference. there will never likely be an invasion though, either xi xinping will engineer taiwanese political allies to topple the government, which is unlikely or the old cunt will die the matter will be settled, and taiwanese independence if they truly desire it will be up to themselves.
> The vast majority of developed countries, including Australia and the United States, do not recognize or consider Taiwan to be part of the PRC.

"Australia's Joint Communiqué with the PRC recognised the Government of the PRC as China's sole legal government and acknowledged the position of the PRC that Taiwan was a province of the PRC."

"The United States formally acknowledged that "all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of China" and that the "United States Government does not challenge that position", and that it "reaffirms its interest in a peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question by the Chinese themselves"."

"In so doing, the United States recognized that the government of the People's Republic of China was the sole legal government of China, and acknowledged the PRC's position that Taiwan is part of China."

Sure would suck if anything you were saying were easily googlable.
The ROC of then is not the Taiwan of now. They have transitioned into a successful liberal democracy. They are an example of the defeat of facsim through internal democratic movements. Why the revolution happened is irrelevant in the current world.
I'm well aware of the 9 dash line. Tell me why you think it's worse than how France or the UK or America claim huge sections of maritime territory as falling under their EEZ.

Also China is one of the largest nations on Earth with its own nuclear arsenal, no nation like that has submitted to any international Court ruling that goes against them when they violate international agreements. This is why the UN has a reputation of being toothless, there are a lot of treaties that the big nations violate. China should respect their neighbours maritime borders, the same way Israel should obey the laws of war, and Australia should obey the Paris agreement. None of those things will happen, and I consider China's treaty violations pretty bland compared to the other two I mentioned.

What is your huge objection? Are you a Vietnamese fisherman or something? If you are then you're getting screwed by China, but if not then what's the big deal?
Yeah, it's the other world order, the nice one that has fixed global warming.
They're a tankie so their view of the Korean War will be that the United Nations were the aggressors because they didn't let the poor communists do whatever they wanted.
Yes I'm very aware that North Korea invaded South Korea. Are you aware of the events that precipitated those events? Are you aware of how the UN coalition led by the US conducted the war? The bombing campaign alone destroyed something like 85% of all buildings in North Korea. Or how MacArthur needlessly provoked China into entering the war despite their continuous warnings via Indian diplomats? Or the blatant imperialist division of Korea made by Russia and the US in the first place that made some kind of conflict very likely?

Also, are you aware of any benefit Australia's contribution had? South Korea wasn't that grateful that we helped the US impose the Rhee dictatorship on them.

China wasn't just threatened, the US violated their airspace and bombed China several times. The fact that you don't know this shows how little you've researched the other side's perspective of this conflict.
> what they didn't have were stable supply routes.

I think there's a plan to fix that.
Somewhat, but a blockade would crush our economy nearly overnight, but stopping trade doesn't achieve much long term as trade is global these days. Suppliers and buyers might shift around or middle men get added. It doesn't change much long term.
Oh Yeah fair enough 

Idk What i hate is there is no clear Good guys this time around 

Like I respect taiwan and want it to stay But am i willing to die for it?
So we agree that Taiwan is part of China, but Taiwan is separate from China. 

You crazy man.
Anyone who has been paying attention to China know that China's military build up has been happening long before Xi. previous Chinese presidents oversaw a lot of the R&D and espionage that laid the foundations for the military buildup under Xi.

For example China has been interested in aircraft carriers since the late 70s, but this isn't something you just figure out overnight.
>Things move really slowly in the world of military procurement. A decade is not as long as you think it is.

A decade is also not as short as you think it is. Especially when it's awash with billions in additional investment. The pessimism of some observers makes one wonder if they're actively wishing for this to fail.

>They haven't even yet been designed...

SSN-AUKUS is an evolution of the UK's SSN(R) project which the Royal Navy has been working on since 2018. Part of the reason why the RAN is interested in it is because of how mature the concept already is. The head of the ANPSTF, VADM Jonathan Mead [commented](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-03-14/nuclear-subs-chinas-military-expansion-aukus-jonathan-mead/102094202) on this back when the plans were outlined in March 2023.

And Osbourne Shipyard in Adelaide will be the ones building the RAN fleet, the design doesn't need to be 100% finalised for them to plan that.
Lots of people are getting downvoted for this entirely reasonable position. seems like there's a decent chunk of people who are convinced that Australia needs to commit itself to Taiwan no matter what - and the same people often like to point how scary China is becoming and how much of a threat they are... almost like the two things are related
What, they're going to let ignorant kids know the detailed arrangements of one in the most advanced and secret technology transfers possible? Every military project has intricate ties with industry, this project more so. 

The other point is you don't know anything about submarine operations at all. Not one tiny fact. Right? No conventional submarine will be survivable in the next 30 years in Asia. Australia has massive deployment distances that cannot be sustained by conventional submarines. They are essential to having a credible defence. But yeah you don't think we need them. FFS. 

What's your problem, can't handle Australia being able to defend itself? What's wrong with you?
You wouldn't support a democracy remaining independent from an authoritarian state? 


Wow ok.
Both things can be true. Yes we were complicit in some questionable wars and incursions. There were reasons and triggers of course, such as Saddam's invasion of Kuwait and actions against the Kurds that led to UN actions. Afghanistan can be seen through the lense of harbouring Bin Laden and the 9/11 masterminds. There was never a scenario where anyone harbouring them was safe and rightly so. Timor could be argued in the positive as the Timorese were being massacred by an authoritarian regime and had Australia and other countries not become involved, would have led to more bloodshed. 

It's all very nuanced and not as black and white as saying the US goes around invading places.
The difference also, is that the US leaves when asked. They don't invade and claim territory. If anything they aim for nation building and sovereignty. In modern times they perhaps haven't achieved that as they did in Europe and Japan, but then it is incredibly hard to overcome tribal grievances, warring factions and other obstacles to peace when they simply don't want peace.
Yeah, "they're too reliant on their neighbours for trade" was a legit argument pushed by people in the 1930s as to how Germany starting another world war was impossible. The same kind of argument being pushed about China today. I'm not saying that a war is inevitable, but the idea that it won't happen because we trade with them is hogwash.

Taiwan does not have an official "one China policy" and I went into more detail about the US policy in another comment to this post: https://www.reddit.com/r/australia/comments/1enkl6f/comment/lh8a5zt/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb3x&utm_name=mweb3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button
No, it isn't. You are mixing up the "one China policy" with the "one China principle".


The "one China principle " is the PRC position that Taiwan is a de jure territory of the PRC.


Most developed countries do not agree with this, so they have a "one China policy" instead.


For example, the United States does not recognize or consider Taiwan to be part of China. The United States simply "acknowledged" that it is the "Chinese position" that Taiwan is part of China. They do not agree with or endorse the Chinese position as their own position.


>In the U.S.-China joint communiqués, the U.S. government recognized the PRC government as the “sole legal government of China,” and acknowledged, but did not endorse, “the Chinese position that there is but one China and Taiwan is part of China.”


https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IF/IF10275/76


Here is the US position explained by Dr. Roger Cliff (Research Professor of Indo-Pacific Affairs at the U.S. Army War College) to a visiting Korean solider (1:18:55), followed by representatives from the UK and Australian government agreeing their governments take a similar position as the US: https://youtu.be/_20tt4tb0Ig?t=4736
Not to mention, if we include legacy nodes and solar grade silicon, China already dominates the market. I think in a lot of ways a monopoly on solar grade silicon (and lithium refining) might be an even bigger threat.
> That is the total and complete behaviour of a bully that knows their opponent can't fight back. It is also completely in keeping with the Wolf Warrior Diplomacy China tried to deploy through out the 2010s.

Yeah no shit. This isn't something new. Major emerging powers will always expand and big countries bullying smaller ones isn't something new. Even we do it all the time.

Back in the 90s under the Clinton administration, we and the Americans were openly talking about making space for China to flex. If it wasn't for for people like Howard to Morrison, we would be having an open and frank conversation about what a future in the region could look like. Instead we're at a stage where any criticism of a pro US stance is seen as unacceptable in public discourse. That should really say a lot about what's been happening to our foreign policy.
But your concern was that they would claim.control -- and they already do claim control.  

I doubt we will ever agree with one another on these points.
>That is exactly what I am saying and I genuinely don't understand why people struggle with that concept.

They're not struggling with it, they're outright trying to ignore it.

Because if they acknowledge it, then they lose one of their biggest talking points against AUKUS.
Point is that if China wants to fuck with our trade with China they can just stop trading with us.  No other weird steps are necessary, no strait, no Taiwan, no blockade.
> Supporting democratic egalitarian states in their independence is what other democratic egalitarian states do.

Bit hard to believe this given the history of democratic nations overthrowing the governments of other democracies.
>You're missing the point. Supporting democratic egalitarian states in their independence is what other democratic egalitarian states do.

What fantasy world are you living in? The one where Afghanistan isn't controlled by the Taliban and Iraq is a stable prosperous democracy?

Liberal democracies use foreign intervention for geostrategic and economic reasons. It doesn't bring democracy or freedom to anyone, and multiple military interventions have proved that point.

>Opposing an authoritarian surveillance state in its designs on a democratic nation is not a bad thing,

Again, we invade more Sovereign nations than China does. 

>We cannot adopt their values just because they say so.

But you're fine with forcing your values on sovereign nations?
> Opposing an authoritarian surveillance state

Yet our major ally is the US.
Because French nuclear reactors need to be refuelled every ten years. This requires a mature nuclear industry, which Australia lacks, so they would effectively have to go off to France every decade and hope that the French are willing and able to refuel them for us. If not, they stop working.

We wouldn't be removing a dependency, we'd simply be adding a second one. Because our entire defence force runs on American gear. American weapons on our boats, American planes firing American missiles. Army uses American tanks, we're replacing European helicopters with American, and we use American SAMs.

There's no world where, in a major war, we're not dependent on American resupply. The steps to break out of that dependency are a hell of a lot longer term and more complex than just buying some French submarines. We would need to either spool up an entire, enormous domestic military manufacture and R&D ecosystem (likely economically unsustainable without enormous government subsidies) or just choose another supplier to become dependent on (China, Russia, France or maybe South Korea being about the only options, maybe some kind of pan-european consortium of Germany, France and the UK could more or less get us there). I'm not sure either of those is realistic or better than what we already have.

We made our bed decades ago, and in reality it hasn't worked out too badly yet. AUKUS is just us lying in it.
AUKUS is about more than just subs, it includes partner access to programs like various hypersonic weapons, advanced stealth anti-ship missiles, long range SAMs and anti-satellite weapons, sensor technology and so on. The French can't offer that level of technology and systems integration. 
Because they require mid-life refuelling, which is complex and difficult. The refuelling would happen in France, not Australia. The US subs do not need refuelling at all.


The waste fuel also needs to be processed by the originating country and Australia is not willing to construct a large repository for high level nuclear waste like expended fuel.


The expended US sourced reactors will be stored at the present expended reactor facility as US subs. 
Sorry 'bout that.  I always meant that the current opposition, the libs, were in power
Wow you just figured out world peace! Look at this guy, the peace circle where we all join hands and sing Kumbaya worked! 


So totally not privileged and completely unpaternalistic of you to fully solve the issues that nearly all Asian nations have with China, by simply suggesting things that nobody else has ever considered.
Paul Keating is a China apologist on an unbelievable scale. Although you would not expect anything less from a bloke who went to work for the Chinese government following getting turfed out of The Lodge.

Their designs go far beyond Taiwan. They have both terrestrial and maritime disputes with every single neighbour  (including North Korea and Myanmar). They literally building islands on which to base naval and air force assets to control the worlds busiest shipping lanes adjacent to other nations' terrestrial territory and in their maritime territory. They have and continue to attempt to station security forces and military personnel and bases on our doorstep in PNG and other very close neighbours. They are an expansionist imperial power and their ambition stretches to at least the boundaries of our territory, yet we should just say that's cool, do what you want.
> In WW2 the US abandoned their own territory of the Philippines for the Japanese to fight in Europe. They don't have the best track record.

USA did the whole isolationism thing early during WW2 FYI. That's one of the reason they left Philippines. 

> The actual situation is that the US needs to start something right now - because even if China offered 100 years of the status quo it would not be accepted, as at that stage China and India will be the entire global economy. They win by waiting. I'm not sure who is Hitler in that scenario - but we should sit it out.

This is your assumption, not facts. The western world did play nice with China for a long while hoping they will play nice with the world. We reopened relationships, collaborated with many things through outsourcing and building up their economy but we got Xi instead.
That's not true at all regarding China, it's probably true of India though.


China is beginning to have the same demographic problems as Korea and Japan, especially after the one child policy, their population will start dropping hard and the majority of their population will be in retirement instead of working. 


Western countries have avoided economic issues through massive immigration to compensate for aging populations and low birthrates. The west has also massively increased military spending, cooperation and research, if anything China's time to retake Taiwan is in the next decade else these factors will start cause them to fall back behind.


India is a completely different beast though.
Correct, and I suppose literally every word of your previous comment is correct, albeit accidentally.
Lmao I'm sorry I don't recognise your username but I doubt I was the first to make the shill accusation. I just think Australians buy into pro American propaganda way too easily. I'm probably not going to remember you in the future either because you talk like every other Redditor and have nothing original to say and can'

>I love how you act as if not being pro-CCP s some kind of unnatural position to hold.

I love how there's nothing you can do when someone doesn't go along with assuming China is the new Nazi Germany. It's completely fine to be anti CCP, if there's some reasonable argument behind it. I'm anti US because we've repeatedly followed them down poorly thought out and often illegal military interventions. You're anti PRC and when pushed you rely on name calling and claim I'm implying being anti PRC is unnatural. It's projection.

>The answer to your question is pretty obvious, many people do not believe that being pro-Chinese like you and Keating are is good for Australia.

The polling shows AUKUS is getting less popular, and it wasn't that popular to begin with. Pointing out that our government recognises Taiwan as part of China or that we are more aggressive in our use of military force than China is just a fact.
Aggression-splain....right. If that's the term you need to use to consider the context to understand these conflicts then call it whatever you want. 

>or the time the CCP went to war with the United Nations to install a monarchy.

That is a hilarious way to phrase the Korean war.
Why do you think I'm defending their legal system? I'm defending their sovereignty if anything, which is to say I don't care what legal system they have, but they're entitled to have one. I can also tell you don't make any effort to understand China, and have no idea what metric they measure their own legal system by, and ironically think this makes me naive.

>you are either very naive, do you know anyone or have you lived in a totalitarian state?

I know many people from "authoritarian" states and visited some myself. You ever spent time in Singapore and tried to brush up on their laws? They are very serious about a lot of stuff I didn't think was that important, but while I was there I respected their laws.

>Or you have some sort of agenda...

Yes I have an agenda. I don't like AUKUS and don't like when westerners look down on "authoritarian" governments because it leads to things like invading Iraq. What's your agenda? Because if you don't like authoritarian governments that's normal, most governments aren't very popular, especially these days. If you want to work with the US to destroy authoritarian governments then you're ignoring all the times we tried that and things got worse.
Wasn't in the list, But sure, let's bring up Russia and America caused a horrific War in Korea That China got dragged into despite all their best at diplomatic efforts to warn MacArthur That his army and airforce are threatening or directly attacking their territory.
Lets be honest, when they image search Tiananmen Square, their fist image isn't a T55.
The same declining birthrate seen [across the country](https://theconversation.com/chinas-population-shrinks-again-and-could-more-than-halve-heres-what-that-means-220667)? But in regard to the Uyghurs specifically:



The [UN Report](https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/documents/countries/2022-08-31/22-08-31-final-assesment.pdf) mentions no forced sterilization of Uighur women:


> the illegal practices of forced abortions and sterilizations persisted in China”, despite “remarkable efforts by the State Party to curb” such practice


>regarding sterilisations and IUD placements in XUAR, with official data indicating an unusually sharp rise in both forms of procedures in the region during 2017 and 2018, in comparison with the rest of China.


Which is explained in the report to be due to changes in the family planning policy:


> In 2017, XUAR amended its regional family planning policy to permit people of all ethnic groups to have two children in urban areas and three in rural, thus equalizing the policy and allowing Han Chinese couples to have equal numbers of children as ethnic minorities. **The amendments also enhanced enforcement**, including through a threefold increase in the  
“social maintenance payment” payable by persons who violate the policy.241 In June 2021, in line with the new national policy, XUAR introduced the three-child policy for all ethnic  groups.  


Despite that, the population continues to grow:


> Overall, the Government reports that the population of XUAR grew from 12.98 million in the 2010 census to 14.93 million in the 2020 census, and that the Uyghur population grew from 10 million in the 2010 census to 11.6 million in the 2020 census, an annual average of 1.52 per cent


The sterilization isn't taking place to wipe out the Uighurs, but rather done in line with the family planning policy. While it is a controversial policy that many will disagree with, it isn't being done to wipe out the Uighur people as many seem to think.
The US is a democracy the US public is the check and balance and our opinions and stance as an ally can have an impact on that voting public. Is it the most stringent balance? No but it's more than zero which is the alternative you have with China. 

Piss of is a strong word for a country that has invaded and annexed its neighbours before and one of their neighbours they're pissing off happens to be India. Deterring Chinese capacity to escalate those kinda conflicts is generally considered to be a good thing and the US is the force capable to do that.
> Well the dismissal happened because Witlam wanted to close Pine Gap so you're probably right there

Just fyi, this isn't the "fact" you're presenting it as. There's some circumstantial evidence pointing towards US involvement in the dismissal and then that's it. It has never been confirmed, nor is it ever likely to be anything beyond a conspiracy theory. It's not farfetched by any stretch, but it's also not something we can just be presenting as if it's the historical consensus of what happened.
That would be my preference, but to me it seems prudent to prepare for disaster and hope for peace. 

If there is a war, and we're trying to be neutral, we will still be cut off from trade with China, and we will still ultimately only be able to be threatened by the United States, so being prepared for that future seems more prudent than going our own way and risking the ire of the Americans who have committed heinous atrocities, atrocities I do not doubt they would inflict upon us if they felt it was in their interests to do so.
Can you specifically cite what I said that is wrong? Sharing a bunch of links that support what I say isn't very helpful.


Most countries do not recognize or consider Taiwan to be part of China. They consider Taiwan's overall status as "unresolved". They don't have diplomatic relations with Taiwan, nor consider it part of China.


The United States and Australia "acknowledged the position" of the PRC that Taiwan is part of China.


They did not agree with or endorse the Chinese position as their own position.

Taiwan is the "Republic of China" and China is the "People's Republic of China". The ROC and PRC are two completely different and independent countries. An invasion of Taiwan is a breach of international law just like an invasion of any other country.
Exactly.

Mate you gotta work on your reading comprehension...
That is absolutely absurd. It's not irrelevant to the 1.4 billion people who are Chinese citizens, nor is it irrelevant to the 100 million members of the party. 

Why the revolution happened is also entirely relevant from the perspective of colonialism and neocolonialism. The West has dominated the world for 500 years, and while the period of colonialism mostly ended with the inter-imperialist WWII, the world has been dominated by western neocolonialism ever since. 

You have zero understanding of the world outside the western-determined liberal bubble.
My objection is that it's ridiculous and inflammatory and expansionist?  You don't think the other nations in that region are pissed off about it? Christ you're thick, just because something doesn't affect you personally doesn't mean you're not allowed to have feelings about it.  


Let's just say there's a reason why US Navy ships are now very welcome in Vietnam. If you can't understand that Asia is gearing up against China because of provocation from China then you're just another western chauvinist that thinks they know China better than anyone who actually lives in the SEA region.
> because they didn't let the poor communists do whatever they wanted.

20-24% of DPRK's population was killed in the Korean war, over 80% of their infrastructure was obliterated, you trying to pretend it was some just, necessary or even handed war is fucking disgusting. "Tankies" view on the Korean war is that it was one of the most atrocious campaigns in the world, especially when it was ultimately undertaken so that the US could maintain their fascist puppet dictator in the South.

But sure, pretend it's just people being pissy at the UN and not people horrified at the objectively disgusting events, much the same with all of the USA's other bloodthirsty endeavors that left literal millions of human beings, people like you and me dead for nothing more than wanting to continuously push their neoliberal imperalistic agenda and keep that needle going up.
> Are you aware of the events that precipitated those events?

Yes, I'm not claiming that South Korea were the "good guys" or anything like that. But in regards to the Korean war, the aggressors were undoubtedly the North.

>Are you aware of how the UN coalition led by the US conducted the war? The bombing campaign alone destroyed something like 85% of all buildings in North Korea.

Yeah, that tends to happen when you start a war and then refuse to capitulate when beaten. Just ask Japan what happened 5-6 years prior.

>Or how MacArthur needlessly provoked China into entering the war despite their continuous warnings via Indian diplomats?

MacArthur was a jackass, but he also wasn't commander in chief. He had no authority to unilaterally invade China unprovoked, and the Chinese knew that. He also completely ignored the Chinese when they were actually massing on the border preparing to intervene, so he clearly wasn't actually that concerned with fighting them.

>Or the blatant imperialist division of Korea made by Russia and the US in the first place that made some kind of conflict very likely?

Pushing the Soviets to get involved in the war against Japan was in hindsight a bad move, but we can't really blame people for not knowing how things would play out. The unfortunate reality of the situation was that the Soviets had the forces in the area to ensure that at least part of Korea would be within their sphere of influence (as Russia had been attempting to do since the late 1800s), and splitting it was an attempt to prevent the whole peninsular from coming under Soviet control.

>Also, are you aware of any benefit Australia's contribution had? South Korea wasn't that grateful that we helped the US impose the Rhee dictatorship on them.

While they probably weren't too keen on the dictatorship at the time, I'm pretty sure you'll find most South Koreans today pretty fucking glad the North didn't win.

>China wasn't just threatened, the US violated their airspace and bombed China several times. The fact that you don't know this shows how little you've researched the other side's perspective of this conflict.

I am aware of the other side's perspective, and I'm sure China felt quite justified to intervene to save their ally against the invading western imperialists (even though the north had started the war). What I object to is people trying to do everything to justify China's involvement in the war, while portraying the west as the brutal aggressors just waging a war because 'Communism bad' or something.

Atrocities and war crimes were committed on both sides, but at the end of the day, the west wouldn't have been involved in the war if the North hadn't invaded the South.
Or kill someone else?
Nope.


"One China policy" simply acknowledged that it was the Chinese position that Taiwan is part of China. It does not recognize or endorse the Chinese position as the Australian position. 
I'm not talking about R&D or general army building, I'm specifically talking about the exercises and placement of military assets along the strait. It has intensified in recent years.
As a general principle independent democracies definitely should support one another against totalitarian military aggression.
I'm sorry but I don't believe sending our navy off the coast of a hostile nation is defense, but you believe whatever you want, in the same way I don't believe the war in vietnam/Iraq/Afghanistan was in any way "defending" Australia. 

But sure let's do this with a nuclear power and see if we can light the world on fire this time round. Came close with cold war 1, hoping cold war 2 will be bigger and with more action this time round.
Yeah great, how many Australian lives are you willing to pay?

We did fuck all during the Arab Spring but let's take on our major trading partner and the biggest military power in Asia.

Even closer to home, we see India sliding into authoritarianism, are we going to start sending troops and resources to fund democractic independence movements? Gee I fucking wonder why we don't
What happened in 2022?
Taiwan does have a China one policy, and they can never change that policy because doing so would be regarded by China as a declaration of independence.  They must keep up the pretense of pretending to be the true rulers of all China.
And cobalt.
Claim in the sense of being able to enforce.
Something bad was done in the past therefore nothing should ever be done again.
Australia is not willing to build a high level waste facility. Hmm where could we put it? It's not like we have millions of square kilometers of empty desert......
No because I'm suggesting those issues have nothing to do with anything, they're not the issue.

The issue is that if the US loses control of the global economy they can't fund their military. You don't need a war to defeat them.

So that's why the US looks on anything that challenges their current role as an attack. But to tell India and China they cannot grow is not possible. There is no way to wish this away.
Yeah but you don't understand, they're not America so that makes it okay.

That's literally what the tankie position boils down to.
The US did the whole isolation thing during both WW1 and WW2. They jumped in at the end of both conflicts and got the world for very little. They left the Philippines without a fight because they were treating it as a colony... food for thought. That's why they didn't mind totally destroying Manila when they came back.

Yeah that's not true at all. We were happy with them until they decided to move up the value chain. That was never going to be sustainable.. not with China and not with India.
Massive immigration from where, praytell? Another way China doesn't have to do anything but wait - nobody is moving to China, nor are they welcome to do so, so they don't have that problem. 1.4 billion people goes much further than 25M, that's for sure.
It wasn’t even me you nong
>I just think Australians buy into pro American propaganda way too easily.

It's extremely generous to believe that there is any real thought behind your views beyond contrarianism.

>I'm probably not going to remember you in the future either because you talk like every other Redditor and have nothing original to say and can'

It's hilarious that you think you're original even though you're regurgitating the same talking points (that you now can't even finish) that multiple other users already beat you to saying.

You're pretty slow, in more ways than one.

>I love how there's nothing you can do when someone doesn't go along with assuming China is the new Nazi Germany.

You're the only one bringing up a comparison with Nazis here. The CCP has done more than enough that such comparisons are unnecessary.

>It's completely fine to be anti CCP, if there's some reasonable argument behind it.

There's no point in you saying this because you don't consider any argument against them to be reasonable. You've had plenty of people in this thread alone outline their issues with the CCP only for you to respond with your typical bad faith, disingenuous dismissals followed up with the usual malding over the West.

>I'm anti US because we've repeatedly followed them down poorly thought out and often illegal military interventions.

I think there's a deeper reason than that. Tankies usually don't have a chip on their shoulder like you do.

>You're anti PRC and when pushed you rely on name calling and claim I'm implying being anti PRC is unnatural. It's projection.

Projection, that's rich coming from you who's trying and failing to do exactly that in their reply.

It's not projection when you're literally asking another user if they even know why they hold the positions they do.

Yes, I'm anti-CCP. I don't know why it's taken you this long to realise that but I'm glad you finally did. It clearly incenses you that nothing you can say will change it.

When it comes to "name calling" it's just me treating you the same way you treat everyone else. Besides, it's not name calling to describe your personality, clearly my description has struck a nerve.

>The polling shows AUKUS is getting less popular, and it wasn't that popular to begin with.

It doesn't matter when its bipartisan policy. The government doesn't consult the public when it comes to military acquisitions, kiddo.

>Pointing out that our government recognises Taiwan as part of China or that we are more aggressive in our use of military force than China is just a fact.

And it's a fact that the government's recognition is not an endorsement of the CCPs behaviour towards Taiwan.

And it is also a fact that our increased military response to China is driven by their continuing provocations.

No amount of lies or misinterpretation is going to make China the victim in this situation.
You're right it is hilarious 

the Kim family is a joke and the fact that the CCP sent about 1,500,000 soldiers to kill the United Nations to keep the Paektu Dynasty as a pet is clown behaviour 1950s edition 

I'm entertained by the walkback though 
"Australia is more aggressive than the CCP" but we can't count the CCP aggression because of CCP approved reasons

Okay then say I thought like that, Australia has never been in a such a war, we're literally saints, we only fight with rogue states and illegitimate regimes and these don't count as wars no matter how flimsy any justifications might be so therefore the CCP isn't just orders of magnitude more aggressive its infinitely more aggressive.
Singapore is strict but not totalitarian like China or Russia is.

You seem to be very upset with the idea of criticising them, but what right do those nations have to persecute dissidents or throw whole minorities in camps? "Because you're a hypocrite!" Right, work with the US to destroy... as if that's a possibility with Russia and China. We need to regard them as a threat that's for sure. Because they are. Ask the Ukrainians.

>*If you think China, just simply locks up people for the religion or their ethnicity, then you don't understand their legal system,*

The Uyghurs are in camps because they aren't Han, aren't Buddhist, Confucian or atheist but are Muslim, and they're in a resource rich, strategically important area which has had some violence and terrorism.

Tell me you agree with this, or well, it can't be seen as anything else than a defence.
"Dragged into" is a curious way to describe willingly joining to defend their friends in north korea, who you know, started the war by invading the south. Sucha shame that hundreds of thousands of chinese "volunteers" had to die because they were dragged kicking and screaming (read: willingly involved in) a war started by their ally.
lol China got dragged into it because they sent troops…
Lmao forced sterilization isn't being done to wipe out a group but because it's part of the overall policies of the country, are you kidding me???


And you say we're just as bad as them ahahahahaha tankies never change
It's a democracy that elected Donald Trump. Those checks and balances don't seem to work that well, even when they do, how does that help Australia? You know China has their own forms of political regulations right? It's not an absolutist state. Australia has no influence over neither nations political process so it's a moot point.

And you know we have invaded more of China's neighbours than they have right? We've been at war with Afghanistan, Vietnam, North Korea, wars that went on for years if not decades. China invaded South Korea after being attacked by UN "peacekeeping" forces and invaded Vietnam for a few weeks, and gas disputed borders with India.

I don't consider taking India's side or the Philippines or any other nation having issues with China as good or bad, all of those nations have their issues, and the land their disputing is insignificant. It's a question of Australia's national interests. What do we gain from always siding against China? What do we gain from helping maintain the US dominance of East Asia?
One all-powerful party vs two almost all-powerful parties who agree about 99% of their policies and quibble over one or two social issues.
Check out the friendlyjordies video about this. He has the receipts.
so we've devolved into semantics. official standing is what matters not belief or intent. lets not behave like children with whispered promises. 

nothing i linked is incorrect, it show's there is no official support for taiwan as an independent country.
No I don't think other nations are actually that phased. These nations actually have bigger issues than China ignoring maritime borders.

The US and Vietnam have had a close relationship for decades and it's because Vietnam won the war. The Philippines has a much older history of a love/hate relationship with the US. The US along with our help massacred a million people in Indonesia. The UK forcibly displaced hundreds of thousands of ethnic Chinese Malays with our help as well, these are just a few crimes us and our allies have committed so why do you act like violating maritime borders are some great crime?

>If you can't understand that Asia is gearing up against China because of provocation from China then you're just another western chauvinist that thinks they know better than anyone else.

Who is "Asia" in this example? Just China's immediate neighbours? Except Afghanistan and Russia naturally, and North Korea, and Laos. Also none of the middle east if we include that part of Asia. The Phillipines jumps back and forth, Indonesia is neutral.

So by "Asia" I take it you mean India, Japan, Malaysia, and Vietnam? And I'm the western chauvinist for not assuming "Asia" is all against China and on our side? Sure.
>20-24% of DPRK's population was killed in the Korean war, over 80% of their infrastructure was obliterated, you trying to pretend it was some just, necessary or even handed war is fucking disgusting.

Yeah that's what happens when you start a war that you had no hope of winning. The North Koreans fucked around and found out.

War shouldn't be even handed, you should tip the scales to your favour as much as possible.

Are we meant to feel bad for poor Kim Il Sung because he failed at his little communist crusade?
Their navy is relatively new in terms of experience. Training and exercises were always going to be ramped up. In fact it's one of the main critiques of the Chinese navy, that they lack experience. You can't be surprised about this.

Furthermore it seems like the expected response to the US' military containment strategy. Remember the "[first and second island china](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Island_chain_strategy#:~:text=First%20island%20chain,-This%20section%20is&text=It%20is%20principally%20composed%20of,Malay%20Peninsula%20in%20the%20southwest)" were initially coined by the US. No country is just gonna sit on it's ass when it's major rival forms alliances with all the countries around you and builds bases there.
That was caused by Obama's pivot to Asia policy all those years ago. China intensified its military build-up after that. You don't stand around idly by when World Number 1 announced its intention to come after you.
I think generally yes, but we also have to understand geopolitical realities and that we share a world with a lot of different governments.
Sorry which independent democratic state is India threatening to invade?
Taiwan does not have an official "one China" policy and the current governments position on the matter is literally called "One Country on Each Side".


>One Country on Each Side is a concept originating in the Democratic Progressive Party government led by Chen Shui-bian, the former president of the Republic of China (2000–2008), regarding the political status of Taiwan. It emphasizes that the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China (commonly known as "Taiwan") are two different countries, (namely "One China, one Taiwan"), as opposed to two separate political entities within the same country of "China".



https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Country_on_Each_Side
What's the logistical difference?  Do they need actual bases in Taiwan to deter shipping there?

I feel as though if they wanted to shoot at or sink ship in the strait, they could already?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_involvement_in_regime_change

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_interventions_by_the_United_States

Almost all of the modern examples we were right there by their side, most of them not even "in the past", trying to pretend that this is some old habit that we've put behind us is absolutely goofy. Their point was that trying to pretend that we're "democratic egalitarian" in any form when the material reality shows anything but is just pure idealism and that perhaps you should question why you're willing to so earnestly believe that this time will be any different to all of the others - especially as they too, were "justified"?
Not willing, not unable. It's political poison. High level waste is also no joke, it requires careful treatment and monitoring.
Nobody is in an arms race to stop India apart from Pakistan, because India doesn't claim the Indian Ocean as their territory, unlike China and their 9 dash line in the SCS. 


Honestly, you really think you know more about China's intentions than most of Asia - who willingly host US forces? You think you have more historical, political and cultural understanding of China than Vietnam, who now harbour US Navy ships and buy US weaponry? 


This western chauvinism is insane, so many people ascribing innocent intentions to China through lack of understanding.
Tankie position or not, there is a seriously unhealthy adulation of Keating in this country. He is treated as a messiah when he was merely little more than an intelligent and highly egotistical politician who refused to believe the rules he insisted everyone else had to play by didn't apply to him. 

He is lauded for positioning Australia in Asia,and due to his hubris and one of his famous (I was going to say foul mouthed because that was his usual way but i am not sure if he actually swore in this one) rants, he completely destroyed any chance of creating a real and lasting bond between Australia and South East Asia. At a moment when we needed a statesman, he, despite all of his intelligence, chose to crassly and condescendingly lecture a leader amongst our aspirational peers, reinforcing a fear that Australia intended to replace the colonial powers and attitudes our northern neighbours had so recently shaken off.

He and, therefore, We had a chance to embrace ASEAN as partners and equals, yet he chose try and feed one of their number a pile of steaming shit. That moment handled with any sort of respect could have seen a unified bloc in our part of the world that would be its own balance to China. This in turn would have balanced our relationship with the US. Instead, he reignited all the doubts and mistrust that continues to plagued not only our relationship with ASEAN, but many of the relationships within ASEAN. 

And now, China directly threatens the entire region and East Asia and the Pacific, and our current government is still scrambling to clean up the consequences of his mess, and most of us don't even know it let alone understand why
India, China/Taiwan, Philippines, Nepal, UK, New Zealand, Vietnam, South Africa, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. In that exact order infact.


And I think you missed the point... Maybe I didn't present it well? When it comes to economic growth and productivity you want population growth in the working age population. Immigration is a solution to the trap Japan have fallen into where the population has aged and an extremely large percentage of the population does not contribute to the economy.


China is starting to have this issue as their biggest demographic are starting to hit retirement age and a low birthrate due to the one child policy means the generation that follows them is no where near as large. This will mean China's economy will begin to struggle under the weight of a large population in retirement and the generations that follow will struggle to support them. China's population is expected to halve over the next 75 years due to these issues.


The thing about all this is it means that they will not be able to support as large military budgets and output like they can right now. This is even acknowledged by the Chinese government itself which is why many people believe that China is massively increasing the size of their armed forces because it might be now or never in regards to being able to take Taiwan back.
Sorry. Assumed that you were a secondary account created by OC.
>It's extremely generous to believe that there is any real thought behind your views beyond contrarianism.

Great argument, never mind the many obvious examples of how our American alliance has hindered more than helped Australia, or the inconvenient fact that China has almost no history of aggression towards any nation apart from border disputes with their neighbours.

>I think there's a deeper reason than that. Tankies usually don't have a chip on their shoulder like you do.

No trust me, it's the whole "destroying the middle east" thing that I'm still hung up on.

>Yes, I'm anti-CCP. I don't know why it's taken you this long to realise that but I'm glad you finally did. It clearly incenses you that nothing you can say will change it.

Oh no way really?

I'm not incensed by you having the same opinion as every other Redditor, I'm perplexed at your incapacity to explain why you hold that position or why you object to my anti US position.

>There's no point in you saying this because you don't consider any argument against them to be reasonable.

Not if you're trying to argue why Australia as a nation should feel threatened by China. I'm not interested in why you personally don't like China.

>You've had plenty of people in this thread alone outline their issues with the CCP only for you to respond with your typical bad faith, disingenuous dismissals followed up with the usual malding over the West.

They tried and failed to argue about China being an aggressive nation and it's a very weak argument to say the least. Their human rights record also isn't a threat to Australia in any way.

This "nerve" that you've struck isn't about not liking my personality, if anything it's about the absence of any real argument. Americans I can understand at least, they don't want to lose their number #1 spot. You don't have anything though to explain why Australia is threatened by China.

>It doesn't matter when its bipartisan policy. The government doesn't consult the public when it comes to military acquisitions, kiddo.

Yeah it's a great process, and the lack of accountability and public debate is great for our country and taxpayers.

>And it's a fact that the government's recognition is not an endorsement of the CCPs behaviour towards Taiwan.

What is their behaviour? Continuing to claim Taiwan is their territory like they always have?

>And it is also a fact that our increased military response to China is driven by their continuing provocations.

Provocations like when ScoMo tried to get into Trump's good side by going along with his trade war against China?

>No amount of lies or misinterpretation is going to make China the victim in this situation.

No amount of asking "why" either apparently.
I'm upset at my own country's record on human rights, and how little Australians care. Hypocrisy is just annoying. Are you opposed to over incarceration of minorities? Because our government is one of the worst abusers of that particular problem.

>Because they are.

Not to Australia.

>Ask the Ukrainians.

What do they have to do with Australia? I can ask Palestinians what they think of Israel but what relevance would it have?

>The Uyghurs are in camps because they aren't Han, aren't Buddhist, Confucian or atheist but are Muslim, and they're in a resource rich, strategically important area which has had some violence and terrorism.

That's certainly a big aspect of the issue. As is the conditions of the camps and evidence of torture. If you think that's all there is to the police actions in Xinjiang then you've obviously haven't looked into any other perspective on the issue.

>Tell me you agree with this, or well, it can't be seen as anything else than a defence.

I don't agree with it, but I also don't know of any governments that have effectively neutralised Islamic terrorism without violating human rights one way or the other. That includes our own government.

Again why do you think I support these specific policies? I just don't care about your critique of them, and find it frustrating that you don't express your passion for human rights by holding our own government accountable.
UN forces repeatidley hit Manchuria, China Ward MacArthur to cut it out or they'll have to fight back, and he thought they were bluffing. He got fired for his "mistake" (or deliberate provocation depending on what historian you read). I don't care if you blame North Korea, defending their sovereignty wasn't why China became involved. They became involved because American forces threatened their sovereignty and routinely attacks their territory. 

>Sucha shame that hundreds of thousands of chinese "volunteers" had to die because they were dragged kicking and screaming (read: willingly involved in) a war started by their ally.

The actual shame is that Korea is still a divided Peninsula and it's 2024. And yes, many people lost their lives. That is actually bad. War is bad.
Actually their territory was violated and even bombed on several occasions. If you want to pretend like that's not an act of War then go for it.
Trump was a bad president, he got voted out. 

Xi is an awful dictator, he stripped CCP regulations to make himself president for life. 

Do you perhaps notice the distinction?

Broadly speaking Australians seem to prefer China not being the dominant power, autocratic basket cases being the main power destabilises everyone which is why across the region other countries share that sentiment and that involves engaging America in the Pacific.
Hurdur both sides are actually the same I'm very well informed btw
No he doesn't, he has the same circumstantial evidence that has been around for years. The fact that someone in the CIA referred to the GG as "our man Kerr" is not definitive proof that the US staged a coup here.

-Edit- You do realise that blocking someone who challenges your argument is proof you don't actually have an argument right?
The official position of the vast majority of countries does not recognize or consider Taiwan to be part of China.


Taiwan, officially the Republic of China, is a sovereign and independent country under international law.


Nothing you have provided says otherwise.
> Yeah that's what happens when you start a war that you had no hope of winning. The North Koreans fucked around and found out.

It must be a truly terrifying experience to live with so little empathy for your fellow man, I genuinely pity you.
Obama pivot only after China starts bullying nations around them. I am originally from Vietnam and remembered when they started putting islands and oil drills in our water and stealing our resources. US buildup has the tacit support of all those in the region, even historical enemies.
Have you not being paying attention to India cracking down on minorities and independence movements in the last couple of years, you had hundreds dead, internet shut off etc. They literally assassinated a Sikh separatist in Canada last year.
 yes they have the capability of sinking anything in the straight currently, but the US and others run war ships through there regularly as a reminder they don't want to try that. And, despite china's claims and lip service from other countries to a 1 China policy, the political reality is Taiwan is recognized as an independent country, including defence treaties, maritime zones and economic exclusion zones.

If Taiwan was invaded and fell then the logical conclusion to that is China now can enforce control of the straight. This is totally different to claiming control. Taiwan only falls if either the US abandons it, or China beats the US.

So currently there is a balance. China wants Taiwan, the straight, and the south China sea. But the price they would have to pay is too high. But if politics changes, and the US, Australia, Japan and others all say they aren't going to get involved, then the cost equation for China changes.

If that cost changes enough to make it worthwhile for China, then they will take control of the whole region and use the outcome of that to control other countries. 

I will add though that if China did start striking ships in the straight that Taiwan has a significant arsenal of medium range ballistic missiles which can hit a huge amount of China, including critically the 3 gorges dam. So without taking Taiwan first, China would risk huge counter attacks, and if the 3 gorges dam did collapse it would be a catastrophe far worse than even the largest nuclear strike.
Seems like the places where they win, the countries turn out pretty democratic and egalitarian compared to the places they don't. I mean I'm only relying on the evidence of my eyes.
India is just China with a 30 year delay. To think 1.4 billion people are going to sit in their current predicament is completely naive, especially when they throw democracy in the bin with Modi.

I don't want western anything.. you guys fight and both sides can buy all the resources they want at low low prices.
Don't you think it's a bizarre point to make that China is experiencing a demographic disaster while being a main source of emigration to western countries. 

For instance if Japan solves their demographic population by opening the floodgates to China, who do you think will be happiest about that?
Your comment is a real master class in how to say a lot while saying absolutely nothing at all.

>the many obvious examples of how our American alliance has hindered more than helped Australia

This is your subjective view, nothing more. Honestly, I find that people like to blame America for our own national choices a bit too much. We need to start acknowledging more responsibility on our part.

Don't forget that your darling boy Keating did nothing to try and change the nature of this alliance while he was Prime Minister.

>or the inconvenient fact that China has almost no history of aggression towards any nation apart from border disputes with their neighbours

Inconvenient fact, more like convenient bullshit lmao. Points for creativity though.

Funny how, for such a peaceful country you like to pretend China is, that they have so many border disputes. Disputes that typically involve large amounts of dead people.

>No trust me, it's the whole "destroying the middle east" thing that I'm still hung up on.

No, it's more you just seething because even Redditors are smart enough to know that your positions are nonsense.

>I'm perplexed at your incapacity to explain why you hold that position or why you object to my anti US position

I don't object to your position, you have the right to be stupid and I'm not going to try and take it from you.

But my position shouldn't need explaining, it's pretty obvious why I hold the position I do, the fact that you need it explained to you just tells me that you clearly don't have the capacity to actually discuss such a complex topic.

>Not if you're trying to argue why Australia as a nation should feel threatened by China.

I don't believe Australia should feel threatened. I believe that Australia should just be honest about the reality of our relations with them, that every element of Chinese culture and society is in complete opposition to ours and that the extent of our relation is a purely economic one.

We need to drop these delusions that the likes of Keating and you promote of them being a potential friend.

>They tried and failed to argue about China being an aggressive nation and it's a very weak argument to say the least. Their human rights record also isn't a threat to Australia in any way.

They don't need to try, it's abundantly clear to anyone with a single brain cell or a shred of integrity that they are an aggressive nation. If they weren't, they wouldn't pursue stupid shit like the Nine-Dash Line.

While yes their human rights record isn't really our problem since it's their citizens they're fucking over, it still serves as another example of how the CCP like to operate.

>This "nerve" that you've struck isn't about not liking my personality, if anything it's about the absence of any real argument.

Says the one whose only line towards people on this post has been "you can't explain" even though they've explained it to you multiple times. You have really nasty habit of projecting your failings onto everyone else.

>You don't have anything though to explain why Australia is threatened by China.

Everyone here does though. It's not our fault that you refuse to acknowledge it. Don't be salty because people aren't interested in your college student tier contrarianism.

The simple fact that China's values and beliefs are in direct opposition to our own is more than enough reason to consider them an adversary.

>Yeah it's a great process, and the lack of accountability and public debate is great for our country and taxpayers.

It actually is a great process. The vast majority of the public isn't informed enough to debate such matters, as you and others in this comment section have demonstrated.

>Continuing to claim Taiwan is their territory like they always have?

Yep. Such a blatant disregard of the Taiwanese people's self determination shouldn't be ignored.

>Provocations like when ScoMo tried to get into Trump's good side by going along with his trade war against China?

No, I was thinking more like the PLAN using active sonar against Australian divers while the RAN was supporting UN sanctions against North Korea.

Morrison is no longer the Prime Minister, you need to move on.

>No amount of asking "why" either apparently.

This is another thing that should be obvious and the fact you have to ask just further speaks to your ignorance.

I'll just repeat it again for you: *No amount of lies or misinformation is going to make China the victim.*
Can you give an example of the UN hitting Manchuria?
And I asked for an example..
>Trump was a bad president, he got voted out. 

And he could get voted back in, or someone else that would risk stability and peace in our region but still have the support of American voters.

>Xi is an awful dictator, he stripped CCP regulations to make himself president for life.

There are a lot of awful dictators running nations that we still manage to get along with. 

>Broadly speaking Australians seem to prefer China not being the dominant power, autocratic basket cases being the main power destabilises everyone which is why across the region other countries share that sentiment and that involves engaging America in the Pacific.

The record speaks for itself when it comes to China's use of military intervention vs the US. They sometimes have border conflicts with their neighbours whereas we helped the US invade Iraq and create a power vacuum for ISIS to fill. East Asia also isn't united against China.
Ok champ.
Little empathy? That's rich coming from the one trying to defend the aggressors of the war, the ones who started it by invading South Korea.

But I guess the South Koreans don't matter in your eyes because they don't have a red star on their flag. 

Next you'll be trying to tell me that Ukraine provoked Russia.

Save your bullshit for someone actually gullible, tankie.
Can you answer a question without a question?
I guess when you close your eyes you can believe you're seeing whatever you want.
I'm calling you a western chauvinist because you claim to know what's best for Asian countries despite clearly not having any sort of political or historical understanding of why these countries might not like China. 


It's a pretty classic move from people who reject western values and then fail to understand why many non-western nations prefer some of those values.
Modi is bad but if you think India is throwing democracy into a bin then you just didn't pay attention to the most recent election which is again a highly important distinction between India and China.
I honestly cannot understand the point you are making, and I'm not intending to be confrontational in this discussion.


> The actual situation is that the US needs to start something right now - because even if China offered 100 years of the status quo it would not be accepted, as at that stage China and India will be the entire global economy.



In my post I was addressing this part in your post and trying to highlight that isn't likely due to current demographic changes. I also wouldn't call it a disaster but more that the assumption China will tower over all other western economies combined is extremely unlikely.


And regarding military power the next 10 years might be the peak military power China has relative to the collective west because due to the war in Ukraine, western defence spending (mainly Europe) has exploded and their military capabilities are expected to grow massively. Obviously defence spending takes a years to see a return, but it has started now.
>Inconvenient fact, more like convenient bullshit lmao. Points for creativity though.

>Funny how, for such a peaceful country you like to pretend China is, that they have so many border disputes. Disputes that typically involve large amounts of dead people.

Which border conflict stacked up a lot of bodies to you? The Sino Indian war that resulted in a few hundred casualties? Or the Sino Vietnamese war that lasted less than a month? I just checked to make sure the Sino Soviet border clashes weren't casualty heavy and once again it's a few hundred casualties. So you're either referring to Korea or to WWII?

The reason China has so many border conflicts is because modern borders between states in Asia have been drawn by colonial or imperial nations from Europe.

>But my position shouldn't need explaining, it's pretty obvious why I hold the position I do, the fact that you need it explained to you just tells me that you clearly don't have the capacity to actually discuss such a complex topic.

It's obvious how you feel about this topic, it's just as obvious that how you feel isn't informed by any historical or geopolitical analysis.

>I don't believe Australia should feel threatened. I believe that Australia should just be honest about the reality of our relations with them, that every element of Chinese culture and society is in complete opposition to ours and that the extent of our relation is a purely economic one.

>We need to drop these delusions that the likes of Keating and you promote of them being a potential friend.

You wasted a lot of my time and yours when you could have just said this is all about Chinese culture and society. Another topic I'm sure you think you're an expert on. But once again we've strayed from anything relevant to our nations interest (in fact you're admitting that we have a beneficial economic exchange with China) and are back to talking about your personal feelings towards China.

>They don't need to try, it's abundantly clear to anyone with a single brain cell or a shred of integrity that they are an aggressive nation. If they weren't, they wouldn't pursue stupid shit like the Nine-Dash Line.

>While yes their human rights record isn't really our problem since it's their citizens they're fucking over, it still serves as another example of how the CCP like to operate.

No it's a weak argument. China is a powerful nation and they act like all the other powerful nations towards their weaker neighbours. Even then, China has only had border conflicts with their neighbours and you can pretend there were massive casualties but I don't have to go along with your fantasies. Also there's a lot of neighbours between us and China.

It's not relevant if a government is screwing over their people, you'll find that's a common complaint made about most governments.

Get better material.

>It actually is a great process. The vast majority of the public isn't informed enough to debate such matters, as you and others in this comment section have demonstrated.

I won't pretend I'm an expert, just a concerned citizen. Which usually should play some role in a democratic system which I don't think you value much either.

But just so we're clear, are you impressed with how multiple Australian governments have gone about updating our submarines to replace the Collins class? No notes?

>Says the one whose only line towards people on this post has been "you can't explain" even though they've explained it to you multiple times. You have really nasty habit of projecting your failings onto everyone else.

Would you like me to debunk your weak arguments (all two of them) again? We can if you want, I'm very confident in how weak those aregiments are. We can go through every border conflict in detail. Every one of the Taiwanese strait incidents, every day from 1949 to present if you want. You still won't find China acting aggressively enough to justify your position.

>Yep. Such a blatant disregard of the Taiwanese people's self determination shouldn't be ignored.

Then you're going to be real pissed at what Gough Whitlam did in 1972.

>No, I was thinking more like the PLAN using active sonar against Australian divers while the RAN was supporting UN sanctions against North Korea.

I don't like that they did that, not a fan of when other countries put Australians in harm's way needlessly. Like when our allies lie about WMDs and create a power vacuum in Iraq for ISIS to fill.

>Morrison is no longer the Prime Minister, you need to move on.

You need to understand how cause and effect and timelines work. I'm sorry it doesn't fit into your victim complex to point out our own governments actions.

>This is another thing that should be obvious and the fact you have to ask just further speaks to your ignorance.

>I'll just repeat it again for you: No amount of lies or misinformation is going to make China the victim.

I know man. The CCP that exists in your imagination is very important for your identity. I'm fighting the urge to make a 1984 reference about always being at war with Eastasia.
I can repeat China's examples, and the Soviets made the same claim, and historians have had pretty open access internal documents ever since the fall of the Soviet regime. Or I could quote the US pilots that explained how and why the violations happened from the book MiG Alley (1950s aeriel navigation wasn't that advanced) but I don't care that much and clearly neither do you. China wanted to avoid fighting a war with the US and allies right after their civil war, and repeatedly warned the US not to approach the Yalu river. whereas US politicians and military leaders were keen to provoke China, and ignored all their warnings. Historians are still undecided if the UN coalition was trying to call China's bluff or expected the reaction they got. Although MacArthur clearly didn't care or wanted China to intervene.
America might elect a bad president but democracy means they might not they have a choice. Better than China 100% chance of Xi until he croaks, you can say the American president is bad as many times as you want doesn't change the fact. 

Australia doesn't really have that many close ties with dictatorships, outside of China our closest would be Singapore which is slightly different, slightly better human rights etc. perhaps you're just incapable of thinking of Australian policy outside of America and just lumping in Saudi Arabia or the UAE as close allies despite us not having an awful lot to do with them. But even if you grant those ties there's a pretty significant difference between working with a distasteful government for mutual goes and said distasteful government being the global superpower that is dictating how your country and region operates. 

And yeah you just loop back like a broken record onto the same point that I first responded to. Plenty of other comments have exposed your unwillingness to admit to any of China's aggression, 20th century America never pulled a Tibet for example but yeah China lacks the capacity to fight war on the scale of the Americans that's not a statement on their willingness to fight wars. Countries across the Pacific do not want China to have that capacity.
