If Linda Reynolds thought this trial was going to to help her reputation I've got news.
Linda Reynolds always looks like she wants to speak to the manager.
Gosh yeah when your political party hires staff and they rape your other party staff and then you have the room cleaned and the AFP, under your government's watch, don't seem to do much for months ... Jeez it does get emotional doesn't it. All this "politics".

The emotionally draining thing is hiring and covering for alleged rapists. The only reason it was in the news is because Murdoch and the Liberals wanted to discredit Higgins, and also to discredit all rape accusations in the future.
ABC seems to be getting worse.  Did they forget about the rape?
As an average Australian Jo, I'd say this trial has lowered my opinion of Linda Reynolds.  Spectacular own goal, coming right up in the shadows of Ben Robert smith and Lehmann.
> The trial has also revealed the "catty" side of Senator Reynolds (her description) and reminded us of the infamous "lying cow" slur she directed at Ms Higgins while watching her TV interview with The Project.

>We've heard the 59-year-old admit she was greatly annoyed by what Ms Higgins wore at the rape trial, so she texted a photo of Kate Middleton in a similar outfit to the barrister defending Lehrmann.

>"Miss Higgins had a predilection for expensive clothes, including my jacket – and probably a little catty, being a bit overly sensitive [I commented] about her imitating Kate Middleton … going into the trial," Senator Reynolds told the court this week.

> She was also "incredibly angry" about the "unfair" $2.4 million settlement the government reached with Ms Higgins, so she refused to sign a confidentiality clause about it, instead leaking details of it to a journalist at The Australian.

It was when that settlement went through that Ms Reynolds kicked off -

I just can't understand how oblivious Linda Reynolds is to how her hatred of Brittany from the get go is so palpably obvious. She actually texted Lehrmanns lawyer regarding what Brittany was wearing to the trial.
Reynolds is about to discover " just because you can doesn't mean you should " is a true story.

I hope her upcoming loss and subsequent costs are life changing.

Absolute fucking bottom feeder.
A reality check about the sort of people that populate the "Canberra bubble". Ick.
She’s an abhorrent woman. 

Suing a rape victim who was under her duty of care for her settlement. The entitlement! It’s SO GROSS. 

Not to mention the narcissism it takes to think that those social media posts were aimed specifically at her and not, you know the endless trolls harassing Brittany?
Did you read the whole article?  When I started reading it I too initially felt it was very off but in actual fact I think the article is able freely to utter or emphasise some unpleasantries by its stated aim of giving ‘both sides’. (I’ll find the quote). -

> But it's not all one-sided.

>The trial has also revealed the "catty" side of Senator Reynolds (her description) and reminded us of the infamous "lying cow" slur she directed at Ms Higgins v etc.

The article then goes on to show how very unbalanced the power struggle *instigated by Ms Reynolds* actually is. In short, bullying. 

I don’t think you’ve given the article due credit.
May she lose and be forced to pay Brittany’s legal bills 🙏🏼
It seems she has very little self awareness.
90%+ people in the canberra bubble aren't like this at all
