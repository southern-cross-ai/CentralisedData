For context, My unit i rent is up for sale...well was up for sale, right now its under "Pending offer"

Found out via the real esatae app that my unit had been marked "Under offer"

Selling agent said couldnt say much, but would see me next day.

met the prospective new owner friday afternoon.

a 20 something yr old and his brother with parent who apparently worked hard to throw down for a depoist for the unit.

Im....happy for him if he manages to get approval to buy it, at the same time im semi jealous.

Also at the same time my hyper aniexty, autism and everything else i currently going through has been triggered to the point where fight or flight has been activated to where ive begun packing everything up.

The current rental market in Gladstone QLD, is a joke.

My real estate is pretty much adament they will help me find a new place.

Ive gone through so many internal scenarios that im gonna have to store my stuff in a storage shed and be homeless.

Cant move home with the boomer parent because she doesnt want me there.

I hate myself that i couldnt save for a despost for my own place. Im tired, im stressed, and im over it.
Your lease is still valid despite the sale. If the new owner wants to move in before the end of your lease, you can ask for compensation for all costs -- time off work to find a new place, costs associated with moving, etc. Name your price. If they don't pay it, don't move until the end of your lease. Easy. The law is on your side.

Also, do not trust the real estate agent, not a single word. From your post, I get the impression they've already deceived you re your rights, at a minimum by omission.
Do you have a lease? If you do, when does it end?
I just bought a place that is tenanted for a further 6 months.  I am unfortunately kicking out a mother and 2 children in 6 months as I don’t have a place to live and will be moving in.

The sales now gone through and I’ve advised them that they will have to move.  I’m not in a rush (lucky to have a couch to sleep on currently) but what I’ve done is offered them $5K and no exit/condition report if they wanted (no pressure) to move earlier.  This gives them time to find a new place, no overlapping rental payments as their last day here can be their first day there.  I didn’t want to buy a place that was tenanted but the only places for sale are investors selling their shit properties that they wouldn’t be able to sell in a normal market - there’s nothing for sale.  I even offered to pay for their bond upfront for the new place if they don’t have a deposit available.  I’m trying to be as nice as possible.
they are not going to help u just fyi. they say that to make u feel better.
Don't beat yourself up over not being able to save a deposit.

The last thing you need right now is self doubt getting the better of you.  Don't stress over the parts of this that you can't control.  Write down a plan and break it into manageable steps.  Work on getting the first one started on Monday.

Focus on what you can do and be proactive about finding a suitable outcome.  

You're not alone.  Most of us just don't want to speak up about our situations.
Have you been told you will be moving out? Or is it an investment for them?
>Cant move home with the boomer parent because she doesnt want me there.

Love how people bring life into the world and don't care if it survives or not after it turns a certain age. The guilt of knowing an adult child of mine might be homeless would dominate my entire body if I didn't help.
>My real estate is pretty much adament they will help me find a new place.

Unless you want to buy a house from them, you'll see their adamant attitude change pretty quick. But it's still worth following with them to see if they are managing any vacant or soon-to-be-vacant rental. 

It truly sucked but let's just unpack thing one by one: rn you still have a place to stay but you will unfortunately get on the rental market again and it is a Bitch with capital B. If you have disabilities, reach out to your current support networks and see if they can offer any assistance with finding another property and the moving ahead.
>Ive gone through so many internal scenarios that im gonna have to store my stuff in a storage shed and be homeless.

Been through that line of thinking when I wasn't offered a lease renewal, and the housing crisis had just started. 

I applied for a storage locker. There was a waiting list. I got one a few weeks later and started moving excess stuff into it, things I didn't immediately need. I got lucky, and got a new rental.

Then that got put on the market, and sold, by that point I was on the brink of getting permanent housing, and I still had the storage locker.

Get a storage locker. It will at least alleviate that part of the stress.
Usually when a rental place is sold, it's sold as a rental with renter. So the people purchasing are aware you live there and will most likely let you continue living there.

If there was an intent to evict you, they'd still have to legally serve you, the property cannot be sold and you kicked out. You do have rights.

Although I don't know your rights and the law, I do know there's some legalities. At the very least, you can contact the realtor or if you can, the new landlords, and ask their intentions, try and get ahead of all of this.
Start looking now so you get an idea but yes they do need to honor the lease
Do you have a lease?

Went through this with a close friend who lives in Sarina.

End of the story was, got a credit card and bought a used van, now in a permanent spot in the Caravan Park, temporary till she finds a place.
I've been homeless and trust me you don't want it do anything and everything to avoid it i wish you the best
My husband and I were in a similar situation (owner selling and we had to move). 

The only properties we were accepted into were 2 government subsidised rentals or a far more expensive (and much smaller) place that was with the same real estate agency we were with. We decided on the latter as it seemed like a more stable option. 

Maybe those are both options you can look into?
Dont rely on on your RE for any help. Theyre simply placating the tenant so the tenant does not become a problem to them.

They have no legal obligation to help you whatsoever, and considering most RE have to be court ordered to fulfil *actual* legal obligations id be looking for another rental yesterday.
Flatmates. com or FB community groups will keep you homed.
I moved out of Calliope last year and hoofed it to Melbourne after living in Gladdy/Calliope for about 11 years. 

I worked through the boom, saved heaps during the couple of years after the Curtis bust, but paying over $400/wk for a 4bed in a town with minimal opportunities outside of heavy industry just doesn't work. 

Might be time to start looking at a big move and starting over somewhere with more opportunity and a larger rental pool. That, or start working out how to get into the smelter, QAL, Rio, Orica, CA or out to the ports.
You actually are in a good position. If they want to get you out early for the new buyer, you can negotiate with the real estate agent that you'll agree to end your lease early if they find you something else. Just make sure it's to your liking and you have a new lease in hand first.
Your boomer parent should take you in until you can find somewhere. They are the ones who decided to bring you into this world afterall
Don’t hate yourself for not saving for a deposit. These days house prices are outpacing most people’s ability to save. The system is jacked, no point in hating yourself because some 20yo clearly comes from a decently well off family.
My unit sold almost 2 years ago, my lease continued and I've renewed a new lease. Only difference is I got a new real estate and my rent increased a little. 

Just because your unit sold doesn't mean you will have to move out, they could want a good tenant
I’d recommend looking into rent choice assist. I really can’t stress enough how helpful DCJ has been. Edit: This is in NSW, other states would likely have an equivalent. If you qualify, they help you source/pay for private rental. They also give you up to $3000 to pay for house hold essentials , you don’t have to repay them. They can pay over half of your rent.
Same thing happened to me 18 months ago. I'm still living in my car. Yes it's that bad . The thing is we all voted for it. Time for a new government
This is the very reason why I saved up and able to get a home loan and now an apartment owner. It is currently tenanted and breaks my heart to have the tenants move.
I'm so sorry you're going through this. Mental health stuff goes extra hard when your home is taken away from you (which is completely fair). I truly am sorry
I really feel for you and can't imagine the anguish these situations cause. I am very concerned about my own children, all renting in Sydney, and things don't look good.

Something you mentioned struck a chord with me, the fact it was two bothers. Perhaps people could look into buying properties as a shared expense with a couple of good friends.

I accept my comment doesn't help you immediately and I hope everything works out for you. There is always light at the end of the tunnel, no matter has dim and far away.
Find a share house?
Your lease is still valid until it’s up for renewal then they can say they don’t want to renew as they need to live in it. OR, worst case, is that your unit is their only housing and therefore can evict you.

The real estate will NOT help you. Our rental in Melbourne was sold. We were told 6 months in advance so we could move (we wanted to more anyway. Paying $420 a week for a shoe box townhouse was ridiculous) 
Real Estate said they’d help us then said “they had no places in that area” and to just apply to other rentals and they’ll call the other Agents and like talk us up. Never happened once. 

We had to move to regional Vic for $450 a week with a 4 bedroom, 2 living room house with a huge backyard. We got lucky but the original Agents didn’t help once
Are you able to move to another town or state or us that not an option?
This scenario happened to a relative. Thankfully she is on NDIS and so they have helped with emergency accommodation whilst she waits for public housing but has had to leave belongings in storage.
My new lease hasn't been offered yet.
I'm afraid I'll be in the same boat come November.  Good luck with it all
They all say they will help when this happens. They don't. Been there 5 times due to sales early into leases. I feel for you mate it's absolutely a joke. Do you need any help writing a cover letter for applications? 

 I also recommend trying to cut a deal with them that you'll be looking to move before the end of lease, as long as they waive the early termination fees and let you break lease without the drama and the return of your bond. Also request a positive reference should it be needed.
Going through the same, place has just been sold and gone unconditional last Monday, the whole time they were saying they will help me move into a new place as I've been here 10 years and I'm a no fuss renter, even was looking to buy this property I'm renting last year until a relationship breakdown stopped that. 

Tuesday I get a call from the rentals person with the REA, call lasted all of 2min 40sec and can be summed up as, no we won't give you referee details, just provide our office number, no we have nothing available for you maybe check our website in a few weeks. 

They won't do a damned thing for you.

Technically I could stay here until end of lease on 15th november - legally - but I've just resolved to be out ASAP and only need to give them 2 weeks notice during the notice period out to 2nd october. 

It ain't a great time to be a renter that's for sure but what else are we gonna do?
And . ..will need first months and bond for the real estate to help.  They say theyll help as long as ypu have money .
I can't fathom how a parent wouldn't want their child home. Especially when they are in hard times.

I would lay down my life for my children.

It's sad to see how little virtue there is in the modern world.
When this happened to me, the real estate found me a place and I moved quickly so the new young owner could move in. She lived there for a year and then rented it out to professional single men so she could live in a nice area. Otherwise I would have stayed there until my rent was up and not moved at all
It doesn't help but i have his fear in new zealand, my rent was reasonable at first but I dodnt realise it was because they were desperate to get anyone in after covid, when the market exploded the rents all hiked. 

I have autism, adhd, sevwre depression & medical issues and am PARANOID of becoming homeless. Like it doesn't matter what I tell myself I can't feel safe, I even have nightmares about having to move but not being able to. 

So I'm sorry you have the same internal stress & I hope everything goes well. It's amazing your rental people have said theyl find you somewhere else, that's unheard of here
Have you spoken to your parents to explain the situation to them ?
If you have a fixed term, you’ll be there till the end of it. Do you have a periodic lease agreement? If so, it’s 2 month notice so it should give you time to find an alternative place. If not, you can refuse to move out and claim financial hardship and delay it for a couple months while they take you to tribunal. It’s not all bad. Do you have a fixed or periodic lease arrangement?
Gotta try, Flatmates.com.au
I don't think this has been mentioned enough but Don't trust real estate agents. I would send them to the gulag if I could. Hope you find something OP
Seems like a lot of people have autism these days.
https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.realestate.com.au/property-unit-qld-west%2Bgladstone-435088911&ved=2ahUKEwi-4_iG_9qHAxUPh1YBHb8PFZAQjjh6BAgREAE&usg=AOvVaw0vFh73hkZhXYkC6MaEo-KM

There you go- $280/week. Problem solved.
Are you on the NDIS for your autism diagnosis? If so, speak to your support coordinator or LAC about the possibility of accommodation. It may be a long shot, but if they can help you, then it's definitely worth it.

Emigrate
Was in a similar situation when I was 23ish. Got kicked
out of a house because they were selling, was stressed AF, managed to find another place, awful place but a roof over my head, 11 months later they were selling up too. Couldn’t take the rental bullshit anymore, and made it my mission to work like a maniac to buy my own place, and a year later I did buy my own home. Use this bullshit to motivate yourself to never be in this position again.
That happened to me many years ago.
We were given notice when they hammered the For Sale sign in the front yard.

5 people sharing the rent.... one person only just moved in, so they stopped paying their share of the rent and by the time we realised no rent had been paid, the room was empty.

My rent doubled that fortnight.
Then the others decided to leave and told me they won't be paying anymore rent either.

I found another rental property, borrowed money to pay the bond and while I was looking for new housemates, I had some of my old housemates camping in my loungeroom.

Renting a shoebox sucks, but renting a bigger shoebox with other people becomes very expensive whenever you have to pack up and start again.

Get a co op of friends and buy something
What’s it stopping you from finding another rental?it is not easy I can understand but have you tried looking if there is any shared accommodation. Sometimes first home buyers just want a rooming arrangement in their home. You gotta be a bit careful when moving to a new place if you’re not willing to share with too many other people. Questions about how many live with and without partners and if anyone’s got any special guest visiting often helps narrow down. 

I know it’s not easy finding another accommodation closer to the city and it’s getting expensive every time you move but try maybe a bit out of the cbd. 

I personally did the same. The rent is more or less the same but it’s the commute bit that’s only an issue for me. 

Hope you find something better in the meantime
Yeah, if there's one single thing you take away from any of this thread, it's *DON'T TRUST REAL ESTATE AGENTS* . They are like the bad version of used car salesmen, and do not have your best interests at heart
This - OP you said your lease is until March 2025. You can literally relax and do nothing about this until March next year if you really want to. The agent can be annoyed but there is absolutely nothing they can do. If they sell it tenanted, the new owner can't kick you out till your lease expires. If they can't sell it tenanted, that's their problem, not yours.

That said if they are saying they'll find you a place, might be worth letting them find a decent affordable place in exchange for moving earlier than March. But have it IN WRITING. I'd be inclined to not do any paperwork about moving out until the new lease has a start date and is literally signed, because I don't trust them.

Edit: also, do NOT let them guilt trip you into giving up any of your rights, or rush you into doing paperwork early to be "polite" or considerate. You said you think you might be homeless soon - that means they either told you you've got to move out, or implied it and let you believe it, knowing it's not true. Extremely unethical. They are deliberately deceiving you and don't deserve any consideration at all!
When we bought our house in 2008 the housing market was rooted because of the WFC, luckily for us it coincided with when we were ready to buy. We found perfect place, bit run down as it had been a rental, but it was on the canals of GC so we wouldnt have been able to buy it if the price wasnt down due to WFC.

We decided to play hardball, buyers market etc, Did almost a month of negotiations, final price was a little bit higher than we hoped but still happy with it.

I can still see the slimy real estate agent, we had to deal with him for every counter offer, probably about 10-12 different offers and counter offers.  He had a young girl with him who was a 'trainee' help organise the communication.

Deal was done, we moved in and started cosmetic reno's.  About a year later my other half ran into the young trainee and she asked my partner how it was going blah blah.  My partner asked her if she was still working for same agent?  She said she left a couple months later because Mr Slimy was getting a bit inappropriate and she hated the job due to basically having to screw over buyers and sellers to maximise their commission.......and then she said something that made my partners head almost explode (mine did explode after my wife told me)........there was no negotiation with the owners.......the RE agent was just doing the counter offers.  The young lady said he only contacted the owners after we signed the contract and the owners were happy because we paid about $30k more than the owner was happy to sell for (according to her).

The whole time he just played us for chumps, there was no counter offers from owners, he just kept us on edge so he could get bigger commission.

I looked into reporting him but we had no evidence other than the ex employee and she wasn't interested in getting involved.

So we paid about $30k more than we should have and the 'buyers market' didn't bother the slimy prick.  In the end our choice paid off and the house has tripled in value since we bought it but fu#k I hate Real estate agents.
How shit is it that OP had to find out from a real estate app that the ownership of their residence has changed status. If REA's weren't all completely self interested bastards, they would have made an attempt at a phone call before updating the app...
I recently sold my investment property which was tenanted. We were looking to sell to another investor but actually sold to a first home buyer who needed the property vacant to claim the grants. 

Rather than cash payment for expenses we offered several weeks free rent to the tenant until they found somewhere. 

We also told the buyer early that settlement may need to move if tenant struggles to find somewhere. Legally you can't be kicked out on a fixed term lease except in a few special circumstances, change of ownership is not one of them. 

Our solicitor says what we did was pretty normal in that situation.

The sale contract of a house can include a clause to vacate tenants and it’s legal. It’s called Vacant Possession. The new owner doesn’t have to keep tenants but does need to give at least 30 days notice
March 28 2025
Your a good soul for that offer
You are a rare species...your kindness is outstanding!! 💗
You are a kind soul and I hope you get rewarded more than you get burnt by others.

Our rental sold, they then had to live in it but we just got a notice with the minimum requirement and a "we'll waive the rent from the day you hand the keys back as incentive to leave quicker" and 3 phonecalls minimum a week from the real estate til we moved asking if we'd found a place yet and putting the pressure one.

You went above and beyond and as a single mum myself, I would have been forever grateful for your kindness!

May life treat you well!
Some friends of mine are renting and their place just got bought - same thing. New owner offered to cover their moving fees if they could move out. They declined, as they had only been there a few months, and had only been at their last place 6 months and had the same thing happen! But they did start looking for a new place
You sound very nice but I also think it’s a good way for someone to walk all over you.
No need to convince us, champ.  It’s your property, do what you want.
And make you more cooperative.
They might. I'm in my current place because when the last owner sold my agent recommended me for this place to the REA (same company, different branch). If you are a good tenant they sometimes will actually help you out, it looks good for them if they can refer good tenants and help owners fill properties with people they can vouch for. 

Hard to say if OPs agent is telling the truth or not, but it's possible they are. It's also possible they are just saying that to make OP feel better, but I think it's too soon to entirely give up on the idea of getting any assistance from the real estate agent.
Well fuck
They might, if for the wrong reason. There's no legal reason to get the tenant out on the new owner's timeline. It'd be for their "real" customer's benefit to get OP to relinquish their rights in exchange for priority on another place.

I've been in a similar position, landlord wanted me out (although in my case, they were pissed off at me for issuing a breach notice over a broken heater), kept sending me completely invalid vacate notices. I told the REA I wasn't leaving before the end of my lease. They said to keep the peace, I could have first dibs on any rental on their list. True to their word, I picked one, no application rigmarole, moved at the end of the rental month. They even fast-tracked my bond return without even a final inspection, as part of the offer.

OP is in probably the only situation where the tenant has the better negotiating position. Take full advantage!
If they’re a good tenant then they are telling them the truth. Agents want good tenants so they will recommend them if a property comes up
If the buyers are getting the 1st homebuyers grant, they will have to move in. Obviously we don’t have this info but by the ages, I’d plan for it not being solely an investment property.
Its his first home for him and his brother, i believe the mother who was with them in a supporting capacity or whatever the term is called
The way she put it was "Look son, i love you, but i dont want you here, im entitled to have my place to myself" 

Yet complains about everything minimal possible, acts like a boomer karen and drinks maybe 3 bottles of wine a week. go figure
And that’s absolutely how it should be but most boomers couldn’t care less cause even with an autism diagnosis they think it’s easy to find stable work with a decent paycheck that will keep you off the streets. Kind of ridiculous…
Right? I don’t have bio kids, but I can’t imagine in a millions years telling my stepson that I’d rather him be homeless than inconvenience myself in any way.
Was told that I would be out of a home at the age of 18 from the age of 13. True to their word I was out living on my own very short after my graduation from high school. The next year was the GFC…. They refused to let me move back because they had downsized and wanted to keep their guest room available for guests
You don't know their story, it's not always the "boomers" fault. If a parent doesn't want their child to move home, it can also mean the adult child has issues too.

It's entirely possible he's a shit child too. We shouldn't automatically assume parents bad because OP is posting his side on Reddit. My parents would give up all their possessions to keep any of their kids safe and housed.
If you don't mind me asking, what made you shy away from the cheaper rentals?

Are you sure you didn't get screwed over by your current REA? 

eg "Let's put the price up and accept these guys, we know they've got to to get out..."
Buying property as shared expense is what my brother and I did. This was about 12 years ago. Both of us were earning average salaries but were able to save  enough to be able to put a deposit against a property. It was a semi regional area, and not the area  where we want to live. We put the property on rent, and loan repayments were fully covered through the rent. We kept it for 2 or 3 years and then sold it. Split the profit and end up buying our own individual house. We consider ourselves lucky as the property market went crazy and we were able to get in. I feel this is the way for people to get into the property market. You do need a reliable person to do this with.
hoping so too
This comment seems super irrelevant to this post and not very helpful. If you'd looked into the "why" of why "everyone" seems to have these diagnoses in the last few years - it's actually a very simple answer. It was under-diagnosed for a very long time because of the stereotypes and misconceptions of how someone with one or all of these diagnoses should present. And now it's not because society learnt and grew.
Truth.
You essentially just said "just get a better job / work more hours". Not everyone has life circumstances that allow for that.
This is the advice people need. It's advice that actually helps!
Spoken like someone who really has no clue what the rental market is like at the moment.
HR and Real Estate Agents - name a more iconic duo that everyone should have zero trust in.
Used car salesman but they gatekeep and profiteer off what should be a basic right in a prosperous country.
The key piece of information is that agents **work for the owner.** Not for the tenant.
This. REA are the worst.
Was the agent supposed to be getting you a good deal or something?
i haven't seen my mum in over 10 years. Not all parents love their children
Who knows what the situation is with the parent. Sometimes the best thing for a toxic relationship is to let it go. It’s far from an “always” thing.
Wow. How ignorant can you be?! I suppose you'd say the same harmful shit to me and others who were removed from home by child protective services due to our parents abuse. People who say things like this are filth. You are the reason people don't heal.
That is a lovely disney-centric worldview. In reality there are plenty of not so great people out there and all of them are a parent or a child of someone. The murderers, the child abusers. All.

I'd say "value your family, and consider the value of a strong relationship. Family can be the best, but your mileage may vary"
Stalling sounds like a better option than homelessness
Not in QLD where OP lives. It's 2 months and not before a tenancy ends.
Then you don't have to leave until then. Doesn't matter who they sell it to. If they want you to leave earlier they have to compensate you.
Then you don’t have to move out until the 28th of March next year. Don’t let them pressure you into moving out before then without adequate compensation, because you’re under no legal obligation to do so.
It looks like your REA has a lot of interest in getting you out of there sooner, so you should put him to work and not make it easy. I bet he's been telling the buyers that he will get you to move out before your lease is up. The ball's now in your court. You might even get a better place if you put enough pressure on him. Definitely don't accept the first place he shows you, make him sweat a little.
Thank-you for your kind words Bo.

I shouldn’t be a “rare species”.  It’s just the way I was brought up.  

I am truly shocked though that people are just out there to gouge other people for their money.  

I.simply.dont.get.it.

You can’t take money when you die, we’re only here for a short period of time in this world, why be a prick when you can be nice.  

Another famous old saying (true or not I don’t care) a smile takes 12 muscles and makes everybody else smile.  A frown takes 72 muscles and makes everybody around you a negative piece of shit and makes you look like a douche.
Thanks for your kind comments.

So far in life being kind has always come out on top.  

Yes sometimes I’ve been burnt, and burnt bad - whatevs.  I assume they had their reasons, or were in a tough spot - so be it.

I don’t take the bad as a lesson because that can lead to hatred and distrust and I would carry that forward.  I brush it off and don’t worry about it.

Things like hate, distrust, if you carry those, they only lead to more hate and distrust.  There’s some classic quotes relating to this, “treating hate with hate, only leads to more hate, the only way to combat hate is with love and compassion”….and yes - it doesn’t always work out and you get screwed over, but I’d rather live my life knowing I tried to do the right thing then not.  I’m not a wealthy person, far from it, I work a job for a little above minimum wage like the most of us, I’m a single dad to a 6 yr old and I want to teach him decent values that will stand the test of time.

Treat every occasion as a single occasion, don’t let past history change your current decision making - not everybody is going to screw you over like the last.
Sounds like a similar situation.  Respect to the new owner for the offer, even if it was declined that owner knew the circumstances (like I did) and hopefully had budgeted for it.
Possible.  However I’m generally the one that says hello first, lends money to someone first, falls in love first etc…..and sometimes yes I get burnt.  

That’s how I choose to live my life - treat others how you wish to be treated.
You sound like an asshole -- what they're describing is standard practice -- but at least no one will ever get one up on you?
I wasn’t trying to convince you.  I was giving my version of my events to the OP as they’re in exactly the same situation but on the other side.
He wanted to do the right thing.
yeh they literally did this 2 my friend recently and she was its all ok

then she was like wtf that bitch told me what I wanted to hear so I would play nice.
Their “assistance” will amount to showing OP other properties in agent’s portfolio. They’re not going to be doing any favours unless all other factors are equal.

Same happened to us, we got told the exact same, and still ended up vying and losing with 15 others looking for a new place (i.e. “putting in a good word” means absolutely fuck all. Nor should we expect it honestly, they are a business - need to see through the emotion).
I had this. Rented a place for four years till it sold, REA found me a place with a takeover lease and got me in before anyone else had a chance to apply. Stayed there for four years, and they had another place lined up when once again the property was sold to a new owner. I ended up moving interatate, but they were happy to help me out as I was a no fuss renter.
Hey, I'm also autistic and just want to say, I also have the very literal 'box all my possessions immediately' reaction when I'm experiencing housing instability.    


In some ways it's actually a helpful reflex because it means when it's time to go, all your stuff is boxed up. So if you're strugging and not in a place where you can deal with things (because moving is stressful even for neurotypicals), well, you've already got the packing done.
they send a text saying here's a place, here's a application come view it w the 60 other people who want it this weekend. 

property managers are not exactly the most reliable people out there as nearly everyone in the country knows.
They would have to move in to within 1 year to get the grant, however they can't force out a tenant with an existing lease as that is still valid until the end of the lease.
Where do you work?
I'll admit my own father seems to think the housing crisis is because people are choosing not to work and the ones that are the exception to that are just not trying hard enough/not resilient because "it was worse in the 70s".
Not sure why you’re being downvoted like this isn’t true or possible.
This is the second time we’ve had to move because the owner was selling (the last one being 2 years ago) so we decided it was better to spend more for the more stable option.

With the government subsidised options, they were a LOT cheaper but we had to meet certain requirements (which we did and still do) but we both have recently graduated and are hopeful to improve our financial situation sooner rather than later, which would put us above the threshold to qualify for these properties.

We’re sure we weren’t screwed over. We found our current rental independently and didn’t know it was through the same agency until we went to look at it. It’s one of many apartments in a brand new building, all of which are being rented for a similar price. Ours is actually one of the cheaper apartments at $490 a week.
If you have any option to avoid the govt subsidised places that's preferable - unless you have a high tolerance to people screaming at each other at all times of the day (and night), slamming doors in the middle of the night, stomping around, frustrated people hitting walls etc etc. 

But well done to OP for not taking that option - there's probably someone else who needs it more.
That's perfect.

Perhaps more family members around the country and consider doing something similar.
Well not everyone, I guess. But most in their 20s are in a fairly flexible position with a lack of responsibility. I actually downgraded my pay to $9 an hour as a first year apprentice, then worked like a maniac stacking shelves on nights and weekends to make the real money to buy the house.
I’d put it to you that most people do have life circumstances that allow working more hours. People are doing just that, because that’s what it takes.
But isn't this what reddit has being crying out for??? Investors to sell to FHB who then free up rentals because rentals are taking up by people trying to get into PPOR

Might be tempted to add employment agents to the list, who also profess they to have your best interest in mind. 

These “humanitarians” have one thing in mind, their pockets.
Don't forget car salesman
I'd trust REA over a HR manager any day!! That says a lot....
Themselves first. Owners 2nd. Somewhere in the depths of hell do they care about tenants
They do but if they have a good tenant who has had to move due to the landlord some do recommend places they’re advertising for lease to that tenant. They aren’t working for the tenant but it’s to their benefit to keep an easy tenant renting through them and also a benefit to the landlord to get a known tenant with a good history.
I disagree 100%. 
You've had bad luck. 
I've never had an issue with an estate agent.

I'm so sorry. Of course, I dont know the circumstances or if there's a chance of change, but I hate that you still feel that pain. For what it's worth, I'm sending you a hug.
This OP ^ ! 

Do not listen to the agent. Your lease overrides
And to be clear you don't need to agree to the compensation. You can just keep living there till the end date.
We've been happily telling people it's all about "me me me" for decades now.  
Apparently looking out for one another is just a "quaint" idea of a bygone era.

Thank you for your kindness.  It isn't an easy road to walk, but I'm grateful you walk it.
Agreed! 💯
> treat others how you wish to be treated.

This needs to be jammed into everyone's head. Simple things like putting feet up on seats on trains. No one wants to sit on a filthy seat but some still do it.

They lack folds in their brain. It's basic shit honestly. Sometimes we get a bit selfish but "treat others how you wish to be treated" should be the guiding voice behind decision making.

I've become hyper aware of this growing up with asian parents with narcissistic tendencies. They cannot imagine a world existing outside of their perception.

My sister had a sale start as she had 9 months on her lease and the agent organised the new rental in its entirety and made sure she could be gone for the sales campaign without her having to do much.
Same here! Owner wanted to move back in to our old place and real estate put us forward for one that was no pets even though we had cats and got us approved, don’t panic if they are adamant they will help they probably will
There are bad ones sure but I’ve had pretty good experiences with the agents I’ve dealt with. 
If OP has a good relationship with them and is reliable then it’s in the agents best interest to put them in one of their properties. Otherwise they could end up with problem tenants.
I definitely am not choosing this that’s for sure. Discrimination is a thing that exists, if you don’t fit in with your peers sometimes they will boot you on that factor alone. It’s tough out there.
it took me 3 months to find a rental. I was lucky I was in a situation where I didn't have a hard deadline to leave. Im so worried what will happen if my lease isn't renewed this year. I ended up finding my place through talking to a property manager on Facebook. who had a granny flat that hadn't been advertised yet. I don't think I ever would have got anything just applying for ads. There are too many people applying and they earn more than me. And I have a cat.
Lol the population of australia in the 70s is less than half of what it is now. 

Basic maths will tell you that with more people, there is less to go around. It's far more complex than that but population difference is a core factor. We didn't build twice as many capital cities in that time. We expanded and build up a bit but not by 2x.
Yep, 14 years later, and a qualified plumber now, I still work a few nights at the supermarket, and most of the other night shift workers work other jobs like I do. This allowed me to fully pay off my house at age 36.
Do you think that people just don't know how to search for properties online or something? That isn't the issue. The issue is that every one of those $400 shitboxes have 50+ people turning up for every inspection, and probably most of them also applying. There is so much competition for every single property and unless for some reason your application stands out above the rest, you have to be extremely lucky to be picked.
I've found that HR understand labour law a lot better than REA understand rental law. And rather than lining their own pockets, they protect the business from legal troubles. As long as our labour laws are strong and you have a union behind you, HR can be to your benefit: better to negotiate with an informed opponent than a greedy idiot.
By maybe 1%. Both are 100% guaranteed to do everything they can to fuck you over
In a market where you don't have lines of people out the door for a rental showing, that's probably true. But the care factor in this market is likely going to be pretty low
Found the property manager or agent trying to have good PR
Yes 99% of tenants have just had extraordinarily bad luck./s
I'm the same.  Only had great agents.  I think we are the lucky ones though,  so many horror stories.
My brother moved north for work and sold his old house. The REA was REALLY unprofessional.

As soon as there was ONE offer she refused to do ANYTHING else to see if there could have been other potential buyers. NEVER organised a home open or advertised one.

But the worst thing was that on one occasion, she left all the documents AND the key OUTSIDE the gate where anyone could just have helped themselves to a house. Fortunately my mum saw them and retrieved them.

End result - my brother had to accept a price that was probably lower than what he otherwise would have received if she had done her damn job properly.

Agents like this make pollies and used car salesmen look positively the epitome of trustworthiness. And there are a shit ton of them in the industry. Utter fkn leeches.
You’re cynical and you hurt people before they hurt you. It’s a sad way to live.
absolutely and in a normal situation u would think this would be the case

but we are in a a rental crisis and anything goes.
I have a good relations with my real estate and the propety manager, Im a on time renter and at best minimal maintence person
Oh I'm well aware. I work directly with people who are or are facing homelessness. Not because that's my actual job, just because it's now such a huge issue that it's dominating presentations.

Never ever have I seen that "informed opponent" to have a soul!
It happened for my coworker before the lines were quite so long. The real estate agency wants as little work as possible so a known good tenant is potentially better for them than an unknown. Plus they want the landlords to keep using them so a non-problematic tenancy makes the landlord think they're good and stay with them.

They might not all do it but some still realise that keeping a good tenant is beneficial to them so will try to place them in a house that's on their books.
Don't completely give up and get too overwhelmed.  Sure there are plenty of assehole REA agents out there, but you will always have more people online sharing their negative reviews and experiences then those who have had positive experiences.  Some of us have been fortunate enough to be looked after by REA when our rentals have sold, and they have stuck to their word and looked after us, and got us into a new property without any hassle. 

I hope this situation works out okay for you. In the mean time, try to look after yourself,  and do whatever it is that works for you to fill your cup up a little, and help soothe the fight/flight mechanisms that have been triggered.  I feel for you, and hope you get a positive outcome, either a smooth transition to a new property,  or no need to move at all.
😔
Let me put a scenario to you. Say a member of a 6 person team experiences the death of their baby. That employee takes extended leave and is considering not returning to the job. In the meantime, the other five members of the team have to pick up the team member's clients while they are away, about 7 hours of extra work per week. Two of the team members have children of their own and another has long service leave coming up soon. HR is bound to keep the employee's loss confidential and is legally not allowed to advertise for a new hire until they receive a letter of resignation. 

Is it wrong for HR to ask the employee if and when they would expect to return to work after a week of leave? Is the employee being selfish by waiting until they have grieved their child before giving an answer? I would argue that any action taken by HR would be seen as soulless by someone, so the only ethical action to take is one that serves the interests of those who remain at the company.
Thanks but I could rebut your justice seeking HR supporting scenario sub with literally frekkn' stacks of scenarios where HR have completely f$$ked people over for the sake of the institution!! All I will say is just because law says you can do something doesn't mean you should! 
I will not comment anymore on this as my feelings and empathy to others are staunch no matter what you write here.
