I’m always 50/50 on reviving dead or dying towns because if a place is unviable to live in why should we be spending money to try and keep a sinking ship afloat especially since historically towns and cities came and went. But i’m also aware of the fact that people can choose to live wherever they want and it’s nice to have a variety of place to live and not have everything crammed in one place.
