Currently recruiting participants for a study looking at how different styles of humour and ways of managing emotions may influence job satisfaction, burnout, and mental wellbeing for individuals working in the service sector.

To be eligible to participate individuals must meet the following criteria:
1. Minimum age 18 years old, or 17 years if enrolled at university.
2. Can read and write English.
3. Currently residing in Australia for a minimum of 12 months.
4. Currently working in a service role and have been employed for at least three months in this role.

For the purpose of this study, service roles are defined as jobs that require employees to interact directly with customers or clients either in person or online through video communication. Service roles include but are not limited to customer service, retail, front-of-house hospitality work, banking, law enforcement, healthcare, social assistance, and teaching.

There is a prize draw to win 1 of 10 $50 vouchers and it will only take ~30 minutes to complete.

Cheers!
"Research has shown that people who work in service roles which require direct interactions with the general public...use a variety of strategies to help them cope with their work roles."


They tell you the call is recorded for "training purposes", mostly it's for comedy value though. The Karens who call the wrong company to rant at some poor telephonist for ten minutes before she can shoehorn in a word edgeways, drunk guy who want to book a holiday in Narnia and the old people who asks your British telephonist if they can talk someone who speaks English. Every culture has a mythology.
I did my part
