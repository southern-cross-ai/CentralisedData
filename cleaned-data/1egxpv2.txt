I apologise. This is my fault. I pay to have a roof over my head, I pay for petrol to get me to and from work and I buy groceries so my family can eat. Sorry it seems I am the one fucking up the economy for all.
Heard this being discussed on ABC Radio on Monday. Normally, when inflation is high, putting up interest rates lowers discretionary spending. People have to put more money towards their mortgage and have less disposable income as a result. People are spending less money, and businesses have to lower their prices to compete. 

This works if most people are mortgage holders. This doesn't work if you've got a large cohort of cashed up boomers who are completely immune to the problem and spending like drunken sailors. That's the problem. You're not stopping inflation by hiking rates at this point because the people spending the money don't have mortgages. 

Older Australians are wealthier than ever on the back of spectacular investment returns. People working for a living are the ones struggling and you're only going to hammer them further without putting a dent in inflation. The RBA doesn't have any cards to play here.
Quite simply the government needs to start attacking the problem with policy and legislation and stop relying on the RBA to manage the problem alone.
Housing is killing most Australians bank balance other than the boomers who already own . The values keep going up the boomers have more equity and disposable cash so on a spending spree its driving up inflation and the only solution is to raise interest rates more whch drives up the rent . Every hard solution is avoided because its electoral poison , because we need to maintain way over inflated home values and its only heading one way
Boomers are getting richer and richer as their paid off houses keep increasing in value and higher interest rates increases their savings accounts. Meanwhile everyone else’s with a mortgage is getting destroyed.
The year is 2030, we are all homeless
Just keep fucking us from behind until we die.
Welcome to the world of the lower socio-economic Australians,  who have been living this nightmare for the last 30 years! But now that middle class Aussies are being forced to watch their wallet, it's the end of the world? 


Maybe stop trickle down economics? Or stop giving tax breaks to the wealthy? Negative gearing? Tax multi national miners properly? Fucking fossil fuel subsidies?! Or maybe stop using housing for investments? 


Greedy, selfish, hoarding, mega wealthy, tax evading fuckers, with so many properties that they don't need occupants for most of them, are pushing housing and rentals out of most working class peoples grasp. 


We should have housing for living! Not to exploit for profit. Inflation is a direct result of greedy cunts wanting more, and more profits. But its the bottom 65% who are paying for it!
We need to find a way to tax the consumption of the rich while sparing wage earners. Plenty of gen z & millennials getting absolutely hammered by cost of living and rate rises on decent incomes but unable to get ahead
>Of the top 12 biggest contributors to annual inflation, overwhelmingly the drivers are goods and services that people either consider essential (or “non-discretionary”), such as rents, building a new home, petrol and insurance, or things that have prices driven by non-market factors like tobacco and beer excise, and the cost of university and education.
Maybe it's time we changed the rules. You can't vote until you're 18, maybe we should change it so you can't vote after 65.

Put an age limit on politicians, as a middle age person I would like to see younger people being in charge of the country. I'm tired of old australians just looking out for themselves instead of looking towards the future of this country.
I think there’s too much of a generational gap in Aus. 

This year I am going on my first holidays since covid and it’s only because I got good holiday packages and I had pressure at work to use up some leave. My  parents go on getaways non stop and do a big holiday annually. Last month, my mum visited 3 states in Aus. I notice this among colleagues too.
We need the ACCC and the Federal Government to stop being so toothless and bring in firm price regulations and a super profits tax. We have to stop letting companies set unreasonable prices for any old reason.
If the RBA can't rate rise their way out of this, does it suggest that the government actually has to try and implement some policy? It seems so far that Labor have been acting like a timid mouse, afraid to actually change things in fear of burning their political capital, all the while burning all their political capital anyway.
We want inflation to go down, but we don't want house prices, the single greatest cause of inflation, to go down. 


We can't have house prices return to a reasonable price, because to do so would cause a million overleveraged mortgage holders to go underwater and lose their homes, and the broader economy would collapse. Not to mention of course that house prices are the basis of the wealth of many of the richest and most influential Australians. 


So we keep making the bubble bigger, because we didn't want to rip the bandaid off in 2019, because housing must always become more expensive. 


I don't see a solution that doesn't first do tremendous damage. 
Correct. It's an economy in need of government policy to balance economic impacts of things like rate rises. The idea that rate rises are really only impacting sub-section of the community, whilst others are loving it because they see massive boons on their savings is insane to me
Our market economy is based on growth. When the standard response to any economic problem is Spend More! and prices dropping or even remaining ‘stagnant’ is generally seen as a massive negative, it’s understandably infuriating when a section of society least able to take the hit get left to carry the can for inflation.
If the government is going to sit on its hands and totally delegate responsibility for inflation to the Reserve bank, they need to give the Bank more levers for them to adjust that target different sections of the population, rather than hammering young families with mortgages. Give them control over the CGT discount for example.
So as I believe it, inflation means there’s too much money in the system, so they raise interest rates to lower the amount of money in the system. You could just tax the people with the most money and put that money into making things like schools, public transport and other infrastructure, but rich people don’t like that, so it’s easier to just keep taking from poor people. So poor people are causing inflation and the only way to make it go away is make poor people poorer, got it.
‘Too many people are spending too much money. Quick increase interest rates’
Govt then pumps up migration levels bigger than ever…
‘The interest dates are not working. Too many people are spending too much money. Quick increase interest rates‘. 
Govt then pumps up……. yep you get the point.
It's interest rates or implement politically unpopular government policy to treat the root causes of the issue.
Basically we are in a housing trap and their is no way out that doesn't have serious, and potentially unfair, consequences.

I expect homeowners are going to shout loudest and call for interest rates to come down and keep inflating the housing ponzi scheme.
When people are being gouged for essentials, it is impossible for them to rein in expenditure.

I have no problem with price increases in reasonable increments, but I draw the line at price increases of 40%, 50%, and even increases in excess of 100%. These increases don't reflect cost, or demand issues, and can only be the result of corporate greed. We can't not buy food, transportation, utilities etc..

The time has come for businesses to be reined in where they are making unnatural profits. We regularly see Banks, Supermarkets, Telcos, making profits (not Gross Sales) in the 4 to 5 billion dollar range. Given our relatively small population, those figures seem extreme.

It is time for businesses to take some of the strain off homeowners.

But will any Government take action against its donation Cash Cow?
It’s almost like mortgage holders aren’t driving the continued increases to inflation. 

Who knew?
There are ways to take money out of the system without raising rates. Tax the rich higher.
A Fair Go for all Australians is over. And the politicians that watched this happen and did nothing to stop it and today do nothing still… need to be held accountable. 

Every Australian should matter. Not just the rich ones
I think one demographic people keep ignoring in these discussions is those who have simply given up on owning a property and are therefore just spending money as they see fit. Just as important as the cashed up landlords when it comes to the continued spending despite hikes
Is living costs really a hard issue to tackle? Otherwise why do we keep voting incompetent people into office. Please can anyone explain to the layperson on the street (me).
Welcome to the new zealand economy. At least you guys have valuable stuff in the dirt
Government don't care, they're importing rich foreigners at record rates to starve off inflation. Pretty soon all Aussies without family wealth will be homeless because there goes all the newly built housing stock. Look forward to dying an early death because the health system is also very under resourced. Over worked doctors will overlook serious health issues because they're burnt out, under pressure and don't care to investigate. 
Get ready to bunker down..
Capitalism gonna capitalism. 

A game of monopoly never ends with everyone being rich and owning property.
They need to raise the superannuation rate at times of high inflation as it takes money out of the economy and impacts much more people and also the money isnt being gifted to banks, instead it gets kept by the super member. Win all round (except for the banks).

Instead of targeting mortgage holders it targets all Aussie workers and will have a bigger impact on curbing spending.
Fully expect LibLab to avoid any hard decisions or apply effective measures against the segments driving inflation. 

RBA may mumble some hints about the actual causes much later but ultimately powerless
Rates rises really hurt those at the bottom.. those with money just end up making more money from interest.

There needs to be a bigger squeeze on the top end to stop their rampant spending.

There needs to be a squeeze on grocery prices too.

Capitalism is breaking.
Yep. We're currently on a fixed rate. Fuck help us in a few months when we come off it and have to pay hundreds more a week. Could even have to go back to renting and try to find a cheap shit-tip to move into, hope the landlord doesn't chuck us out again this time so they can jack the rent up.
They need to let boomers gift more $ without losing their pension.  It's been hammered into them their whole entire lives how crucial it is to get a pension for all the tax they paid.  We can't undo that mentality.  

But fuck me it's like max $10k per year (or around that) that they can gift.  Why not inflate that so they can?
The problem with all these arguments about not raising rates due to subcomponents of inflation is that they could equally be applied to not cutting rates.


Inflationary pressure is not benign at the moment, the era of low interest rates is reversing. That is a painful process.
[deleted]
Yes it is. Interest rates need to go up another 0.5%  to be close to the historical average. If you bought a home and you can't afford it after interest rate rises it's time to sell. You might have noticed "it's not a good time to sell" but that's because there are thousands of others who can't afford their houses because the are over leveraged also.


The market response is people start selling houses at lower prices, not more handouts for speculators.
Australians are struggling so let’s not try to get inflation under control. Genius. We aren’t all paying off loans.
Economy needs more wealth taxes,  That's what is driving inflation.
Just steal shit from the big companies
Pump the market with social housing
How many more millions did the Colesworth CEOs make  this year?

If that number was injected into the struggling communities would it make a difference? Obviously.

Billionaires are pathetic.
Interest rates are a blunt tool.  Maybe also get some multinationals to pay tax please.
I find rate rises so counter productive.

On the one side you are stinging the people who have borrowed money to do things (aka…the people that don’t have the money). They have to sacrifice.

On the other side. You are giving a high interest to the people who don’t need the money and are making a killing on their massive bank accounts (aka the older generations who have money to spend and spend more now…keeping the spending going and not slowing inflation down). 

What a stupid economy.
Yet tradies got a massive pay rise and say there aren't enough Ford Raptors to buy in Australia. There's a LOT of workers doing well and blowing money.
America looks to be dropping rates this should flow on effect.  I think rates will start to come down as a flow on effect
Another rate hike is needed to bring inflation back to 2%-3%. Look at [US CPI](https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm). They've been stuck at above 3% CPI for a year from maintaining the same interest rate. The same will happen for AUS.
So glad we spent $400m on the Voice. Happy to see Labor had their priorities right.
Yes I did chuckle at the ABS press release the other day when they said housing, food and transport where the biggest drivers of inflation. So, all the costs Australians can't easily dodge...
Those things are luxuries, cut spending selfish  peasant
I got much needed dental work done (work which will prevent further, more expensive work in the future) so I think I single handedly increased inflation for everyone in Australia
you should be ashamed of yourself
But the alternative is to raise taxes on the  extremely wealthy,  mining, gas, oil and corporate interests! I mean, that would be *unthinkable* to do that. You peasants just have to stop fucking the economy with your buying food to survive.
I'm sure you can live of bread and water now you've seen the error of your ways.
No mate, its my fault. I work on a farm. The cost for labour, power, fertlizer, fuel and consumables have risen that the price of our product had to go up which means you have to spend more for the same amount we got years prior. I'm fucking up the economy.
While they wont address the one fundamental flaw that is driving this inflation the boom in asset prices in the  property market. With one fix they could cut negative gearing that will cool down the boom and cool down the rental market. They dont want to use the most potent lever that they have. They will rather screw the ordinary people than touch the special investors and fix their taxation policy incompetence!
all these payment should be tax deductible. individuals income tax should be assessed like a corporations income tax.
Yeah, ease up turbo. If you keep eating for sustenance, those major supermarkets are going to keep having to price gouge. It’s reckless on your part.
Yeah, the data generally supports this too. A couple of months ago there was a presentation at my work from someone working in consumer insights at one of the big 4 banks. He gave a breakdown of spending in various sectors across different age brackets. Due to inflation, overall spending was always going to be up and that was the case even in industries that have really been struggling. But the two youngest brackets had cut back spending almost across the board. So obviously if overall spending was up despite the two youngest groups cutting back, the pressures are coming from elsewhere
Friends of my fathers earn $300k a year purely from rental income (mix of commercial and housing). They are mortgage free, interest rates will not affect them.
Yep. The rich (and it's not just "cashed up boomers") are playing a game of greed with our lives. It's all about wealth, and not giving a  shit about anyone else. They can afford ANY interest rate rises, so they'll spend way over limits to buy more properties. Then they use well known tax dodges to pay stuff all tax, in some circumstances even getting tax back!


I blame Reagan/Thatcher for really starting this shit, and Little Johnny for bringing Australia to the party,  a party that only the wealthy get an invite to. And our pretend media that are complicit in pushing the lies and misinformation that allow the rape of Australias resources and people, all for the profit of the few.
You nailed the issue here, the RBA only has two levers to pull, they can't fix every issue with the economy with those two levers, what we need is REFORMS, we already  have most of the issues identified and solutions proposed we just need to implement the things highlighted by the Henry Tax Review.
Yep the government needs to stop sitting back and implement fiscal policy to address this issue. Rate hikes are not going to work.
The rba has no cards to play is exactly right. They got themselves in this mess by no it hiking early enough. Now there is nothing they can do. It will be the wrong move either way.
This isn't really the premise of the article though. Retail spending is dropping as a whole. We are spending less on discretionary items. 


What's driving inflation is the increase in the price of non-discretionary items. Things like rent and insurance. 


And the rental crisis is driven by out of control immigration and a fucked housing market. 
Yep, you've also got a compounding problem too in that an increasingly significant portion of mortgage holders are landlords who just pass the cost increase on, which increases rent and gets counted as inflation.
Exactly. The one blunt instrument they have is predicated on a housing ownership system composition that no longer exists.
That's the nature of our demography. Goods and services are produced by the working age population but consumed by all of society. The ratio of workers to population dictates the rate of inflation. We are experiencing a decline in our working age population. Interest rate policy will need to be periodically adjusted upwards to rebalance supply-demand.
Yeah this is pretty much it, I often wonder if increasing consumption tax (GST) and reducing income tax further for workers to offset would be a better mechanism for controlling inflation in the current environment.
Given the government is trying to build its way out of a housing crisis by upzoning, raising interest rates also has the effect of reducing new housing supply. Higher borrowing rates means higher loan costs for developers, who either pass those costs on or decide not to build (in some cases by land banking until rates fall).

Sure, there's some downward pressure on home prices via reduced spending, but those can be offset by the above.
Yep, gotta raise taxes or peoples mandatory superannuation contributions if you want to actually slow inflation faster.

Government seems blissfully ignorant to these options
yes, ubi. the economic wealth generated should be shared to all citizens and not to only a few billionaires.
 Not just boomers. Anyone who got a house before covid.
why don't we try something new like increasing super contributions to lower inflation? maybe a variable contribution rate.
I think you should read the article because what you wrote and what it says are completely different.
Time to cut the pension? 😆
Yeah but wealthy boomers are a minority (wealthy) within a minority (boomers).

That just doesn't tell the whole story.
The price gouging of pandemic profiteers is the root of the inflation we are suffering, not "too much boomer money".


Looks like you've swallowed the narrative hook line and sinker on that one.
A ruthless inheritance tax
I believe higher interest rates make term deposits more appealing to non-mortgagees too. If they have spare cash that is, which I doubt
Not true it still works. It has worked so far to bring inflation down from 7.8%. 

It is not like labor will do anything. All we have are interest rates.
It’s not the boomers, it’s the governments lavish ndis spending that’s the problem.
The median voter is a home owner, so the government's optimal strategy is to pretend to address the issue, without actually affecting house prices. Placate the youth with first home buyer grants etc, which just adds to demand, while pretending to address supply. 

The problem is you have single owner households thinking they are Warren Buffett for buying a house decades ago and now fear the loss of that 'wealth'.
If people started blaming them instead of the RBA
Solution is to win the election and then immediately institute fiscal policies
If they already own their own house then interest rate increases actually give them more money from their investments
Yup. The housing market is by design. Thinking any govt is going to forcibly bring prices down is futile. We need a better solution.

Rental systems need to change to accommodate lifelong renters. We need arrangements made for critical workers to be allowed to live somewhere near their places of work.

Why are we trying to cram everyone into a few cities? How about some actual vision of how we grow outside of these cities?

So much could be done if we actually tried.
This makes sense only when you assume that older people with houses have the same amount of debt as younger people.

The reality is, most of these properties are either owned outright, have very small mortgages or are on a fixed term rate. Raising interest rates disproportionately affects people that have bought since the current rate hike cycle began.

This second group also got hit with a furiously hot covid market and a bunch of government incentive to go out and buy, and drained all their cash reserves to get into the market.

There are a lot of asset rich people out there with very little cash to spend in the market.

The current real estate market is being propped up mainly by immigration numbers. Last year there were only 163k new homes built. In the 22-23 tax year there was 518k people added to Australias population via immigration.

Interest rates will do nothing to change that base reality.
The price of housing won't be addressed as simpletons keep being told to blame immigrants rather than the landlord class. When the economy hands huge amounts of cash to the wealthiest they're either going to invest it safely (if interest rates are high) or invest in property (if interest rates are low) pushing up housing prices. No government has the balls to either admit that a wealthy few essentially dictate how the market functions or how reliant Australia is on immigrants paying tax to plug the shortfall caused by demographic collapse and Australians not wanting to fill certain types of roles in their own society.
Our mortgage repayments, while high, aren't something causing us problems, we budgeted for much higher interest rates - and indeed have our repayments set slightly higher than the minimum (otherwise you never get anywhere)...

The things that's killing us are either directly controlled by a government or overseen by some government regulator or another.

\* Insurance  
\* Rates  
\* Power  
\* Water  
\* Petrol  
\* Rego (srs, almost $600 to register a 300cc bike?! that used to be car rego!)  
\* Internet (Which I'd give up if I didn't need it for work)

This is where the bulk of our money goes that isn't mortgage.
Just implement a ban on raising rents over a certain amount per year and also tax the shit out of vacant properties before you raise the interest rates.
Reminds me of when every new Roman Emperor would add a new holiday to Roman citizens, in the hopes they wouldn't get assassinated (a simplification, but for brevity's sake, bare with me)...

A holiday meant a day off from work. 

Over time, citizenship was expanded to more than just native-born people living in Rome.

Some Emperors added more than 1 holiday. Almost every single one of them was assassinated.

Toward the end of the empire, there were more holidays than working days for Romans.
Exactly. The burden of fighting inflation is being put squarely on the shoulders of renters and everyone with a mortgage. Those with a small or no mortgage and savings hardly notice the price of their expenses going up.

The rich get rich the poor get poorer and like 90 percent of the new wealth is going straight to the top 10% every year.
It’s not even from behind anymore, straight up face fucking us.
They could at least give us cheap beer or weed to numb the pain, but nope, not even that
The beatings shall continue until moral improves
The beatings shall continue until moral improves
There are still plenty of boomers around who are going to shoot down any party that tries that into the ground unfortunately
Stop voting for liberals!
Couldn’t agree more!
Luxury tax on consumables like luxury car tax, land tax across all states not just VIC, progressive council rates on 2 or more houses owned (eg +x% for every x houses), plenty we can discuss and try but the thing is NO ONE who can initiate such changes are talking about it because THEY THEMSELVES will be impacted. Only if people had a longer term view where our society is heading currently…
I wouldn't tax rich consumption. I'd go for taxing the way the rich earn their money. Reduce or remove all the concessions and loopholes on rents, dividends, capital gains, SMSF contributions, etc. And ideally legislate against the massive discount you get from being able to funnel your income into an LLC in a tax haven somewhere. Make it a criminal offence with a hefty minimum jail time for anyone found to be engaging in or facilitating such an income structure.

  
Course it'll never get done.
It's a start but trust me, the really rich don't actually spend much of their money, they simply can't. It's why they continuously invest. What needs to be done is taxing capital gains at the same rate as income, and taking other drastic measures towards intense wealth redistribution. Free healthcare for all (including mental health, optical, dental and prescriptions), free education at all levels, investment in federally owned housing, combined with taxing empty properties and land speculation. It's not impossible, but it would require relatively radical government, which they don't need to bother with as they can convince people to blame immigrants instead.
I like how it sounds like tobacco and alcohol excise are primary contributors to the inflation above education here, yet the government is just like nahhhh let’s keep taxing the fuck out of poor because sin
> You can't vote until you're 18, maybe we should change it so you can't vote after 65.

Why?

> Put an age limit on politicians, as a middle age person I would like to see younger people being in charge of the country.

You are free to vote for younger candidates.

> I'm tired of old australians just looking out for themselves instead of looking towards the future of this country.

Plenty of young Australians are just looking out for themselves too.
In the past 2 years the ATO have been given more funding and powers to collect tax from big companies and brought in more tax from the oil and gas companies than was ever collected during the previous government. The QLD government have been taxing the coal industry and have a plan to use the funds to setup a new state-owned power grid (which the LNP are looking to destroy if they get elected).

Cracking down on corporate tax avoidance has helped bring the budget back to surplus, but companies have just driven up prices to protect their profits (it's no surprise that energy, supermarkets and insurance are reporting record profits right now). I agree that a super profits tax might be needed, but the last 2 years have shown that when big companies are forced to pay tax they just pass the cost directly to the consumer.
What about house prices? Should ACCC control prices for them too?
Price regulations for what?
Problem seems if you tax the super powers too much, they move offshore and Aus gets no tax at all.
Price regulations for what?
The primary driver of inflation is not house prices it's corporate profits.


Also you don't lose your home because it's value decreases, you lose your home because you cannot meet your repayment obligations. The value of the house only matters if you want to sell or refinance.
It's almost as if the economy works in a way that benefits those able to influence policy making. Nah, can't possibly work that way.
If the government cared about families they wouldn't have destroyed Medicare
Unfortunately you need to do both, just as raising borrowing costs disproportionately impacts mortgage holders while others walk away untouched, so would taxing only the wealthy.
You understand that migration was a hangover from Covid. The government has actually 'pumped' down the migration intake
I think so, but has blaming immigrants for the state of the economy ever been accurate?
>  making profits (not Gross Sales) in the 4 to 5 billion dollar range.

Given bank's deposits and loans are typically both around 100 times their net profit, then the spread between what they charge on loans compared to what they pay for deposits is about 1%.

> Given our relatively small population, those figures seem extreme.

The 'small population" is irrelevant, you have to look at the amounts of money involved, if millions of people each have half million dollar mortgages then the sums are in the trillions.

> The time has come for businesses to be reined in where they are making unnatural profits.

Except that they're not doing that, and for example for the two large supermarkets their sales are approximately 40 times their net profit is for every $100 of customer spend only $2.50 for Woolies and $2.70 for Coles. This has been consistent for the past couple of years and not much has changed during this time.

Rates of return for investors in banks and those two supermarkets is around 8%-9% on average and is about the same as for other stock market investments.

The only "unnatural profits" profits I've seen were the spectacular BHP dividends I got a year or two back when the iron ore price were really high. Rio Tinto paid quite high dividends that time as well.

> When people are being gouged for essentials

There's no evidence of that at all. If prices are being increased it's because the suppliers to the supermarkets are also facing COL increases and have to increase their prices.

>  those figures seem extreme.

Can I suggest you go and do an accounting course of some kind. It's not hard as I did four years of it in high school. That way when these large companies release their profit results you can then read and understand their financial statements and balance sheets and you can then discern the true state of affairs rather than making up wild speculation and hyperbole?
Pffft. What is this heresy you speak? /s
A symptom of the same issue
It is but that’s because they haven’t got a chance of getting a house. Not so much given up but I would say have come to the realisation that it’s not an option therefore, might as well spend what they have earnt. 

Housing is a right for people and should be seen as so - it should not be used so you get a receptionist as an example who has 4-6 houses and the first question they ask is how many houses do you have!!

Edit - spelling
Neither party has any real policies that will fix it. And are unwilling to try anything more than what they’re doing in case of political suicide. They’re  both as bad as each other and the minor parties have no chance of getting enough seats to try and make any changes. So it’s a never ending cycle of bullshit.
Don't worry, we gave that away for free :)
Maybe, but with all our dairy farmers retiring and no one else taking their place we are importing lots of NZ butter to make up the shortfall and this looks like it's never going to change. So, you have at least one export you can rely on that will probably only grow.
[deleted]
Not sure if this applies to all but doesn't increasing super rates not reduce net income? Companies increase your gross income to take into account the increase in super contribution.
I like it
Counter-proposal: Put it in a separate "inflation fund" when inflation is too high, and release it back to people when it's too low.
Let's lower rates, and in doing so increase the wealth of those owning million dollar properties. Then, they can use their increased equity to further perpetuate the housing market. Then the renters will surely be able to afford a deposit!!!

Another short-sighted and often parroted "solution".
Can't you then renegotiate the length of the loan and stretch it out further, that could possibly reduce your regular payments?
Pensions aren't exactly a lot of money, they are $29K p.a. for a single person and $44K p.a. for a married couple. If people retire after a lifetime of work, then yes, it's true that their personal investments and super are counted under the income and assets test.

Since the assets cutoff point for a [married homeowner couple](https://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/assets-test-for-age-pension?context=22526) is $1,031,000 then if you're over that limit you don't qualify for a pension. However, since the average return for a super fund is about 8%-9% p.a. then that $1M+ should return around $80K-$90K p.a. so why would you be giving away any assets as you'll probably need that money as people could conceivably live into their 90's, and that level of income would give you a really good lifestyle. 

Admittedly they wouldn't be pulling out all of that money each year and the rate they withdraw would probably be comparable to the married rate of Age Pension but the rest would just compound and probably their investments would outpace wages over the long term.
 
The only time it might be viable to give away assets is between the $470,000 limit where below that you get the full pension and the $1,031,000 cutoff point but if you do give any away then Centrelink maintains that gift for the next five years anyway. This is a reasonable thing to do because why should the taxpayer pay more pension for people that artificially give away assets that they could use themselves to provide them with income.
Rates were held low for far too long after the GFC hit, but business got their way.
If you are mortgage free and have a large chunk of savings earning interest, then the rate rise will increase your spending capacity.
House prices need to be less than half what they currently are to be anywhere close to the historical average. 

I'd gladly pay much higher interest on a loan half the size.
Yeah and where are people supposed to live then dumbass
Higher interest rates impact a lot more than home loans. It also reduces business spending and pushes up the unemployment rate.
> We aren’t all paying off loans.

Which is why interest rate increases are not super effective. GST increases would help curb spending for everyone.
With interest rate rises, people who are not paying off loans get pay rises on their savings which is INFLATIONARY.
Something like two million houses needed for that and at say $500K for each housing package then where's the money going to be obtained for that? Is the federal government going to borrow all that?

More importantly, social housing is subsidized housing with tenants paying no more than say 20% to 30% of their income which probably would be Centrelink payments. Since market rents would probably be $500 p.w. higher than that, then who would pay that $26K times 2,000,000 = $52 Billion shortfall? Taxpayers? I guess we could reverse the stage 3 tax cuts and hit them with additional tax rises as well?
I mean we could all just work from home like all the politicians and bureaucrats right? Why are you driving inflation by selfishly sitting in traffic an hour each way for work? Typical entitled bogan
They did not?!?! How out of touch do you have to be! Sorry I have to have shelter, food and get to work everyone!
I worked out that it's entirely feasable to eat out and from the supermarket if you're saving rent money by being homeless

Then I realised others had been doing this calculation already
The between the lines thing about that is that the housing costs are principally associated with Australia's cooked capital economy and undervalued labour economy. 

The RBA are pulling the only lever that they have. We need the government to start getting their shit together to level out the playing field for housing. We have housing stock that's sitting in short term accommodation to generate passive revenue and capital gains for investors as the market is corrupted by a system that not only fails to punish cartelling on property values, it rewards it.

The RBA is pulling the rate hike lever because it's all they've got in terms of a brake on the system and its theoretically also the best way for them to reduce property speculation and runaway property values. Property values that are fuelling the housing crisis, masking the economic woes of the country and being rorted for money laundering by organised crime - the same organised crime that is rorting the NDIS.
Could you link that to me, cuz that’s amazing, pretty much saying people existing is causing inflation.
As long as there is zero informed commentary on economics in the MSM, nothing will change.

The ABC requires expertise in musical theatre as a prerequisite for the jobs where you get to interview the powerful. 

Tax avoiding billionaires have taken all the assets, these oligarchs have literally nothing to do with their ever expanding fortunes than acquire control over life's necessities.
How does your overseas trip affect Australian economics?
BLASPHEMY 

IMMEDIATELY SHOOT this man he makes too much sense
The answer is staring is us in the face yet the media or political class never mention the effectiveness of targeted fiscal policy (ie tax).
Sorry but isn't that still food. Food is one of the causes of inflation. I will attempt to become a breatharian and live off only oxygen.
You are on a farm. Therefore you are getting fucked over by my insatiable desire to house and feed myself. You work longer and harder than most. None of the economic woes are your doing. If more of us lived like you do we would not be in this mess. You are a producer I am just a dirty consumer.
Wages have not risen in parallel with CPI, sorry.
Yeah see that is the actual hard part to crack, and monetary policy can only impact them in one way - through total collapse of the housing bubble.


For that guy to be impacted, his rental income has to drop. That rental income won't drop unless realestate prices drop substantially.  


The only way for realestate prices to drop substantially is to continue to increase mortgage rates until people with mortgages can no longer afford to service their loans and new buyers simply cannot afford to enter the market whatsoever. 


And that will be an absolute bloodbath. 


The offramp for this insanity was 5 years ago, but we've doubled down and now nothing can be done effectively with monetary policy without first utterly demolishing mortgage holders. 
Goddamn that must be feel fucking amazing. No stress. Just pure enjoyment of life.
If anything, rising interest rates means those who do have mortgages on their investment properties raise rent, then boomer landlords/agents can say “the market says rent is $XXX” and raise their rent too. Our landlord owns our rental outright but she still raised our rent beyond inflation because “that’s where the market is”
Yeah but are there enough of them nationwide to drive up the price of lettuce?
High interest rates can also take money out of the economy by investors seeking safer term deposits.

> and Little Johnny for bringing Australia to the party,

Bit before that. You can really point at Hawke/Keating (the latter in particular) as being the ones who brought "Third Way" - before Blair in the UK popularised the term - Thatcher-lite economic rationalism / neoliberalism to Australia.

(And if you really wanted to, you could even go back as far as Gough - in welding the modern Labor party back together, he created and entrenched the Left / Right divide in the party. And, while we've had nominally Labor Left PM's like Hawke since then, they've been beholden to the Labor Right for implementation.)
> The rich (and it's not just "cashed up boomers") are playing a game of greed with our lives. It's all about wealth, and not giving a  shit about anyone else.

that is the system we live in, everyone for themselves, and isnt it working out well /s
Keating deregulated the banks so that you could borrow off more than 1 income in a household. You can thank him for starting us down this path.
I keep seeing this mentality online… please enlighten me.

I got a decent job without finishing high school this year aged 20. I don’t spend much and can save a fair bit of income by not wasting money on silly stuff. 

I see myself as lucky, but nothing I’ve achieved is impossible for anyone else. To me this life is comfortable and good, I love Australia.

I guess I’m trying to understand what the big problem is?
They didn't need REFORMS, the government could have just done nothing instead of giving $20B per year in string free tax cuts. $20B a year would have bought a lot of social housing and means-tested safety nets - addressing genuine poverty directly. At the very, very least it would have removed the need for rate rises - which are now locked in. Action and consequence.
If there was enough slack in the system then they couldn't pass all the costs on.

Ah yes, all that “lavish” spending on helping the most vulnerable people in our society.
We do, don’t you worry. Our time will come.
But it crowds out everyone else from
 the economy . Who has the leverage and who has better access to and more access to more leverage? Not the renter.
What about their second and third investment properties that have a mortgage?
How does it? People default and are forced to sell at a loss.
>How about some actual vision of how we grow outside of these cities?

Yes. Like Japan, England, and many European cities. Who says we have to be the odd one out?

You know those conflict, right?

And is probably unfair to "non-critical" workers.
Uber for houses, we need something that fucks the real estate market the way “ridesharing” fucked the value of taxi licenses 😂
All those cashed up 2nd and 3rd  world immigrants coming from countries where home prices range from 20k to 300k ? Who then purchase 1.3million dollars homes have you seen them living 8 to a room in bunkbeds working ubereats and 711? instantly rich and getting mortgages on below minimum wages ? When even ex pat aussie. professionals come back from overseas are shocked at home prices
> The price of housing won't be addressed as simpletons keep being told to blame immigrants rather than the landlord class.

The price of housing and especially rent is primarily a product of supply and demand.

If there was an excess of houses to rent landlords would need to compete for tenants instead of the current situation where tenants are competing for rentals.

Immigrants are not to blame, it is the government to blame for permitting an unsustainable amount of them.

> No government has the balls to either admit that a wealthy few essentially dictate how the market functions

It seems to pretty clearly be driven by supply and demand.

> or how reliant Australia is on immigrants paying tax to plug the shortfall caused by demographic collapse and Australians not wanting to fill certain types of roles in their own society.

I guarantee there is a price at which someone will do every job.

Perhaps the wages being offered for certain types of roles are insufficient for Australians? Importing people to fill these positions puts downward pressure on wages.
Insurance . The climate in no longer "stable " and the prices went up cannot say we weren't warned decades ago but some " believe" there is no climate change  yet the proof is in the insurance premiums and record amount of floods ,storms etc add on covid gouging which should be regulated in inflationary times  but again half of politics in Australia doesnt believe in business regulation .

Rates all that weather damage needs paying for especially the roads , powerlines , drainage needs upgrading,  erosion from  months of rain , you think rates is just paying for the garbage truck once a week ? Add on gouging too 

Power went up once again because one side of politics sat on hands for 10 years while the coal stations fell apart and didnt build either new ones or build anything else . The price is going up because the power stations are beyond expiry date and  have an excuse to game the system by saying the old coal station is broken down even if they perfectly fine making billions extra plus gouging on top

Water will always go up even without inflation in a drought then flood environment  doesnt stop people from hosing down driveways and footpaths and its simply taken for granted 

Unless you invade oil rich state  Australia has no control over petrol prices even better they shut down all but 1 refinery in australia ? Theres always electric but that aint  cheap either . 
Seems like alot of these problems listed are a lack of future planning from the last 20 years funny that !

There are plenty more active younger people who might just start outright shooting any party that stands between them and not being homeless.

I would take a dozen angry letters from boomers about how their real-estate values have tanked and they have lost everything due to a poor investment over a single angry, out of work, homeless person in their 20's looking for someone to blame.

Unfortunately we are about to have an overabundance of both.
It’s an official Boomer Standoff.
Labor is not interested in solving any problems caused by the libs. Stop voting for them too.
And Labor!
This isn't a party specific problem. Every politician is guilty
I would say, stop voting conservatives. Liberal has lost it's meaning, and often confuses younger voters that see  American Liberal as left wing, while Australian Liberal rightwing. 
Yeah the first two statements are a bit off the mark but the third one has merit. It’s a bit less egregious for younger people to be looking out for themselves with the state of things, than it is for the older generations to be doing it. They have decades of life to plan and work for and god forbid they want to have children of their own?

The vast majority of wealth in this country sits with the older generations, they have less time left on this earth and the younger generations are literally here because of them. They then see the older generations doing fuck all except protecting their own investments and interests so in turn decide to look out for themselves. Why would you want to look out for the older generations when they are fucking SET and refuse to admit that it’s way fucking harder to get ahead nowadays? They don’t need our help, we need theirs.
Yep, and I'm saying we need to regulate against companies doing that exact thing. What's happening now is unsustainable.
Rent prices could be better regulated, yes. I believe there is now some regulation around frequency of rent increases that are allowed.

Free market capitalism in Australia is a fallacy, we have the most concentrated markets and industries in the world, resulting in basically no competition across the board. Price regulation and divestiture powers will be the only things that save us from being an absolute hellscape.
we had rent controls until the 70's or 80s and no housing crisis. why not go back to what worked in the past
Staples. Petrol, food, water, internet, public transport.
The data from the report shows housing costs as being the single largest driver of inflation in the last 12 months. Let's just work with that now. 


And theres a misunderstanding with my comment. House price decreases don't cause foreclosures, but any monetary policy setting that would decrease house prices would obliterate mortgagees. 


House prices only decrease when people can no longer afford to pay the ludicrous sums of money being thrown about for housing.  


This happens one of two ways, either through 1. increased and sustained high interest rates that make it so people are simply unable to purchase at these prices, or 2. Through a general economic downturn (job losses mean less people able to save and buy a house).


If either of these two factors to occur, mortgage holders will be under incredible financial stress from trying to service their loans, ans that could see hundreds of thousands of foreclosures. 
Medicare was killed by a government that was ideologically opposed to it
Don't try it on these subs man, I'm an economist and people have no clue what immigration does for this country. Sure it adds to housing demand, but the problem with housing isn't immigration, it's zoning regulations/land release and people's speculation against that limited supply. That and the median voter wants house prices to rise, so the government makes it so, people struggle with dunning-kruger a lot, they see immigrations and they don't like it at a human level, then conservative governments play on this fear. 

Australia can literally pick and choose who comes here, we tend to pick young 20 somethings with a whole working life ahead of them, we can also specify their level of education. More educated people is better for everyone.

The literature is pretty clear, immigration to smooth out your population is beneficial to the average worker. Assuming they are educated to at least the same or improved level, they immigrate equally among professions and they immigrate younger 20 somethings.

It's pretty clear cut that it is good for the country in general, people just need to demand education standards are high and it is equally distributed among professions.
I think we all understand the government's communicated rationale for the level migration. I assume what the person you replied to was getting at is that the government's suite of policies has some unbalanced, opposing policies generating negative effects in the economy.
I am not blaming migrants. I am blaming bad govt policy. If the shoe was on the other foot I would want to do the same as those people.
No it hasn't been, but the people down voting you are not experts so don't worry about it.
> There's no evidence of that at all. If prices are being increased it's because the suppliers to the supermarkets are also facing COL increases and have to increase their prices.

Well we wouldn't know because the probe into whether it's happening or not was struck down by both major parties.

Yes. It's modern day feudalism. Land owners having the power.
Hey mate, the point is to take money out of the economy and make it more equitable. At the moment we only penalise mortgage holders as its the only tool they have they keep telling us. 

There are only \~6.5m mortgage holders but \~11m tax payers - it broadens impact while getting to keep the money in the long run. Boomers who live off passive income would be just as impacted as PAYE employees making it much more equitable.

Case in point, my parents who are mortgage free cant spend quickly enough & they counteract mortgage holders - its pretty fucked TBH.
My point isn't to lower rates as much as to squeeze the rich in other ways to stop the growth.

Higher taxes on more houses owned is a start. Make having more than two homes uneconomical.
It's already pretty long, 30 years. And I'm in my 40s. We'll probably pay it off just before I retire as it is.
Interest rates don't just impact individuals, they also curtail corporate spending.
In a house they can afford? Shovelling taxpayer handouts on the bonfire is not helping and taxpayers are not on the hook for any price corrections speculators face. dumbass.

Politicians and Bureaucrats don't have to worry about inflation. They just vote themselves more money. They get transportation and lodging at taxpayer expense, even when they are paying rent to themselves.

The Head of the Reserve Bank earns in excess of $1.1 million/year. I'm sure she really suffers inflationary pressure.
Acknowledging the causes of inflation isn't a moral judgement by the ABS or RBA it's a measurement of reality. Inflation is often broken down into discretionary and non-discretionary items such as housing and food.


The RBA and ABS don't control housing supply or rent prices but they can measure the impact it has economically and report on that. That's all they're doing when they say those things are driving inflation.
Food, transport or rent: Pick any two.
They could openly acknowledge their lever sucks, say it seems to be maintaining inflation as the price gouges don’t respond to rate rises and implore the governments to price cap things like groceries and housing. 

The lever is shiny but they don’t need to touch it.
Yes, well, that's what an increasing population does:

You're allowed food if it's otherwise considered a waste product that has to be disposed of, personally I've found licking the grime from the roads has a surprisingly large amount of nutrients in it *and* saves the city council money on street sweepers.
It’s a bloodbath that needed to happen 15 years ago, protecting one asset class has destroyed the country.
You can increase taxes on investment properties, it will drive down prices as people divest, which will lead to negative equity for a good chunk of mortgage holders, but not the same level of bloodbath as interest rate hikes.
>Yeah see that is the actual hard part to crack, and monetary policy can only impact them in one way - through total collapse of the housing bubble.

There are two groups that can try and tackle this problem, the reserve bank and parliament. The reserve bank has one tool in the toolkit and it isn't working. The government is too afraid to put in policy and is relying on the reserve bank. This also allows the government to blame the reserve bank for not being able to solve the problem.
In fact, if interest rates rise, people like this just end up with more money because their managing Real Estate agents will just raise the rents because 'market went up'.
If you leave high inflation but have policies that keep housing prices static, you can devalue the investments vs incomes without having the bloodbath you describe. Mortgage holders will actually benefit as long as we're rises happen in line with inflation. 

You'd devalue the dollar significantly but that seems ok as long as wages rise to match?
The crazy thing is alot of them watch so much Fox-esque news that they are stressed anyway about dumb shit.
It probably doesn't feel as good as you think. They are probably stressed about having to ensure it doesn't go away and fear those that could do it! 

I know some folks thru friends of friends and they are endlessly complaining about how to keep up with their investment properties. They are the most stressed people I know and they have no end game other than "buy more property!".

Having a home you own and the mortgage paid off seems the be the sweet spot for contentment, everything beyond that starts to look like greed very quickly. But they don't see it like that as everyone things they are a vessel of virtue.
> Our landlord owns our rental outright but she still raised our rent beyond inflation because “that’s where the market is”

And yet they get incredibly upset when you call them leeches.
No Australian PM did more to take from the poor to give to the rich than little johnny. Conflating common sense economic and tax changes that Hawke/Keating brought in, is not in the same boat that the Coalition decided to float. Real inequality started under  Howard, and made worse by every conservative government that followed. Gough, Hawke and Keating made us a real economy on the global stage. Howard simply took advantage of the work already done, creating a truly divided nation.
At that age, I'm guessing you're living with your parents?

The problem is one you have no perspective on. "I have it good, what are these people are whinging about?"

Sky-rocketing cost of living, after a decade of sub-inflation (aka a pay cut in real terms) wage "growth".
>Action and consequence.

I agree, and inactions also has consequences, we have a housing and cost of living crisis because the LNP sat there for a decade doing nothing. Why cant we have reforms? It seems like the governments are so scared of actual leadership?
Bracket creep is real and does need to be addressed. Ideally permanently indexed by some metric.
Colluding oligopolists everywhere in energy, retail, airlines and the government does nothing. People who still recite the "inflation because covid stimulus/too much boomer money" mantra are a concern...
They just pass those on the tenants by jacking up their rents.

Australia’s economy has been rigged by neoliberals to screw people who earn their income from work and subsidise those who earn income from investments.
What about them? They either pass the rate rise along to their renters or cash in on their 100% equity growth over the last 4 years
That's what negative gearing is for.
[deleted]
I wouldn't use England as an example, outside of a small handful of very large cities the entire place has been left to rot since the 1980s, as they're following the same forced American neoliberal capitalist model that you guys are, but worse. See Macquarie bank and the rivers of literal shit in England, and Macquarie bank and their takeover of (previously publicly owned) English gas infrastructure. The working class of England are exploited just as brutally by foreign investors, it's just that some of them are from here.
You can’t compare them to us, the density helps their case much more. Logistics is costly here
Plenty of cities around the world have subsidised situations for those types of workers. Unless you’d prefer no critical workers in your area - which is already starting to happen.
I heard that someone has written some AI software that might get rid of realtors. There’s a start 🤣
Immigration is a double edged sword. 

For continued and sustained economic growth there needs to be a working population large enough to support it. 

Australia has half the birth rate it did as compared to 50 years ago, and the australian population is getting older and older which not only puts pressure on a whole bunch of services but also decreases the amount of tax revenue the government receives to fund those services as people leave the workforce.

Strong immigration keeps topping up the working population of people in the system, and these people buy goods and services and thus supports jobs and the governments balance sheet through tax.

But they do need to live somewhere, and whether or not that is through renting or buying they are going to add demand to the housing market, unless more housing is built at appropriate levels.
> The price of housing and especially rent is primarily a product of supply and demand.

Yes, and landlords absolutely play a part in the supply factor of this.

>  It seems to pretty clearly be driven by supply and demand.

No part of the market is driven by a single factor and you're a child if you think so, while still continuing to ignore that landlords have a direct effect on S&D.

> Immigrants are not to blame, it is the government to blame for permitting an unsustainable amount of them.

Except you're still blaming immigration, which is but one factor that plays a part and not the most significant of them by any measure.
Oh I got more regos, 110 (wife) 300 (mine)  car (ours) - and every one of them has over priced insurance (pretty sure I can just buy her bike again for what she's paying per year in insurance.)
Why do we vote then for the same two parties.
Just saying last time labour tried to reduce negative gearing after it looked like they were a shoe in for government we got a second term of Sco mo. I don’t love either party for a lot of reasons but they aren’t going to touch it with a 10 foot pole if they want to get re elected unfortunately
Found out liberal and labour voted against the colesworth price gouging bill those bastards
Because they all have mad investments in the property market. You would dog yourself or your mates, apparently. Who cares about the peasants who should have eaten less avo on toast and bought property instead. It's their own fault they have no wealth or generational wealth.
Both sides are not the same. But that said, we need better politicians than the slightly less shitty choice.
Most politicians are landlords…
'Liberal' hasn't lost its meaning, it always meant two things in politics - both *socially* liberal, and *economically* liberal.

American Democrats are (generally) both, while Australian Liberals are mostly economically liberal (as are most 'conservatives').

In this case, the issue being faced is the result of economic liberalism. So 'stop voting for liberals' is more specific to this issue than 'stop voting conservatives'. However, both major parties in Australia are (neo-)liberal economically, no neither offer particularly compelling solutions.
> It’s a bit less egregious for younger people to be looking out for themselves with the state of things, than it is for the older generations to be doing it.

I don't think because one group as a whole has it harder is justification for banning another group from voting. It is a slippery slope.

> They have decades of life to plan and work for and god forbid they want to have children of their own?

Based on this logic would you say prohibiting young people with terminal illnesses from voting has merit too?

> They then see the older generations doing fuck all except protecting their own investments and interests so in turn decide to look out for themselves.

I think you'll find people tend to do this regardless of their age.

> Why would you want to look out for the older generations when they are fucking SET and refuse to admit that it’s way fucking harder to get ahead nowadays?

Because we are all Australians and should support each other irrespective of age, background and socioeconomic status. Your mindset doesn't make for a healthy cohesive society especially when not all older people believe things are easy for younger people.

If people wanting to buy a first home, especially a detached or sizeable dwelling, vote for either major party or the Greens they are probably voting against their best interest.
What about property prices? They have been going up like all the other things you said and impact lives of ordinary Australians just as much if not more. Should the ACCC get involved in regulating the property market?
Cause in the long run, rent controls do more harm than good.
There already is price controls for internet, water and public transport - they are government controlled. Petrol is set by a global oil price and food, what happens if input costs go up, food just stops being produced?
>**the problem with housing isn't immigration, it's zoning regulations land release and people speculation against that limited supply. That and the median voter wants house prices to rise, so the government makes it so,**

Just wanted to highlight that point. it's bang on ;)
Is immigration also a benefit to workers salaries?
Ah, thanks for clearing that up.
Yes, we would, because if the supermarkets were actually price gouging their net profits and likely their dividends also would be going through the roof, which they haven't. 

When I made this point previously then people would stupidly reply that they're "hiding profits" or some rubbish like that, and since cooking the books would most likely get you into real trouble with the ATO at the very least, then even if they did that their net asset backing per share would be rising fast and if people realized that then their share price would rise also and there's no evidence of that occurring either.

The best [Alan Fels stated in his report on pages 52-57](https://www.actu.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/InquiryIntoPriceGouging_Report_web9-1.pdf) was that they were making consistent profits that were higher than say the UK where they have five major supermarkets and that we need more competition here, but everyone is struggling even more over in the UK than they do here. 

If they were supposedly price gouging, there would be room for other supermarkets to come here. Aldi makes a lot more profit than the two supermarkets and yet I believe they recently stated that they are not expanding to Tasmania and I think it was Kaufland that operate in eight countries in Europe with 1500 stores stated that they're not coming here either, so clearly there aren't big rip-off's being made by the two major supermarkets.
> which is going to leave us right up shit creek

Not really, you just have to value add and make stuff like high quality cheese for example. Of course, if you're not doing that then you have no one else to blame.

e.g. The French manage to sell their Roquefort over here which retails for about AUD $100 kg. There's no reason anybody else can't do something like this either.
This is like saying eating an apple is better for you than eating the apple tree.
You can’t just extract money from your property, you have to borrow it. Most people avoid borrowing money for non essentials and end up with savings which is given a pay rise with rate rises.
So shan’t be long until they are discussing 10bn profit from comm bank?? I’ve not heard them once talk of corporate profits.
The RBA isn’t reporting. It has a lever to pull, which is higher or lower interest rates to pressure the every day Australian to stop or increase spending. We get punished if the prices go too high. It’s nonsensical and regressive.
Food and transport 

When the fine young officers ask what I'm doing, I'll explain "I'm attempting to stay alive in Sydney", a house is useless if you're starving, so I have a sleeping bag and some takeaway. 

Far out living in a dystopia comes on slowly but hits hard when you realize it
Combined with price gouging for increased profits on essential items the situation is catastrophic to people on a low > median wage.
And deprive actual street sweepers of a job/income. Why do you think I am such a horrible monster?
Exactly. 15 years ago it was in the process of being sorted and then we said - nah credit for housing is so important to australia the federal government and every tax payer needs to explicitly guarantee every australian bank. Now 90 odd banks by 20bn each. 2tn dollars of guarantees on the table. 

Now that this is not enough we have labor proposing more shared equity - ie the government literally owning homes and the liberals proposing we use super. 

I dont know where we end up in 50 years but i expect it will be the government owning an ever bigger slice of our housing market just so the few privately held properties can have ever growing values no matter what interest rates do.
Yep, when Kevin Rudd helped steer us away from disaster in 2009, that should have been the time we should have eased off. We decided to accelerate into this mess.
Oh yeah absolutely if we looked at fiscal policy there would be a solid dozen levers to pull that would do the trick. 


It is seen as politically impossible though so they'll leave it to be dealt with via the reserve bank and monetary policy, no matter how blunt that tool is. 
Yup, fiscal policy can be crafted in a myriad of ways to deal with this issue but it's considered electoral poison, so the government leave it to the RBA to fiddle with the one Monetary policy lever they have. 
Inflation itself has a range of significant costs associated with it, not to mention the real impact to all other forms of debts and savings that would follow from devaluing of the currency. 


That would be even more damaging to the economy than the alternative, you simply can't upend the entire economy to protect a single asset class. 
I think the end game is to slowly roll off property and into shares & index funds.
I am, but I adjusted that to my calculation of savings in the previous comment. I still pay for all my food, but only 100 dollars for rent.

I could move out any time and still save half of my income right now. Maybe it’s shit over east but not here.
You not being able to get a job isn’t related to cashed up boomers though is it? Idk…

Where do you live btw? I’m keen to know about areas in Australia where people can’t find work. Here in WA it’s easy as pie to work a couple jobs. It sounds like young people over east have it tough right now.
Because reforms mean that the landlord class would make less money. They'd rather tank the entire economy than let that happen (see: 2019 election)
$20B per year was one of the biggest spends in Australian history and Labor threw it to people who didn't need it. It approaches the annual spend of Medicare. That was their chance to rebuild a fairer Australia - they won't get another one.
The implicit solution is to increase the GST to pay for it, because no other taxes are raised to fill the hole. The GST is a regressive tax.

Make no mistake - "broadening the taxation base" actually means making homeless people pay more for a pie at a service station so rich people get a tax cut.

I disagree, though my opinion is still not in the favor of landlords.

Landlords have been redlining on the "market rate." The maximum people are willing/capable of giving up. It's close to the cost of a mortgage in the area, were you to buy that property today. Which is practically wages minus the bare minimum cost of living, cause that's what people are willing/capable of giving up to escape renting.

Landlords have used *supply and demand* to waive away any critiques of greed. It's just the natural order, they're not running a charity.

Which is why anything that raises their costs is a threat to them. It eats away at their profit and lifestyle they've grown accustomed to. They've already maxed out how much they can charge for their property so can't easily pass along any additional costs.

They threaten to raise rents when there's efforts to raise their costs. They say they're charitable mum 'n' pop housing providers who aren't making any profit, and if you make it too expensive for them they'd have to pack up their rental properties and leave town. 

It's a bluff. We need to call them out on it.
I don’t get it. Do people actually expect landlords to do whats best for strangers? No wonder our country is doing nothing about it. The psychology of a landlord is free income from an idiot who will keep paying
Wow beats me, we are more fucked than I thought
Probably time for us to stop choosing to build our cities so low density and focused on sprawl. We only have ourselves to blame for deciding to go down that path instead of building with more density like many other cities of the world. 
I don't believe that's our issue. And it still doesn't solve the problem if you do that.
> Yes, and landlords absolutely play a part in the supply factor of this.

What is your point? It is in the best financial interest of a landlord to have their properties occupied as much as possible.

> No part of the market is driven by a single factor and you're a child if you think so

You may note in my same comment I said *"primarily a product of supply and demand"* which is acknowledging that there are other factors.

> Except you're still blaming immigration, which is but one factor that plays a part and not the most significant of them by any measure.

What is the primary driver if it is not the insatiable demand caused by unsustainable population growth?
Why do you have so many vehicles?
> Private capital tends to become concentrated in few hands, partly because of competition among the capitalists, and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones. The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society. This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties, largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who, for all practical purposes, separate the electorate from the legislature. The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population. **Moreover, under existing conditions, private capitalists inevitably control, directly or indirectly, the main sources of information (press, radio, education). It is thus extremely difficult, and indeed in most cases quite impossible, for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.**

If the last three decades of government action has taught me anything it is that our government is the last path to changing this country anyone who is actually serious about change should take.

They are not going to have an option though. in 2019 before covid hit our nation hit the borrowing wall. Go look at new home lending over the last few decades. Households were tapped out. Covid saved us from a recession that was brewing and no one had an answer for that was not "just pour trillions of dollars on it and pray". Except the rate cuts are over, the money we poured out for Covid (actually mostly for housing, jobkeeper should have been called mortgagekeeper) has caused massive inflation. And after all that, new lending is still rolling back over because of simple maths. Households have no money left.

Does not matter how 'cheap' houses are, they could drop 20% from this point and most people still could not afford them. Houses could drop 50% and still the vast majority of us will never afford it. That is because our economy is houses, as houses decline, so too does the amount of money in the economy (deflation, it is coming hard and fast). To put it another way, unless people keep borrowing ever more money for more expensive homes then the majority of people in this country are going to take a pay cut because their wage was someone elses new mortgage last month.

This is why people say our country is run on a ponzi scheme. It literally is, our economy is running on the petty cash box and the only money going into that box each month is new household lending and a LOT of government spending.
> Just saying last time labour tried to reduce negative gearing after it looked like they were a shoe in for government we got a second term of Sco mo.

They literally had a higher % of preferential votes in 2019 than in 2022, can y'all stop parroting this narrative uncritically?
> Found out liberal and labour voted against the colesworth price gouging bill

Probably because their net profit margins are below 3% which is razor thin and adjusted for inflation they are not making record profits.
Definitely not the same. Liberals push the agenda and Labor capitulates to their demands at every opportunity, but at least they kick up a stink about it I guess.
I literally said the first two points of the original comment, which include the voting thing, are off the mark. In other words, I don’t agree with that at all. Everyone deserves a say, that’s democracy. 

I only addressed your whataboutism-esque last comment. 

Yes you’re right most people would likely do that, protect their own investments and interests, but the point is the younger generations are not even being given a chance to HAVE investments to protect because we are being targeted with the methods they are using to try and curb inflation, all while wages are barely keeping up with inflation. We are the ones being hit the hardest, when it is the older generations who many analyses show are the ones spending, because they are the only ones with the means to do so. 

I will add though that all of this discourse between generations doesn’t help anyone, because in my opinion, a lot of these issues would be near solved if the government actually went after huge corporations and mining companies who pillage our land and resources while giving nothing back. They have far more to give than your average tax payer, yet they are given a free pass to keep chasing profits while passing more and more costs onto us all.
*According to studies performed by the landlord class
That's not true at all. The trains in Melbourne are privatised. They have contracts with the government, but their prices are not government controlled. 

Have you ever once looked at the 'price at pump' for petrol? As in, the wholesale price? There should be regulations that the price we pay cannot be X% greater than the price at pump on any given day. Very simple change that would benefit everyone.
Depends, in general yes( but usually negligible) assuming the immigration is well rounded and not specific to your profession and education levels are high.

Remember immigration brings in both supply of workers and demand from Australian workers. That being said usually the economic studies use real wages, not nominal, nominal wages may very well decrease, however it's the real wages that is important to living standards as more specialised workers/competition drives down prices. 

That being said while immigration leads to negligible or higher real wages if done sensibly, it benefits asset owners the most. They get a larger pie. But then it just becomes a distribution issue and the government can fix that with tax policy in post.
Tbh I am not sure what you are being downvoted for.

Sooo the government investing in housing through equity stakes is now a bad thing? The slice of government owned housing shrunk to next to nothing after the private market took over. This is one way to claw it back. Government subsidised housing will suppress prices.
When you move out you will have rent, bills, food, travel, etc. It adds up. 

And you say what you have achieved isn’t impossible for anyone else - honestly not everyone is fortunate enough to have parents who will let them stay long term so they can save. Some people live in abusive homes or have parents who passed away. Being poor is expensive - if you start off kicked out of home at 16 - 18, you’ve potentially had to take on debt to set yourself up and then you have to pay that off. You can’t afford to buy nice $100 shoes so you buy ten $20 crappy ones throughout the year instead. Things like this add up.There’s lots of variables you haven’t considered and a lot of hardship people go through that they don’t share.
Assuming your parents kicked you out tomorrow, you’d need to front up 4 weeks bond and most studio or 1 bedroom apartments will start at 3-4 times what you are currently spending on rent. 

Then you need renters insurance, electricity, internet, public transport or insurance, registration and consumables for your transport. You could live closer to work but that often then comes at the cost of higher rents.

In Canberra living within walking distance of work is 450-600 a week. Add utilities to live, and you’re looking at 600-800 just to have a roof over your head and cook at home for 1 never going out. 2400-2800 a month without factoring in saving for a home, having a social life or buying anything to replace stuff that breaks. 

This is all post-tax. Assuming you get taxed on the above before you can pay for things, you’re probably needing to earn a minimum of 40,000 a year to only survive.

Heaven forbid someone wants to socialise with hobbies, go out with friends to dinner, go on holidays or fix your car if it broke down for 500-1000 out of pocket suddenly.

I earn comfortably enough that I don’t worry about living paycheque to paycheque. It’s incredible you’re so lucky that you get to live at home. I would absolutely consider saving what you can while you have this amazing opportunity and ensuring you can forecast what day you can put down 20% of an apartment or a home that’s valued at market value around you and still pay off the residual home loan at less than the cost you might pay in the current rental market. 

If you look up what the cost of an average home or apartment is that is the standard you might want to live in and then work out how much you’re saving and how many months you need to save to put down that cash in hand only to then need to pay off the remainder over 20 years, you might find out when you can afford to not live at home without being impacted by the current cost of living crisis.
Yeah market rate for an empty room in a capital city is $200.
JFC, mate. You are seriously out of touch. You have no idea what it's like to fly without the Mummy and Daddy parachute. You have no idea about the world outside your parents' home, do you? 

Some of us don't have the safety of Mummy and Daddy. Some of us left home as a teenager due to abuse. Some of us have never had a safety net

So, yes, for some people it is impossible
A suburb on the outskirts of Melbourne "metro".

The job change is about you, not boomers. "I got a satisfactory/good job easily, therefore it is easy to get a good job. These complaints don't make sense." The implicit part being that people who are complaining are at fault.

In reference to interest rates specifically, cashed up boomers are insulated from cost-of-living increases (which interest rate rises are/cause). They own their homes outright or have much smaller mortgages and a smaller portion of their income/wealth is spent on necessities (food/shelter/commuting/bills).
I really dont understand this line of thinking, apparently we cant do anything remotely contentious because of the 2019 election? 

I swear that election is getting brought up almost to the same degree as boomers pearl clutching the 17% interest rates. What Shorten took to the election was correct, it's up to the public to decide if they want to go back to feudalism.
They're chicken if they're that scared of the landlords.
They did it precisely so they could get another one
There are many sources of tax revenue, of these sources all of them need reform.
For example,
The GST should probably apply to private school fees
The income tax scales need indexation
Capital gains tax should be not provide a discount
Superannuation should not be a tax haven for 'excessive balances

Greatly simplified, the working class pay income tax, the owning class pay capital gains tax.

Don't be too narrow focussed.
The counter argument to this is that the youngest of the asset-rich boomers are heading into their 60s and will soon be retiring and transitioning to fixed incomes, while their older peers already have. 

So giving people a tax cut (we can certainly debate about the brackets) actually puts more money into the hands of people who need it now, rather than cashed up oldies in their $5M mansions.

Nah, they really haven't, they're still earning more than their repayments on -their- investment.

> It's close to the cost of a mortgage in the area, were you to buy that property today. 

Except very few landlords bought the property in recent time, a lot of them bought it many years ago when it was a third of the price, so an interest hike doesn't hit them nearly as hard as you're pretending it does.
"An idiot who will keep paying"

Interesting way of phrasing - person who needs a home to live in, which are hard to find in a national housing crisis.

And people wonder why this country has gone to shit. 

Sounds like it's nearing time to eat the rich?
You fuck

There's things that can be done to chip away at the problem. 


VIC is taxing investment properties now and that plateaued the prices a bit. 


Ending negative gearing should also put downward pressure on investment properties.
Only fucked if successive governments fail to tackle wealth inequality. Handing me a massive tax break that I don't really need, which will go into stocks, bonds or a pension pot, when that money could be used to build government owned social housing, or start a free at the point of use healthcare system for all is fucking mental.
They did so due to need - not preferred living conditions.  Look at Tokyo and 20-30 m/2 1-2,K  apartment hell hole. 

Just like what will happen here - as population increases 100mil+ will be more like those other dense cities.

Losing quality of life with detached house and yard, pool, gardens, trees  - entertaining area - room for kids / pets  to run and play etc vs stuck in stacked hell boxes is something that will continue to happen as we do increase our population and how many all want to cram int the same limited physical locations.
You seriously think 1 thing solves the problem? This IS absolutely an issue we’ll see more of if we don’t think about how a well rounded, multi-skilled community can live within an hour of their work. 

Or do you think 3 hours of travel a day is acceptable to expect?
She works 5km away from home, I work 60km away from home, she works 9-9 I work 7-6 (inc travel), the bikes make sense 90% of the time - cheap to buy, maintain, and run - the car is for inclimate weather or picking things up.
He never misses.
They still lost to the liberals over it so I don’t see your point. Faith in the big parties collapsed during the pandemic so it’s hard to compare them.
According to studies conducted by economists and academics. But don’t think that fact will make a difference to you.
What happens when refinery costs increase or costs of transportation the fuel increase?
And immigration doesn’t drive up rents?
People have opinions but aren't allowed to voice them - this is probably where the downvotes come from.
People hate immigration, when times get tough people always turn on immigration. Even though it was far higher in the 70sand 80s per capita
Where did I say we should lower interest rates? I never made such a remark. I said if they were serious about curbing spending then increasing gst is a far better way to do it as gst affects everyone. Interest rates only affect half the population
Jokes on them, I'm employed and a new (second hand) sleeping bag every day is cheaper than rent
I am not talking about government housing. Some folks simply shouldnt be in the private rental market so accept that should be public housing. Gov should absolutely build for them and own it. 

I am talking about the government chipping in for 40pc of home purchases for someone buying a home. 

Ie shared equity. 

Thats just another way to put more capital into our housing market.
All these problems are exactly why I don’t live in the city, I guess that’s my main gripe. I realise that it’s not so simple to just leave the city if someone can’t afford it, but it shouldn’t be dismissed as a bad option surely.

Living in a regional town for a few years could net you enough for a down payment on a really nice flat in the city right?

My goal right now is stacking as much cash as I can so I have nothing to worry about when I want to work and travel, I understand 50% of men my age aren’t living at home so it’s not that easy for them.
Yeah, I hate that line of thinking as well, but it's the first line of defence any Labor supporters run to when you criticise Labor's lack of action

Oh well, we'll find out if the public buys that next election. I'm betting the majors get an even smaller vote share
They are the landlords.
They will get a budget hole that the Teals will use to wedge through a GST increase. The LNP doesn't care if they are in opposition in this case, because Labor are implementing their wildest dreams while also taking the heat for it.
If you dig a $20B hole you need to fill it up, and no tinkering will do it. 

You can either tax resources or put up the GST by 5-10%. The LNP is happy for Labor to try either one.
They're giving it straight back in inflation and rate rises that would not have happened otherwise. Doing nothing probably would have given the same benefit.
Of course, homeless people all live right next to a Coles. Maybe they just want something warm to eat.
> Nah, they really haven't, they're still earning more than their repayments on -their- investment.

Cause market rates have afforded them that meat on the bone. But anything that threatens to eat into their margin makes them throw a hissy fit. They might still be making money, but it's a pay cut relative to before. They can't afford to replace ovens or insulate homes like they're providing a service, they're got Audi's to service and Polynesian islands to visit.

>Except very few landlords bought the property in recent time, a lot of them bought it many years ago when it was a third of the price, so an interest hike doesn't hit them nearly as hard as you're pretending it does.

You're right. I thought I should've mentioned before, but I worried about rambling. I'll do that here instead.

With rampant house price rises, it didn't take long for a newly minted landlord to start making money. They'd have to suffer paying some of the mortgage themselves since the rent couldn't cover everything, but most were content knowing they would reach breakeven and eventually start profiting, and stuck it out until then. And until then they've had other things to support them that the average home owner doesn't, like negative gearing.

This led to the outrageous house price rises, as investors and first home buyers fought it out in the Auctions. FHB's would bid as much as their wages could afford, and landlords would bid based upon how long they could remain solvent until the market raised up to a level they could comfortably profit from. Hence why mortgage repayments and market rate rents are so similar, it's priced for the property being mortgaged in that moment in time. Added bonus is it consumes the wealth of those renters so they can't form a deposit and escape the trap.

And of course there's all those owners with freehold properties, still charging market rate. Which goes to show the market rate isn't directly based on cost, instead by what demand is capable of paying. If there was less demand and landlords had to fight for tenants, those with freehold properties would be the first to reduce pricing cause they could afford to, putting those investors at their limit out of luck and forced to sell, further reducing demand for rentals, and reducing the price of homes cause why would you get a mortgage when rent is so cheap, and now you have a crash. Which is why government's have reduced supply by kowtowing to nimbys, divesting from social housing, and kept pumping up the bubble with favourable tax laws (and there's immigration, but that argument quickly turns into xenophobia, and we could have them building to meet their own demand too if it weren't for the problems mentioned before.) They need to protect their buddies and their own investments at all social costs.
Think they’re phrasing it from the perspective of the landlord. A lot of the “advice” from investors essentially boils down to “just have money and use it to make money”, and comes from the arrogance of privilege. There’s a big disconnect between people with wealth and those that don’t.
You're just straight up parroting tired propaganda at this point, get a new perspective and perhaps actually talk to someone who lives in those "hell holes", gd.
No, I was replying to what you said.

You were talking about essential workers being subsidised. 

I said, THAT doesn't solve the problem. It's just stealing from Peter to pay Paul.
Then the wholesale price goes up? Did you read anything I said?
Yes it drives up rents all else equal. However it is only allowed to drive up rents because we don't have the housing supply where people want to live. It is possible to simply build enough housing, it's just unfortunately not the median Australian's wishes to build enough housing because that would drive down prices. You had far more immigration per capita in the 70s and 80s way before the boom in house prices from 2000-2023.

Instead we find a comfortable steady state where we don't allow housing to be built where it is needed, while grumbling about immigration as if they are the source of the issue. Everyone is happy, the median Australian points the finger at immigration, the government doesn't lose votes by fixing the issue and the journalists just provide what story is demanded mainly that we are in a housing crisis that isn't the fault of the median Australian.
The local hangout has immigrants with thick accents, angry at immigration. One Moroccan bloke was so passionate, he started to yell/rant about it. Wild times..
Ahh that makes sense yes. I was thinking long term but you're right in the short term it just drives up prices even more.
I think the situation is primarily like the Industrial revolution in that some industries simply will not exist without scale. You might be in a mining town, with the support infrastructure that benefits mining, but there may not be a demand for people who want to learn things that require further study after school unless it relates to the industry around the small town. 

Someone with no knowledge in Canberra can earn 60k a year doing nothing but having headphones in and feeding paper into photocopiers as a full time job with 12-17% super and only work 8-4. You can’t get that in a country town. But you can get that here. 

I remember the rent being about 200-400 a week for an entire house in northern Tasmania, but you then have the issue of the “IT” shop was staffed by 3 people and didn’t need more, if you wanted to learn about IT your options were an online degree of dubious worth, or living in hobart.

There’s no problems in living in a small town provided it doesn’t glass ceiling your ability to double your income by doing so. If you have a valuable skill set you’re golden to work wherever a satellite can give you internet. Unless that skill set requires people, in which case you have to be where the people are, or work somewhere in a place that is fine with you working 100% not in the office. Quite tricky to find them.
And Labor did worse in 2022 In terms of preference vote share. Labor benefited massively from a shift away from the Liberals in a number of otherwise staunch lnp areas. The 2019 narrative at this point is just dishonest because it ignores so much context that could have influenced an election. Like an incredibly biased media, which is still around and probably just waiting for someone other than Dutton to take control before going in.

Its such a risky narrative as well because it both blocks off a way for Labor to think about major problem and makes it seem that the Labor 2022 campaign was far more popular than it may have actually been. Yes winning on preferences still counts, but it's a red flag for their actual support. And it's not like Labor is becoming more popular in power either (though that rarely happens). So they probably aren't going to do better than last time, which was already not the best picture for Labors actual support vs preferential support.
Labor took away their wildest dreams, and instead did something only half as bad, and gave tax breaks for all.

Creating affordable/rent controlled (subsidised) housing is one way of addressing one of the problems. So is property tax policy, building new housing, etc etc. 

Who is it robbing if its built and designed for the purpose?
Yeah my town isn’t a mining town but skilled work is particularly useless in comparison to the city. I plan on getting a degree so I can work overseas but there’s not much incentive other than that right now for me, I walked in to a job that pays as good as my mum who studied for years, which isn't fair but I do work plenty of hours on weekends.
Yeah, everyone likes to think that because the LNP got demolished then that means that Labor has a huge majority. In reality, they have a three seat majority, and we know how easy it is to flip that few seats

We should all be thankful that those on the right seem incompetent: Dutton isn't winning any popularity contests, Pauline can't find sane candidates, and Palmer is useless at capitalising on major party dissatisfaction. One vaguely competent person on that side running a halfway decent campaign and Labor's going to have a very tough time in the HoR
Nope, because you're going to get stage 3 anyway. The tax cuts Labor gave are merely on top - further building the case for a GST increase.

Labor can propose any more tax cuts they like, the LNP will back all of them today - because they have the answer to the hole created.
It's absolutely a bad thing. If you spend all your income to survive you pay more tax as a proportion of your income than someone with surplus income who doesn't need to do that. 

It also hits people who formerly paid no tax, not because they were evading, but because they were merely too poor to pay tax. They get no upside benefits of the taxation system like negative gearing or the CGT discount (or tax cuts). They unambigously just pay more.
Putting the GST up 10% is a simple choice - it solves literally all taxation problems overnight. What better way to reign in inflation than taxing consumption, right? Less income tax for you, less inflation, less interest rate increases on your mortgage.. and the only cost is to the poor guy down the road who pays 10% more on his pie.

Job done for 20 years.
Again, maybe you want something hot. Also you might live somewhere rural.

I can't tell if you genuinely think this or not.. it comes across as a kind of "if they have no bread, why can't they eat cake?" comment.
Ok, sure. But none of that was what I was responding to.

Which you know, because I just specifically told you what I was replying to.

Look, if the basic structure of conversation is up in the air I'm out.

> Who is it robbing

I specifically said that, specifically, to what you specifically said, about essential workers.
We are getting a far better Stage 3 than was promised. It's still bad, but not as bad.

And by doing it in this way, Labor have headed off the 'broken promise' barrage that would have been unleashed, by giving to everyone, even the rich ones who really don't need it.
