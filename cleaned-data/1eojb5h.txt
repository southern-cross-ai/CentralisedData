The EFTPOS terminals in the Sydney Airport Newsagency all have that tipping popup after a transaction. Every single time, the worker immediately just skips it. That is how it should be. Tipping culture is BS and has no place within Australia.
This is one of the reasons I don't tip - Australian employers have repeatedly demonstrated they can't be trusted.
> "A [previous] employer, when we put our website up, had a $2.50 or $5 tip added automatically to all online orders, which is pretty significant considering how many orders we had come through," he said.
> "Over the course of two years it ended up being about $10,000, which we never saw."



I bet that cafe also had a card surcharge because “it was a cost of doing business”
Ban tips
If only beneficiary of monies collected for tips is the business, instead of the Staff members as implied,
… is that considered fraud/theft?
I never tip.


See Australia's living wage laws
Aussies were tipping?
Fuck that I refuse to tip. Not having that shit make its way into Australia
I never got a tip when I worked in hosp, always manually entered $0 tip before handing the eftpos machine to the customer
Tipping culture sucks. 

It's out of control in the US.
Ex Hospo worker here. Only tip in cash and to the person. Each place will have different rules. 


For Eg, one place I worked at, we pooled our tips for staff parties or a staff day out for breakfast and coffee. Our owner was really good as what tips we made he would do dollar for dollar.

Other places would pool tips for the night and split between staff, that can generally create fights.

One place I hated, because he was greek and called everyone a malaka, would pool the tips and use it to pay wages. Biggest malaka of them all.
So reconfigure the damn eftpos machine to remove the auto tip option. Cuz none of us will use it
Tipping in restaurants  - Australia Says no
If I’m going to tip, I will speak to the waiter/waitress and asked do they get the tips? If it goes to the business they can go get stuffed. Tips should not be going to the business owner.
I worked at a cafe for two years and never saw a single tip. It was sad only because genuine customers were showing their appreciation and I wasn’t able to tell them it wasn’t actually going to us…
I worked at a place in Surfers Paradise that the manager would take all the tips and give it to the owner. She would actually say that it was the owners money.
This isn't America. We have awards. People should only tip for exceptional service
I'm a strong no tipper but on the rare occasion I'll check with staff. If it doesn't go to who served me fully, the venue can fist itself
Nope, not tipping. 
Talk to your boss.
You can take your tipping and shove it.
20 years ago working in hospitality it was the same. I just always said thanks but please don't tip, the company keeps it.
I guess when people bought a coffee with cash they may have tossed the change into the tip jar, however that is usually more out of convenience of not wanting to carry change around rather than tipping a job well done. 

However it shouldn’t make a difference -  Australia is not a tipping culture.
I’m ordering off apps in a cafe.  To hell with a tip.
I also love when places where you order via QR code at the table have a tipping screen. Yeah, I’m totally going to tip when I’ve had zero human interaction
Mr Pink had the right idea. 
Tips are not needed for your job your pay should cover that but when a customers gives a tip anyway it means a lot and I say thanks
Hospo businesses on charging credit cards has torpedoed me tipping anymore
Ha ha, eftpos tipping - when the business adds a levy that you only see on your receipt for CC but doesn’t take cash
Australia does not have or need a tipping culture. I may have a slimey process to copy some sepo system, but we do not deserve such an undignified process. 
If out hospitality staff are struggling it's an employer issue not paying a living wage. If you can't pay a living wage you can't run a business or need to change the model.
Fuck tipping culture. As an Australian who lives in Canada, unless you want to see tipping at subway, liquor stores and coffee shops in the future press $0 EVERY TIME. It’s out of fucking control here. 
Psst: this article only exists to normalise tipping culture.  

The only acceptable option is reject tipping entirely.
Why is it leaving them "worse off"? Tips already shouldn't be treated as a key source of revenue for anyone, let's not imply that they are. Otherwise this discourse just leads us down the road to being the US.
I laugh at any waiter asking for a tip. Absolutely dreaming asking for more on over priced dishes because they welcomed with a smile and interrupt conversations to ask if we were enjoying everything 20x in an evening.
If you want to tip give cash.
I see a request for a tip, I decline and then never go there again.
I will only tip in Australia for exceptional service, and only on a special occasion.
Most of the time when out dining with a group, we’re too lazy to divide up the cost and say “well you owe $47.30, and you owe 43.25 etc etc@, so we just round up to $50 each and that’s their tip”.

Of course, now with the advent of PayID this is not required. One person pays the bill, and everyone else does a PayID of the exact amount at the table.
I don't mind the idea of ripping in addition to not in place of regular wages ( which would eventually happen)

But this pay before you get anything and include a tip can double fuck off
Tips can get farked. We pay proper wages here.
Tipping is being pushed by EFTPOS and the like because it equals massive additional profits for banks and the credit card companies. 

People don’t realise but banks and credit card companies get a % as a  transaction fee from the vendor/buyer, this includes tips.

This won’t go anyway soon unless something is done from a legislative perspective, especially as we move to become a more cashless society.
Do not tip. No tipping ever. Pay your staff. 

Tipping is not extra money in the pocket of the employee, it’s just an excuse for an employer to pay staff less.
This isn’t America.
Why, in Australia, has tipping become a thing? Are we really to the point where a living wage depends on the kindness of customers. Pay a decent living wage Scrooge McBusiness-Owner and stop screwing over your employees.
NEVEr TIP IN AUSTRALIA. eVEr! I don’t want your tips I want my employer to pay me what I earned.
FUCK OFF with yank tipping culture.

Anyone caught trying to bring shitty American tipping behaviours here deserves a public flogging.

Only the lowest of the low expect their deliberately underpaid staff’s wages to be made up from customer goodwill.

Business owners, don't be scum - Set your prices so you can pay your staff fairly and your customers know what to expect upfront, or you have absolutely no business being in business.

If you catch an Australian business acting unAustralian by soliciting for tips (and I don't mean merely having a tip jar), shame them nationally and don't fucking return, unless your aim is to raze the deplorable place to the ground.

The Aussie way for rewarding above and beyond *exceptional* service is well fucking established throughout the country, and it sure as fuck doesn't require point of sale integration.

If you think paying more just because you were asked to tip is ok, book a one way flight and fuck the fuck right off, and don't ever come back.
If you are going to tip then do it with cash
I don’t tip, things are expensive enough that I can’t afford to pay twice for a service.
I know for a fact that the Lucas Group owner takes a cut from all tips… like wtf? As if hat asshat needs it????
If the service is great, or I have some change, I’ll leave a tip under my plate.

The waiter/ess is the one cleaning up the table, so I know it will go to them.
I never tip on eftpos but sometimes there’s the 60c or 30c so I just leave it. If I was tipping, it’s for excellent service and always in cash
(Shrugs) I'll get downvoted because I always do when this comes up but I love how pretty much every comment here is "I won't tip because we've got decent minimum wages in Australia" when pretty much everyone writing that is utilizing services where our minimum wage doesn't apply to workers in Australia; Uber, delivery apps, Amazon etc.
For those that still don't know : "You don't need to tip in Australia '!!!
You don't tip in Australia.
Tipping? Not going to happen. That's what minimum wage is for. How many locals are actually tipping through POS? It would mostly be tourists who don't know any better.
Gold Coast. He often called the male staff malakas and the females putinas. Donkeys and whores. Didn't pay income tax but took it out of our wages. Had a nice long chat with a federal tax agent about that a couple of years after I quit working there
Hospo workers should get an ABN for a sole trader, set-up a PayId and link it to the ABN so people can tip directly to them
In Ireland they have this thing, separate tipping machine set at a fixed amount (usually about €1). 

 https://justtip.net/
Oh well don't deserve to be tipped... harden up
I’ve worked in Hospo. Always skipped the tip menu. Those who genuinely want to tip have asked me where the option is. No one should be pressured to tip.
Get pushed to use QR codes to order, there's a two fees at the end, then they also have a tipping screen where a tip is default. No interaction with staff before they want a tip. 

And if you do order a beer through the QR code, it sits waiting for several minutes for a staff member to bring it over.
Nope fuk right off with ur american bullshit. We have real wages here.
there is no such tipping culture in Australia FFS

If I am happy , I will give to them  cash directly.
I won’t buy from cunts that want tips. Pay your fucking workers properly
Who's been tipping this whole time anyway? 

The same businesses probably also charge 15% surcharge on Sundays as well as fees to use cards... 

But the one that gets me is charging to use apps to order food because that actually saves the business money. 

It costs them in the end because these practices put people off and many avoid these places. Discouraging patrons from even coming in at all isn't a particularly savvy move. 

(Instead of charging surcharges and POS fees just roll it in to your yearly budget people won't even notice).

With all the hidden fees, yeah I'm not surprised people don't feel like tipping.
Just dont eat out. Can save lots of $$.
I worked in a restaurant that everyone was getting paid tips in their accounts except me and the reason is that I was a supervisor(casual not full time) and I literally was doing the same f**** as all waiters. Is this legal?
Sorry but unskilled hospitality workers are paid too much already in Australia. Coupled with generally poor service and attitudes. 

I rarely meet any server worthy of a tip.
[deleted]
Why the hell would anyone tip in a news agency?  I mean, really??
That poor worker, so many unnecessary button presses. Turn the option off!
I read the article and the workers aren't mad about the tipping but that they're not getting any from customers because of the business, through customer to EFTPOS. I get that's fair, hopefully they aren't for tipping culture in Australia. 

"**In short:**

Hospitality staff say they are concerned they are receiving fewer tips as the use of cash declines and the cost of living rises.

While EFTPOS tips are becoming more prevalent, some workers say employers are withholding those funds."
It's not uniquely Australian, just people
Why does online orders having compulsory tipping?
And a weekend surcharge and a public holiday surcharge
I actually don’t tip on card because I know most places will just pocket it sadly
Yes! I've been working in hospo for an embarrassingly long time. We don't want tipping to be normalised. Just pay us a living wage, don't be rude to us and we are fine.
Yep, can't let that shit come here. Nope. So don't engage in it, people.
In a way I hope a lot of scummy businesses get caught stealing tips/having "tips" that aren't actually tips, and that causes impetus to ban it altogether.
It is, in fact, illegal. Stealing tips has always been illegal.
What living wage are you on about?  You cant afford a house on our "living wage" anywhere in Oz basically.
And the people in the article saying how they’re skipping meals because the money they’re making isn’t enough.
We have *minimum* wage laws, not *living* wage laws. The minimum is too low in most capital cities to be considered a living wage.

Edit: No idea why people are downvoting, I don't support tipping. I'm highlighting that the minimum wage is too low to be a living wage, and by implication, that it should be higher!
Mate did you read the story? Poor bloke on minimum wage can't survive without tips.
In cafe culture it was closer to tossing the spare change in the jar when things were $x.70,80,90
Stupid ones are
In high end dining it's more common, once you're spending a couple hundred a head, not including drinks, the money flows a bit more freely.


I'll get "tips" that mostly amount to people not wanting change in coins. Occasionally someone will pass me some cash to play music on request. That's normally more than just one song, though, and I'll only do it when we're quiet.



Doesn't upset me that much, it pays for an afternoon out every couple months.
i leave silver. thats it when i paid cash. no gold or notes ever.
Depends on the venue, pubs not really and the tips are usually pooled and used as a tab at the bar for staff parties. I’ve worked at some ‘higher’ class restaurants and it’d happen fairly often. Would usually amount to $5-$30 a week. Nothing crazy.
When I worked in hospitality 25 years ago in Australia people did tip, sometimes very generously.
In 1980-1990’s  as a 20/30 something,  I commonly tipped 10% at restaurants.  Now, never.
I always do when it is table service and it comes to $78.00- just chuck $80 in notes down and walk away without waiting for the shrapnel.
Yeah but mostly only in high-end dining.
The easy way to do it is to extend the bribery laws from public servants and foreign officials to anyone with any kind of licence or registration - RSA and gaming, REA, whatever. That's all tips are in essence, a kind of a bribe in connection with employment.
I don’t tip, but I don’t understand this idea of it “making its way” here, since it’s always been here.
You get asked to tip now in places where tipping never occurred in the US it is nuts. Also, 15% is considered cheapskate now lol.
Didn't happen to be George's Paragon by any chance did it?
Next you'll tell me you don't even tip your landlord!
You couldn't open your mouth?
[deleted]
Which restaurant ?
Agreed. I don’t have any issue with tipping younger hospo workers (or even older ones) that go out of their way to provide great service. Makes people feel much more appreciated than a ‘thank you’.
To be fair it’s not in their best interest to tell you they get 0% of the tips, in case you complain to the owner and they get fired
Tipping might be okay if it remained purely optional. Unfortunately once it gets a foothold it rapidly becomes mandatory, driven by guilt and unspoken obligation.
The whole $7.25 thing is bullshit in the U.S. btw, most tipped workers make about USD$14-15 an hour and then receive tips on top.  If you ask tipped workers they’ll make about $5-10 an hour on top and not declare it so they’re actually doing better than our hospitality workers.
Yeah the interruptions and how was everything have been driving me nuts lately. Have some confidence in what's being dished up...
If you smell shit everywhere you go, maybe check your shoes
They are paid at the minimum wage, at least.

If you think that's "too much" then you are a major part of the issues with our society.

Everyone deserves a living wage, no matter how skilled you think they are.
Almost everyone I know have quit or are getting out of hospo because the wage/hours keep going down. The problem is there is too many hospo visas and people are going out less.
Do you want to tell me what other entry-level jobs in this country pay $31-44 an hour while also keeping me fit and mentally stimulated?
Well shit, thanks for that hot tip!
Can't wait to hear you complain when you can't get a coffee because no one is working hospo
It actually pays well $ wise, it’s whether that money is worth the Karen’s and Chads of this country. But sorry mate Hospo pays pretty well which is why WE DONT FREAKIN TIP IN THIS COUNTRY!!!!!
While I can agree with the working with the public is not easy part, it can still be a solid career. It's also a really diverse one that doesn't necessarily mean dealing with the public. We don't want your tips. We want to be treated with the respect we deserve and paid fairly.
I assume they bought a POS system designed for use in the US and then didn't turn off the "prompt for tip" function in the hope they could exploit some naieve and vulnerable tourists.
In an airport, they’re betting on Americans who are used to tipping everywhere anytime
Why would anyone tip anywhere period.
We expect they were paying for the whole experience. The social contract being that the service staff serve and the customers customerise.

If a tip is required your boss isn’t changing enough and passing it on appropriately. This what and how we expect things. In you too in Australia the staff need to have gone above what is expected as a polite, prompt, and proper service. A decent tip and it should be given to them as an award/reward, not a participation medal.

Too much?
Employers.
Absolutely. Pay people properly.
Yep, this is only going one way unless it gets banned. See exhibit A - USA.
We should join forces, Australians against tipping fighting for a fair wage for workers and a ban on tipping!
I’m very happy to tip restaurants and bar staff when I’ve felt really well looked after, yet a tip should never be required or expected; it should be a gift of gratitude, given and received with grace.
Former hospo, couldn’t agree more.
American hospo workers make significantly more due to the tipping culture there. I just don't want it here because I don't want to pay more tbh.
It's more complicated than that. 

A tip in Australia is seen as a gift, and the gifter can specify who the gift (tip) goes towards. If that is the case, where you specify it's for the employees, and the employer takes the tip then it is theft.

When you tip on a cheque, an EFTPOS machine, or an online checkout, you are tipping the business for its service delivery and therefore they are the gift recipient and the employees are not legally entitled to any of it.

There is usually nothing in these tipping processes that specify you're tipping employees. This is by design. You just *think* you're tipping the employees because that is the social custom.

We should have a law stating that any and all tips provided to a business without direct request of a recipient are divided up equally amongst the staff. But we won't see this without union action and calls to it.
Dude people on a hundred thousand can't afford a house in most cities. That isn't a minimum wage issue but a housing one
There's no way to raise it to the point people can buy a house, fuck people on hundred grand struggle to afford places in most cities
Housing in Australia long ago left the realm of affordability for wage earners at any level.


Australia's young are too pussy though to do anything about it. The French would have burnt their cities to the ground in the same affordability situation long ago
>. The minimum is too low in most capital cities

The solution definitely isn't the absurd practice of tipping, especially company collected tips.

We can all see the clownshow of that system in America. We do not need it here. If they can't afford to cover their staffs wages properly, then they can't afford staff.
In this post your comment reads as tipping should be included to boost the minimum wage, which I don't think you meant.
Lmao fuck you for having a correct opinion everyone here actually agrees with I guess? People are so fucking dumb as if you’re getting downvoted for saying the minimum wage isn’t enough to live on
Welcome to Reddit cowboy!
Dw some of us get you. ‘Living wage laws’ is quite objectively a factual error.
You are experiencing the reason why politicians speak to the public in the way they do.
Minimum wage is $24 dollars an hour.

You're not going to be eating smashed avo every morning on that but its deffinately enough to live on as a single in a capital city.
People on reddit act as if Aussies haven’t been tipping for decades or more.
Arr! Eight pieces me hearty! Cap'n Flint knows!
Me too. Worked at Uluru in the late 80's and would barely touch my wages
Yeh I hear this pretty consistently from people who worked in hospo a decent while ago. Seems like we collectively stopped tipping some time in the 2000s? Would be interesting to find out why.
It's changed a bit though, people tip less than before. The restaurant manager mentions it in the article.
Up the cross? Horrible man
Nah, not him. I'm starting to realise that those types of Greeks are everywhere.
imo tipping a 22yr old in uni isn’t the same as tipping your landlord who already owns a house.
toxic management that caused mental health issues which is why I’m no longer there. so no, I felt incapable.
toxic management
Surfers Paradise Beach Cafe. I normally wouldn't name and shame but they were and probably still are, awful to staff. I used to have to clock out to go to the bathroom.
Yeah I don't mind a tip jar on the counter. My local coffee spot has one with a label "girls night out fund" and when it fills up they put it toward something like a paint and sip session or a gold class movie session with the owner kicking in the difference.
I highly doubt they're doing any better. Because tips, mate, aren't guaranteed.

I used to live in the US and for a period was in hospitality. It sucked.
No one "deserves" anything - that's the sense of entitlement and arrogance that is currently corrupting Australian society.
I mean, not to say don’t work hospitality like this guy, but I got $31/h working at Kmart.
Wage might be $31 an hour in hospo but only with 3 years of experience and even then they will want to pay you cash with no super. If you don’t like it they will tell you to find another job. Ask how I know 😂
Most EFTPOS systems support tipping / surcharge options. All EFTPOS terminals require initial setup / configuration to work. So, if the option pops up when you pay, it was either deliberately or negligently, specifically set up that way.

Tipping is gross, EFTPOS tipping is worse. In most terminals there is no way to associate the tip with the person who is supposed to receive it, so the tip goes straight into the owner’s account and stays there.
Point of sale system? More like ‘piece of shit’ system
A lot of businesses use square which is American I believe. Probably just baked in to the system.
most likely just bought a square unit and have it set up more or less as default other than the payment sheets.
Americans don't tip at stores.
People are employers
How is it "going one way"? Our minimum wages aren't based on workers receiving tips like in places like the U.S.

The middle-aged hospo veteran in the article says that tips used to be bigger in the 90s.
Are all hospitality workers going to be thinking along these lines?
Love the enthusiasm, love the idea. Facts are that if people in hospo were paid a living wage, costs would go up and people would complain about that. Chefs complete a 3-4 year apprenticeship yet people don't want to pay them like other trades.
Agreed
Congratulations on escaping.
Tipping culture also opens up a whole can of worms since the money an employee makes is wholly dependent on what individual customers choose to pay them, meaning minorities get paid less than their peers for the exact same work.

It also enables a disgusting degree of entitlement among the portion of customers who'll punish workers for not catering to their every whim, no matter how unreasonable.
I thought that was only for front of staff servers/bar people, not like chefs, dish washers, or anyone else not dealing with customers directly
They don't and it's never regular and reliable. It depends on how busy the business is, what time and day your shift is on and where you work. The people that serve food can get more income from tips and the cooks and cleaners who are on the same wage get nothing.

Tipping is great if you have a nice rack and smile and working on a Friday night. Not so much for everyone else.
I wonder what the average hourly rate would be including tips.
Does not pass the pub test. Needs to be regulated clearly like wage theft laws.
Specifically, it’s housing becoming an investment vehicle rather than a thing that people need to feel secure. 
Here’s an idea: Landlords can only access negative gearing on one property, and only if the tenants have a lease of at least 3 years.

Problem - not enoigh housing stock. French answer: burn lots of housing stock?   Really?
>The solution definitely isn't the absurd practice of tipping, especially company collected tips.

Where did I say I support tipping? You even commented *after* my edit which clarified my position.
I don't understand, I didn't say anything about tipping being included. I highlighted that there aren't laws about living wage and that the closest to that is minimum wage which isn't enough to live on.

I get that it is a touchy subject and all it takes is two or three people to misinterpret the comment for mob mentality to take over and assume I meant something I didn't say.

Even after editing to clarify, heaps still downvoted because they obviously didn't read and just followed the mob.
> its deffinately enough to live on as a single in a capital city.

LMFAO. It's really not. Nowhere near enough to live, even outside a crapital shitty.
In a share house with zero savings, maybe. 

$24 an hour x 40 hours is $960 before tax; assuming you’re getting full time hours (and most arent). 

That’s $830 after tax.  Rent, bills, groceries, PT or rego (or both) is going to leave you with basically nothing. 

If you’re smart you’ll be putting money into your own super (11% of nothing isn’t getting you far in retirement) and by that time you’re lucky if you can save some for a rainy day; let alone to ever hope to buy your own place and get out of the rat race.
Right but surely those were yanks tipping, not aussies
> Would be interesting to find out why.

I would imagine it's a combo of cost of living + more and more people going cashless, when something comes to 46$ and all you have is a 50 it's easy enough to tell them to keep the change so you don't have to deal with shrapnel, doesn't happen when you're paying the exact amount.
Sorry to hear that. Hope you're on the mend, and somewhere better.
Oh, you are one of those wankers...OK then...toddle on.
Well exactly. For a variety of reasons, I work retail. We have to deal with the same sort of shithead hospitality workers do, and no one would dream of tipping us.
I guarantee you this guy would give the same advice about working at Kmart.
And given that it's at Sydney airport I could 100% see some greedy franchisee leaving it enabled in the hopes that they could hoodwink international travelers, especially yanks that don't know any better.
It is. I have to turn the option off manually on each and every invoice. If there's a way to globally disable it, I haven't found it. Sometimes one goes out with the "option to add a tip" and my entire skin clenches when I realise.
A lot use SmartPay but, you need to call them to get stuff like that changed.
But are employers people? 🧐😂
Batman’s a scientist.
Eftpos tipping is normalising tipping on every purchase, where tips are expected as standard rather than an extra for exceptional service. It gives employers an excuse to lower wages in industries that have tipping, because “my staff make all their money from tips, so I don’t need to pay them as much”.
Foreign ones might not be
Completely disagree. I’d rather pay more but buy less frequently.
Yeh, thankfully we don't have entitled customers here.
Yeh non-tipped positions suck in the US lol. Workers who get tipped pretty much always make more than they would otherwise. Just sucks if it's expected and you're the customer.
People love hitting the down vote, don't sweat it.
Really?

If on full time hours, 1000 dollars a week after tax isnt enough to live on?
Im not saying that its easy - im saying that it is a liveable wage.

Rent would tske most of it, groceries the next big chunk, some bills, then discretionary spending.

You can get a room in a share house within 40 mins of the cdb for under 400

Again, im.not saying its good or easy, but its a lie to say its not liveable.
 European visitors would give 15% and Americans 10%
Aussie tips were up to 10%
Working in restaurants in the Gold Coast in the early 90s most tables tipped $5 to 10% of the bill. Would generally finish a shift with at least $50
Team of 6 staff at cocktail lounge at Sheraton Port Douglas made $10k over skins that we split
Wonder if that tracks with increasing card usage. From memory a lot of people were still paying with cash in the 2000s, but I don't have data on that to hand.
Square Dashboard > Settings > Tipping > Off
Depending on what you mean by people, stochastically less and less so as they better embody an appendage or agent of capital given consciousness and a will.
Exactly, we do. My point is that the degree of entitlement would get worse once these people are put directly in charge of whether workers get compensated or not.
You think the average minimum wage worker is willing to travel 40 minutes to the city??  

Good lord you’re so out of touch.
Ah, I'll have a look next time I'm on an actual computer.

Primarily, I'm using the app, and the setting in that for turning tipping off only applies to POS payments as opposed to the invoiced ones.

Fingers crossed that the dashboard one works for this, thanks.
😂love it!
I guess that's a fair trade-off. Australian hospo workers make less money, but the customers are annoying in slightly different ways.
 - A 40 minute commute is really not that bad
- the vast majority of jobs in a CBD are not minimum wage
- do you actually expect that a single bedroom apartment in a cbd, for a city  of millions, must be easily affordable for someone on minimum wage working 38 hours a week?

If someone wants to live in something other than a 2 bedder with 4+ people, then of course they will need to live 30-60 mins from a cbd.

This is not a standard unique to Australia - its the way all cities operate.
You have never worked a customer facing role, have you? We have plenty of entitled customers. People still treat hospitality workers awfully. Thankfully, If someone abuses us we don't have to cop it because our wages don't depend on them paying us.
I'm glad you're happy with that trade-off, even if I don't personally understand it. If the customers were going to be abusive either way, I'd prefer the option where I make more money.
