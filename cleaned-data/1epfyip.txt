Both of them need to be flagged for doping by WADA, because they are both high as fuck when they do these routines.
It's like the slam poetry of break dancing
This explains a lot.
That's the person who kept telling her she was ready for the Olympics...
This is also her husband too btw
There needs to be a Royal Commission into this shit.
The blind leading the blind. Wild.
What the fuck is he doing? Trying to kill a spider? üëü
This isn‚Äôt break dancing. They are breaking dancing
This is why you tell your kids when they‚Äôre actually shit at something. It helps prevent adults like this.
I can't with this pair - the level of delusion to think they're an Olympic worthy duo is insane.
I've seen better male and female break dancers around darling harbour regularly, this fool and his partner have no idea ...
J To the R O C ... Knowatimsayin?
Jesus... who even encouraged them? They don't have real friends.
When you're surrounded by yes men, I'm just imagining this guy saying 'yes that's it babe, you're killing it!'
When you fake your way to some tang but then you're elbow deep and there's no reverse gear
She has a coach? Wow
This shit is so buster. Both of them are posers and wanna-bees.
I think I did exactly this routine the other day when my toilet backed up and flooded the bathroom, and I was trying not to get toilet water on my socks.
Jeeez I go harder than those two when I'm walking to the bar full of piss.
Jimmy Pesto Jr. all grown up
Jesus wept
All filler no killer.
This is what we refer to in the breakdance community as "whack".

Seriously, what was the selection process for this. I have been in the scene for about 15 years now, But even I know a few girls that are leagues better than whoever raygun is.
I've seen drunks dance way better than this at the clubs
Can‚Äôt believe someone saw this and actually thought this was Olympic-ready
jonah takalua would be ashamed
Muppet
Looks like something from a Fatboy Slim video.
He looks like he‚Äôs trying to unstick his ball sack from his thigh
She has no style and neither does this imbecile.
Me when I have too much cough syrup
The sound effects from the audience is the best part.
Don't do that
WTF is this try hard shit?
Fark me go see the chemical brothers and hire Sammy the salmon I‚Äôm sure he could do better
He should change his breaker name to Grand Mal
And the crowd goes mild.
Her coach is her husband
Is he the Free because no one would pay to watch him?
Is this a Flowers for Charlie situation where some stupid science bitches just give these people a placebo pill and constant praise?
You know what‚Äôs sad? I‚Äôm sure we have some absolute killer breakdancers in AUS. But that‚Äôs what we will always be known for now. Such a shame
I can't even begin to imagine attending some thing like this. How cringe.
What the fuck has happened to breakdancing. It used to be cool...
Their lives are like an SNL sketch.
Jesus this is so cringe
Breaking has never been the same since they stopped calling it break dancing
I swear these people are just trolling your country at this point.

All i see is disrespect coming from this pair. For Australia and for the origins of breakdancing and the culture(s) it originated in. 

What an absolute, international farce.
Squash the bug dance?
Jeepers.  Old mate needs to just sit down.
Looks fucking stupid lol
I feel like they need to issue a public apology to the community of break dancing.
These two trolled and pissed off the entire dance community, scored 0 and made themselves look foolish - they also got the sport pulled from 2028 olympics and the entire world to laugh at them. The goats
A routine based on observations of Aussie clubbers pissed as fuck on meth and /or pingers.
Raygun is an Aussie icon and she was robbed. The world just wasn't ready.
So squiggling dancing, not break dancing
I'm so out of the loop?! What's an Olympic breaker?
 No cardboard insight.
Lol to the guy who tried to combine the Melbourne Shuffle, with fluid dance and Breaking... bloody nuffie.
I hope this is all revealed to be a Sasha Baron Cohen type film
He's at least more fluid here.
They're gonna call this Australian breakdance aren't they...
That banner says ‚ÄúGolden Flow‚Äù because they‚Äôre taking the piss, right?
There are 15 years old B Boy videos from Perth on youtube that put this shit to shame.
Anyone can do this, there's no skill. You teach me this ... "movement"... its not a dance, and i could do it the exact same in 2 hours. These people deserve ridicule. Even simple actual breakdancing would take forever, my core strength isn't good enough.

Also, is this idiot living in the 90's when baggy jeans and loose shirts were cool? Dude peaked in highschool.

Edit: Her PHD was on breakdancing?! How can you think anything resembling this is breakdancing if you're so ingrained into the scene? How did she even qualify for the Olympics??
My friend told me she's considered one of the greatest professionals in break dancing in Australia, but every video of her or related to her is telling me a completely different story. I don't dance and even I think she made Australia look like we don't know what break dancing is
Is broken Lego on the floor and red cordial considered doping?
It's like My drunk Aunt and Uncle at my cousins wedding...
I think this might be where she got her style of Breakdancing from cause wow what in the hell was that stuff?‚Ä¶like i could not tell if the guy was being awkward about it or he was trying to make something happen
Where'd you get this footage of me trying to squash a particularly dextrous and agile cockroach on my kitchen floor after coming home from a night out???
I‚Äôm part of a dance community (not breaking, I‚Äôm fucken old and my discs bulge), and there are always people in any scenethat are seen as being objectively good at what they do because they‚Äôre consistently supportive of the community. They apply for and get funding for the group, they organise events, they teach classes, they organise for other people to teach classes. They have a lot of knowledge. But at the end of the day, when they step out of the bubble, they are NOT objectively good dancers, and no one is going to tell them. But they hold the community together.
"style"

It looks like someone with Parkinson's doing a cross between tap dance and interpretive dance.
Reddit and flogging a dead horse, name a more iconic duo¬†
The power of being white and no one telling you that you suck to your face.
Who cares.
The start of his routine could almost fit in a pit
oh...so he cant dance either, that makes sense
Cwalk or breakdance?
I like how one terrible performance has dredged up all these clips.
Is this old? Cause Raygun is 36, and this guy looks
.... not 36.
Track id?
It‚Äôs like that Shane Gillis joke about Australians not being humbled by black people and we end up with stuff like this
Hate when you‚Äôre in the middle of breakdancing and there‚Äôs a fucking cockroach you gotta squish.
Looks like my moves when there was a huntsman in the bathroom.
Who's 'pulling a Raygun' now?¬†

Genuinely fascinating. I love her attitude though. Being delulu is all the rage these days
Maybe a few less ‚Äúsquash the cockroach‚Äù and a few more ‚Äúangry roo‚Äù straight into the pub classic ‚Äúthe Worm‚Äù for the win?
The plot thickens
Giving real principal at the middle-school dance vibes.
I feel like people have stopped calling out bullshit because it makes them seem mean.
Broken dancing
That's his audition for the Ministry of Silly Walks.
It's the jauntiness of it that looks bad. The moves should flow rhythmically - sury that is the very essence of dance. 

I remember seeing this modern dance performance chorigraphied by a guy called Merce Cunningham. It was awful, but I was confused because everyone around me appeared entertained. The dancers were dancing arythmically, with sudden and sometimes bizarre movements. The music was incidental. Did I mention it was awful? This break dancing reminds me of that.
Even the neo Nazis hiding out in the hills in Gippsland lost their white pride today.
Can we leave her alone?
Honestly, this isn't break dancing, it's a form of all-style freestyle ‚Äì probably some house and hip hop elements combined. He's actually not as bad as people are making out to be but not anything you'd consider to be national level or higher.

His timing is a little off and he doesn't seem to have a good feel for the music. If you go to a local freestyle dance session, a lot of people aren't far off this level.
‚ÄúStyle‚Äù
Get off you toy
Ah the classic cringe style
I'm suddenly reminded of Rhonda Rousey, and her trainer Edmond lol
ü§£ü§£ü§£ awful.
Art and hot air ballooning used to be Olympic sports
I have no idea what I'm looking at here. 

Much like the 10m diving...
Call me old fashioned but I believe this is more dancing than the borderline gymnastics routines some people do this day. Keep it old school
CANADA the BEST for me
They come from the land down under, just leave them alone
wtf
I mean this is fine as a hobby but you can‚Äôt call it Olympic level
where's the breakdancing I saw from the 80s? I don't think that this is that at all
Style is a strong word.
The ministry of silly walks
This right here is the perfect example of the Dunning-Kruger effect
Are we sure they're not just all taking the piss. I feel like this could be a joke.
Who's behind the camera hyping them up lmao
Hahaha. Disgraceful
That's not breakdancing
Go read some of her research material - Raygun is a DEI hire 100%.
When getting electrocuted becomes 'art'
The Australian break dancing scene is the wack.
I think his only student as a coach is Dr. Raygun. As if you'd pay money to learn from this guy.
Yup.  She only started breaking when she met him.  It all makes sense now.
Its like you ordered a break dancer off temu
Tell me you‚Äôre 40 without saying your age.
Jesus Christ when are you mouth breathers going to relax. Raygun for prime minister
I guess a couple that is delusional together, stays together?

I get Jo Jo Siwa vibes, anyone else?
Why aren‚Äôt the people watching laughing? Are they trying to be polite?
This is the finest level of dance comedy.
People don‚Äôt understand this is the Australian evolution of break moves.

You know‚Ä¶.like the platypus, kangaroo, wombat, koala, Tasmanian devil‚Ä¶.   

Obligatory /s
Yep he sucks too, he should not be coaching anyone
omg, they think they jammin' AHHHHHHHHAAHAHA! üòÇü§£
Okay I have EDS and extremely stiff hamstrings from toe walking and this looks like something id do by accident while trying to dance.
Average at best
The fuck
Well he doesn‚Äôt really love her then. If she was my wife I would not be encouraging her to humiliate herself on a world stage.
*"GOLDEN FLOW"* seems appropriate for something ***THIS*** pissweak.
They can at least do a backflip right? Right?
What is 'Sammy the Free' Free from??
Oh dear....
Jesus christ. 
Looks like they both think they can do it.
But they just look like they‚Äôre both having a fit.
This is interpretive dance, not break dance.
Can't believe they made Phosani's Nightmare from osrs a real thing
Please don't call this style üòÜ
This is what happens when "art" is valued over skill. Elite break dancers are almost more impressive than Olympic gymnasts, or at least on a comparable level. These people are not that
Fake it till you make it is a mantra I live by also but this is.. 

**MAKE SHAME AND EMBARRASSMENT A THING AGAIN PLEASE**
I get the vibe they are trying to shape breaking into some kind of safe space for all expression, inclusivity and whatever the latest phd social trend is.

Breaking is fairly exclusive when it comes to who can do power and skilled moves. Diversity is welcome - as long as you have skills to back it up.
Can't we just focus on the 18 gold medals we've won instead of mercilessly mocking Raygun
Not hard to see why they are dancing alone. Pretty sure that Raygun is Michael J Fox's and Celine Dion's love child.
This has got to be one of the stupidest ‚Äúsports‚Äù
It's great that a couple has a shared hobby and they go to meet ups for their hobby and compete.

But, it's delusional to think you could or should compete at the athletics.
Please tell me this isn't high level breakdancing in Australia, because I could do better than this and I've never breaked (broked? Gone for broke? What's the verb here, brokeback mountained?) a day in my life. I wouldn't normally shit on someone's hobbies because you don't need to be good at your hobbies, but when you coach an olympic athlete you better have some skills of your own.
I‚Äôm genuinely confused as to why everyone seems shocked that an entirely amateur sport is a bit amateur.
Who cares?
I'm not sure why they're putting art in the Olympics anyway. What next? Painting? Music? Theatre?
...am I the only person who think it looks like he's having a lot of fun?
At least it‚Äôs original
That's misogynistic!
Just gotta feel the rhythm and become one with ol‚Äô mate Trevor
Nah, if they were high then they‚Äôd be better

Toxic positivity is a thing
And she said he could easily compete there
and the person who approved them for the Olympics? That person is the worst.

God, can you imagine if they were your upstairs neighbours
Oooooh... Ok, it all makes sense now
I think we found the girl the song Sally was written about.
Did you not read the title of the post?
That is what 'partner' means

100%. Won't happen though, the government never wants to expose just how incompetent they are.
She's the perfect representative! Like, we're not talking about a serious sport at the end of the day.

All the other athletes trying to act like hard kids from the rough streets of like, Finland. Yeah cuzz, west side!!!! Streets 4 lyfe!!!

She's gone "you know what? fuck it! I'm gonna bounce like a kangaroo, squirm like a snake and run around in circles like Homer Simpson doing the woopwoopwoopwoopwoop!"
Fire ants.
All I could see. Just kept thinking "how is that damn cockroach still alive?"
I thought he was Crip walking for a minute
Broke dancing.
Sniffing their own farts.
I was wondering if this was representative of Australian break dancing in general. Some of yall gonna have to popout and show us lol.
Honestly they should both go directly to jail for life.
You know'm sayin' everybody that walk on the face of the Earth tryin' to judge the J-ROC, know'm sayin'? See wha'm sayin'? But I ain't shook, 'cause ma-fuckas tryin' to take me out and stuff, but they can't, right? Know'm sayin'?
I‚Äôm guessing it was an ‚Äòemperor‚Äôs new clothes‚Äô situation. They might be quite charismatic in real life, and everyone just yes-manned them for years.
If her wiki page is to be believed. She has been breaking for 15 years, training 3-4 hours per day, with a couple years gap for her PhD.
Her husband. Who introduced her to breaking years ago.
We‚Äôre obviously using the word ‚Äòcoach‚Äô loosely
‚ù§Ô∏è Bobs
Well said.
I've read somewhere that he was on the selection panel
They didn‚Äôt know what seizures were.
Shut up Ranga
I've never seen you dance but i think you'd do better on cough syrup.
It has to be Raygun behind the camera, right? Because nobody else could think those moves were fire.
*Let me introduce to you a brand new dance*
Did you actually watch any of it? J-Attack was exactly that.
I follow a few local dancers, they don't even find this whole thing funny, just upsetting. Because we do have plenty of amazing female breakdancers who just weren't given the opportunity.
Well, it's kinda our fault for bringing so much attention to Raygun and ignoring the other guy.
Room full of 50yr old break dancers: ‚Äúwe still cool, we still cool!‚Äù
This is what you would normally see when someone takes too many shrooms at a bushdoof and gets stuck in a muddy puddle.
Ohhh I‚Äôm push this opinion so hard for no reason at all.

She‚Äôs the Vegemite of dance.
The internet was ready üí£
Seriously though, all revolutionary artists are ridiculed before they are venerated.

There's a greater than zero probability that she's doing a whole new style of dancing.
I agree with everything apart from the clothes comment! He‚Äôs actually trying hard to be in style with the younger people. This type of outfit is what all of the younger generation are wearing, 90s and early Y2K is back in style. It‚Äôs cringe because he‚Äôs nearly 40
Sammy the Free and Raygun
I was getting early 2000's Killswitch Engage vibes.
that the 'joke' where he called chinese gooks?
So many great comments on that video lmao

>All the kids at school used to laugh at me until I learned to dance from this video. Now they laugh AND beat me up.
Yep, enough of the pile on.
She isn't good enough to compete in breakdancing AT ALL, let alone in the Olympics. The whole thing is a joke.
>we've

You and I haven't won any medals. Stop trying to live vicariously through others just because they live in the same border as you
It's honestly erring on the side of cyber bullying, especially when they start involving their family members etc.
No this is just two white theatre kids from Hornsby butchering something that came from the Bronx.
This isn't even breakdancing. Most people here seem to be judging this as breakdancing when...its not really breakdancing. This is some sort of all-styles freestyle dance competition because his movements are some mixture of house and hip hop.
Then you need to look at the history of the Olympics.
What rhythm
Agreed‚Ä¶ this is what sober breakdancing after a massive egg & bacon breakfast looks like. No shrooms or weed here, just a dirty chai latte and side of avo.
they mean high on their own bullsh!t (not drugs).
*Gestures widely around the open plan office*
That would be the ballroom dancing body of Australia. They were responsible for the breakdancing oceanic qualifier championship that she won. 
They‚Äôve tried and failed to get ballroom dancing into the Olympics for ions. Absorbed breakdancing when it was announced as an Olympic sport.
You should see them make love it's.... Freestyle
*hiphop-less
Lmao nope
Missed that part in the header my bad
Thats pretty unfair to those participants who do take it seriously and had trained hard to get there. Would you say the same if it was swimming and someone just fucked around took the piss?
Oh jog on mate. 

If you don't like the sport, that's fine, but they were all friendly as fuck towards one another. Nobody was trying to "act hard" in the slightest.

She made an embarrassment of herself, while 15 others got up there and showed actual skill, rhythm, full-body strength, and love for the culture.
If the sport is included in an official competition then it should be taken seriously. Also, have you actually seen good breakdancers? It‚Äôs absolutely a sport and an amazing one to watch.
First off, I'm sure there are rough areas in any country. Secondly, breaking has grown so far from being a "poor kid" thing. They are not "acting hard" they are "serving attitude" because that's the culture. Have you ever worn a baseball cap? Do you actually play baseball? Stop acting like a fucking jam sponge and keep your dumfuck opinions to yourself.
They've had their own comps for years.

Go watch a couple and then tell me these two are representative.
[deleted]
I normally will defend sports when people say something isn‚Äôt a sport. 

But breakdancing isn‚Äôt a sport. It had to be assisted in setting itself up to be a sport to comprte in the Olympics. 

It‚Äôs a brillaint art form, tough as hell, but it wasn‚Äôt a sport prior to being in the Olympics and likely won‚Äôt be one after.
mate it's a big athletics carnival. sport is inherently unserious
Yep. Trying to kill the Fire ants, but a few of them have managed to run up his leg.
J Attack performed 100 times better in the men's category than this dude. And he's only a teenager. Also, some Korean OGs like bboy blond moved to Australia and competed in crew battles with local Aussies. So there definitely is way more talent than the memes being spread around
Do not collect $200
That‚Äôs too many know‚Äôm sayins
And her PhD was about.... break dancing....
Just goes to show, you don't need to have talent or skill to be successful.
Puck you miss!
I think this proves the point, the amount of people talking about raygun compared to J-attack is telling. Nobody is going to remember j-attack in a year or so, but a meme of raygun or a do you remember video of raygun being posted over and over is all that's going to come from australia break dancing at the olympics. I watched J attack and thought it was a skilled performance but I'm not going to remember it like I will raygun because that shit is unforgettable¬†
Did that not enter the qualifiers?  I feel like it's a lot of moaning from people who didn't show up when asked to.
I've seen people call her Napoleon Vegemite
Like Vegemite, leaving the haters tasting salty.
She‚Äôs the Vegemite of dance.


Yeh but missing the bread, and butter, and knife to spread.. she‚Äôs really just left  a bad taste in your mouth really
>There's a greater than zero probability that she's doing a whole new style of dancing.

It's just a shame its not breakdancing.
No if you read my comment I said ‚ÄúAustralians‚Äù
Eh 'we' pay the taxes that go to the exorbitant budget that helps all these people become world class athletes.
This is well deserved criticism. They've embarrassed the breaking scene in an entire country. In saying that i do not support anyone messaging them or focusing this on them... but we're certainly allowed to discuss it, even if that means negative opinions.
4D Chess. You gotta move on the beats between the beats, the ones only the blindest jazz cats can find.. and then you take some muscle stiffeners and get dancing!
That is the major problem here , I wonder what they hear when they listen to music
Caffeine is a ridiculously bad drug.
Everything the sound touches, is your stomping ground
No please no.
It's pretty hard to take the piss in a lot of events though due to objective performance criteria, and I think that's the point. When something is so subjective, it opens it up to questionable moments. In all honestly, fair play to the contestants who trained and competed, but it just shouldn't be an olympic sports.
They wouldn't make the team because there are minimum standards to team selection.  That's the point. It's dance, it is subjective, and there are no standards. Even something you think is similar, like rhythmic gymnastics or ballroom, has standards and moves you have to do.  There are things you can measure, did they do the move to the standard.  This was just, whose stuff do we like more and is most like the stuff we see in the movies.
I would take hope that I still have a chance of getting to the olympics
Olympic or not, If you can‚Äôt have fun while playing games then maybe change the name and make it clear that having fun is frowned upon.
You mean like Eric the Eel?
Ah, lighten up mate.

You reckon we should have sent some girl wearing a giant white t-shirt, gold chain and saggy jeans? Wearing a constipated look of self-importance as she "serves attitude", yo? 

Raygun's performance was my favourite thing in the whole Olympics, and people are missing out if they can't see the funny side. It's the closest thing to a real-life Kath & Kim episode that's ever occurred.

"And now, a special treat for all you kids. Our very own Dr Rachel Gunn PhD is proud to bring you this demonstration of Hip and Hop Dancing. Raygun's urban stylings reminds us all that serving attitude, street style, is open to all of us."

People are taking this shit too seriously.
Kontula?
It's fundamentally no different to rhythmic gymnastics which has been in the Olympics for a long time.
100% agree. Saw his performance about 5 min after I made the last comment. 16 and doing work! Can't wait to see him in 4 years bring it all the way home! 

I talk shit but I can't dance either. Just seemed off that raygunn made to this level. I also haven't watched my own country's performances lol.
I don't understand how someone who obviously loves it so much, could really watch a video of her competitors and say "yep I'm on that level "
But he's got red herrr
Yeah this is gonna overshadow it. I'm just making the point that we do have talent in it, cause it was on display at these games.
It is far more complicated than 'they should have entered' and the whole story is why this thing is a complete farce.

When a sport enters the olympics it is organised and overseen by that sports governing body as selected by the IOC. In the case of breaking, there isn't really a governing body, so how did it get in the olympics?

The answer is World DanceSport Federation. They are a governing body that runs international ballroom competitions in several categories. They wanted ballroom dancing in the olympics. 

The IOC however rejected the idea of ballroom dancing, they wanted something targeted towards the youth. So WDSF pivoted the pitch, breaking. Somehow they managed to convince the Paris officials and the IOC to allow them to run break dancing for the olympics, despite the fact they were not a governing body for break dancing.

The end result of all this politics is that to qualify for the olympics you have to be a member of the DanceSport Federation. Australia has a Dancesport Federation, which of course was not involved in breaking at all.

Then comes along AusBreak. This small breaking competition based in Sydney, that Raygun belongs. They are essentially a small group of break dancers that run a competition every year, scoring dancers across different events and coming up with a yearly ranking. 

For women, there are usually 10-15 people registered and it is the same few people year after year that actually show up regularly to events and score points for the competition, one of them is Raygun.

This small group of essentially friends who run an annual dance competition, connected with DanceSport Australia and managed to become the break dancing representative for DanceSport Australia. 

You should see where this is going. This small group of friends are now the official governing body of break dancing in Australia as far as the IOC is concerned. The rest is history. They run their competition, Raygun wins and they select her as the olympic representative. 

Unless you were in Sydney and part of this specific break dancing scene, you probably were not even aware qualifiers were even happening.
The skills were a bit thinly spread.
Not to your taste mate, that‚Äôs your deal.

She represents Australia, and I felt represented as hell.
he seems like a perfectly normal not racist guy
We also fund art schools so musicians learn instruments. I wouldn't walk past a busker, look into his money cup and say "wow, we are earning a lot of money today".
Criticism is one thing, but most of the comment here are insults.
Very underrated assessment! Genius summation.

If something as stupid as Dressage, which is literally getting a horse to dance, can be in the Olympics (since the 1920‚Äôs) than breakdancing can be too. 

The actual competition between the finalists was super entertaining and all the competitors seemed like a fun bunch of people who showed amazing sportsmanship between each other. That last point was a fresh way to end as this olympics has shown a notable [decline in sportmanship](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2024/08/olympics-sore-losers/679390/)

Strong disagree. 

Rhythmics has an orginisation and a set way to judge. 

Breakdancing doesn‚Äôt have that
There‚Äôs a lot more athleticism in rhythmic gymnastics. They incorporate quite a bit of gymnastics into their routine.
Except for the built up systems and grassroots culture that gymnastics already has.

Would've much rathered see some odd sports that already have governing bodies, chase tag or ultimate Frisbee or something along those lines.
Rhythmic gymnasts can do somersaults and have more skill. They can catch a hoop with their ankle. They don‚Äôt jump around like a kangaroo.
There was a comment from her that went something along the lines of.. "I can't compete at that level so I want to be memorable.." mega paraphrasing because I read the article a few days ago but that was the gist
According to articles RayGun was a founder of AusBreak too. It‚Äôs a small group so wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if she and her coach husband basically ran the thing. Would explain why/how she selected herself to go lol
That makes sense. I'm from Perth and whilst I haven't been in the scene for a few years, there's some amazing talent to be found that would have represented us a lot better.
You‚Äôve been represented as hell by a zero.. literally, that‚Äôs what the judges scored her performance.
You seem literate
Nor is anyone walking by the fox sisters houses and taking their gold. This isn't a commune.

Dressage is the most technically difficult of the three equestrian disciplines in the olympics - it requires significant technique and is essentially a test of how well you can communicate very minimal commands for complicated physical movements. Your average rider would probably be able to get closer to the peak of show jumping or cross country as both are more about pure altheticism. Dressage is asking whether horses and riders are physically fit enough to perform the moves required, as well as how they execute them - there is no execution score for cross country or show jumping. 

A leiman‚Äôs assessment of whether something ‚Äòlooks cool‚Äô is a terrible yardstick for whether something is difficult or should be in the olympics. Equestrian has a long and well established standard - breakdancing lacks the formalised standards and breadth of competition required for this level of sport (at least for now).
Didn't the French finalist mime pulling down the pants and mocking the size of a child's penis on stage?
Yea it's weird when people single out breakdancing.
That‚Äôs terrible.
If she knew she couldn‚Äôt compete; then she shouldn‚Äôt have. She took away the opportunity from someone she could and she‚Äôs done so poorly that it‚Äôll likely set back the whole culture in Australia.

If someone from Australia competed and did well; you‚Äôd bet that that‚Äôd kick it interest in the sport, maybe some clubs, some government funding, tournaments etc. 

She did the opposite
The Aus Olympic heads trying to guilt the public about shaming her when she basically selected herself from a pool of nobodies. She deserves what she gets.
I feel like a 0 represents my ability to breakdance, so spot on there.
So stop saying we. They're just people that are good at a sport. Stop worrying about where they come from and just enjoy the athleticism. It doesn't matter who wins or where they're from
I haven't seen any news that suggests that occurred.
Why not do both? And we do take pride in our national arts successes too. But keep being bitter my bro we'll cheer on anyway.

Ah.

Well that's fucked up.
