Nothing says fair and balanced like the person who gives you favourable coverage when you leak confidential documents to them.

Honestly, I am yet to see anything come out in this case that has really shown Linda in a good light. I'm really not seeing any damages being awarded.
Linda "Eric Cartman" Reynolds. She even throws tantrums like he does.
Albrechtsen is an IPA director and ex-chairman.

Fair and balanced? Utterly partisan.
To be fair to Linda Reynolds - who is otherwise coming across as thin-skinned, self-serving, vindictive and heartless - at least she is capable of original thought.

Because I can guarantee that no-one has ever used the words “fair”, “balanced”, “Janet” and “Albrechtsen” in the same sentence before.

Next she’ll be telling the court that she thinks Andrew Bolt is open-minded and evidence-based in his opinions.

Delusional.
“Fair and balanced”? Not based off the 200+ articles from The Australian (with 20-30 from Albrechtsen herself) that I’ve just had to read for my PhD thesis, she isn’t…!!!!
I'm actually amazed Samantha Maiden was given the free reign she seemed to have at News Corp to report on Reynolds but especially Porter, her coverage on the Porter allegations was top notch
I'm following the Linda Reynolds case where she has admitted leaking confidential documents to a journalists, and having text conversations with BLs lawyer. It looks like the sort of own goal the previous two high profile defamation cases made. Is it bad advice or their ego pushing this?
Isn't/wasn't "fair and balanced" literally the slogan for Fox News? Fucking hell Linda
Based on what has been revealed so far, it really doesn’t seem like Linda has come to court with clean hands. I don’t know if she’s going to get the outcome that she wants from this, unless what she wants is to inflict as much pain on Brittany as possible.
As fair and balanced as Fox News? That's damning praise if I ever heard it.
Martin Bennett has the same taste in ties as he does in clients.
I quite like Janet Albrechtsen's writing - however would never describe it as "fair" or "balanced".
I so hope reynolds loses and is made to pay all costs...
If I had any doubt that Reynolds was an abominable person, it's gone now
Hmmmm. It’s almost like the term “lying cow” could be appropriate this instance? 🧐
She's coming out looking better than Bruce Lehrmann, I'll give her that much, but that's primarily by virtue of not being a rapist.
I'm not seeing anything from Reynolds so far that paints her as a victim. 

I see Reynolds and Higgins copping a dressing down from the judge and that'll be it. Case thrown out at best.
TY, I had much the same vibe. Narcissist? Moi?
"Eric Cartman" lmaoooo
Linda like Cartman has been known to eat all the chicken skin from the kfc bucket before her liberal colleagues show up for lunch.
Planet Janet.
To be fair, " fair and balanced" means a different thing to liberal politicians than everyday people. Reynolds is transactional. She gives a leak, gets favourable article. A " fair" transaction.
> I believe she was fair and balanced,” Reynolds said. (It was an interesting choice of words, given it was the original slogan adopted by Fox News when it launched in the US in 1996.)
are you referring to convicted racist Andrew Bolt?
I assume your Doctorate is going to be in masochism
NewsCorp is actually pretty decent when it comes to *actual* news reporting. The problem is that much of the stuff that ends up being popular is instead opinion dressed up as news.
I know it's not as bad as raping but sticking the boots into a rape victim is up there
...that we know of
Agreed, it's strange. 

This whole week has basically been Reynolds admitting on the stand to failing in her duty of care to Britney during the rape/investigation and subsequent actions of going above and beyond in the whole mess while the victim is saying STOP.

And this trial is just more of the same. And somehow she's the victim yet she's given no evidence that she is actually a victim just that her feelings were hurt by people other than the person she's suing.
Moon it.
I actually think she kind of worse. While I don't believe Lehrmann at all, people have a right to defend themselves.


Lydia heard about a rape allegations made about someone else and thought she should cover it up to make sure she don't look bad.
Going by the article, she's also a serial pest who just loves to sue people.
Her response was to sue the person that, as established already in court, was raped in her workplace by another one of her employees.


I really feel like it's flying under the radar just how vile that is.
She’s not suing about the rape allegation, so many people on this sub have zero idea what this case is actually about.
She's suing because the rape victim criticised her for the handling of the aftermath of her rape in her workplace.


No matter how you spin it, it's absolutely vile that Reynolds is going through with this court case.  Surely even if she does feel unfairly defamed she's capable of saying "jeez probably better I don't sue someone that was raped by one of my employees in my workplace, she's suffered more than I have".


Unthinkable levels of evil. 
> She's suing because the rape victim criticised her for the handling of the aftermath of her rape in her workplace.

No, she isn't.
