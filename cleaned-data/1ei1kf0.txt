Because every newspaper in Qld is owned by Murdoch and the LNP have nothing to offer voters, so it's the old 'Law and Order' chestnut. 


Especially so after the Mineral Council's campaign of 'mining royalties are killing Qld jobs' fell flat. 
Because RW media wants to keep the power structure in place, and that “us” and “them” truly are different. The unspoken entity casting a shadow over you and I? Murdoch media, a societal cancer.
Dig into that data in a bit more detail and you find the crime is still there. It's not the number of crimes that are down, it's the number of criminals. If one kid steals 46 cars over 6 months it's classified as single offender.

To quote: *"The latest Children's Court Annual Report indicates 17 percent of all youth offenders account for 48 per cent of all youth crime" ..."QGSO data shows that as the rate of youth offenders has decreased, those who do come before the courts are, on average, facing more charges"*

Coupled with recent high profile youth crime events like Toutai Kefu facing off kids holding a sickle, Emma Lovell's driveway murder, that 10yo boy raping an Italian tourist in Cairns - people remember that shit.

Because it’s the same group of offenders, committing more and more offences until they do something incredibly heinous like murder someone.

“When the government suspended the Human Rights Act to introduce a new criminal offence for children breaching technical bail conditions, it justified the move by saying that 17% of youth offenders commit almost half of the offences. This amounted to, it claimed, an “exceptional crisis situation”.

QGSO data shows that as the rate of youth offenders has decreased, those who do come before the courts are, on average, facing more charges.”

Edit: we also have more people victims of assault which is what people actually are concerned about.

“The most recent police data shows that while youth offences have dropped across the state, **“offences against the person” have increased.”**
Queensland crime has been up so that might effect people's perception of youth crime going up.

Large corporations influence opinions of voters. I wonder which large corporations want a different Queensland government?  

Could it be the same type of corporations that toppled several Prime Ministers a decade ago?
My local community Facebook page documents every dodgy character including kids looking for car keys. It’s like a war zone if you visit often enough. But if you stay away from Facebook it’s peaceful and crime free, pretty much.
No one gonna point that while overall crime is down, crime against persons is up?

Alternate headline: ‘Queensland police data show that violent youth crime is up, and it will be a key issue this election.’

But of course you are all marks for guardian propaganda.
It seems many of the commenters live in the South East Qld bubble and vote left. They are not from Townsville or Cairns or Mt Isa where youth crime is a major problem. They don’t see it so it must be a media conspiracy. 

Blaming the LNP or the Murdoch media for “hysteria” getting really tedious when every day victims are getting invaded in their homes or car jacked 

Downvote me as much as you like. I don’t give a fuck.
The media loves, just LOVES, pushing the fear narrative.
Because youth crime is way up in Far North Queensland and Alice Springs, perhaps? 

It isn't country or even statewide, but it sure seems that there are communities that feel like they are on the brink of anarchy.
Maybe because it’s the same group of people committing the same shit over and over then getting let out on bail? Queensland is one thing, but I’ll tell you something about rural Victoria; it’s getting to the point where they’re not even bothering with the cops and just handling it themselves.
You can make anything an issue or not an issue by just reporting on it more or less.
Define crime. Is it those who are convicted?
It gets boomers hard that's why.
Because we still personally know people having their houses invaded, in daylight. I'm talking Saturday family breakfast home invasions.  I believe the stats, but that doesn't help the terrified victims much, as men walk into their homes.
Because the LNP have nothing else.
Election coming up
M U R D O C H  M E D I A
The police data will show a ‘decrease’ in youth crime - not because youth are offending less, but because police are diverting more youth crime via alternative action thus avoiding the youth court. This has been happening in NZ for the last 10 years. Youth crime is going up but the stats show a downward trend.
Between the 'youth crime crisis', the 'african gang crisis' and the more recent 'violence against women crisis', Australia is suffering through a 'crisis crisis'.

Our lives are being upended by one crisis or another that makes the streets unsafe, dominates the headlines, and has people clamouring for authoritarianism, censorship, and more policing. It's making it hard to function.

When is a politician going to address the crisis crisis that's gripping our nation?
>So why the ‘tough on crime’ election talk?

Because if the public *thinks* there's a youth crime wave, they will vote for whoever they think will fix that problem. In this discussion, facts don't matter.

The fact that youth crime is at a record low, doesn't matter.

The fact that "tough on crime" approaches for youth crime almost always make youth crime worse, doesn't matter.

The fact that these approaches are usually stupidly expensive, as well as making the problem worse, doesn't matter.

The fact that reducing youth crime hinges more on providing far better services to the locations with higher youth crime, doesn't matter.

The only thing that matters are votes. In an election year, both parties would happily set fire to the entire country and everyone in it, if they thought they'd win votes for doing so. This is true of some parties more than others, but they're both guilty of doing bad policy for populist reasons.
They say there lies, damned lies and statistics. Police and governments are incentivised to report lower youth crime figures, media outlets are incentivised to report higher rates of crime. The average citizen is left wondering which is more accurate.
Same reason the Albo govt is claiming an epidemic of violence against women and children... create fear and hysteria and then throw big dollars and push through legislation that helps to further the Labor parties UN agenda all for him to appear as the knight in shining armour to capture the female and feminist male vote.  

Politics 101:  Create a crisis - promote policies to resolve crisis to cash in on irrational voter emotion..
Maybe spend more time on getting all those rape kits tested and clear up the courts so we can persecute the eventual perpetrators.
There's a "if those kids could read" meme in here somewhere
Coz it’s all that worm, Crisafulli, has. The miles govt is doing just fine, but there’s a lot of community sentiment regarding youth crime and worm boy is riding that wave.
It's because people vote on fear. It's the easiest primal emotion to exploit. I mean, movies like V for Vendetta blatantly lay it to bear and yet many people will still fall for it for various reasons like racism, ephebiphobia, etc...
Murdoch media.
>The Labor government has twice suspended the state’s Human Rights Act

... so it's more of a Privileges act than a Rights act, if you can suspend it.
It’s the RWNJ way; keep people fearful and make out they are tough guys who can save the people.
People I know who are otherwise centrist or even left leaning seem to be bringing up "youth crime" as the number one issue. Not sure where they are getting their news, maybe their drunk uncle or the bloke down the pub (which could be the same person).  It's happened three times recently. Didn't think they'd be 2GB listeners.
As others have started - there are two reasons for this fixation on youth crime:

1. Murdoch media - beyond just the Courier Fail, but also Sky News and his merry band of fuckwit bobbleheads like Credlin and Bolt
2. Facebook - I've given up on my community page because it was a cesspit of "saw this dodgy youth in a hoody" shit.
If you're a hammer everything looks like a nail
Because it sells well to the media, despite lots of evidence that is bad for everyone involved, but especially the taxpayers.

There are far more effective ways to reduce the crime, but no politician will advocate for them, despite the fact that they are both proven, and far cheaper than incarceration
Same thing as crypto. When the moneys good, when there something to deal with it’s all silent.

When the scammers and charlatans come out the moneys gone bad.
lmao people crying about the media like a 6% drop means any change happened on the streets
Because it is easy to scare Boomers... That is ACA's target audience and they have been on the air for over 50 years.
Because the commercial TV networks profit on pushing fear..  haven’t watched FTA tv for decades but saw some ads while watching olympic & have realised that nothing has changed.

My favourite bit of the mineral councils attack was their backwards logic that our minerals are our nest egg that pay for hospitals and schools so we should stop getting money from them in order to pay for hospitals and schools.
This article is cherry picked data. Youth Crime is up but this article removes repeat offenders from its stats
Really interesting.
The Courier Mail and Cairns Post wouldn't have any content if they told the truth.
One of the better decisions new zealand made was keeping murdoch media out. But now its leaking in through social media and other forms
... and until the rest of us have the balls to call it "Murdoch media" and make that a phrase of universal understanding, Western democracy will die.

Everyone hates him but there is no unity whatsoever in resisting him.

People have to ask why his employees are on panels, being interviewed, why his headlines are the basis of debates.  The ABC are probably the worst offender in keeping him relevant outside his own publications.
The data shows both the number of offenders AND the number of offences.

According to the story both are down, not just the number of offenders:

“The QPS said offence numbers dropped by a greater amount (6.7%) last financial year.”
The article literally says both the number of offenders and offences is down.
That's really interesting, thanks.

Focusing on the 'rate' data because that's the only apples for apples measure in an expanding population, it has indeed been going up recently, especially since a natural.drop during covid times.

At the same time, the historical data there goes back to 2001 and every crime looks much lower than then, although low volume ones like murder jump all over the place. It was a really good run from 2001 to about 2015.

So maybe going up a bit but I would assume disproportionately in some towns where it's risen heaps?
A lot of people focussing on the legacy media, but these huge Facebook community pages are absolutely wild. You would think these towns are downtown Mogadishu.
You’re exactly right:

“Queensland’s overall crime rate decreased 15.4 per cent since 2001, although much of those declines are attributable to city areas such as Brisbane.

Queensland’s overall crime rate was 1,087 per 100,000 offenders in January 2001 but decreased to 920 in February 2024.

Outback Queensland had the highest crime rates, with North and Far North Queensland having some of the worst rates.

The Northern police district, which includes Townsville and Mount Isa, has bucked statewide trends and seen crime worsen over the last 20 years.”

We had Taskforce Guardian up here in Townsville again recently. It's almost like there is, in fact, a youth crime issue.
Couldn't agree more. My fam is in Townsville - there is most definitely a youth crime wave - and cops do next to nothing (because they can't). Don't get me wrong - just arresting/jailing these kids is not going to solve anything - it is a social services issue and requires a lot of intervention when kids are born to get families on the right track - but to pretend there isn't a problem is wrong.

My sister went to take her kids to the local park to ride their bikes but cops were there - kids as usual had stolen a car and were busy doing burnouts in the park. The cops just told her to stay out of the park for the duration of the holidays.
How much is crime up? How do you know? Which crimes are up? Genuine question, not having a go.
Then why don't the statistics reflect the supposed reality?
The data I'd like to see is how many home invasions or robberies and car thefts are from unforced entry vs forced entry. 

As much as these little shits shouldn't be getting into houses and taking car keys, I still believe that people should be taking responsibility and all precautions to stop it happening. 

Something makes me wonder if we aren't getting the full picture here.
It’s pretty well understood at this point that both legacy media and social media have an incentive to push negative content because it drives engagement. Engagement means more clicks, more clicks means advertisers pay more. Driving the fear narrative keeps people more engaged with the negative content. Simple as that.
Because its what the general public loves to hear about, probably.
Townsville, Alice Springs, Port Augusta etc all have a large youth crime issue.   Go to other towns / regional cities and crime is down and it's really safe.
the fact that it's not state or nation-wide to me means that being "tough on crime" isn't the answer here. if the punishments or lack thereof was the issue, the problem would be present everywhere that those punishments exist, which is everywhere, that's not the case.

these issues need to be looked at closely in those specific areas and addressing the differences between those areas and others that actually leads to this high level of youth crime

i.e. socio-economic status, education, living conditions, support structures, employment opportunities etc

when those issues can't be addressed broadly, we need to look at what has worked in the past, what has been shown scientifically to reduce crime rates in youth (it's not higher incarceration or "being tougher")

One of these things is not like the others

20201/22 ABS data shows an average of 13 women a day were hospitalized due to domestic violence. 

On average a woman is killed every 9 days by her partner or ex. https://www.ourwatch.org.au/quick-facts

This one I am happy to call a crisis. For the down voters, when would it be a crisis? 20, 25 women a day in hospital?
Good thing that you don't have to just sit there and scratch your head, you can educate yourself on how statistics work and interrogate the data that they presented, which does in fact show that on the whole, rates of crime are down.
Youth crime offenses went 49000 in 2019 to 45000 in 2023. In the same time the number of articles (Online from ABC, The Guardian and SMH) reporting youth crime went from less then 50 articles in 2019 to 1020 articles in 2023. So yes people are rightfully pointing out that a 2000% increase in reporting does not match 6% drop in crime
Yea exactly. Not to mention the hydro projects that were going to create thousands of jobs in regional Queensland, who they claim to care about.
I honestly don’t understand how anyone in QLD would vote LNP over Labor.   

We just got $1000 credit on our electricity, bus rides are going to be 50c a ticket and we’re getting 20% off Rego.  Thanks to mining royalties.  My local area is getting a new $28 million police station upgrade, helipad and an additional 150 police officers for the region which is desperately needed due to a post covid population boom.

LNP have nothing to offer.
It’s the goose that lays the golden eggs… so make sure Gina and Clive get all the omelettes, otherwise the goose will die
pfft, the scores on the sports pages are usually true
Yet they elected  a right wing government that is about to do a Javier Milei on New Zealand. A PM that wants to end public funded healthcare with a playbook that was given to them from Sky News. Bizarre how voters respond and  are favourable to train wreck policies from all around the world.
And youth recidivism rates are at record highs.

“On average, youth offenders were caught committing 44 per cent more crimes than nine years ago, from 2.7 offences per youth offender to 3.9.”

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-04-22/queensland-violence-on-rise-report-shows-not-just-youth-crime/103751192
I took the above from the article.

**"QGSO data shows that as the rate of youth offenders has decreased, those who do come before the courts are, on average, facing more charges.”**
What about the severity of the offences? Ten less stolen mars bars but one extra murder isn’t a good outcome.
There are a lot of factors to take into account.  

Increased population, increased rent, increased property prices, increased cost of living across all areas, stagnate wage growth, low skilled work (non-trade/non-degree) like manufacturing all outsourced overseas while localised low skilled work like seasonal harvesting and  abattoirs uses foreign visa programs to avoid paying Australian wages.

Combine that with inter-generational socioeconomic issues like Domestic violence, Drug and alcohol abuse, and in some cases the issues related to indigenous Australians unable to adapt to the Euro-Australian culture who instead adopt a rebellious counter-culture.

I haven’t read the statistics posted above yet but I would be very interest to see what the “per capita” crime rates are to see whether it is just increasing with population growth.
I'm curious how accurate the data is, I would have thought that with change in technology that crime would go down, being easier to convict. 

I have distrust in government organisations like this, I wonder if others do and that's fuelling anger.
Bulimba has become Detroit if you believe the Facebook groups. But people would rather demand the police “do something” or vote in a change of government than replace their flimsy louvre windows with something more secure and lock their cars in a garage at night. 
Had to chuckle over the image of Townsville running out of lattes, Chardonnay and quinoa as entire hotels are filled with slightly left-leaning journos furiously typing out opinion pieces
75% of Qld's population lives in SEQ. A 10% decrease in crime in SEQ combined with a 20% increase everywhere else nets out to a 2.5% decrease overall. Averages can be deceiving, and don't necessarily reflect the experience of individual communities.
It's naive to assume that the media don't also push particular narratives for political reasons as well.
Stop dancing around it, we know what you're trying to say
Of course not.
I don't think anyone wants to minimise the victims of violence against women. Or victims of youth crime, or victims of break ins, or victims of refugee crime, or victims of any other sort of crime for that matter. It's great that these issues are being looked at. But there is a pretty clearly defined line between drawing attention to important issues, and spreading fear and panic and cynically using the issue to further an agenda.

From the police chief saying that the Bondi attacked was targeting women based on a guess, to the recent calls for internet censorship, banning kids from social media, to thoughtless appeals to be tougher on crime.... There are definitely moments when the conversation; as important as it is; danced over that aforementioned line.
I have no idea, either. They keep delivering.
"Usually."

If *that* doesn't say what you need to know...
Social media is literally being used by bad actors to hack democracy. 

And they are winning. 

Support for conservative policies is at an all time low, but conservatives keep getting elected because they are allowed to lie about their platform without consequence, and they are enabled by the media.  People are being tricked into voting against their interests, and we are letting it destroy our common weal and our habitat.
The issue is in our multi party govt, the largest party normally sets the schedule. But this one is a weak idiot whos just giving away everything to the two minor extremist parties, or claiming their policies as his. He was that desperate to be pm he just gave it all away.

Problem being most people voted AGAINST the prior govt, not for this one so most people didnt even question it. That and the fact they are doing things no one actually voted for doesnt help. They'll be the first one term govt in modern times.
So if members of society are less likely to be criminals, but criminals are more likely to continue being criminals, what does that say about the effectiveness of our prison system? About the effectiveness of those morons who just say lock em up and you’ll fix crime?
A smaller group of offenders committing a large number of crimes does not mean the overall number of offences is up.

>The QPS said offence numbers dropped by a greater amount (6.7%) last financial year.
Homicide is down.
You're right but how is the solution being "tougher" than throwing kids in the same building as rapists and other sex offenders?


Because we are already being pretty dam barbaric with these kids in north QLD and they don't give a shit, nothing we do to them could be worse than home anyway.
If you go to "Advanced" you can toggle to "Rates" which  I think is per 100K head of population (couldn't find an axis key).

Normally I'm that "well actually" guy saying crime has gone down. It has here in NSW but the QLD stats are different. Sharp drops consistently since 2001 and now an uptick (but still way lower than 2001).

Didn't slice by region. Assaults are way up though. Wonder if that's ice? Might be the main contributor to the overall stats but I'd need to download into Excel to have a proper look. And it's a sunny Saturday :)
I'd say that the data wonks aren't manipulating things. I've known and worked with too many. They're really meticulous about churning the data accurately and will be the first to point out in notes things like "there was this change in definition X in 2018 so be aware that data pre and post can't be directly compared for that" etc.

If there's any bias I'd guess it comes at the data capture end, e.g. cop hierarchy ruling it's mandatory to record every DV allegation or whatever?

Or maybe if a dataset is reporting convictions, and offenders are routed away from the courts to something else?
You'd think Townsville is the Ukraine the way they carry on in the Facebook groups as well.
I didn’t suggest they don’t. That’s definitely a part of it too. But enriching themselves makes justifying the political agenda easier. A win win as they would tell themselves.
Systemically addressing poverty and inequality with a strong social safety net? Properly funded schools with well-paid teachers? Yes, so glad you knew this is what they were trying to say!
what?
No one in minimizing the victims but they are minimizing the extent of the issue of violence against women by comparing it to things that are fear mongering.
Literally the only thing I didn’t like about QLD Labor in the last decade was when Anna P went after the Olympics bid for Brisbane.
If all crime is done by a few specific offenders, lock those offenders up permanently and crime is done.
Youth criminals are rarely imprisoned if punished at all.
Can't speak for Qld, but the issue in Vic is that there's basically no punishment at all for youth offenders. So the prison system doesn't work here because it's not used
I never said total offences were up.

I said, "Because it’s the ***same group of offenders, committing more and more offences*** until they do something incredibly heinous like murder someone."

Which is backed up by this, *"****those who do come before the courts are, on average, facing more charges.”***

It's possible for total number of offences to be down, but the offences per individual to increase. People are not worried about kids doing graffiti, they are worried about repeat offenders who have already offended, then comitting more violent offences. These kids then reoffend and end up stabbing someone in a home invasion and killing them.

From an article in April.

“The Queensland Government says a small proportion of “hardcore recidivists” are responsible for the majority of youth crime.

On average, youth offenders were caught committing 44 per cent more crimes than nine years ago, from 2.7 offences per youth offender to 3.9.”

https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-04-22/queensland-violence-on-rise-report-shows-not-just-youth-crime/103751192
Transportation to Australia seemed to work back in the convict days. A lot of them learnt skills and became functional members of society.

Maybe we need a modern equivalent. House prices are fucked in our existing cities. So maybe send them to a remote area to build a new settlement.
> If you go to "Advanced" you can toggle to "Rates" which I think is per 100K head of population (couldn't find an axis key).

Thanks. there's definitely an increase.
It’s not? 

Let’s see: walking while black, walking while black, police chopper, what’s going on at Stocklands?, actual small problem, existing while black. 

Of course I’m kidding, I don’t think it’s as bad here in the ville as many have touted: but try saying that and people get really mad.
Yeah, but they also take their foot off the fear peddle when it suits their political leanings.
it took me a minute but i think they're implying that i was making a comment on the indigenous populations of both areas which I can sorta see how they got there but that was obviously not my intention and i don't think people who are that racist are often spouting talking points about the aforementioned social safety nets lol
Those things can be true and that can also not be an answer. If the orbit of the Earth around the Sun was creating criminals the answer would not be to move the Earth, even if long term that would be the solution. Short term solutions are also valuable in the meantime.
I certainly don’t want another Neuman debacle. That was *fun*

Go and leave the state for a couple of years and they elect him!
That still doesn't back up your point when total number of offences is dropping
You say it worked but there are still plenty of convicts in Australia mate, isn't that the issue according to the "the kids are crime crazy" crowd.


How exactly is it supposed to have worked?
It almost feels like there aren't ever any new posts....It's just copy and paste from last week.
As long as Labor remember that Campbell won that election because Anna Bligh broke the one rule Queenslanders wont stand for: 

Do not privatise!

Campbell Neuman wasn’t so much voted in, rather that Bligh was voted out.
I mean, yes it does. I said the same offenders are committing more crimes.

“On average, youth offenders were caught committing 44 per cent more crimes than nine years ago, from 2.7 offences per youth offender to 3.9.“
It got them away from England. Anything else is a bonus. At least some of them became productive members of society here.
Pretty much, and all the usual suspects who absolutely froth at the mouth about things repeat themselves more than my dad’s war stories. 

I keep a casual eye on the pages so I know when the area has a run of kids trying to get cars- coz it happens- but I roll my eyes at all the exaggeration.
As an outsider looking in, Miles doesn't come across as the kind of Premier to want to privatise any public services. Mind teaching NSW Labor about that?
Most governments are voted out, not in
Let me rephrase. It backs up your point, but it doesn't make your point meaningful to this discussion. Total number of offences are dropping
I stopped rolling my eyes at that stuff because it began to hurt.
I’ve mentioned earlier, people don’t care about kids doing graffiti. People care about violent crimes.

If we have 10 assaults and 90 acts of vandalism, that’s 100 total offences.

If we have 20 assaults and 60 acts of vandalism, we have a 20% reduction in offences yet we are in a worse scenario because we have more violent crime with a higher impact.

It depends on what type of offences are decreasing.

It says it here, “The most recent police data shows that while youth offences have dropped across the state, “offences against the person” have increased.”

We have more people getting hurt.
So has the total number of violent crimes increased or decreased?
