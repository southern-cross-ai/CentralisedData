If not for it being compulsory (and sausage sizzles) I reckon our turnout would be about 10 per cent and we'd have nothing but cookers like Scomo and Barnaby in office.
I recommend checking out the book From Secret Ballot to Democracy Sausage. It provides a history of compulsory voting, as well as a bit of an overview of recent Australian history through the lens of elections. It’s pretty darn insightful.
Share this on r/damnthatsinteresting and give the yanks some perspective. Will do them good.
some strange takes on this great idea, including empty-headed cries of 'fascism'.

so glad that somehow we were able to say: "look, what we do around here is we choose how we run things by all voting, and the price is that you need to at least get out of bed and tick your name off on the day. and sure voting might often be a shit way to choose leaders, but it's no worse than any other, and it has this one benefit that it's absolutely brilliant at getting rid of the fkrs when they become unbearable."

compares so pleasingly with what goes down elsewhere.
LFG
I love our compulsory voting. It has contributed to our relatively moderate and stable culture. To some degree it has helped stave off the worst aspects of poorly regulated capitalism. In countries with poorly regulated capitalism and optional voting, the poor, uneducated, and disenfranchised tend not to vote because they rightly believe the system is rigged against them, whereas wealthy, well educated, and highly motivated people rightly believe if they vote and very few others vote, then they'll end up with the system that favours them. 

Compulsory voting is not the only factor of course but it played a part. My concern now is that Murdoch and all his cheap knock-offs will turn their attention to it one day and many will become convinced that compulsory voting somehow infringes on our freedoms or some other nonsense. A divided public is good for his business so I'm surprised they haven't attacked it yet. Perhaps Australia is simply too small a prize compared to America.
One of the BEST features of our EXCELLENT electoral system.
An accomplishment of celebration, it has kept Australia a moderate nation. As I often voice to mostly Americans who question it, "You have the *right* to vote, I have the *responsibility* to vote."

Plus we're actually civilized about it, none of this voting on a weekday and struggling to find a polling place, schools and public areas are we vote and it's always a Saturday and hell you can get your boss in hella trouble if they refuse to give you time to vote. 

Our system, unlike many others, is designed to get the maximum amount of people voting.

Edit: I was just looking into valid exemptions for not voting and wow we really do bend over backwards to get people to vote, even more than I thought, for example you can become a "silent elector" where you can vote but your name wont appear on the electrol roll if you believe that it might present a danger for others to learn your details (I imagine in the case of domestic violence survivors), I already knew that mobility impaired people can get deferment for voting in person, and seriously ill people can vote from the hospital if they want. 

Honestly something worth taking pride in.

We also allow people to abstain out of moral or religious reasons, but you have to jump through a few hoops, a family friend's parents were JWs and had done it.
Noob question: What inspired them to enact compulsory voting?

The political system here is sometimes called "Washminster" because it borrows heavily from both American and British models, but neither of them have compulsory voting.
Ok, it's not compulsory to vote, it's compulsory to participate in the voting/electoral system. You can put anything you like on the voting form or nothing at all. You just need to have your name checked for participating. 

It's more akin to a census of opinions. You don't have to provide one. It's not a big ask and it's made as easy as possible.
You guys should look at this view presented about australia and our political system and how Americans can't fathom how compulsory voting is actually a good thing and we in Australia pretty much just treat it as our civic duty as an australian

https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/s/GAZTt25h7T
Imagine living in China or Russia. They're lucky enough to not have to worry about who they vote for.
Only for white Australians. 

The *C*[*ommonwealth Electoral Amendment Act 1983*](https://digital-classroom.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/indigenous-australians-granted-right-vote) gave all Australians the vote in 1984. 

>***It was not until 1984 that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were politically equal to other Australians*** *under the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Act 1983. This Act made enrolling to vote at federal elections compulsory for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.*

>*The Commonwealth Electoral Act 1962 gave all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people the option to enrol and vote in federal elections, although enrolment was not compulsory. Shortly after this, Western Australia and the Northern Territory gave Aboriginal people the right to vote in state elections. Queensland passed an Act in 1965 which finally gave voting rights to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.*
It's not compulsory to vote

USA, approximately 25% vote
England, approximately 60% vote

It's compulsory to vote

Australia, 92% vote
The ascendancy of Trump and the Murdoch cancer finally hammered into me the wisdom of compulsory voting.
And 40 years for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people
Cheers to that!
i like the ribbon
Positive Aspect of compulsory voting that you don't realize until you see the American system , that it forces the government too have a large amount of voting centers so everyone can vote.

In America, governments can pick and choose how many voting centers there in an area and if political positive for there election, rheyw ill limit voting centers.

It's why yous ee tanks say "stay in line" because its common for people take whole day in line too vote
Here here to having a political system that dissuades radicalism.
Compulsory voting has had the effect of making the Australian political system incredibly stagnant. Only the Whitlam government has stood out as actually a radical push for change.  

With Compulsory voting it's just wait your turn politics and don't rock the boat.  Kevin Rudd was a good PM imo but rocked the boat too much,  so he had to skip his turn. Political insiders will already know who the next few PM's will be because that's the turgid state of Australian politics.  Albo will win the next election,  Dutton will be out, his replacement already knows this and is waiting to be next PM. Labor will lose the next election after that,  Albo gets replaced by the ex union boss whose next in the que. However, he won't be PM it will be the guy after him.  That guy again already knows.  Nothing really changes,  nothing gets better for those who need it.  The staus quo remains for the elite class who benefit from it.
I used to hate this when I was younger as I was once a citizen of a democracy where voting was not compulsory, and so I had firm notions of compulsory voting being an infringement of our freedom of (political) expression. With time, and observing the political climate in other parts of the world (not least where I currently live, the UK, where apathy reigns supreme), I have come around to compulsory voting and now see it as a social obligation like jury duty (though I still think the jury is out, pun intended, on the efficacy of juries in determining guilt) where it being compulsory is a responsibility that comes with being a citizen. I’m so glad Australia has compulsory voting now!
Compulsory voting is cool but compulsory giving your vote in the end to someone over preferences might not be. Would be nice to decide how many parties can get your vote on preference and where that line ends.
This post has my vote : )
Wish It wasn't, Aussie politics is for dopes.

I would vote for the party that removes compulsory voting.
How many actually realise that the voting part is not compulsory?
Unless you're black. Then you won't get to vote for another 38 years.
Australians are obsessed with compulsory voting, and often compare us to the USA, and credit compulsory voting for some of the relative advantages of our political system.

But despite this obsession, no one seems to have checked what other countries practice compulsory voting:

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Compulsory_voting.svg

(Red, pink, and blue are current; yellow is "the country had compulsory voting in the past").

As you can see, outside of Australia, virtually all the countries practicing compulsory voting are corrupt shitholes (or Belgium). Literally North Korea.

The entirety of Western Europe, and anywhere else decent in the world, functions without compulsory voting.

So the frequent credit it's given as a savior of democracy, is essentially baseless.

What I think is far more important, and seldom mentioned or understood, is our preferential voting system
[deleted]
Time to amend this act and get us some real freedom. The freedom to choose whether or not to vote, and not get fined for it.
DEMOCRACY IS THE ONLY OPTION. PLEASE DO NOT RESIST.

I love this, let's spread managed democracy to the rest of the planet.
[deleted]
Weirdly fascist for a democracy the whole forcing people to vote thing. “You’re free to choose what you do and how you participate but you must participate so there is a more tangible illusion of choice and change”
Democracy sausage should be compulsory too!
I’d agree.
> If not for it being compulsory (and sausage sizzles) I reckon our turnout would be about 10 per cent and we'd have nothing but cookers like Scomo and Barnaby in office.

Compulsory voting in the USA would also be a good thing, in my opinion. Also if they could finally get rid of the Electoral College's "first past the post" style of voting, change it to ranked choice voting and return to a "one person, one vote" style, things would be a whole lot better. Again, in my opinion.
It is not compulsory to make a valid vote. It is compulsory to get your name crossed off the role
So you're saying lefties won't vote unless made to do so? Interesting flex.
Absolutely, it means extremes cannot bamboozle the system. You have to appeal to the people, not just the most devoted folks.
Scomo was prime minister under compulsory voting.
Challenge: Without looking it up, name an OECD country you admire other than Australia that enforces compulsory voting
This yank would like some perspective. How does it work? What happens if you don’t vote?
Yank here, I'd fucking love to have this here.
 you'd be surprised
The way it's been explained to me is that in the US its a right and in Australia its an obligation and non-compliance is fined, two different things under two different systems. What people are trying to do back in the States is motivate people to vote organically rather than threatening people, of whom most are financially struggling, with a fine if they don't go out (drive, and waste gas) to vote.
I bet you Clive Palmers cooker party would’ve had a much better election result in 2022 if there was no compulsory voting. The far right has very very little political power compared to many other western countries because of it forcing things to be a lot more moderate 

Of course the other great effect of compulsory voting that I’ve only realized due to comments on here is that the government is forced to make voting as easy as possible, and in many ways this is actually the most important thing
It’s like we’re all on a jury to decide if the government should be convicted of incompetence or corruption. Sometimes both.
[deleted]
'getting rid' does an awful lot of heavy lifting considering we have really only ever been governed by one of two sorts of fkrs.
LFM TK, group loot
It can still be improved, though. You might quibble at the UK having its elections on a Thursday as opposed to a Saturday but having just voted in a British general election for the first time earlier this month, I thought there were 2 things they do well here (plus 1 silly but fun thing). 1: at least anecdotally, in cities, it seemed like your polling station is closer to you than in Australian cities (though that might be due to the higher population density here). 2: polling stations open at 7am and close at 10pm. It wouldn’t hurt to extend opening hours from the relatively paltry 8-6 (though, mind you, Australia has early voting centres and the UK doesn’t). 3: this one’s a little silly, but I love how all the candidates have to be physically present in the room when the results are announced, wearing their little rosettes. None of this “straight to the party election room” nonsense and victory speeches from party HQ. I kinda adore that. Australia should adopt that.
It's complicated, but Australia had introduced compulsory enrolment about 20 years before because it was seen as administratively simpler. Many saw this as a natural evolution of that.

Both conservatives and Labor people argued at various points that compulsory voting would bring out their voters.

The turnout collapsed to around 60% after WW1, which alarmed people.

It's also generally accepted that the debates and referenda over conscription made it much easier to introduce as so many had spent so much time arguing for the government's right to send citizens to war that it would have been hypocritical to then say that the government shouldn't force people to vote.
Not sure what inspired it, but compulsory voting leads to a stronger democracy where politicians have to appeal to the majority, particularly the centre swing voters and not their bases.
Since voting is compulsory, the government has to make voting as accessible as possible which prevents voter suppression.
> Noob question: What inspired them to enact compulsory voting?

The man who introduced it, as this was a private members bill had seen that the voting turn out had dropped to under 60% and believed that in order to combat apathy and indolence in politics voting must be made compulsory.

It passed very quickly and is one of the few private members bills to actually become law.
In the [1918 Swan by-election](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1918_Swan_by-election), the two candidates on the conservative side split the vote roughly equally, causing the ALP to take a safe seat away from the government. 


Commentators at the time observed that preferential voting wasn't introduced as an attempt for meaningful reform, but purely because it was politically beneficial for the government of the day.
[deleted]
Technically you are wrong. The text of the Act is very clear, you are indeed legally required to vote according to the instructions on the ballot paper and put it in the box.

A literal reading would render an informal vote punishable with a fine.*

The issue is that what is done in the privacy of a polling booth can't be enforced without violating the secret ballot.

*Some state electoral Acts explicitly allow informal votes, but not the federal Act.
The AEC does not agree with you: "Under the Electoral Act, the actual duty of the elector is to attend a polling place, have their name marked off the certified list, receive a ballot paper and take it to an individual voting booth, mark it, fold the ballot paper and place it in the ballot box.
It is not the case, as some people have claimed, that it is only compulsory to attend the polling place and have your name marked off, and this has been upheld by a number of legal decisions:".

Ref: http://www.aec.gov.au/About_AEC/Publications/voting/index.htm#comp
I doubt the major parties would want to force you make a choice after having your name crossed out. Chances are, if we were, the smaller fringe parties might get the angry upvotes.
>USA, approximately 25% vote England, approximately 60% vote

I'm not sure if it's terrible punctuation or if you're just speaking nonsense.
The real figures:

USA 2020: 66.2%

USA 1840 through to 1900: as high as 82.6% (highest ever) and as low as 69.5%

Lowest ever was in 1792 at just 6.3% but in more modern times/ boomer gen life span was 1996 at 51.7%

For comparison... well... [just look for yourself lmao](https://www.aec.gov.au/elections/federal_elections/voter-turnout.htm)

[Source](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1139251/voter-turnout-in-us-presidential-and-midterm-elections/) For US data

> It's compulsory to vote

no it's not, you do have to turn up, but you can make confetti with the ballot paper if you want
Correct, it has been compulsory for 40 years, however it would be useful to clarify that the ability to vote was available much earlier than 40 years ago.
The voter has complete control on how their preferences are allocated.

When the voter numbers the boxes from 1 to 5 or 1 to 65 - that is the voter controlling their preferences.
Partly wrong!  
  
Aborigines were voting way before 1901 and voted federally from 1901 to when it became compulsory fully in 1982.  
The problem was it wasn't a positive duty on them to vote, though it was still a right.

[https://aiatsis.gov.au/explore/right-vote](https://aiatsis.gov.au/explore/right-vote)
The reason for this is that mandatory voting has often been implemented in flawed democracies without a strong democratic culture as an attempt to protect the democracy. Australia is unusual in implementing this policy *and* having a strong democratic culture, which has made it very successful.

Its similar to term limits - they're uncommon in strong democracies, because they're more often a measure meant to protect unstable ones. That doesn't mean term limits *cause* authoritarianism, instability etc.
The same could be said of *abolishing elections.*

No doubt a country that's supposed to be a "democracy" getting rid of elections is a sure sign that the country is sinking quickly into fascism.

But Ancient Athenians didn't have elections in their democracy either; instead, they practiced Sortition, a process where members of the legislature were chosen by random lottery from eligible members of the public, and it worked quite well as it essentially made the existence of political parties, vested interests, career politicians, and institutional corruption impossible. Indeed, the word "democracy" means "rule by the people"; ordinary people.

Arguing that "no elections" is inherently anti-democratic is therefore technically fallacious; it's possible to have a well-functioning democracy without them, as indeed the Athenians did and are credited with inventing democracy.

Similarly, "Mandatory voting = corrupt shithole" is probably an example of the Hitler Ate Sugar fallacy.

 it's entirely possible to have a well-functioning democracy (or rather, *better* functioning than a lot of others in the developed world) with mandatory voting, and you could argue it may be absolutely necessary if you want electoral results to adequately reflect the will of the people. It's just obviously not the *only* quintessential thing a country needs to do so.
> Literally North Korea.
> 
> 

Literally North Korea... and Belgium. 

I don't think compulsory voting is what makes Libya or DRC a corrupt shit hole...

And by that same token - look at all the corrupt shitholes that practice voluntary voting eh!  

If having compulsory voting makes Australia corrupt as the other countries that do it, then surely not having it makes Canada just as corrupt as Lesotho and Nicaragua...
The fact that voter turnout that has almost always been over 90% is incredible, the act is having its intended purpose.

Don't let perfect be the enemy of good, or in this case, really good.
You can easily do this, you just submit an empty ballot or one with a lewd doodle on it instead of preferences.
Can I smoke some of your crack? You're advertising being fried out of your mind quite well.
Yes, yes I will.
You don't know what the word fascist means, lol
Little known fact, apparently even among Australians, voting is *not* compulsory in Australia.  Every Australian is perfectly free to spoil their ballot and not vote for any candidate.

They want you to show up, but they can't do anything about what you do from that point on.
Is jury duty fascist now too?
You can literally just scribble a picture of a dick on your ballot paper.

The bare minimum is just sending a blank ballot in the post. If you can't even manage that should you really be allowed to participate in society as a fully functional adult?
100% I use Democracy sausages as a reward for voting. Voting to have rights is good too. It gives me the opportunity to keep the bad politicians in check.
2019 It was my #2 daughters first time voting, and some reason there was no sausage sizzle, nor cake stall at our normal polling place. 

So I told her the Greens had banned sausage sizzles. 

She voted labor in protest. 

Needless to say she doesn’t take my political advice anymore.😂😂😂
I think that would be hilarious if it was literally compulsory to eat a democracy sausage at every election, no matter if you’re vegan, hate sausages or anything, if you resist you will have sausages stuffed down your throat into your stomach like a goose being force fed to make pâté de foie gras.
Oh no, I just cited examples of the types. You'd be certain to get extreme leftie cookers too. Optional voting gets special interest groups out there voting for their candidate while average people can't be bothered, which would be very common here I'd think.
Belgium. Although actual enforcement may be somewhat lax, voting is still mandatory. We should have it everywhere to be fair, including a mandatory day off.
Uruguay? My brother in law came from there, he told me it was the only other country he knew who did it.
**Enforces** being the key word.

I couldn't, so i looked it up. Surprised the heck outa me.
You get a fine. Voting here is run by a politically independent authority. It's always on a weekend and polling is open all day and in as many locations as possible. There's typically food and drinks available run by a local charity. 

Ensuring everyone votes means that all strata of society get a say not just the people that can afford to take time off work or those highly motivated. There's also no voter or party specific registration or ensuring that one is on the roll - it's automatic.

We also have preferential voting so if the small party you vote for doesn't get in the vote gets passed along to the mainstream party which means minority votes still count. 

That's the ELI5, and I'm not expert but you can see how that would lead to a fairer outcome.
The best way I can explain it.

In the US you have the right to vote, in Australia you have the duty to vote.
You get a fine in the mail
You provide a good excuse (I was unexpectedly hospitalised, i was teaching for a semester in remote PNG and a4 hour mountain trek then a16 hours boat ride from the consulate are both ones i know to have been used) with evidence or you pay a fine.


National and state elections are compulsory. Local government elections may or may not be, depending on the state.
Another thing worth noting is you don't actually have to vote, you just have to go and get your name ticked off and put your paper in the box. Drawing dicks or just taking it and dropping it straight in the ballot box is perfectly acceptable.
  You get  a  fine unless you have a good reason.. the culture is very much to vote.              You can also turn up to pols and get signed off as attending and not vote, or even get a ballot paper and draw  on it.                                        
When people vote they tend to vote in their best interests so legislators tend to consider everybody not just fringe groups with high voting rates (when dealing with subjects not already controlled by  lobbyists or mates)
>What happens if you don’t vote?

You get a fine, but it is small, depending on which election.

For example, not voting in a federal election is a $20 fine. (No, I didn't leave off any 0's, it really is $20).

Not voting in state elections varies from state to state, ranging from $50 to $120. Not voting in local government elections attracts the same fine as state elections, except in WA and SA, where no fines are issued.

And it is dead easy to get out of fines. I missed two consecutive local government elections by saying that I had moved house between the time roles closed and the election, and I couldn't get to my old council area on election day.
How I would love to be able to say it would make people more informed and produce better outcomes. In practice, we got a 60% no vote based on lies, simple prejudice and disinformation... not to mention the 9 years of LNP fuckery.
It's a legal requirement to vote. But we see it as a duty, not an Obligation, so we don't turn out like 'Murica.
Exactly as governments lose elections, opposition’s don’t win them so in best interest of the government to make voting easier hence we can now vote on weekdays for two or three weeks before election day. Brilliant. Don’t have to wait in a long queue on the Saturday.
If we employed that method we would end up with a two party system dominated by the People's Front of Judea and the Judean's People's Front.
Good times
Need tank
> Since voting is compulsory, the government has to make voting as accessible as possible which prevents voter suppression.

This - I would say that for its flaws (e.g. "forcing" a vote), the real benefit of compulsory voting is to prevent voter suppression. Imagine if we actually did have voter suppression, I could imagine people using it against the Indigenous, Middle Eastern and Asian communities at various points.
The man who introduced it did it to prevent apathy in politics as turnout at the previous federal election had dropped to a record low. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Payne
> compulsory voting leads to a stronger democracy 

Countries with compulsory voting:

* Brazil, North Korea, Honduras, Greece, Mexico, Thailand, Turkey, Peru, Bolivia, Fiji... and Australia

>It is British, it has borrowed nothing from the republic /American system.

Ok this is just not true, the Washminster line is 100% the sort of thing you hear in a AusPol1001 course because large swathes of the Australian political system draw on ideas and structures from the US.

Having a federal system is distinctly **not** British, Britain was and remains a unitary system (with devolution). Many of the debates at the constitutional convention of the late 19th Century drew explicitly on ideas and comparisons to the US system.

Compulsory voting is an instance of being *neither* British nor American influenced, but instead a domestic development (along with the secret ballot, which was often called the Australian ballot in the past).
The Senate was explicitly inspired by the US Senate rather than the House of Lords. The constitution writers talked about the American system constantly.

In many ways the Australian constitution is a rewriting of the US constitution into a Parliamentary system and without a bill of rights.
Our federal system was very much influenced by the United States, particularly our Constitution, which the British are lacking. Source for the pun here: https://peo.gov.au/understand-our-parliament/history-of-parliament/federation/the-federation-of-australia
You are technically correct, the best kind of correct.
Yes, but nobody is ever going to be fined for submitting an informal ballot. Also, if you’re going to go to the trouble of travelling to the polling booth, most people will cast a vote, regardless of how disinterested they may be in politics.
It probably wouldn't survive scrutiny under the implied freedom of political communication.
This is a case of "the purpose of a system is what it does."

Because of the secret ballot voting is not compulsory. Collecting the ballot is compulsory.
What section of the act specifies this where you must mark the ballot as instructed? I found section 245 but it doesn't seem clear on the exact process. Is it in accompanying notes or a reference to an external document or appendix? Thanks.
Took me a couple reads but it's basically

>(places where) It's not compulsory to vote:

>USA, approximately 25% (of people) vote

>England, approximately 60% (of people) vote

>(places where) It's compulsory to vote:

>Australia, 92% (of people) vote

Even then it's a mouthful lol.
why, both. 66% of people voted in the 2020 US Presidential election. The midterms are worse, but I'd be shocked if even they were 25%
https://www.statista.com/statistics/1050929/voter-turnout-in-the-uk/

60% last general election
The US had 39.9% turnout in their elections in 1918, the year we introduced this in Australia, and fell to 32.9% a few years later. Turnout in 2014 was 36.7%. This is using your source.
Yes, but it causes a headache for the AEC if you do that.

The first, and one of the most critical, things that they check is that the number of ballots in the box matches the number handed out.

If you walk out with a ballot, or tear it up or whatever, they have to search for it and do their best to account for it.

If you don't wish to place a valid vote, simply put the blank ballot in the box.  No need to make the AEC's job harder than it needs to be.
Completely wrong though a fallacy that people keep repeating.

It is a positive duty to vote under the Electoral Act 1918 which states that you MUST:

* Attend a polling place
* have your name marked off a certified list
* receive a ballot paper
* take that same ballot paper to an individual voting booth
* Mark that ballot paper
* Fold the ballot paper 
* Place that folded ballot paper into a designated ballot box.

Not doing this is a breach of the Act that can result in a fine and if you elect to take that fine to court can further result in a criminal conviction.

Due to all votes being legislated as secret ballots, it doesn't matter what you mark on the ballot paper as long as you mark it

Multiple court cases (even two specific High Court cases) have enforced this and the AEC is quite clear in all its publications what you must do.
thank you for this. quite correct.
From the National Museum, 1984 is the year when they were "finally treated like other voters".  This post is about compulsory voting isn't it?:

>From the first federal electoral Act in 1902 to 1965, when the last state changed its law, tens of thousands of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people were subject to regulations which prohibited them from voting at federal and state elections.

>It wasn’t until 1984 that Indigenous people were finally treated like other voters and required to enrol and vote at elections.

* [https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/indigenous-australians-right-to-vote](https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/indigenous-australians-right-to-vote)

And as for non-compulsory voting rights I don't consider The *Commonwealth Electoral Act 1962* to be "much earlier".  I consider it to be a fucking disgrace that it wasn't until the 1960s that they could vote in Queensland, WA and NT.
Lol how did you and so many people misinterpret this post? I know how preferences work. I think it would be nice if on a list of four independents, four small parties, Labor and Liberals, to number all but Labor and Liberals, so that my vote ends before they get their hands on it. That and whatever bigots are running.
It absolutely wasn't a right for most Aboriginal Australians, they were specifically singled out as not being able to vote in most states. It wasn't just that they weren't mandated to vote. You might want to read that source again. I didn't actually know that SA had universal suffrage so much earlier than everywhere else though.

And just so you know, 'Aborigine' is a very outdated term and is generally considered offensive today.
I'm not saying mandatory voting makes democracies flawed.

I'm saying the absence of mandatory voting in virtually all other functional political systems demonstrates its far less essential than Australians believe.
>Sortition

I feel like there's an argument to be made for this after Lambie, Wang, Lazarus and Muir all got voted in. I didn't agree with the majority of their views but I think they did a better job of representing their local constiutents then the major parties and they, aside from the PUP candidates,  definitely didn't have rich donors backing and guiding their views and policies like the current Teals do.
I never said "mandatory voting = corrupt shithole"

What I'm saying is, the virtual absence of developed countries practicing mandatory voting demonstrates it's far less essential than Australians believe.

It demonstrably doesn't matter.
I'm not saying compulsory voting makes Australia (or anywhere else) corrupt.

I'm saying the absence of compulsory voting in virtually every other functional political system demonstrates it's far less essential than Australians believe
Sadly you missed the point, you still showed up, signed in, in order to leave a blank vote.

Not the same as.....Not showing up, staying home, and exercising your freedom to abstain from voting at all.
my local school has a bake sale as you leave the voting and i get a chocolate crackle for breakfast as a reward
My local primary school has a shit P&C which means no democracy sausage or even baked goods. The reward for voting is that most eligible voters vote and it's easy for them to vote which means it's not  extreme voters voting over average but not massively politically involved voters who will vote but not if it takes hours with loss of pay and hoops to jump through. Bad politicians are naturally somewhat in check when the disinterested middle have the obligation to vote and no personal disadvantage by doing so. Sausages are just a bonus.
I'm glad people get their sausages, but my reward is you having voted.
>So I told her the Greens had banned sausage sizzles. 

>She voted labor in protest

You're a monster!

Also...Nice work! 👍
I hereby second this amendment to the constitution, Mr Speaker.
Compulsory voting has the advantage that it keeps out extreme governments. I doubt we could ever have a Trump type person here. 

The disadvantage is it discourages any real change in politics. It's also fundamentally undemocratic,  but Aussies don't seem to mind that.
"*if the small party you vote for doesn't get in the vote gets passed along to the mainstream party which means minority votes still count.*"  
That's not exactly right.  If the small party candidate you voted for doesn't get a majority of the votes, then your vote goes to YOUR second preference candidate - who could well be a member of another small party.  The voter decides where their preferences are allocated - no-one else.
> We also have preferential voting so if the small party you vote for doesn't get in the vote gets passed along to the mainstream party which means minority votes still count.

This is the other big pillar of Australian politics because it means that parties always need to stay in the centre. Your candidate needs to appeal to the general public and the major parties have to pay attention to minor policies in case they lose the primary vote (which is where their fund raising comes from).
> You get a fine. Voting here is run by a politically independent authority. It's always on a weekend and polling is open all day and in as many locations as possible. There's typically food and drinks available run by a local charity.
> 
> 

Additionally, a positive thing about compulsory voting: no one can say they didn't have a say in the choice of their leader. They could say "don't blame me for Candidate X, I voted for Candidate Y" unlike what has been happening to Americans at least since 2000 ("don't blame me for Candidate X, I voted for Candidate Y but the Electoral College and/or the Supreme Court chose Candidate X for the entire country").

While that's bad enough, if you chose to sit on the couch instead of at least voting, now you have no right to complain when the administration of the SCOTUS-chosen Candidate X (e.g. in 2020) or of the Electoral College-chosen Candidate X (e.g. in 2016) turns into a total crapshow. You had a chance to make sure Candidate X never stepped foot in the Oval Office, and you didn't use that chance. Now the whole country suffers as a result - including you. That's bonkers.
Thanks! Do you know how much the fine is? Can you appeal it for extenuating circumstances or if you’re poor?
That's assuming you're just too lazy to drop in at some point and put random numbers or just write "Fuck you" on the paper.

I fully support mandatory voting as it at the very least gets SOME would-be non-voters out and voting, but I know there's a LOT of people who just get their name ticked off but don't contribute to the vote. I have a friend who says he'd rather just cop the fine than take 30 minutes out of his day to go vote, so unfortunately mandatory voting only goes so far when the punishment is a slap on the wrist at most.
How much? And can you appeal it for extenuating circumstances or being poor?
Technically according to the law you do have to vote, however that part is completely unenforceable, since we have a secret ballot so there's nothing that can connect you to a specific ballot (in fact anything that can makes that ballot invalid).
You might see it as a duty but there are plenty of people here who only go to a polling station because they will be fined otherwise. Plus, you wouldn’t turn out like the US even if voting was optional because the system here is vastly different to there.
Countries with murders: Everywhere.

You're point? It works for us, it's been proven to work for us, that's all that matters. We're not America, we don't export out politics to other nations without consent.
It is funny how the Australians who are loudest about the “Americanization” of Australia are typically the most American acting 

Like this kind of shallow reasoning
Shit. I'm blind and mixed up preferential with compulsory voting lol
to add to this, because we have a codified constitution (unlike the British) we have a similar system of judicial review to the Americans, rather than British parliamentary sovereignty.
[deleted]
Sometimes the informal vote becomes an unofficial referendum, such as in 1982 folks writing 'no Franklin dam' on their paper whilst still otherwise submitting a proper vote.
Ahh, so nonsense, too, then. Those numbers are entirely made up.
That 66% was an absolute record though, but I expect we'll see something of a repeat next election as well.

It's really hard to get some proper numbers out of the USA, but apparently only 37% of voters voted in each of the 2018, 2020 and 2022 elections. Overall it still is way way lower then what we see in Australia, and I much prefer the massively voter enabling system we have over anything in the US.
66% of people voted in the 2020 US election, or 66% of *registered* voters? Voter turnout doesn't include those who aren't registered.
That's rather disappointing, thought our British other half would've done better
Your point?
Yep, it's a massive PITA when the counts don't match, all the paperwork's been done, most of the ballots are in the special boxes, the school hall is packed up - and everything has to stop so we can find the missing ballot while two people are recounting the number of issued papers.

Source: have worked some elections and had a missing ballot paper.
[deleted]
No it is actually wrong.

 It is mandatory to vote.

The loophole is that your vote is anonymous.
This is NOT entirely correct.   


You are also (like the Museum) conflating State voting ability (or inability as it was) with Federal voting.  
  
Here is a MUCH BETTER history that explains some of the misconceptions that a LOT of people have and describes even more the idiocy that was occurring due to the racist policies of WA and QLD up until the 1980s (some would say still!). 

[https://aiatsis.gov.au/explore/right-vote](https://aiatsis.gov.au/explore/right-vote)
You are further confirming my statement, thank you.
What was misinterpreted?

You've said exactly what I've said:  the voter chooses who their preferences go to. That choice can include leaving the boxes blank for the major parties, if that is what they want.
I agree. I wouldn’t argue it’s essential - certainly in a country like the USA no amount of theoretical benefits will make it politically or culturally feasible there. That said I don’t think that’s a common argument?
Absolutely!

The basic paradox of electoral politics is that when you let people vote for their representatives, you end up with a legislature that's less representative of the public as a whole than if you simply chose people entirely at random, which is completely counter-intuitive.

Say you have 30% of Australians with the opinion X. Through electoral politics, you might expect that 30% of MPs would also think X, but not so; if only 30% of people think X in any given electorate, you might end up with only 2 or 3 candidates who think X who are actually elected across the whole country or even none at all, having all been out-voted in each Seat... But if you chose MPs entirely randomly, statistically you'd likely end up with a Parliament made up of around 30% of X thinkers.

Elections also mean that those in office aren't necessarily those who are most in-line with their constituents desires and will do the best job, but those who are best at winning elections. Indeed, it's possible to make a pretty good career out of winning elections. But that's not necessarily the same thing as doing a genuinely good job in office... Which is probably why the public seem to distrust politicians so much.

As weird as it sounds, you could make a strong case that *e*lections are actually *anti*-democratic. There's a reason the Ancient Athenians didn't trust the idea...
What. No it doesn't, ut demonstrates the opposite! It does matter.

Other developed countries' electoral systems are almost all universally worse and result in more polarised electoral politics and voter suppression.
> I'm saying the absence of compulsory voting in virtually every other functional political system demonstrates it's far less essential than Australians believe

I don't know if it's essential... but higher voter turnout is a goal of every democracy - and the fact that we have some of the highest is to be celebrated.

Canada, US, UK - they all spend COLLOSAL amounts of time, effort and money to get people to vote. Because more people voting is better.

Australia just does it easily. And because it is mandatory there are incentives to make it easier and more convenient.

And I would struggle to ever hear why any of those things makes it a corrupt shithole and literally "north korea" haha.

I don't know if I would ever say one thing would be "essential to democracy", but Australia has a system that makes many steps that imo make our democracy better than other systems.
You can stay at home - just mail in a protest vote. 

Your right to forego any responsibility or effort at all regarding the democratic health of the country seems deeply unimportant. It is such a minor obligation! 

And if you really think it matters that much, then just pay the $20 admin penalty and go about your day. If your cherished right to not send some mail every now and then isn't worth the price of a pub parma then why do you care so much?
Last election I visited two polling booths and they were both out of sausages because I'm a lazy bitch and went late. 


Second one had chocolate crackles though, so the day was more than saved.
Honey joys are my weakness.
Yes that's the worry. Special interest groups will get their candidates in through voluntary voting which is bad. But compulsory voting means the major parties must appeal to the middle which doesn't like change much.
Sort of. But if your #2 has fewer votes than your #1, he/she will have been already eliminated, so your vote always ends up with one or other of the biggest 2.
The centre is dictated by reactionaries and ultimately an imaginary ideology. Also this is not a pillar of Aussie politics it's a pillar of the manufactured two option state that is slowly and finally decaying.
Last time I was fined ( I forgot there was a local election on) it was small..ike $60-80. Having said that, out turnout is something 95% because we take elections seriously here. The fine is small, but people still want to vote.

I find it tragic that it's not compulsory in the US. I can't fathom living in a country so ambivalent to who runs the country.
The fine is tiny, like $50 and if you have a half decent excuse you can get it waived.

Its more a threat than a punishment.
The fine is around $100 AUD. You first receive an Apparent Failure to Vote notice where you can explain why you didn't vote. If the explanation isn't adequate, you get fined. 

Being poor isn't a good enough excuse, since voting and registering to vote is free.
"I work weekends" is good enough to avoid a fine, fine ranges from $20-$100 depending on the election.
Australia's voting turnout has ALWAYS been high. even before the 1924 Amendment it was  averaging approximately 74% of voters turning up to vote. [https://www.aec.gov.au/elections/federal\_elections/voter-turnout.htm](https://www.aec.gov.au/elections/federal_elections/voter-turnout.htm)  
  
As for your "people wont drive or waste gas" that's a complete falsehood for a few major reasons:  

* EVERY public school (primary and high school) is a mandated voting place. 
* Anyone in Australia can vote early at early voting in every local community (normally libraries or community halls) up to a week before any election. 
* If it is impossible or inconvenient to vote you can complete a postal vote. 
* You can vote by telephone if you are blind or vision impaired
* Mobile voting personell from the AEC visit care facilities on or before voting day.  

Compulsory voting is for Federal, State and Local Government elections. We both see it as a duty and social obligation and it is also a right within our constitution (s 41) . 

We do NOT vote for administrative public service roles though (eg: Attorney General, Fire, Police, etc) . We see that as highly problematic and an instant conflict of duty to the public as a whole.
> You're point?

The absence of compulsory voting in virtually any other functional democracy demonstrates it's far less essential than Australians believe.

> It works for us

We're jerking ourselves off over something demonstrably meaningless, when we do actually have good parts of our system that receive relatively little appreciation.
No fucking idea how you drew this spurious connection between my comment and "americanization"
Still a cool history on why we have preferential voting though. Thanks for that.
One thing I'm particularly fond of about Australian political history is that the constitutional conventions are recorded into Hansard and have been digitised, so we can go back and reread the arguments from everyone at the time. You don't just have to take the second hand literature at face value or else go digging through some archive you can just google it and see the points of influence coming up very explicitly in the debates:

>**Sir George Turner**: In Canada and the United States entirely
different modes of procedure were adopted. In Canada they gave the States certain specified and limited powers, and retained to the Dominion all other powers not specifically conferred on the States.
In the United States they gave limited powers to the new body, allowing the States to retain power over all matters which they did not voluntarily give up. That latter course was followed in the
Commonwealth Bill, and it is the course that we, if we are sensible, will endeavor to carry out in framing the Constitution for the Federal Parliament.  [[1897 Australasian Federation Convention, First Session, March 24](https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/constitution/conventions/1897-1042/upload_binary/1897_1042.pdf;fileType=application%2Fpdf#search=%22first%20session%22)]
The American Senate ultimately, I guess, but the Australian one is very much taken from America.

Australia did make the innovation of direct election, which took the US til 1913. Early drafts of the Australian Constitution had senators appointed by states like the US at the time.
UK had 60% voter turnout last General Election

Australia had 92% voter turnout last Federal Election

Only one is wrong, the other two aren't made up.
No they aren't, USA is wrong (it's usually about 50% and varies a lot) but UK and Aus are totally right.
Of course
What's the point? You literally pay via taxes for the resources spent on elections, ballots, etc, why waste more of it, you're just fucking yourself and every other taxpayer over more?
Wow what a lovely person you are.
Simple loophole in the entire legal system, you can break any law if you just keep it anonymous
> Other developed countries' electoral systems are almost all universally worse 

If you think Australia has the only decent political system in the developed world, you are naive.
\[claps\] Spoken like a mindless drone, ready to defend your lack of freedom.

Please, create some more compulsory acts giving the govt absolute control over you.
if they had honey joys where i vote i’d be destroying the trestle tables to get to them like a cornflake kaiju
Not necessarily. Presences can end up getting a small party past one of the big parties. It has happened. I know as I’m a member of Greens WA and we grabbed a seat from Labor on preferences. It was a seat in eastern Australia. I forget which one. A few elections ago. 

Plus almost as important, most voters forget that the political parties are paid by Electoral Commission depending upon how many votes they receive. This money goes to the first preference. Greens could not survive without that money. 

Details here https://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/public_funding/index.htm
No, your vote does not "always ends up with one or other of the biggest 2."  It depends on how you have voted and how many first preference votes the winning candidate receives.

If a candidate gets more than 50% of the first preference votes, then they are elected and preferences have no impact at all.  If you did not vote for this candidate, then your vote has NOT gone to "one or other of the biggest 2".

If no candidate gets an absolute majority, then the candidate with the fewest "1" votes is eliminated and their votes are transferred to the candidate numbered "2" on the ballot papers.  If neither of the "biggest 2 parties" win on preferences (say an independent wins on preferences), then your vote STILL has not gone to "one or other of the biggest 2".
This is the biggest weakness. There should be no minimum number of preferences for your vote to be valid but the major parties would never introduce that as it’s not in their interests to do so
What arguably matters the most for voter participation is the state you live in. I, being from NJ which is solidly blue, and MANY other people do not have to bother voting because our EC vote will be blue regardless - on the flip, if you're a Republican voter in NJ there's no reason to go vote in the Presidential election because your vote quite literally will not make a difference. There are loads of people like me in the 30-35 range who have never once voted in a presidential election for this very reason - I'm not wasting my time after work to go to a polling station and stand around for an hour just to get an "I voted!" sticker to post on social media. I would rather do something more productive with my time. I could postal vote from Australia, but my voting residence is NJ, so there is no reason for me to bother with that.

If you live in a battleground state, like Florida, Penn, Michigan etc voting becomes far more pivotal.
In state and local council elections, if you don't pay the fine (and it isn't waived), your driving licence and/or car registration can be suspended.
Federal election is even smaller - $20.
It depends. Commonwealth election: only $20.  Qld state: $160. Victoria: about $100.
I assumed they mean unwell by poor.
That should NOT be an acceptable excuse since all elections have postal voting and at least a week (usually two weeks) of early voting.
The drive and waste gas was an anecdotal bit about the US, not Australia.
> The absence of compulsory voting in virtually any other functional democracy demonstrates it's far less essential than Australians believe.

I'd hardly call America or the UK bastions of democracy. 

> We're jerking ourselves off over something demonstrably meaningless, when we do actually have good parts of our system that receive relatively little appreciation.

I'll agree there, the fact that the AEC is very non-partisan and draws the electorate lines independently means we're far less gerrymandered than the US. Honestly the AEC needs as much love as we can give it.
Except privacy is built-in to the voting process.  
If you murder someone on CCTV, your anonymity will not protect you for very long.
You're reading something different to what I wrote...
The primary school I vote at always has them and I feel like a complete pig because I always buy at least three lol.
Yeah, I was ambiguous/inaccurate in saying "biggest two". I didn't mean"biggest on first preferences"; I just meant that it doesn't stop with #2; it keeps getting passed along till someone has more than 50%, at which time your vote is either with the winner or not.
It's not a weakness, it's how the system works. Effectively, it's like holding successive ballots, each time eliminating one contender. After the first ballot, you eliminate the one with the least votes, distributing them according to the 2nd  preference of those voters. That's like holding a "round 2", with the lowest candidate removed. Then you do it again: the second lowest is eliminated, and their preferences distributed. You go on until one has >50%, when you have a winner. It's like several elimination ballots, but all done in one ballot. I think it's brilliant.
I don’t agree. At all. It’s a civic duty to vote. I have other thoughts, but they’ll likely be lost on ya, so I’m not gonna go there.

Unless due to extenuating circumstances, like you can’t move your hand to fill in a mail-in ballot, I’m challenged to excuse this boorish thinking/behavior.
Aren’t Congressional elections held at the same time as Presidential elections? Even if your vote may have no impact of the latter, it can on the former
I don't think so. In most cases in the US it costs money to register to vote. Around $200.
Worked at the referendum, I voted early a few days beforehand and the first guys in line as I opened the door were complaining about how we are wasting their weekend, as if there wasn't a bunch of other ways to get it done..
That doesn’t help casual workers who may get no notice of a shift until they’re called in right before they’re needed
> I'd hardly call America or the UK bastions of democracy

I never said America or the UK.

Pick any country you respect politically (to an equal or greater degree than Australia). 95% chance they have voluntary voting. 

So the statement "compulsory voting leads to a stronger democracy" is essentially baseless, unless your sole measure of democracy is voter turnout.
You said:

"Other developed countries' electoral systems are almost all universally worse"

Of the countries that have similar or better political systems than Australia, they are almost all voluntary voting systems.

Like the entirety of Western Europe is voluntary (aside from a few small nations). So take your pick of whatever countries you like, among the many that have similar or better politics than Australia, they demonstrate mandatory voting is non-essential to a well functioning system.
They can be as pedantic as they want, regardless of how you cut it demonstrably in over 90% of elections your vote will be going to one of two parties and it has been that way for a long, long time (despite not actually having to be that way)
It’s not brilliant. It just inflates the votes of the major parties and makes it seem like they have more support than they do. I’m pretty sure the number of votes they get would be heavily reduced if people knew they didn’t need to vote for them to cast a valid vote. It’s almost like a leading question
TIL the US electoral system is even more shit than I knew it to be.
You can do early voting? You're 18+ and an adult. You should be able to manage your time.
OK, that scenario is different to the one I was responding to.

Your scenario is that the voter has been called in unexpectedly. That likely will be accepted (assuming the voter could not get to a polling booth on their break.)

However, the scenario put forward by u/BoundinBob was that the voter always "works weekends" - that should not be accepted for the reasons I already gave (postal voting and early voting)
> So the statement "compulsory voting leads to a stronger democracy" is essentially baseless, unless your sole measure of democracy is voter turnout.

Considering democracy is literally means "citizen rule" obviously the higher the (legitimate) turnout the better. How can you consider yourself "ruled by the majority" where there have been cases where  less than *half* of voting eligible people have turned out.

Obviously there is more to democracy than just voter turn out, much more, but to claim it isn't important is just cooked.
Yes. I said *almost all.*

And worse than "better" doesn't mean "not decent".
Our government always has the support of the majority of the population, and the system is designed to ensure this. You have to preference one major party over the other. 2/3 of people understand the fundamental societal tensions and decide the available choices , the other 3rd gets no say in their formulation, they just gets to pick the winner, through their preferences.
Many states are also trying to implement mandatory ID in order to vote, which is something poor people are less likely to have.
I work weekends, I just wrote "I got called in to work" on the fine and it was waved. It was a couple of elections ago and 100% postal vote now whether I need to or not.
Voter turnout matters. But like any sampling, there's a point where you have a representative enough sample, and by any practical assessment many countries with voluntary voting are equal or better than Aus.
Sure, so a number of countries with voluntary voting have similar or better political systems than Australia. 

Demonstrating it's non-essential to a well functioning political system
“Two party preferred” is a scam. The US is showing the failure of the lesser evils approach. We’re going to learn this soon enough when everything that made our country great starts going down the toilet. You can see it just in this sub - so many people making threads/comments about leaving the country. Yet they then come into this thread talking about how amazing it is to be forced to vote for a party you don't agree with. Labor party shills
That supports what I said. Your reason for not voting was written so that it could be interpreted as an unexpected call to work on election day.  The Electoral Commission is  not going to argue with that reason.
To a degree I agree, but I think that number is 80% or greater, because it's not just about sampling, but *legitimacy*. You need a certain point to meet the moral, if not legal, requirement to actually represent a majority. 

It's one of the biggest issues I have with one part of our system, the senate, there have been senators in this country elected with less than 100 direct votes, with all the rest coming from people working the preference system in ways that while legal really aren't ethical.
Well we're just gonna have to hard disagree on that.

Any system that allows for voter suppression or requires strong safeguards against it that must be protected, or requires political candidates to encourage people not just to vote for them but to vote at all, I'd argue is simply inherently worse off than a system where protections aren't necessary because it's mandatory anyway.
