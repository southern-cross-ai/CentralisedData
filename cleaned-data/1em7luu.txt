No, not thermally insulated ones, specifically the kind you plug in or charge and it heats up your lunch for you.

I heard great things about the LunchEaze, even if it meant using a converter. Expensive, but pays for itself eventually. But holy shit they wanted ***$100USD*** for shipping. Holy shit fuck that.

I see a few results googling for lunchboxes but the price range is wide. I wanted to check in here and see if there was a brand anyone specifically recommended before I commit to a purchase.

I never even heard about self heating lunchboxes, but now I want one.
I got one of these a few years back for $50, it was the best thing ever. I used it to re-heat leftovers the next day, put it on one hour before I was ready to eat and I'd have very hot lunches.

If you have access to a powerpoint it would be much less expensive to buy a cheap microwave from Big W or Kmart.
I've got something awfully similar to this https://www.anacondastores.com/camping-hiking/camp-cooking/camping-stoves/spinifex-12v-portable-food-warmer/90164953?gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwtsy1BhD7ARIsAHOi4xYKI6fQOE9VuGFYvyVxQMZIz3pCojDDJJOZITIwjOZ6xpqPBgLML3oaAopuEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds

There's heaps of very similar options around. I'm pretty sure I paid ~$39. And see them on sale around that price pretty regularly.

Also you could get one of these adapters to run it on 240v

I also have one of the kickass 12v ovens, and between the two, it's utterly fantastic. Saved oodles of money on food skiing. There is nothing better than getting back to Loch Car park, at Mt Hotham, and having hot soup and warm bread for lunch in a car with the heater on. Also, do lots of the Aldi frozen foods on road trips, again saves a bundles in the long run
I totally get that! The LunchEaze sounds solid, but $100 for shipping? No thanks! I've heard good things about the Tupperware SmartSteamer too. Worth checking out!
Could you use a 12v travel buddy and use a 240v to 12v adaptor?
I know not everyone's website, but Amazon seems to have the luncheaze with free international shipping.
I know someone who has this for the partners work vehicle. Swears by it.

They meal prep and put in here frozen, and by lunch, it's defrosted and hot through.
They used to use Chinese takeaway containers, they now use recycled cardboard eco containers.
International shipping is jacked in the current age. It sounds like a great idea though so maybe you should do a group order and reduce the combined costs lol
I have the Sunbeam HP3000P GoLunch Food Warmer which was $30 AUD when I bought it years ago. I don't know if they are still available in the market.
Stop wasting money, use the old fashioned way. Put it on the dashboard for a while, or use the engine bay, if the motor is running. No need to buy extra junk

Ohhh that looks good! Is there a version that plugs into the wall too?
Iâ€™m looking for a heating lunchbox because I canâ€™t stand microwaved food lol, but thanks.Â 
That adapter can't deliver enough power to run something like that (2 amp supply vs 10 amp draw). Don't buy that adapter for that purpose.
As long as the power requirements for the lunchbox are met by the adapter.
If you have amazon prime you get free international shipping over I think $60au. Or it used to be. Very handy for heavy car parts ðŸ‘€
That might be how I have to do it.Â 
I love how the product image is specifically designed  to appeal to the target market - a lovely blonde lady about to hoof into a pie and sausage roll.
I would be very wary of anything Aliexpress when you're playing with mains power & heating elements. 

They may be cheap, but they aren't validated through testing to Australian standards.

You really don't want that extra spicy zing of 240v streaming through your body.
