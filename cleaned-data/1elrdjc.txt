Sediment levels in the Brisbane river have been on a downward trend for years.  You can see all the various levels reported here -https://reportcard.hlw.org.au/graphs-by-catchment?regions\[0\]=region.Lower%20Brisbane&regions\[1\]=region.Mid%20Brisbane

There was an absolutely MASSIVE spike due to the 2022 floods, and this resulted in the mud plume, but it isn't accurate to say that developments are currently causing an increase in sediment levels in the river.

I am not at all saying that sediment and erosion controls should be enforced, they absolutely should.

Where developments will cause issues is in the significant increase in hard surface massively increasing runoff into waterways, which then increases water speeds and volumes.

The major cause of sediment is channel and gulley erosion in the Lockyer Valley. This was caused by historical clearing of waterways which has made them unstable and highly prone to erosion. Most of the sediment moves into Brisbane River during minor and major flooding events. 

Construction is a problem, particularly sites that are cleared well before construction starts. But this is a minor problem in comparison.
It okay, its the politicians plan to sell off all the water and privatise it so that we can import the water again. Good governance Australia, the water market will fix all these problems!

Population increase: oh, just build more homes.  
More people, more homes: quality of life lowered.
