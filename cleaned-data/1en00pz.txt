Epic swim!

that was insanely difficult conditions. the swimmers were hugging the edges to minimise the current - but then getting caught up in vegetation and occasional rubbish along the way.
Takes home a silver medal and e.coli by looking at that water
The gold winner is her best friend and would like her to celebrate her win in the TeamNL house (fanhouse in Paris), I thought that was super wholesome. I'm sure the Dutchies will cheer her on like any other athlete!
She almost had gold! An excellent swim indeed.
They all deserve a medal for swimming in that water..
What a ripper
Great effort, but holy crap did that water look disgusting. 
Can't help but be proud of our athletes overseas right now.

In unexpected places as well ❤
Seinesatinal!
And everyone's gonna win the Porcelain award for swimming in that...
Hopefully she didn't get a side award of Ecoli.
A few of the ol bondi cigars but the French version
What a swim, shame she got pipped at the end!
It was the mid-swim diarrhoea jet boost that help her along!
