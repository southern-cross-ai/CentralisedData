Allianz in 5.5th place?
Aren't we always close to the top of the medal tally until the swimming ends. Then we fall off a bit cause we aren't always great at track and field as we are in swimming
At this stage the Greeks probably want to take their ball and go home. No olympics for anybody.
Pretty fucken good
Bugger, the yanks are one up on us. Right after I've been rubbing their noses in the fact we were ahead.

Quick Australia, do your best as we know you can.
No one cares about the Olympics.
Pretty much. Same reason Japan always gets up there when the Judo is wrapping up, then they fall off a bit.
Just looked at our recent results, since 2000 we finished:

4th, 4th, 6th, 8th*, 10th and 6th

The * is because we went up the medal tally after a medal redistribution in London.
When are we not? Australians during this Olympic event are basically the guy who starts showboating at 50yards in a 100 yard dash. XD
they did it ðŸ˜Œ
Japan seem to be doing well in the skateboarding events as well. That's putting them higher up.
Good point, we aussies are awesome.
Yards? I'm guess you're an American :)

I agree, we do like to celebrate even though it might be early.
Respect though yâ€™all are sporty
