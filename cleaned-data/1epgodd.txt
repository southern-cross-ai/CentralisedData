I work a full time job, can't afford a full 50% of the rent in the place I share with my brother.
Remember when housing co-ops were considered just for weird crunchy granola people who thought they were too good to be normal and buy a “real house”, who found other weird crunchy granola people and they built weird little houses together and had lots of meetings and a communal vegetable garden? 

Yeah, so co-ops could start to make a comeback and it wouldn’t be the worst thing ever for some people, IMHO. The inconvenience of having to run things as a collective could be balanced out by the safety of having a community as we edge closer to social collapse or whatever the fuck is going to happen.

Property as an investment is wrong.

Put tax on the owning class to make it enough for them to prefer stocks.

Thanks.
This is the hidden homelessness, the problem is so much bigger than portrayed by the tent sleepers. Those in tents are just the visible rot of the whole stinking carcass of financially unreachable proper housing.
Been in one my whole adult life. 

That doesn't look like it's changing. Ever.
Im yet to see any of my local MPs even discuss it anymore. They've basically put their fingers in the ears and only celebrated the whopping TEN fucking dwellings they've manage to build.
And people in share housing means wfh is nearly impossible!
*new figures

Cold comfort to the people living this for at least a decade.
My neighbour never left the family home. Her kids are now teenagers
politicians pay should be tied to their performance of the society that they have ruined!!!!!!!!!!!

why should thousands and thousands be stressed, struggling, suffering etc. while the inept apathetic parasitic architects of societies demise have no consequences for their inactions!!!!

we exist within a real life game of monopoly, and we all know how that turns out.  one is left holding all the money and everyone else is left upset, indebt and in tears.
Interesting that no one is really fretting about the 1000's of layoffs going on in the mining industry. BHP and FMG being 2 notables. Then there's this headline the other day:

The resources boom may well and truly be over for a while. So it's gonna be hard for landlords to keep jacking rents from here.
Most people throughout Asia live with relatives.
Sharing isnt very safe. Im disabled and Id hate to think what would happen if the person I ended up sharing with decided they had beef with me. 

Theres also the fact if they leave and you cant get a replacement quickly, you have to cover full rent on your own or move too. Simply cant afford to.
It's still lower than it was before the pandemic.
F*cking same.
Also remember when people lived with their families and it was considered normal? And then families helped with childcare and aged care?
The Catholic Church invests in ndis housing. 😑
Your solution to improving the affordability of rentals is encouraging people to disinvest in real estate, thereby reducing the amount of future housing stock that comes onto the market? This is prime r/LeopardsAteMyFace material.

>Put tax on the owning class to make it enough for them to prefer stocks.

Stocks are already preferred to real estate. The ASX has historically returned much better results than residential property. The only reason why people invest in residential property at all is because of leverage and the tax free treatment of capital gains for your PPOR. New building approvals are at historical lows exactly because it's a not a particularly good investment when risk versus returns are weighed up...
Share housing isn't hidden homelessness
Same, and it doesn't bother me, I like living with friends who are also not going to have kids etc. but there's absolutely no fucking security or safety whatsoever in the rental class and not a single MP looks to give a fuck or want to change that.
Not to mention that share housing can be inherently dangerous, especially for women like me and my partner.

We've lived together for 2 years now, and have dreaded if the housing crisis ever got so bad in our area that we'd have to get a stranger living with us.
Did it during covid- 3/4 WFH and due to room sizes one had to work in the living room. Due to the open plan design and the nature of their work this meant noone could access the kitchen or laundry while they were working. Due to Sydney Head office setting the rules from interstate based on Sydney's COVID situation regardless of the situation here. Which meant this went on for 7 months. (The other two were back in office when the compulsory lock down lifted and a month after) They finally let them go back to the office when another housemate walked by the view of the camera while on an early morning meeting wearing only boxer briefs.
Maybe they could invent these buildings where people go to work 🤔
> we exist within a real life game of monopoly, and we all know how that turns out.

That's capitalism baby. The behaviour of the owning class and the politicians who serve them isn't arbitrary.
We will just keep pumping up immigration numbers and rent prices will just keep going up.Take a look at Canada, that’s where we will be in 5 years if not much worse.
>The Catholic Church invests

Tax-free/charity status should be revoked based on this alone.
>The only reason why people invest in residential property at all is because of leverage and the tax free treatment of capital gains for your PPOR

The only reason is that it's more profitable in their circumstance.

Got it.
On a risk adjusted basis no way stocks are prefered to real estate (Stand-alone houses not apartments) in Australia. Owning land is the best investment in Australia by far when you add PPOR exepmtion and leverage plus all the grants

Building approvals have to do with apartments being a poor investment not stand-alone houses. That is related to an incompetent construction industry protected by gov as trade skills shortage has skyrockted since we decided we need more IT immigrants to Uber drive instead of builders. NIMBYM makes overall construction a nightmare. 

Investing in land vs investing in a construction business are totally different things. Just because approvals are low doesnt mean land banking is not a lucrative busienss.
Right? I share with my brother and we do have room for a 3rd Tennant since our friend left. However I don't want to live with a strange man I don't know and I can't imagine it would be comfortable for a woman to move in for the same reason. (Plus he still walks around in only his underwear on noccasion) Plus living with a friend/family members quirks is one thing but having a stranger in your home makes it awkward.
I think we will be far worse than Canada, as terrible as they are; they actually build far more affordable apartments to increase density than we do with higher quality. 

We got high immigration and high NIMBYSM against decent afforble apartments which will be a huge disaster
What? They literally just created new laws stopping this they've put caps on overseas immigration not just students.

Yeah they seem to be absorbing up so much, plus they have so much leasehold stuff in manly etc. it’s crazy how much property these tax free havens have when we need houses.
I definitely agree, we also have an economy that revolves around minerals and resources which we will not be able to sell in the near future. 

People in this country have no idea what’s about to happen. I honestly think we will collapse as a first world nation within the next 20 years.
