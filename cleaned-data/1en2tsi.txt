For me it‚Äôs brown all the way
Brown seems a little less fizzy with a more distinct vanilla flavour. Red is sweeter, fizzier and has a more pronounced artificial flavour. Both serve a purpose but both need to be ice cold. Brown is the best option for a spider
Creaming soda = red

Cream soda = brown
Brown til I die.
Brown all the way we used to call it kids beer growing up
Yellow
Tarax Brown cream soda was the bomb. 

I miss the good old days. üò™
It makes me sad that there is no sugar free brown variant widely available. Cut out sugar soft drinks but jeez the brown creamy soda is such a good flavour
Tarax
yellow üíõ
Brown AKA nectar of the Gods
Brown, bonus points for Tarax.
Red
The old blue stuff was good too
Shine a light through it, should be brown.
Used to have a clear one from the US. 

So that. 

Jokes, brown is best
As a kid, it was always yellow. Didnt even know there was other colours. Then one day I saw red and it tasted like a schweppes raspberry lemonade spider.

Then years later, maybe my mid teens, I saw someome drinking a brown one. I though it was a sarsparilla at first. It was odd. I couldn't compute the colour changes ü§£

Even now, I almost never see the brown one except on the shop shelf. Its always yellow, sometimes red. The ones in the shops are always half stocked because they've been chosen, but the brown one is always fully stocked.

I should buy one of each and do a blind taste test.
Unpopular opinion but YELLOW has entered the chat‚Ä¶
Brown and make my own with a soda stream and bickfords creamy soda syrup

Golden creaming soda is king.
Brown all the way.
Brown
When did they change the name? Swear it was called brown

Anyways saxbys brown cream soda is the best
i like brown better but both is good. plus some other colours i only see in foreign lolly shops.
Creaming soda used to be yellow back in the day, and if your siblings/cousins gave you a warm glass, you'd have to check 'n make sure they didn't piss in the cup instead.
I like both, personally.
Both are very tasty. Put either one in front of me and I‚Äôll drink it and enjoy it.

Brown‚Ä¶that is all

Only ever brown.
Brown has a richer, deeper vanilla flavour.

Is brown cream soda the same as Kole beer? (WA)
Brown
Brown all day!

Sno Drop is the best type of creamy soda.
Brown!!
Brown is cream soda (classic) red is creaming soda (yes there is a difference)
Brown allday everyday
Brown...I call it the Original Creaming Soda.
brown all the fucking way
Bundaberg Burgandee.
Yes
Brown of course
Brown is the GOAT
Brown hands down.
Also tastes great with a little white rum.
Brown.... esp 1980's TAB cans
Brown > Red
Brown
Brown all the way
Absolutely brown. Despite the actual differences, I've never understood how you can associate the colour red with being creamy. It's all wrong.
Halls Sno Drop back in the day was like fucking crack. That and Fruita. One sip and 7 year old me would be fiending to neck litres of the shit
Gotta get down with the brown

This is the only time I feel that saying this is appropriate üëç
Brown is the S tier choice. I miss Tarax
Piss coloured all the way.
Saxbys Brown creaming soda thanks üòä
Why are we forgetting the yellow gold and circle one?
delicious creaming soda... brownest of the brown sodas... so tempting... [puts the bottle to his ear] What‚Äôs that? You want me to drink you?
Yellow
Yellow is the best
The best creaming soda is Wimmers and it happens to be a toxic yellow colour.
Brown. Tastes heaps better. Red is still tasty but brown is the best.
Brown just taste like childhood and happiness
Poo colour is best
Why not both? :p
Whichever colour Shelley‚Äôs Snow Cap was
As long as it's creamING soda.

Saw Bilson's creamY soda cordial and thought what the hell is that?
There was only brown in the 1970s/early 80s.  
  
Never saw the pink one till much later. It's not the same. Sweeter and different flavour.  
I've even seen 'creaming soda' instead of 'creamy soda'.

We used to get dozen mixed bottle deliveries by Loys and Swing in the 1970s.  
Creamy soda, sarsparilla were my faves.  
I used to pretend I was drinking beer with the creamy soda. üôÇ
Do yourself a favor and try drinking a bottle of bunderberg burgundy creaming soda instead of that suger swill made by Schweppes .
Whichever is less popular lol
The one in this picture is the best by far.
They taste exactly the same, but brown
Brown is superior
Brown. Always was, always will be!
Brown all day every day
Allow me: the red creaming soda from Spar shops, the Spar brand stuff.

Where I live, they sell out of this shit *every single week* without fail. Without. Fail. My neighbour complained to them the other day because it's like a local delicacy and we always complain to each other about how the shops don't order enough.

The alco's here mix their own homebrew gin and vodka with it. I thought that was a myth but I've seen them load up on the CS and hit the bottle o on pay day.

They order 150 bottles a week (12 cases) on Tuesdays and it's gone by Friday.

They won't order more for some reason but the fact I know all this about a fucking soft drink shows just how popular it is in my area.

Red Spar Creaming Soda. $1.20.
Blue
Wimmer‚Äôs yellow creaming soda around. Change my mind.
Finally, the question has been asked...BROWN.Red tastes like candy piss crap
If its tangy and Brown you're in creaming soda town
Brown is the way, but I grew up with yellow (which has the same/similar taste as brown).
After having the UK cream soda for the first decade, which is at least 10x creamier than the brown cream soda here. I remained disappointed in Aussie cream soda for decades after moving here. That red stuff is not cream soda, why does it have the name when there‚Äôs nothing creamy about it?

Then I found wimmers two years ago, and I buy it at least once a week. The gold stuff. Go buy it.
It used to be yellow.
Totally depends on whether you want Cream or Creaming!?!?
Either. But prefer brown myself
BROWN
Brown.  All day, every day.
brown taste better
As God intended - brown! FFS.

Brown all the way..

The only way
Is brown more like vanilla? I can't pick one over the other.
Brown goes well with Spiced Rum ü§§
Brown. Don't like red at all
Red is raspberry
Brown

I love the brown :)
It doesn't matter. They're all just vanilla flavour.
Burgundy.
Brown is my go to from childhood.

Can remember discovering the delicious clear F&N Ice Cream Soda while overseas, and was stoked to find it at a local Asian grocery.

A few years ago I can remember having a green (lime) and orange creaming soda. Brand was Ceda, but have never seen it around since.
Red, don‚Äôt come at me with that toilet water other stuff.
You guys just had to call it a creaming soda like a bunch of weirdos
When i was a kid it was green, and it will forever be green hands down!
When I was young I would have said pink is the best, but now it‚Äôs brown town!
Portello is best
Bring back Tarax!
Isn't the flavour of creaming soda just vanilla?
It‚Äôs supposed to be green
The only answer is back of burke creaming soda in red.
Brown for the butter beers. üç∫
The name creaming soda sounds a little freaky to me and makes me slightly uncomfortable
I love that this post has generated a meta-controversy over cream, creamy or creaming soda. Soft drink is epic.
Tastes the same to me. Tastes exactly the same as if you were to be mixing bicarb with sugar and tap water.
Woodies used to make the best brown type sno top.
I love both
I love both
Brown will always have my heart.
Red
Brown!
Brown is elite. Red always tasted too chemical-forward for me. Brown also just feels fitting for a vanilla soda.

Has to be brown.
I have just recently swapped from Red to Brown and i'm not going back.
Another vote for the brown. No idea if it's that I associate red with raspberry and hypo drinks, or if the flavour is superior. It's just that in my mind, Brown is creamy soda. Red is the cause-hyperactivity-raspberry fizzy drink.
I‚Äôve never tried brown so I‚Äôll have to check it out.
Both are disgusting
Imma stand on this fence....

B O T H
Brown all the way!
Red.
Brown for sure.
Red.

Definitely brown.
Brown‚Ä¶although in the ‚Äò90‚Äôs I used to enjoy blue creaming soda.
Bundaberg Burgundy in the dark glass stubby was always the best 

When they released the clear glass it changed for the worse

Brown, Red always gives me a headache
I've only ever had clear cream soda
100% brown but I won't knock red off the table.
Nice one Schweppes! I now want both!
brown
Has anyone tried the green can of Schweppes Cream Soda? It‚Äôs like a green/yellowish colour liquid.

It‚Äôs delicious!!!

I grew up drinking that in HK, we mix it with milk. A poor man‚Äôs spider.
Portello
I think its green in some countries.
But have you had Kol√® Beer (its a WA thing) - its brown creaming soda but better, especially ice ice cold!
Clear
Brown.

Currently have a bottle of Billsons Creaming Soda cordial, mixing with soda water. Classic taste.

Never had the brown ü§î
Either.... so long as it has vodka in it ü§™üòúü§£
I'd say a Reddish Brown or Burgundy for better term
Brown is smoother
The old brown A&W cream soda!!!
Wait what? I bought this a few weeks ago and it said "Brown" not classic
Brown
We need a hard brown creaming soda!

They nailed it with hard solo, expand dammit!
Green!
Brown. Red for kids
Snow Drop
I like both
Tastes change, I preferred red as a kid, brown as an adult.
If it‚Äôs brown, chug it down.
Yellow
Both are sacrosanct
I grew up with yellow. 
We'd put a nail through the cap and drink it with the cap on.
Red
Brown with whiskey is surprisingly good. Sounds weird but it works.
What state is this in? I thought the choice in QLD is red or gold.
In SA creamsoda is Green. Anything else is wrong
why not both? üòâ
It's clear.

Brown for sure
There‚Äôs a brown?
Red!?!?!?, what are you a monster!

Aw cream soda
Cream soda = soda that goes well with Vanilla ice cream spiders
Back in the day Brown, then marketing people realised that everyone thought brown was bougie so they started making shitty ones brown coloured.
Brown not even close
For a cold glass I prefer red.

For making adult butterbeer, brown + butterscotch schnapps, dash of cream.
It's brown for me
Red? It's pink
Red for day to day consumption.

Brown when we want to be a little more sophisticated
Always been too scared to try the brown lol
Yellow creaming soda. Crows nest for the win.

There‚Äôs brown? Bahahaha. First I have known of that haha.
Once you go black you never go back
Neither. Should be green
Tarax show with Uncle Norman, Joffa Boy and Fred Bear.
Brown and red creaming sodas are VERY different.  Brown is far superior.
üíØü§é
Brown always
Red.
That's brown creaming soda (source: me, graphic designer for ALB (Asahi lifestyle beverages). Red has been discontinued.
It‚Äôs a red vote from me. There‚Äôs just. Something off putting about the brown colour and it being named cream soda . Doesn‚Äôt gel
Brown has a better flavour
The green stuff please
Gotta be brown, the red looks wrong to me.
What about green?
I got creaming soda for my Sodastream. It's green.
Ours‚Äô in SA growing up was red/pink (Halls), so for me, I see red as its colour. But then Irn Bru is orange
Brown wins hands down!
Brown
Brown  so many memories! When did Red even become a thing?
Brown or yellow.
Red
Red. That‚Äôs it. Taste so much better
I know it sounds crazy but the brown one scares me maybe that‚Äôs bc I grew up on the red one from cans idk it always makes me feel funny looking at it. I‚Äôm too scared to try it though I‚Äôve been told it‚Äôs great
Kirk's red. They even make it in sugar free these days.
Brown > red, with the caveat being it 'must' be cold. Warm brown creaming soda? I'd rather drink diet coke.
Red is great but brown is better
In Hong Kong, Schweppes cream soda is the same colour as Mountain Dew and milder than the brown.¬†
Brown. 

Although I have to say, Seda had a Vanilla Creamy Soda flavour that tasted better than the brown. Unfortunately, I think one of the bigger companies bought the company and the flavour or Brand hasn't been available for over a year now. Sad
Brown
Dr Pepper with cream soda FTW!
Why are we asking this?¬†


Brown cream soda for the first 2 hours. After its flat, it's red.
Neither. It's, cream soda.
Red
The green one you can get from some Asian grocers. It's the best.
Red is acceptable, but brown is king...and Schweppes need to bring back ginger beer!
Brown because better texture and less food coloring
That is coke
They're two different drinks. The red is "Creaming Soda", the brown is "Cream/Creamy soda". They taste completely different.
>Let‚Äôs settle this: brown or red creaming soda

Well since you have the brown, it's not "Creaming soda". That's red. You have "Cream Soda".
It's more of a shade of a pink ISH red 
Brown is the worst one
Red
neither, yuk
Thanks, cool advertising.
A succulent Chinese meal
Creaming soda is a trash drink altogether
Brown is definitely goat for a spider
It might just be the colour perception but I reckon red has a bit of raspberry flavour in it
Tried to do a spider a few months ago. Haven't had once since childhood.

Was fkn gross and not what i remember at all.
. What's the ideal combo?
I prefer the red but go visit a South African shop and try a taste of green. It blew my mind to have red when I migrated here, felt so odd!
So ... what's cream*y* soda then?
Best creaming soda = yellow
In South Africa I think they have
Creme Soda = green
A pedant I see, but I appreciate it
What about clear?
Creaming soda = red

Shit = brown
Then after you die is it red?
Yes!! Lol...Aussie BBQ upbringing!
There was a local brewery in Newcastle called KB. That was what we called kids' beer
IKR? When I was a kid it was always yellow.
I didn‚Äôt even know it came in brown. Yellow all the way, tastes better than red
The hell kind of Shelbyville thing is this?
Yep came here to say this exact thing.
Big ol 2L bottle Tarax cannot be beaten.
Tarax black label lemonade was good too
Tarax or bust
Big old 2L cannon of tarax! [surprisingly still around!](https://www.yourgrocer.com.au/retailers/piedimontes-supermarket-north-fitzroy-/products/tarax-creamy-soda-yg-psn-11036)
My exact thoughts!! Tarax brown is elite. There will never be another that comes close. I miss it so much
Same was sarsaparilla. They need R&D on this 24/7
Did they pull the zero sugar Schweppes creamy soda?
I've seen the sugar free around, but it is VERY rare. Normalise that shit, I want to drink the brown sugar free Cream Soda like, every day!
Schweppes do zero sugar in the creaming soda, I've bought it many times.
A&W zero sugar is so good, hard to find though
Artificial sweeteners are worse for you than sugar and taste terrible, I really don‚Äôt understand why zero sugar is so popular
Kirk's.
All time
Too confusing. Blue is blue heaven flavour.
Interesting, I don‚Äôt think I ever had it, was it around in the 90s/00s?
UK is also clear
Not in Melb. in the 70s.
Found the Saffa.
Brown cream soda has a sweeter vanilla taste than the Kole Beer
'Tis portello.
Someone who remembers Fruita! I loved that stuff so much. It was kinda‚Ä¶ pineapple-ey?
Its the fckn bomb thats what it is. Anyone reading this wanna try it with some cold soda water.
Kirk's Creaming Soda has always been red.
Yup.  Vanilla coke feels like the same family as Brown CS
Creaming doesn't taste like vanilla at all, to me.
Portello.
Burgundy is portello. Not sure why bundeburg call theirs cream soda and not portello.
Then carbonate it, call it a fancy name. Honestly. They're the same thing. They don't have any significant form of flavour, it's just mouthfeel at this point.
Victoria
It's literally only brown because it's got caramel IV in it but sure
This is why i prefer the red one. When i buy the brown one, it brings all the spiders to my yard.
It is. Red is raspberry and brown is vanilla.

I‚Äôve always known it to be  
Cream Soda = Vanilla  
Creaming Soda = Raspberry

I could be wrong, I‚Äôve never actually checked.
Brown cream soda, shot of butterscotch schnapps, shot of cream (or ice cream). Optional, simple syrup and vanilla extract. Shake it all up, add cream soda last or it'll explode when you shake it.
This may have something to do with the ice cream, it's got to be high quality
They are disgusting hahaha
It just tasted like artificial sweetener to me unfortunately.
I prefer the Italian Chinotto  it seems to have more tang and kick. You could get it easily in Milk Bars but they seem to have disappeared from the fridges in shops. To me it was the ultimate drink to have with a greasy kebab, giros or souvlaki, the resulting burps were fantastic to get rid of bloat. It just seemed to cut the grease away. It is a natural citrus product. Try it sometime if you have not already.
We're you just getting the green creaming soda to make a Cane Train? I drank it in PE and it blew my mind......and liver.
100% agree! And when you hung over it's called the green ambulance! Works everytime!
When I visited RSA in my teens I was absolutely blown away by it being green. When I told the school friends I had there that ours was pink they simply would not believe it. 

If you know the lollies "Fizzers" you'll recall the creaming soda is green. I never really thought much about that until I learned they're made in South Africa!
Blue
Brown. Same stuff
Ahh a stray Wimmers fan. You know it's good when it's the colour of dehydrated piss.
SodaStream Creaming Soda is also green. My other half can't deal with the cognitive dissonance and won't touch it even though to me it just tastes like creaming soda.
Let‚Äôs get him now, boys
Still yellow in some parts, see Crows Nest Soft drinks made in QLD.
Where did you live? Tassie?

Always brown in Melb.
Agreed, and now I‚Äôm sorry I read that comment just before bed as I will have the ad jingle stuck in my head
Used to get me high as a kite‚Ä¶god I miss it!
Oh geez - forgot all about that. Yep, agreed - was the king of Lemonades üëç
Don't Schweppes do a zero sugar sars? Someone does, cause I've had it. I'm a sarsparilla fanatic but don't have sugary drinks very much, so I clearly remember getting one at Colesworth. It tasted like watered down sarsparilla and the flavour leaves your tongue as soon as the drink does. It was pretty shit tbh.
[Enjoy.](https://www.woolworths.com.au/shop/productdetails/886811/bundaberg-diet-sarsaparilla?srsltid=AfmBOoreTuplfchxxWo35f6F4GgNKVNdqzIVySMmtxs2YJjH_ZaEuYgZ)
Bundy do a diet Sarsarparilla, but it's not \*zero\* sugar, it's about 6g per bottle instead of 40+ for regular.
Oh my understanding was that sugar is absolutely horrible for you and worse than the sweeteners. Don't mind the flavour at all
Blue heaven was caramel, but the blue tricked your brain.  
I think there was Blue Heaven Cottee's ice cream topping once.
Yep, early 90s from a small Victorian bottling company called Splash
You can still get it from Wimmers
UK creaming soda has quite a different taste too. It's been a few years since I lived there so I can't remember what the difference actually is, but I think it leans much more vanilla-ey?
It's green in Hong Kong
Yeah, cream soda has to be poison green.
Tis delicious.
Yeah, pinapple and bit of passionfruit and something else in it I reckon. Not as strong as Passiona. I could probably search the ingredients but I can‚Äôt be bothered lmao
Kirk's Sno Drop is brown creamy soda.
Pink.
üò≠ü§Æ
Taffies made the best one, it's gone.
myyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

Soda brings all the spides to the yard
Depends on the brand. Kirks have a pink one that tastes close to Schweppes brown.

But bundeburg burgundy cream soda tastes exactly like portello.
im not even sure its suppose to be raspberry flavor. 

i think the flavor profile is just "red drink" 

i dont even want to know the truth tbh
Raspberry Ripple flavour specifically, which is a raspberry and vanilla mix. There‚Äôs a bickfords cordial that tastes exaaaaactly like it!
They are so good
Victorian Italian here. Chinotto is fantastic - love it with pizza - but isn‚Äôt much like cream(y) Soda. It‚Äôs based on a bitter orange type fruit that looks a bit like a darker blood orange.         
As a hack, if you like a similar drink and you‚Äôre at pretty much any pub in Australia, ask for a cola and bitters. Tastes a bit like the Nestl√© (San Pellegrino) chinotto.              
Re ridgey-didge creamy soda, brown was my go-to as a kid; I had Tarax cans 35c from the milk bar
Really? I've never seen that one.
Wimmers creaming soda is yellow. Its fucking delicious.
Brisbane, Queensland.
schweppes used to do a yellow one. i've had it in various places, but it was last century. Kyneton, Gisborne, Gundagai.
Man, that went downhill üòÇ
I started drinking more of that when I was doing 5/2 fasting, fortunately I spotted after a couple of weeks that while it is 'diet' compared to the normal one, it's not a zero-sugar, zero-cal 'diet' drink like diet/zero coke, sprite, pepsi etc. If someone is going totally zero sugar, it's not quite there.
Sugar isn‚Äôt horrible for you in moderation. If you can‚Äôt regulate how much Coke you guzzle down then artificial sweeteners are a good alternative.
Nah from what I‚Äôve heard artificial sweeteners are known to be carcinogenic
That‚Äôs funny, because the one South African I know who loves green creaming soda and specifically an African brand lives in Hong Kong. Wild.
Sodastream sells a syrup that's green. It's fucking awful though. Sodaking do a brown creaming soda that is good.
Different product to [Kirks Creaming Soda](https://www.woolworths.com.au/shop/productdetails/140092/kirks-creaming-soda-soft-drink-bottle).
I‚Äôm addicted to the Bundy burgundy, that stuff is so damn good
Bickfords is the best.
Chinotto > pizza > gelato ü•π
Never heard of cola and bitters - same ratio as a lime and bitters?
Thanks for the tips.
Ah. Different states have different companies.  
  
What brand was it?  
We had Marchant's, Tarax, Schweppes, mostly from memory.
Ah, could be a regional thing.   
Googled it and there's a few yellow ones and some brown too.

I never saw it.  
What did it taste like? Pineapple?
That was a live train of thought. Typed out for all to see üòÇ
Heh, heh.
Link the peer reviewed studies. You've been owned by big sugar mate.
I know, Sno Drop is much better than the red one.
Yes
I could swear that Kirk's Creaming Soda used to be yellow.

There was another brand named Tristrams that was also yellow.
pretty sure it was just vanilla, the colour was fun though.
Yeah it was glorious. I‚Äôve never known a comment to have a story arc before
I‚Äôve been owned by big sugar? You believe that something artificial is good for you?
Wimmers is still yellow, I think.
You are probably right. If you google it, there's a few yellow ones.  
Did it taste the same as brown is the question of our times.  
The brown is vanilla I think. The red is raspberry.
I remember Kirks and Golden Circle creaming sodas being yellow
Heh, heh.
Well if I type it here you might believe it. You "learnt" diet drinks give you cancer from social media as well
Qld. as well? Never heard of Wimmers.
Good question. TBH I'm struggling to remember the flavour. Vanilla seems about right.
Says who?
Yeah Wimmers is a Qld brand. Their yellow creaming soda is incredible, hell all their drinks are. My favourite is their double sars. So thick and creamy.
I know cuttlefish is used to make beer frothy.  
I wonder if the brown stuff had it, as it was quite frothy.
