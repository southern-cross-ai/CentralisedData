Australia's most successful gold medal tally.
Japan has also performed exceptionally well, achieving their second-best result ever! Wishing them continued success in their remaining games today!

I really thought we were a shot in the breakdancing
Aren’t there more sports (and events within sports) at the 2024 Olympics than in 2000?
If they bring in more dumb sports other than break dancing. Such as taking the rubbish out and cooking snags on the bbq we might be number 1 by now.
Great results, Aussies! 

BUT

You had that breaking participant, so…every and all gold medals you won in Paris are forfeit.
👍🇦🇺
That's amazing. For a country with a small population, we are definitely punching above our weight.
So USA needs to beat France in women’s basketball to win the Olympic medal tally. Australia has done some pretty big damage to the US medal hopes, will we cop the China treatment next Olympics and have testers do everything they can to disrupt our athletes
Yeah…. But now they know we can’t dance for shit…
Theres been sum good medal counts all round.

Do we thank Putin for all this?
How many days left? I have loved watching the Olympics this year

For the host country, France seems to be really underperforming.
Remember the Winter Olympics? Wanaka had more medalists than Australia.
NZ got 9 golds, which devalues the whole concept.
I don’t think anyone cares about totals, it’s all about the golds
In times where there are more and more medals to give away, it’s hardly a surprise, is it?
It’s always about number of gold
We need a brown medal for our flygirl
I don’t think either of our nations have any gold medal favourites left
NZ also has its most golds ever and sits in 4th place (medals per capita, Australia 8th) 😉
makes sense given they had the games recently
My mate does the slug when he's off chops and that had a better chance of medaling. I heard a bloke at the bar slipped and still got a better score.
I think we should commit to always having breakdancers of similar caliber representing us, solidifying our identity in this sport. Breakdancing isn’t being played in LA in 2028, but we must reintroduce it to Brisbane in 2032.
Yes, but competition across the lower and mid tier countries would have increased significantly since then.  


New Zealand a prime example. 


In Sydney 2000 they had one gold and 3 bronze (4 medals total). This Olympics they're up to 9 gold, 7 silver and 2 bronze (18 total). 


Likewise Uzbekistan. In 2000 they had 1 gold, 1 silver, 2 bronze (4 total). This Olympics they have 13 medals. 


Great Britain won 28 medals in 2000. Now up to 63 in 2024. 


These are obviously cherry picked at a glance. And we don't have Russia (officially) competing at this Olympics either. 


But we were always a bit ahead of the pack. Others have definitely caught up and we've done well to also improve (albeit slightly).
In 2000, there were 927 medals available in 28 sports and 300 events.

In 2024, there are 1003 medals available in 32 Sports and 329 events.
Also helps that Russia isnt part of this Olympics. They normally do pretty well
1003 medals have been given out so far in Paris. 927 were given out in Sydney.
Yes, more sports more medals on offer.
Being a host of the Olympics also means you have someone in every single event.

You mean the national legend?
The closing ceremony is on in the early hours of tomorrow our time.
France has their best medal results so far, surpassing Beijing record, also France is performing in a wide variety of sports except athletics, and there are a lot of people engaged in group sports like basketball, football, rusty (Where France gets good results in international championships) whereas Australia is not seen much for these sports. 

The disadvantage is that it leaves less players for more individual sports. Only very large countries car have enough population for both individual and group sports I guess.

BTW if you remove swimming Australia is probably down to the 30th rank so it’s also a lucky strike in this discipline
In what way? Seriously explain that.
I thought Kiwis were supposed to be humble. You guys definitely don't toot your own horn, no absolutely not.
Both can be cared about in their proper context.
Until it doesn’t suit the US media’s agenda
Both of us have solid chances to podium in mens keirin, albeit neither are favourites.
Japan has 2 wrestlers with a decent chance.
Japan have a few wrestlers in Gold medal finals. They'll overtake us but I'm liking our chances against France and Great Britain.
Where does it sit in sheep per capita

I’ll start practicing in 2032

I see what you did there. (Something something moral victory)
Russians are still competing under a different entity (sort of an ‘unrepresented nations’ open grouping). However the most egregious dopers are not.
State sanctioned doping helps a lot
Not quite, where you got that info shows that the 1003 includes a bunch still up for grabs
I mean Australia did win bronze in that event. So you're not too far off.

Hunting or return?
International legend now 🥳
France was expected to win over 20 Gold medals so this seems like a huge disappointment. Australia was expected to win just 13 Gold medals so we overperformed. Australia also only won 7 Gold medals in swimming so they're still in the Top 10.
Wanaka, a town of 8900 people had two gold medalists at Beijing 2022. Australia, population 26million, had 1 gold medalist.
True, if you are losing just pretend something else matters xD
Either Australia or Japan only has a chance in the Keirin if Lavreyson fucks up or somebody else crashes into him.
Up there with Wales.
Me too. I’ll be 51 years old at the time, definitely should qualify.
Only 15 Russians are competing in Paris under a neutral flag. There were 435 in Sydney for comparison.
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Summer_Olympics_medal_table#Medal_table  Seems to me to be only given medals
both, but the hunting has to be hunting kangaroos...

naked...

in the bush...

in the middle of summer.
France unofficial goal was 10 gold medals, so it’s a nice over performance

Actual goal was to rank in the top 5, which is attained
The Sochi games were 2014. 2022 was Beijing. Your figures don't correspond with 2014 and in 2022 one of the New Zealand gold medallists was born in Sydney Australia. 

But what ever. All this is irrelevant.
Silver and bronze medals are very different from "losing" for many athletes.
We are 5th in overall medals, and 3rd in golds, why would we start talking about overall and pretend like that matters more than golds when we are better off talking about golds only anyways

Your nonsensical arguement makes literally 0 sense
What about whales per capita?
Please re read the last sentence of my comment above to see why this is ;)
My bad, I misread the section that leads to there, it seemed at first (tired) glance to be unclaimed, but it was just for those that hadn't gotten a gold all bunched together in a smaller table
At the end of day both countries did well and France was a great host
Oh i just checked to see who is winning in the olympics based on gold medals, i see why some are so obsessed with counting inferior medals as total for rankings instead xD
If you believe that everyone but 15 are dopers you’re wrong. There were over 300 Russian athletes still competing in Tokyo under a neutral flag after the doping ban.

Russia and Belarus are completely banned from the team competitions this time because of the invasion of Ukraine rather than doping, and the governments of these countries are boycotting the Olympics and actively discourage the individuals from participating as well, literally calling them traitors. It’s mostly political.
You’re right, it was great games and two great results for both countries !
I have no interest in the terrible American ranking system but at the same time it's fine to celebrate silver and bronze and reaching a a number of total medals.
