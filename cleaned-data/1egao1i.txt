never see one weighted by government funding
I prefer to use the point weighting of (4,2,1)
This has been a known fact since 1992.

We did quite well for a country our size

Love it! I was hoping someone would do this...

Now, let's get more creative and give golds 4 points instead of 3, just to help out more. :) 

Or better still, use the scoring system for that strange AFL/Gaelic football hybrid, of 6/3/1.
I like how people saw a blatant piece of fake news (the down arrow over the "Total medals won" probably means he sorted by it), and decided to swallow it whole and make it a meme.

Can I disown my entire species? You're making me wish for a nuclear war so this planet can start over again.
Our oldest and most enduring sporting rival.
How about cost per medal. Some countries don't care about  how much  it costs to get a medal because its more about the propaganda value rather than raw natural talent so invest a bottomless pit of money. I doubt the data exists because very countries are that transparent.
...you know it was faked?
Except he didn’t - that’s exactly how the medal table is shown on https://sportsdata.usatoday.com/olympics/medal-count. Can we disown you?
So it defaults to sorting by total medals, but you can sort by golds as well. 

Sure they should set sorting by golds as default, but I really don't see why its such a big deal. Everyone knows the yanks will cherry-pick/change perspective to make themselves look better to their own citizens
Except if you go to his link click on the Paris drop down and select Beijing 2022 it puts America in 5th place even though sorting by gold moves America up to 3rd place. This also ignores the fact that the US has used medal count even back when the USSR was getting most number of medals. 

All in all counting by medals seem to just be an American thing to do. Someone joked about it be the Imperial way of counting medals and honestly it makes sense. America counts different and you will see the same post again next Olympics.
