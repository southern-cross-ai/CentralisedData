He was the bloke that insisted on the WW2 era RAAF uniform being actual dark blue & not blue/grey like the RAF version 


We stuck with that postwar for a while but then cheaped out and used the boring RAF colour 


Finally umpteen years ago we returned to real dark blue again and it looked much better 
That sword would be really useful against The Red Baron.
David Bowie, is that you?
It looks elegant and not overly ceremonial.
We are all very grateful it was forgotten
Maybe it was made by Hattori Hanzo "it will cut down god"
More Sgt Pepper
The sort of thing you could wear to a family barbeque, quiz night. Dressy but not over the top.
