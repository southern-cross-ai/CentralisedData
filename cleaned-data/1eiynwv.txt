A close friend of mine sent me a video recorded early this morning, the sound set off his Maremmano.

The following is the message he sent me: Checked up on the neighbours everyone in the direction of it was up checking out the place, not sure which neighbour actually had the explosion, or if it was bigger and being seen from a distance, NFI what happened; based on the explosion speed and size, I'm gonna guess petrol / propane / LPG, i.e. low order fuel explosion.

Cooking meth is hard when you're high on meth
I'm not sure if it was the veggie patch that exploded. Do you know where the footage was taken?
Friday night piss up
Those camping stove butane canisters make a similar explosion if thrown in a camp fire and theyâ€™re full.

Found that out when we were young and dumb. 

And the brazing torch ones go even harder.
