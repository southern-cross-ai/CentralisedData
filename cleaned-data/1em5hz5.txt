I broke two ball pump needles trying to pump up a ball from two different shops. I think they were from our supermarket duopoly and other one was from Kmart or big W or such. 
The metal seems so flimsy that I wouldn't expect such poor quality even from somewhere like Alibaba or Temu. 
Were they always this bad or is it just that Australian companies don't care about selling goods for for purpose anymore?


Also I am hesitant to pay more for them on something like Amazon or catch because I could just get chargeres more for the same exact quality. I am sure sports teams and sports centres that need to inflate lots of balls need better quality ones, so they must exist. Where do they get them from?
Did you lubricate it first?
They've always been a bit shit
Have never broken one, either a decade ago or recently.

Did you at least spit on it first?
I've broken heaps lately, I reckon they've gotten shitter for sure
I was literally complaining about this specific thing to my friends over the weekend
you must be rough on them. I used small pumps from decathlon for weekly footie training for years and went through maybe 2 needles in that time. they do have a slightly wider threaded section than some fittings, but the needle the self is the same size as normal
I've never broken one. Students, on the other hand, just need to look at them, and they snap, usually inside the ball.

I'm a primary school teacher and am often in charge of the sports shed, part of which is making sure the equipment is in good shape.
1970 had good ones, couldn't break em
Never broken one in my life, stabbed my self with one, that was fun not
Push them into the ball holding the needle, not the hose or the head
Try 1990
go to servo, take off tshirt, put tshirt over pump hole, press inflate from flat, push down really hard
I have 2 plastic ones i bought years ago that work awesome. If you can find any like that i recommend.
Not kmart thats for sure. I got a good one from Intersport a few years back. Cant remember the name though. Made sure it wasnt the cheap one though.
should have gone to Specsavers... Sorry just joking ;-)
Did you go in dry 🤔😳🤷‍♂️
Hawk tuah it first
They’re the single most brittle substance on earth
Yes.
Avoid kmart and you'll be ok
I've never had a problem with any of the ones from Rebel. Try there maybe?
These are all I can find and they're shit shit shit
Made from high grade Chinesium
Gotta lick it before you stick it
You can get like 100 of them for less $2 on AliExpress though - it'll be the same shit quality ones that Kmart etc. have, but you won't run out any time soon. And FWIW you can get quality stuff on there, I have some great computer cables for a fraction of the cost locally, but takes a while to find something with decent specs and good reviews.

No idea where to get an actual quality one though, I've never broken mine so figure it must be okay. Came with the pump.
Same here in NZ they are all shit
hawk tuah 💦

I know other people are saying not Kmart, but I’ve found the cheap one I got there as a fill in until I found a decent one has lasted a few years now.
Buy a quality one from a bike shop, and not ones made for balls and mine hasn't broken since. Prior to this was ordering bags full of cheap ones from Amazon.
Everything made in China these days. Cheap and nasty

Agree. Always need to lubricate.
There's no time for lubricant!
Ye olde Vaseline.....
Or Ky
Or skyns
Or ansell
Or just spit...
Never thought this was serious - will wet it first as the instruction states. A timely thread too as we’ve broken the BigW and Rebel Nk branded ones, multiple of the former.
This is great life advice for many situations 
Always broke em
Perfect business opportunity for someone, "Titanium ball needles and ball wonder lube gel" oops I should not have mentioned it, it will be on AliExpress tomorrow. Opportunity lost.
I've never spat on one of these and have never had an issue. i thought you were joking till i saw all the other comments about it ITT. is it just to make it slide in easier?
I’ve always sucked on it. Are people worried about germs?
Many products have become not so much products, but junk in the shape of products. So much quality is removed in the pursuit of saving money that the end use becomes impossible. It’s part of the ongoing enshitification problem.
I had one that lasted me years, but I lost it. I have had bad luck with pumps for my bicycle with different parts breaking in the most stupid ways until I bought one someone recommended and haven't had issues since. I just didn't expect the same thing with the needles, I guess I will buy from rebel or decathlon or such.
One of them I didn't even start putting in the ball and  I realised there was already a gap at the pin connection as air was coming out of it as I was pushing the pump down to make sure that it was put in properly
Don't even need to use the shirt. 

Just make sure you have it tight over the hole.
These are the higher grade - Thaitanium

I didn't think bike shops would sell them because they are not needed for bikes
Not everything is made in china, and not everything made in China is cheap and nasty - but people sure do prefer to pay cheap-and-nasty/made-in-china prices over paying for quality items.
That’s a lie. Many expensive electronics are made in China. It more or less spends on how much the manufactures want to pay for production.
Idk my iPhone was pretty expensive and made in China. Generally, pay a lot, good, pay little bad.
China has lifted the global standards for manufacturing in many industrial areas but stay mad

I have one of these and it's really good. Use for children's basketball and the ball adaptor is pretty good. Also excellent for bikes with both fittings easily usable.
China isn't the only country that builds cheap and nasty. The problem is that the default is cheap and nasty now a days, and that just so happens to often be china. But it won't be china for long, considering how expensive it is now to manufacture in china the only reason cheap stuff is still made there is inertia and that building new factories in new places is an initial capital investment
Yeah just spit on it and stick it in ffs
There's always time for lubricant!!!
Just hawk tuah, spit on that thang?
Or even just stick a pre lubed condom over it and once it breaks you know its in. Altho that may not be the best advice. Edit "Yes that is bad advice but we are talking about blowing up balls here and in theory it would work, any other time No."
Don't need to change material, the point of failure is the joint between the two pieces. Really just need a design that's a single piece.
Can damage the bladder just shoving it in raw.
The first part was serious. The second wasn't.

But yes, they do recommend you lubricate the needles with Vaseline or similar.
yes, very much so, and also makes it easier to take it out after. lube is vital when working with rubbers
seriously. the are far too many innduedos happening already and you are just making it worse, on a more serious note, who the hell would think that sucking on it would make things better. just a little lubrication, water vasseline even spit if need be altho that would degrade it faster. but sucking on it?
If it was the Kmart one,  I have gotten a defective one from them before.  The pin actually shot out of it like a dart gun when I turned on the pump, brand new from the pack.

I don't claim it as broken by me since it never even got its tip wet.
But then you don't get to take your tshirt off.
True but these days you are also paying for quality and getting cheap and nasty chineseium shit. 


The "enshittification" is well and truly upon us.
It isn't just how much manufactures want to pay. It is a cultural problem of quality control and adherence to standards. Different countries and of course companies in those countries have different attitudes and approaches to quality control. Some are based around being so over precise and better than spec that they need to spend less on throwing out products or redoing work, others work so close to being out of spec to save money but then make it up by having to throw out more or fixing things up.

Mainland china doesn't have a culture of any kind of culture which is why you have the tofu dreg building phenomenon.

It isn't something you can just spend your way out of as a manufacturer. It isn't impossible, just it is harder than just throwing money at it. You have to make sure you have workers that don't want to lie flat from the top all the way down and have incentive structures that reward quality over presenteeism. It is an issue in all countries (who hasn't had a job where their boss or management hasn't cared about the stupidest thing instead of what actually matters?), but in china it is much harder because of an entrenched culture
You mean pay a lot to workers or pay a lot as a consumer?
In which areas and in which ways?

The only thing that comes to mind is rare earth metals refining,  but only because of the rest of the world stopped trying ages ago because it is so polluting.
I’m sure I’ve even seen using saliva as a suggestion on the packaging for certain needles
Hawk tuah?
Nooooooo!!!!!!!
Great googa-mooga.
Yeah at least take it out to dinner first, jeez
lots of innuendos here
If it gets the job done, nobody's complaining and everyone's happy after...


Let people suck what they wanna suck.
I guess I’ve always done it that way because that’s what my dad did with my balls when I was a kid.  Never tried Vaseline.
Precisely
Seafood?
> innuendo

That's an Italian suppository isn't it?
True, but i would make sure to wash it first, you dont know who else has been playing with it or where it has been.
