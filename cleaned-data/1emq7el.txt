Gentlemen, this is democracy manifest.
Chinese restaurants are about to have a record night tonight in his honour.
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight we eat Chinese.
Rest in peace, legend. May the afterlife bring you an abundance of succulent Chinese meals, and those who are waiting to receive your limp penis.
Tata, and farewell

May he have many succulent Chinese meals
This does not affect my life in any way whatsoever and yet I'm devastated.

We demand a state funeral.
RIP.  I propose a national mourning holiday.
May the afterlife be prepared to receive your limp penis sir. RIP
#putoutyoursucculentchinesemeals
 
Oh man‚Ä¶ I quote this guy at least once a week lmao. Won‚Äôt be the same now üò¢ rip sir
Will be having Chinese at my judo club tonight
To be always remembered in the larrikan's hall of fame.
When ordering my Chinese meal tonight, I will ask: "WHAT IS THE CHARGE?"
make 8/8 Succulent Meal Day
Day ruined, this is not succulent news, get your hands off my cold dead heart
I am going to eat a succulent Chinese meal on his behalf, and then touch my penis, in his memory.  All for democracy.
All flags at half mast
Just want to recommend this podcast which goes into great detail about the event.  
[A Succulent Chinese Meal - ABC listen](https://www.abc.net.au/listen/programs/earshot/a-succulent-chinese-meal-viral-video-this-is-democracy-manifest/13678264)

It has some truly touching moments, almost brought a tear to my eye.
And at the pearly gates, Saint Peter he will tell, "Are you waiting to receive my limp soul? Ah I see you know your good men well."
Tis a sweet & sour day for Australia¬†
I work right next door to the place too. Might need to stop by when I'm next at the office
Vale you massive legend.

I‚Äôll be grabbing a random man‚Äôs penis in tribute.
Public holiday please Mr. Albanese?

‚ÄúDemocracy Manifest Day‚Äù will do.
An Australian legend. My condolences to your nation. NZ mourns with you
Here's the link

https://youtu.be/PeihcfYft9w?si=1bEb4SY4ZojCXAGm
Has the judo gold medal match been played at the Olympics? If not, they need to do a minute silence for this great man. RIP king
They may have grabbed him by his penis, but he grabbed us by our hearts. Rest in peace, legend.
As an American I just want to thank Australia for giving  this gift of a man to the world. 

Yall did good.
I‚Äôm actually a little choked up. He was an internet meme but he brought such laughter and really showcased how out of this world us Aussies can be. RIP legend.
Ta ta and farewell Sir Jack Karlsson OSCM, DM, KLP, 

(Order of the Succulent Chinese Meal, recipient of Democracy Manifest, Knight of the Limp Penis)
There needs to be a national funeral
"I'm under WHAT?!"
Jack has got to be the most quoted Aussie ever -and what a quote! RIP to a legend & an icon üçúüçÜüá¶üá∫
The king of Australia is dead. God bless the king.
The mystery to me is why the original arrest footage was shown on the news in the first place.¬†It must have been an extremely slow news day for a dine-and-dasher arrest to be considered a newsworthy event.
Everyone should go out and eat a succulent chinese meal tonight. Or grad a random stranger's penis in his memory.
WHAT IS THE CHARGE?
#limpdicksoutforkarlson
What was the cause of death? Eating a meal? A SUCCULENT CHINESE MEAL? 


Tis a sad day today! Rip legend!
The least succulent news I‚Äôve heard all year üòï

RIP(enis), King.
Enjoy the succulent Chinese meal in the sky big fella....RIP.

Watch out for the Catholics though, they WILL try to touch your penis.
Eating a spice bag in Dublin in honour of the single greatest cultural phenomenia to come from this country.

I hope all meals hence force to be succulent and the police keep their hands off your penis. 

The world is a little darker but the memory shall never be forgotten.
May his afterlife be filled with succulent Chinese meals and judo. Thanks for the memes Jack
Fly high mate, may your Chinese meals be forever succulent üëç
He's eating succulent Chinese meals up in heaven now
I'ma grab some Chinese tonight in your honour mate
God‚Ä¶he literally did an interview with the cop that arrested him on one of the morning shows (I forget which one) a few weeks ago and he seemed alright. Crazy how quickly death can come. Rip legend.
Goodnight my sweet prince
Penises will be limp today. RIP
A succulent Chinese meal in his honour is on the cards for tonight
Today we not only mourn the loss of Jack Karlson but the death of aussie larrikinism. Taataa and farewell old mate
American Texan here: I often reference the ‚ÄúSUCCULENT CHINESE MEAL‚Äù and I‚Äôve only gotten confused or concerned responses. Thanks Jack!
This is tragedy manifest.
Albo surely has to announce that going forth August 8 will be national succulent Chinese meal day.
May he and his penis rest in peace
Tonight I have decided to have a succulent chinese meal in memorium of a legend.
Not Australian, but I had to drop in to pay my respects to a legend of the internet.

Ta Ta, and farewell, Mr. Karlson. May you enjoy many succulent Chinese meals in the afterlife.
Yeah we need a public holiday for this. Democracy Manifest Day. The only shops allowed to open are Chinese restaurants. And we must attend morning service at a martial arts dojo. If we don't then the police have the authority to grab us by the penis people.
I'm getting a succulent Chinese meal tomorrow, and my girlfriend will receive my limp penis, also in honour of him.
All time best use of succulent in a sentence.
What's the charge? Being a legend? An iconic Australian legend? üò≠
Tata and farewell, friend.
RIP.  You will live forever in our hearts.
I have taught my daughter to say this is democracy manifest every night before bed. She is now 4 and has been doing it for a couple of years.
Ironic, a man famous for eating a succulent chinese meal, died on one of the luckiest Chinese Calandar days 8/8.
This is a legend manifest!

He lived and died by the succulent Chinese meal üòî

Build this man a mememorial
We need a public day of mourning.
They were working on a documentary about his life which was announced recently. I hope it was put together before he passed because it sounds like he lived an entertaining life. What a legend.
Flags on the bridge had better be at half mast.
I guess the police finally let go of his penis. 


Enjoy your succulent Chinese meal where ever you are, dude.
Rest easy Jack, and enjoy that sweet juice of the red grape, wherever you might be.

Delivered one of the most memorable performances, and etched himself in to history as not only an Australian Icon, but an international icon.

Tata and farewell.
Put out your Chinese meals.
Every time Judo comes on the Olympics, I also think, "Ah yes. I see you know your Judo well."

Threadheads are about to have a record day selling their democracy manifest shirts
RIP to this legend. I‚Äôm going to say something profound in a Australian/british accent next time I get arrested with the hopes that someone is filming me
Anyone else reading these comments in his voice!?
Going out to have Chinese tonight
His date of death, 8/8/24, sounds like "prosper, prosper, starve to death" in mandarin (with slight variation to the intonation). 

Which is a bit of a coincidence given the succulent Chinese context. 



Source: Native mandarin speaker. 8 - ÂÖ´ bƒÅ - Âèë fƒÅ - prosper; 24 - ‰∫åÂõõ √®rs√¨ - È•øÊ≠ª √®s«ê - starve to death
He's up in Heaven now having a succulent Chinese meal

Does anyone actually know what he was arrested for?¬†
I‚Äôll be touching a penis tonight in his honour.
There‚Äôs been so many posts on this today. Am I the only one who‚Äôs never heard of him?
We all should have a nice, succulent Chinese meal tonight in his honour. I will be.
That is so so weird. I couldn‚Äôt sleep this morning and was thinking about the world and democracy then thought of him and thought someone should make him a poster boy for democracy right now. Wow
Ta ta and farewell :(
RIP, Mr Karlson may the heavens open up a succulent Chinese banquet and your penis always be unhanded.
The world is a little dimmer without you in it.
He did some interview semi recently and he seemed a bit confused RIP
Get a speaker in that coffin... This has to be done.
NOOOOOOOO!!!!
On the bright side he lived a long life. In this day and age it‚Äôs rather rare to kick it at 80‚Äôs
So sad....this is democracy manifest üò≠üò≠üò≠
 No fucking way man‚Ä¶
Was he dining alone,  hope not, erudition like that needs an audience.
I suggest a Public holiday in his honour!
Take your hands off my p@nis‚Äô!
Get! your hands off my coffin!

I at least hope his wake is at the Chinese restaurant he was arrested at, if it‚Äôs still there

This man is a national treasure ü•π
In honor of this gentleman of culture, I believe we should all go out, enjoy a succulent Chinese meal, and perhaps be asked to leave for not being able to pay. A non-violent, non-felony arrest would also work.
NOOOOOOOOOOOO
This true blue Aussie will be going straight to the giant pool room in the sky with all the other Aussie legends
Gentlemen, leave a succulent Chinese meal on the front porch in memory
RIP. Absolute legend.
Did a quick ctrl+f and didn't see anything about it, but I first heard the "succulent Chinese meal" quote in Mac Miller's (under his Larry Fisherman alias) mix Run on Sentences Vol 2, so RIP to this goofy Australian rogue, and RIP to Mac both.
Time for a SUCCULENT CHINESE MEEEEAL!
Hopefully, he had a succulent last meal
How depressing. May he rest in peace enjoying a succulent Chinese meal üíï

My heart is broken into a million pieces
The greatest moments in comedy history. I will never stop laughing at this. RIP you glorious bastard!
I met him once. While me and a workmate were opening the bar for the day he rocked up to one of the booths and sat down, and we weren't sure it was him until he bellowed out "COULD ONE OF YOU LITTLE GIRLS CALL ME CAB??" in *the* voice. We're both men. I will never forget it. 

RIP to a legend.
what fucking legend
Ta Ta and farewell Jack
One less succulent Chinese meal will be consumed daily.
Angel: "God, that guy you let in cuz you liked his video, he's stealing from the buffet."

God: "Alright, have him removed. Put him in purgatory for a few days to teach him a lesson."

Jack: "Get your hands off my penis! What is the charge? Eating a meal? A succulent Chinese meal?"
Rest in peace Jack Karlson, hope you can enjoy all of the succulent Chinese meals you want in heaven.

Getting some rainbow beef and spring rolls to honour the lad.
A sad day to remember the good times
I am literally waiting for Chinese at my local in Brisbane right now (only saw this after ordering) and holy shit they are run off their feet.
record for most dine and dashes in a single night?
Yes it's the right thing to do.
Only the succulent ones
I just finished a succulent Chinese meal for lunch. And while I intended on having leftovers tonight, but democracy manifest calls upon me for a fresh meal.
To truly honour his spirit we're going to have to be escorted out by police.
I was thinking about getting some chinese food actual. I do enjoy a chinese meal.
Chinese takeaway is considered a luxury nowadays. The prices are insane.
I intend to make this a yearly commemorative family tradition moving forward. 

RIP succulently mate ü´°
First thing I thought: Chinese tonight for dinner!
#putyourdimsimsout
The succulent ones
Get your hands on my penis‚Ä¶ gone too far?
Yeah, no joke. Was gonna have sushi for lunch, but chose to forgo it and have chinese tonight. Maybe take the missus out
Old m8 be eating succulent Chinese meals in heaven.¬†
we need matt berry to reenact this.
Very poetic til the end. RIP
Off to the succulent Chinese meal in the sky
A funeral? A tasteful Australian funeral?

GET YOUR HAND OFF MY CASKET
Came here to suggest a state funeral as well.
Yep. Every man and his dog has a state funeral these days. The People‚Äôs Champion deserves one too.
Same. My husband and I communicate through quotes of that video. Jack gave us some good laughs.
Legit, if Albo did it, I reckon that would win him the next election alone
National Succulent Chinese Meal Day!
Put together a quick petiton using chatgpt
https://www.change.org/p/grant-a-state-funeral-for-aussie-legend-jack-karlson
Who will supply the succulent Chinese meal for the wake?
Once you've had a State funeral, you feel like another one 20 minutes later.
I‚Äôll actually be disappointed if this isn‚Äôt in the main headlines in the news tonight haha
I say two. One for succulent Chinese meal and another for judo day where everyone says I see you know your judo well after a judo battle.
State funeral
We‚Äôre mourning in Canada as well
International holiday*
I unironically think they should build a statue of him in the Valley Mall. He's iconic.
I think I‚Äôll call one in tomorrow and order in some succulent Chinese and practice my judo! 

The man. The legend. 

Gentleman, this is indeed, democracy manifest! RIP Sir. You may be gone, but your quotes on these subs will never end.
How daaaaare you.
I mean, its surely stiff by now, but the sentiment is touching
Putoutyourpenises doesn‚Äôt have the same ring to it
As you wish
Same
It will be better as your carrying on his legacy

Many succulent Chinese meals to you sir
Make sure police do not have their hands on your p@nis!
Ironically enough 8 is a very auspicious number in China. 

I see Karlson knows his Chinese culture well.
And all the numbers in 2024 add up to 8.

Coincidence? I think not!
Australia Day date debate now solved
May your penis stay limp and your Chinese meals be succulent¬†

Tata¬†
Is that a "limp penis" reference?
Are you prepared to receive my flag at half mast?
I wish this comment was right at the top, everyone who's enjoyed the meme should listen to this. Amazing story and handled beautifully by the podcast.
Peter takes offense, is about to send him to hell...

heard inside the pearly gates: "Get your hand off my penis!!!"
*bittersweet & sour
Leave some flowers by the door
I offer my limp penis in tribute to your tribute.
https://www.aph.gov.au/parliamentary_business/petitions
Ta ta, and farewell!¬†
that's amazing, can't believe i'd never seen it before
I‚Äôve been laughing at that video for over 15 years now. A true legend. May his limp penis be received by his afterlife of choice and a succulent Chinese meal eaten by all in his honor.
I‚Äôve been cracking up about this guy since I was a kid, long, long before I knew I would even wind up in Australia. 

He was one of the perfect little slithers of the golden age of the internet: the turn of the millennia, when things were evolving rapidly and prior to the explosion and commercialisation and centralisation of internet resources. 

I moved here about ten years ago, and was so happy to see how embraced he was by actual Australians. 

RIP to a Legend and a figure from better, simpler, happier times.   

Ta ta and farewell, sir; good one.  üëãü•≤
I am not Australian but this video and the no agents/Asians video always brought a smile to my face whenever I would be having a bad day
What happened was he was doing low level credit card fraud. The fraud investigator was able to track him down and called the police and claimed it was a major most wanted person so they would put effort in. So the police went down, with the news called.

The police did arrest him, though it was discovered that he wasn't the big criminal they were told he was, he was still a criminal.
It was a combination of "camera crew filming something else, just happened to be there" and "tv news is a visual medium so anything with footage gets priority."

It was reported as a dine-and-dash but the reality was he was wanted on multiple outstanding warrants. There's a blog somewhere by one of the arresting officers

Edit: found the article, you have to register to read it

The gist is he was wanted on 19 counts of fraud and receiving stolen goods, totalling $70,000 (a fair chunk of money in 1991), spent the night in the watchouse, was released by mistake the following morning before his court appearance, and then disappeared for a couple of decades until he became a meme
EATING A MEAL?!
I do wonder what this means for the documentary they were spruking at the time. 

I dunno, Jack looked very weary and out of it compared to his interviews a few years back (2022?). He'd been battling prostate cancer since a diagnosis earlier this year, and I think you could see its toll on him. 

A good reminder for all the blokes out there to talk to your GP, and get a finger up your bum... For Jack.
But did he receive his flaccid penis?
His penis is in gods hands now
Eating a succulent Chinese meal.
Having advances stage prostate cancer and the sentence is life support off unfortunatly. 

RIP to an Aussie legend.
I see you know your url well
Please receive my limp comment
Surely you mean tragedy manifest
And receive a limp penis too?
I‚Äôm honestly for that, considering the fact that 8/8 (which puts together as 88) symbolizes fortune and good luck in Chinese culture, as the Chinese word for 8 (ÂÖ´) is phonetically similar to the word Âèë, or prosperity.

If eating a succulent Chinese meal during that blessed day means potential prosperity, then why the hell not?
Honestly, we should make it a yearly holiday. Great way to remember, great for our local Chinese restaurant(s)!
in case you were unaware he wasn't a dine and dasher. The police got the arrest wrong
Why would there be dine and dashes? He wasn't a dine and dasher.
#putyourlimppenisesout
They aren‚Äôt firm enough‚Ä¶
Only if it's limp.
Heaven deserves more Chinese meals
I see you know your last rites well
Casket is a Chinese takeaway box
Ahhh yes, I see that you know your partner *well*.
Let's get this going
It was one of the main headlines on channel 7 at 9am, that‚Äôs how I found out. So I assume it‚Äôll be national news tonight
Black armbands are being handed out to our Olympic athletes.
 *I see you know your judo well* should be engraved on the Judo medals at the 2032 Olympics.
Bless you.  A worldwide mourning holiday?
And it's been done.

Dicks out for Harambe
Limp penises
You can say ‚Äúpenis‚Äù
Leave some succulents by the door
From my understanding he was completely innocent and the police mistook him for the guy with outstanding warrants. I could be wrong though.
A SUCCULENT CHINESE MEAL?!
No, but he knew his Judo well.
How dare you sir.. it was a succulent meal!
I see you know your judo well
A succulent judo meal
I‚Äôm just here to apparently watch a training video on Judo.
Nah chicken‚Äôs feet please
Man was born in 42, died in 24.  It's gotta be a sign.
 we need to take this all the way to our member of parliament! 

ALBO! ALBO!
Actually they didn't. There was a charge: For eating a meal. A succulent Chinese meal.

But who will receive them?
Heaven just got another limp dick succulent angel. üòá üôè¬†
He has told me once or twice to "get your hands off my penis!" (in jest, I promise).
they interviewed him on the radio a few weeks ago. He was a genuinely interesting, charming and funny fellow 

RIP legend
It should definitely be on 7 because Chris Reason was a rookie reporter that reported it back in the early 90s I think
Imagine foreign news services trying to explain that!
Black cock rings
But disappointed Tom Craig wasn't carrying on like that during his arrest...
Yeah, instead of putting it on all the diving medals ü•á. It‚Äôs democracy manifest for limp shrimp.ü¶ê
The English speaking parts anyways. Unless the video has been translated but even then it would lose a lot of its brilliance.
Nah, the "innocence" thing was just later spin, they had the right man. It's just in the context of broader crimes he wasn't worth pursuing further - he kept his head down and the police had more on their plate.
Nah he had outstanding warrants. 

He was a career crook.
THIS IS DEMOCRACY MANIFEST
There's the man who touched me on the penis
to add to this theory, Jack was featured in a music video by aussie punk band The Chats. the song is fittingly called [Dine And Dash](https://youtu.be/I3jAJHRW_Yo?si=TqWqA6WaUOe3rjwB)
Do it for long enough and a cop will arrive to man handle you.
Spare yourself the book then - a tedious read....
One bloke just has to go by and scream GET YO HANDS OFFFF MYY PEEENISSSS...
I'd love to hear that video dubbed into different languages
ne touche pas mon p√©nis
While this is cool, the chats are the group who discovered his identity and made it public. The fact they made a song title after what he was accused of and arrested for‚Ä¶ just makes sense, without the conspiracy.
As long as they know their judo well
