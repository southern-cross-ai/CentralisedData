$106,025-$117,363 will be the annual salary. About 4k a fortnight before tax.
it will be pro-rata based on time
Its a temporary role not a part time role.  
  
Its going to be pro-rata till june 2026.

If you havnt worked in as a 7/8 role before you will be starting off from the $106,025

pretty sure its going to be 35 hours.

OP ill message you if you have any other questions.
Yep both other comments are right. That's the yearly rate based on say 40hrs a week. If your contract is 30hrs a week you would get 75% of that rate
They will start off at 106,025 if they havnt worked as a 7/8 before.
