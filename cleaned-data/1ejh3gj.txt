I'm dying here.
Firstly f*ck the banks and duopoly.

But must admit I laugh everyone time abc posts a story of a rich boomer getting scammed out of millions every other day.

Lol no wonder Australia is ground zero for scams, we have a generation hoarding all the wealth that mistook luck, being born at the right time, and excessive government handouts for hardwork and intelligence... and they're still giving money to a Nigerian Prince 20 years after the scam started. ü§£
The older generation hold all the cash and assets in Australia at the moment. The older generation are aging rapidly, and developing cognitive impairments, and are unable to recognise a clear scam. 
They are behind with technology, and trust anyone who calls them on a telephone. 

They are ripe for the picking and the scammers absolutely know this.
If someone was able to get access to an account and transfer funds that‚Äôs one thing, to willingly send money to a stranger is another.

That‚Äôs on you.  

PS I hate banks too
> ‚ÄúIf Australia is serious about protecting people from scammers, we need every part of the scams chain to play their part. That includes banks, government, telcos and social media platforms.‚Äù

*Every* part of the scams chain? There seems to be a very important group of people missing from this list: the people who hand over their money to people they don't know, on the basis of fictional stories they've never verified. How about we get *them* to play their part in protecting themselves from scams?

I hate this assumption that people aren't supposed to be held responsible for their own stupid mistakes, and that it's other people's responsibility to clean up after them. By pushing the responsibility on to banks, all that's effectively happening is that *all* customers of a bank will be expected to contribute to a customer who hands their money over to a scammer - because that reimbursement money sure ain't comin' out of the shareholders' pockets!
For a generation that preaches 'personal responsibility' and 'live within your means', it's deeply ironic that they take no accountability for their own actions when they get scammed. These are the same people that will attack the government for negative gearing reform and tax reform. That will oppose social housing, homeless shelters and charity operations where they live. That will sing the tune of the 'lucky country' to explain their generational wealth. And will climb the ladder for success, only to push it out after they attain any form of wealth.

None of these people ever cared about banking reform. It's why we never got a banking royal commission. When stupid young people get scammed, they lose a few hundred, maybe a few thousand, and feel too embarrassed to talk about it. But when stupid old people get scammed, they lose tens or hundreds of thousands (even millions), and immediately beg for the bank and government to bail them out...

None of this will solve the problem of people being scammed. In fact the banks just make more hurdles to 99% prove without a doubt that YOU are an idiot if you still get scammed.
I don't see that there is a whole lot banks can actually do to stop this type of fraud without hindering commerce.¬†Maybe put in a check box before you transfer funds to say you have verified this transaction is not fraudulent and by proceeding you agree the bank is not liable for any losses that arise from making the transfer?
That's on them for not thinking before handing over there money.  This is not on the Banks or government.  How about people stop , wait and call to find out before thinking they owe anything.
I think Anna has the best interests of consumers in mind here. Like when her government sold off the retailing of our electricity and how we enjoy cheaper electricity to this day.
IIRC there were circumstances where accounts were reported to banks as being involved in scams that were then allowed to keep operating and scam more people. In circumstances like that I'd absolutely support banks being required to compensate.
My mum got scammed out of 20k, her falling for it is part of how we discovered the brain cancer that killed her. Old and sick people are very vulnerable to this shit and idk how we can fix it.
Pictured is former Queensland Labor premier (prvitisation queen and diehard neoliberal) Anna Bligh, now CEO of the [Australian Banking Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Banking_Association)
Banks should offer much better two factor authentication for starters. I‚Äôve got a yubikey but can‚Äôt use that for my banking accounts as far as I can tell.

And they should tighten up transfers so that account names must match by default (with some kind of opt out).
It‚Äôs a simple solution. If the bank‚Äôs lack of oversight & checks facilitate the loss, the bank should cover the loss. If the account owner ignored and bypasses all of that appropriate oversight and checks, they should be responsible.

Sounds to me like there‚Äôs a major opportunity for insurance companies here
If cunts stop transferring money to random bank accounts because someone on the phone told them to then we'd be sweet.
I don't think people have thought through the game theory of what is going on. It is simply not possible to not trust your customer yet at the same time have the customer in charge of there money.

Anyway... Other counteries have done this, and it all ends up the same: Transactions become limited (to $1,000 a day or $5,000 a week) and anything over that you have to go in person with ID to a branch.
Aaahhh Anna Blight on the state that's still giving.  While shs was health minister she refused to deal with jayant 'dr death' patel, centralised pretty much everything and gutted services.  QHealth fell several steps that it hasn't ever recovered. A few years after she lost government  she was diagnosed with some kind of lymphoma and pissed off to NSW for treatment.
I don't have much sympathy for people who lose money from crypto promises or not doing their own due diligence and checks then blaming everyone but themselves when money is lost.

But I am also sick of all the scam calls and call centres that try to fleece us out of our money constantly. 

With the majority of these scam call centres originating in India. And the government is cozying up to them, I think the pressure needs to be put on the government to use their relationship to finally get the indian government to shut down the scam centres and not continue to allow them because of the obvious kick backs and corruption that happens there to allow them to continue.
Every time these stories come up, there are normally a few people who work at banks who chime in with stories and it‚Äôs always funny. Banks do have some measures in place to detect possible fraudulent actions and suspicious transactions, but many times when they do try to intervene they get accused of ‚Äústopping people from accessing their money‚Äù by the same people who will later complain the banks should have done more.

I hate scammers as well, and I know being slightly younger does give me more tools to avoid them, but some of the people who get scammed run head first though so many red flags that it‚Äôs not even funny anymore. Which is the point, scammers want people to commit fully without any chance of backing out.

The main thing I think banks need to do is fix how they contact people, stop sales cold calls and the bullshit where they call you and ask for *you* to provide your personal information to identify yourself. That just sets people up to have their identity stolen by the next scammer who calls them. Either some system where they contact you via registered post or email and ask you to call (while emphasizing to use the website etc) or something within their secure app. Or even identify themselves somehow with some kind of paraphrase you set on your account, or some recent transactions or something that they and you know, but doesn‚Äôt provide any identifiable information.

Just so something to change what people consider the norm, so that cold calls/text messages claiming to be someone are out of the ordinary and trigger some kind of skepticism instead of trust.
Fuck these people that loose 800k to a scam. The only way you're getting scammed with that amount is through greed.¬†


How else would you be so flippent with so much money?¬†


do their eyes light up with $ when someone tells them they can make more money
?¬†How do you not protect a lifes worth of money more diligently?


This entire situation belies a whole generation of selfish hoarders who think their luck and fortune is a given right.
I really want some banking executive cretin to clap back at these politicians in senate estimates. "Well how should we further protect our customers when we already explicitly warn them when they want to send large amounts overseas to people they have never met?"

This whole thing remind me of the 'ban teens from social Media' thing. Like, how? And why now when 3 generations have already grown up with these problems? Haha!

I also don't see a distinction between scams like romance scams and like, people having their myGov/ATO accounts hacked and their tax returns/super stolen. 

Maybe in another 3 generations the powers that be will identify that distinction
I think cracking down on telecos and phone spoofing would do more. Maybe put in an option to block foreign calls and messages.
A lot of comments here that basically boomers deserve to be scammed. Guess you like seeing people robbed.

Mate of mine parents both 80 years old, Dad was a train driver his whole life. Sold the family home and were waiting to go into aged living. Had a total of $183k in the bank and his Mum got scammed. 

She doesn‚Äôt know how but two scam apps ended up on her phone and from Friday night to Sunday afternoon the scammers transferred all their money to an account in Sydney. From there it got transferred to they don‚Äôt know where. She rang Suncorp Saturday morning as she thought something was odd and the person checked and said all was ok. And despite that call, they scammers spent the rest of the weekend transferring out amounts. Their whole life savings gone. 

Mate had to step in and help them as Suncorp said tough shit. Your phone is your responsibility and wiped them. They engaged a guy who deals with banks and he said Suncorp is the worst, shit security and don‚Äôt care. They went through conciliation with the bank and ended up getting $90k back. It‚Äôs destroyed them.
I think I mentioned this in another thread about this kind of thing. One thing I think banks could do to guard against scams is either require you to enter the account name to do a transfer and either alert you if the account name is vastly different or even have something in place to block the transfer or require further action to confirm. Have this kind of thing on by default unless specifically turned off by the user with them signing something stating they accept the risks. Maybe have this for transfers over a certain amount.

As a second part on this, allow certain names and words be protected, so that only the registered company can use them in account names. Perhaps tied to business registrations. Probably won‚Äôt stop everything, but it might stop someone from transferring large sums to someone pretending to a company when the account name is vastly different.
Regardless of who you think is to blame putting responsibility on the banks is the best choice. The greedy cunts will quickly come up with a way to deal with scamming since it'll affect their share price if they don't.
Neither major party has tried to court people under the age of 45. Ever. And now the older and younger demographic groups/voting blocks are finally almost proportional, I question what's easier for them to win in an election. Engage with the half they've been ignoring? Or go all in on the generation they already cater to. 

Fuck me dead.
I used to work in a bank, and this sort of crap always made me mad. 
I had one guy come in one week to cash a cheque and got mad that he had to hand over some ID, saying "It's my money, you should let me look after it!"
Next week he came in upset that he'd been charged penalty interest after overdrawing his account, because the bank shouldn't have let him overdraw.
> A TSB spokesperson tells Guardian Australia it has maintained a refund rate of 97% since launching its guarantee in 2019.

>‚ÄúAs a result of refunding innocent victims, we have also benefited from more informed conversations with customers to better understand how the scam took place and the tactics and platforms involved.‚Äù

>TSB says the honey-pot warnings had not come to pass.
Yep, the government is on the big banks' side. They don't want to act because it may affect bank profits.

People, repeat after me, "The government is just a service provider you cannot fire. They are not here to help you."
Why can't these people be accountable for their own actions? It's not anyone else's fault they're dumb enough to fall for these scams.
Any Gen Z want to start a scam against boomers with me?
It's even funnier because the generation getting scammed and asking for a handout is also filled with people who go on and on about personal responsibility and accountability.
I think the scams on boomers work so well because they really think they deserve even more money for nothing
And a lot of stupid blokes sending money to organised criminal bar girls. Despite all the information on the internet that criminal gangs are operating these loves scams you still get the stupid sending money to people they have not met. "my mom and baby are sick, send money" Amazing how many guys send their money and life savings  to buy a house for someone they have not met personally!

Even the adult web pages have blanket banned citizens from a handful of countries appearing on cam sites because they all know that criminals are operating from brothels trying to suck stupid guys in. 

Then again you have guys stupidly tipping naked girls throwing thousands at them for perving at their bodies. There is no limit to human stupidity. These girls are making millions  from stupid guys trying to be tipping hero's! 

Sometimes the stupid have to own their stupidity.
You have to try sooooo hard to get past all the checks and warnings and MFA in modern banking let alone the training that front line staff get, and still these smug eedjits manage to give their money away to the most obvious scams. 

The Optus/Westpac thing is the start of some improvements but people‚Äôs ability to believe bullshit will always get them in trouble.
We are the laughing stock of the world. On 4corners they showed that there's a running joke among scammers of the world that Australia is 'Treasure Island' and they aren't wrong.¬†
More like 50 years with the Nigerian Prince scam, boomers were getting tricked in their 20s by it.

They've had half a century to get good at spotting scams and simply haven't. 

It's just sad at this point.
Easy come, easy go.
It‚Äôs not just boomers. 

We have a bad corporate culture (mostly gen x) that got into the habit of paying off hackers - leading to the Optus and Medibank hacks.
The reason that this boomer hate is counter productive is that boomers aren't really the ones with the highest victimisation rates in Australia. 

Here's the ABS data. https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/crime-and-justice/personal-fraud/latest-release

If everyone thinks it's boomers mainly getting stung, and have a laugh, they let their guard down. 

From the ABS data, boomers have lower victimisation rates than people from 25-65 for credit cards. That means boomers are doing better than all the others.

For scam victimisation, boomers do better than anyone from 35-65. 

Now, I don't particularly care about boomers, or people wanting to criticise, but the ABC and Guardian in this case, are just creating harmful stereotypes here...and ones likely to help boomers, rather than the generations actually getting scammed more.

I can see policy responses here directed to helping these outlier boomer victims, while it's really younger people who are victimised more...as a result of misrepresentation by the ABC and Guardian. 

Boomer hate and contempt is literally helping boomers, while younger generations are bigger victims.  But it's those younger generations effectively helping the boomers in this case.

It's not only Australia where this is the case. In Singapore,  a very tech savvy country, it's again,  not boomers, but people in their thirties losing the most.
It's just so tiresome repeatedly reading this entitled garbage on Reddit.
Yeah, really time they were looked after by our government. Maybe by putting them on the basics card so their money can't be wasted on unnecessary, wasteful or scammy things. As the boomer vote's supported the previous Australian government to impose this upon poor people who "Couldn't look after their own money responsibly" this would obviously work fantastically for them too.
People seriously underestimate just how seemingly unnoticeable but steady cognitive decline is. The brain really starts losing its steam beginning in the early twenties (alcohol/drugs compounds this).The ability to learn new things and critically think fades away. Eventually it‚Äôs just the wisdom people have accumulated that gets them by. Problem is for boomers is that the world has changed far too fast and they can‚Äôt handle it. It will happen to the rest of us unfortunately.
> It's why we never got a banking royal commission.

There was a banking royal commission....
>It's why we [never got a banking royal commission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Commission_into_Misconduct_in_the_Banking,_Superannuation_and_Financial_Services_Industry).

There was a banking royal commission between 2017 and 2019 about the lack of regulatory intervention by the relevant government authorities, and later revelations that financial institutions were involved in¬†money laundering¬†for drug syndicates, turned a blind eye to terrorism financing, and ignored statutory reporting responsibilities and impropriety in foreign exchange trading.

But you're right, there was never a banking royal commission on whether banks aren't doing enough to prevent scams.
Leaded petrol is a hell of a drug.
They have done this. There is a page you sign if you do it physically in the bank to say that you have verified it, and that it‚Äôs your fault if it‚Äôs wrong
Even moving the locus of the discussion to the practical implications... ***what exactly do they think the banks can or should do about how most of these scams happen?!***
needs /s, surely?
Maybe in the city where consumers get to have that choice.  In regional Queensland people are still stuck with paying for ergon.
Yeah, this is even more concerning. The cabinet jobs are becoming window dressing for cushy corporate jobs after politics.

I think I prefer out of touch lifelong politicians then. At least they work for you.
And look where the whistleblowers are! 

The whole Labor government  and all governments are just looking like one big con job on the people with their "workers party battler nonsense" While they continue to screw voters with privatisation and corporate plutocracy games that screws people. 

We cant even   aspire to the basics of European governance laws that still makes some attempts to act in the interests of the public by balancing laws and corporate greed. In Australia its corporate greed  all the  way and nothing else matters.
Bank of America has supported yubikey for years now. Some Australian banks still permit 6 character passwords, we are way behind.
I think you underestimate how truly lazy, incompetent and corrupt the Indian police are. And indeed a lot of the Indian Civil Service.
Sorry for their loss but I gotta tell you, your friend's mum sounds like she should not be using a smart phone if she is going to start installing apps just because someone phones her up and tells her to. And I have to wonder whether she actually called Suncorp on Saturday or if she phoned the scammers.
The thing that shits me is that if it went to another account the bank hasn‚Äôt done due diligence in identifying who that account belongs too. 

We got scammed too and it went to a commonwealth account in Sunnybank Brisbane. The fucking bank should know exactly who owns that account and they should be easily apprehended. If they aren‚Äôt then in my opinion the bank has facilitated fraud.
That is heartbreaking.

As soon as I see someone post with ‚Äòboomers‚Äô on this topic I downvote and move on, because I know it‚Äôs going to be some lightweight drivel not worth my time.
This is how I feel. Passing scammed moneys between banks via laundering accounts wil rapidly come to a stop.
What will happen is banks are going to have to second guess every payment we make. The compromise we will have to live with is we'll lose the speed and convenience we currently enjoy. Any time you make a payment that seems the slightest bit odd the bank will block it. You and I will spend hours on hold to call centres trying to get payments released. Is it worth it?
How will money leaving the banks account be a boon for the bank?

Surely they'd want that money to stay in their bank.
Hell yea let's sell off all public assets to big corp that'll change things for the better
There is  almost not 1 demonstrable case where  any government has acted in the interests of consumers. However they are quick to pass laws  on how we should run our lives according to their ideology and nanny state laws. Royal commissioners have just become a fee collecting circus with no recommendations or advice followed. They are purely window dressing exercises. We have no governance in Australia that protects voters against corporations, the corporations write the laws as they see fit.
Sad but true.
You gotta know in IT circles, whenever anybody does a fake phishing test to keep their work security tight, it's usually the expensive ones who fall for it every time.
Lol 100% accurate.
I mean that generation went without avocado toast and balsamic glaze EVERY Sunday
The biggest age groups being scammed are not boomers according to the ABS. 

It's younger folks.

A few high profile boomer cases, and the media make a song and dance for clicks from boomer haters. While younger people are the main victims. 


https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/people/crime-and-justice/personal-fraud/latest-release
The people that ask handouts is because they're lazy, its completely different in their case
I don't particularly like a lot of the rhetoric around boomers and I have respect for the older generations. I feel that it's counterproductive.


In say that though. You're probably right. In their day there really was such a thing as a free meal.


I've grown up suspecting anything even slightly favourable has a nasty hook involved somewhere.
That actually makes total sense.

I'm tech savvy and it sure wasn't easy to let the relevant areas know what I as going on.
Encourage you to look at the work Quantium is doing here as well. It's doing far more with scam data to trigger answers than the Optus solution
God, intergenerational resentment gotta peak when your parents who peddle that bootstraps nonsense give your inheritance away to a scammer, then ask for you to pay for their retirement either personally or through increased taxes. 

Yeesh
Yeah picking up the baton. Interesting Australian millennials are swinging left with age not right like previous generations.
There's a lot of stats here but they're not linked up by age-to-type.

Being stung for 50 bucks on a replica iphone from a shifty asian seller is not the same as sending 6 figures to a Nigerian prince/Laotian "girlfriend".
There is a discussion higher in this comments section that debunks this
60-69  are still boomers..
This is not empirical, though. yes the brain matures but it's not just due to uncontrollable factors that the brain gets into a routine, a habit, a way of thinking, a pattern, and stays there for the rest of our lives. As children and adolescents we are exposed to so many more activities than most people bother to organise for themselves once becoming adults. If you do the same thing for 15 years you're probably just comfortable and risk adverse. Somehow even the slacker everyman is useful in an apocalypse movie. 

The world hasn't changed too fast. In my line of work I've seen my colleagues try to teach boomers very simple computer functions tens of times... I've done it myself, not to mention those same boomers have children who have tried. It is an attitude of closedmindedness, fear, resentment and disinterest. No one's physical brain stops them from getting up off the couch, or learning a new hobby. Opening an email attachment is not like climbing Everest so don't pretend that it is
> The brain really starts losing its steam beginning in the early twenties

This is objectively false, like straight up nonsense.

> Problem is for boomers is that the world has changed far too fast and they can‚Äôt handle it.

When my Gran was still alive she was able to not only keep up with tech, but was ahead of the average person, she was still manually building PC's and devouring new tech/software without any issue whatsoever. The world didn't change too fast, boomers just refuse to learn and make it everyone else's problem, like literally just look at lifelong academics who are still publishing groundbreaking works well into their 80's, we never stop being able to learn, absorb information and create new knowledge, it's just that a certain sect has adopted the mindset that ignorance and being stubborn is something to be praised.
Maybe they meant that there was no popular support for the reform recommended by the RC.


Which is definitely true.
I think they should close or freeze accounts that are reported to be used for scams and also show the account name when someone enters a BSB and account number to pay to.

Other than that I don't think it's their responsibility to ensure people have done their due diligence before handing over money, especially since most scam victims in the media lately have been investment scams. People really need to check everything before handing over money expecting to profit from it.
I am not a Labor fanboy (being an anarchist and all), and they are not perfect, however on any metric you care to measure (socially, economically, environmentally etc) they are objectively a better government.  

Here's a fairly comprehensive list of all the shitfuckery the last coalition government got up to:  
https://www.mdavis.xyz/govlist/  

Can Labor match even 5% of this amount of blatant corruption?  

This rhetoric of 'both sides same' is absolute crap and only helps the coalition
They screw the populace marginally less badly than the LNP.

It's a choice between a double shit sandwich or a shit sandwich with cheese. One being marginally more palatable than the other is enough to win when they go head to head.
Yea hence why these call centre get away with it all. If the PM wants to be best friends with  Modi, he needs to also use the relationship to protect Australians
Also even if they were scam apps, unless she's keeping passwords in plain text on her phone, or she had no 2FA, or the apps were somehow able to grant full access to the device(something she'd get a million warnings for before installing), then how on earth do "two random apps" not only magically appear, but suddenly start siphoning off money from a bank account.

And when she called them, why on earth would you just accept "nah it's fine" when you can literally see your money going, like you said she likely just phoned the scammers, but why would you just accept some random person on the phone telling you it's all gucci that your money is disappearing at an alarming rate?

Like they don't deserve to be scammed, nobody does and the fakes saying as much in this thread are a bit dorky, but OP there is leaving out some pretty enormous parts of the story to try and paint his mum as someone who did literally nothing wrong and just magically got scammed and that it's the banks fault somehow.
People forget that ‚Äúboomers‚Äù are their parents or grandparents.  I hate it.
Sure but we all know that the banks are more important than individuals, so after they tell Labor to FK off with this policy, they will pass it on to taxpayers.
Yeah that's true if we assume innovation is over.

Maybe it could be more intuitive though?
Sure, they want customers' money, but they don't want any responsibility. And they definitely will not use any of their own money to pay back customers. And they also don't want to use their own money to improve security.
> We have no governance in Australia that protects voters against corporations

What about our consumer guarantees which are world leading?
Banking in Australia is one of the most highly regulated industries we have. There are 3 different regulators. ASIC, APRA and AUSTRAC. All are there to protect consumers. You are talking garbage.
I think you're getting down voted because of the phrasing you've used, but I think your vibes are on the right track. Royal commissioners work quite hard and are qualified. Their recommendations are often good! But they do not have authority to implement them. That's up to the government of the day. So it's politicians who are to blame, really. Katherine Holmes (the royal commissioner for robodebt) delayed handing down her report in order for it to be able to be referred to the NACC. 

12 months later the NACC found that they could not act on that referral - not because they're evil mind you, because they were given a scope for what they could do, and they also can't actually implement anything. 

The problem is accountability in government departments and with politicians themselves. Vote independent, and put whoever is already elected below the opposing party (out of the two majors). They hate that shit.
Truly the darkest timeline
Uphill both ways!¬†
Wait, am I misinterpreting or overlooking something? It feels like the graphs are showing younger people *aren't* the ones being most scammed? 

I found an overall graph in the Australian Government scam report below. When you look at "Figure 5", older demographics are making more reports (blue circle), and they're being scammed the most amount of money (orange bar). 

https://www.accc.gov.au/system/files/targeting-scams-report-activity-2023.pdf
Yeah, I'd hazard most of it would be people getting scammed by "crypto investments"
Your link says 34 and under are below the average scam rate (2.5%) for 2023 while 35 and over are getting scammed more with it decreasing by age. 

It also doesn't specify how much they were scammed out of. Boomers being older are more likely to have more money so can get scammed for more. While young or middle aged people are likely to have less money so while they may get scammed more the overall loss is lower. 

Getting scammed out of $50-$1000 by clicking the wrong link is very different to getting scammed of $800 000. You have to be a special kind of stupid to fall for any scam, let alone a scam that will take all of your life savings. 

It's only going to get worse as scammers start using AI generated video and audio.
Mate it's not rhetoric, my old man is a stubborn boomer cunt too, computer illiterate I had to hold his hand and spoonfeed him on how to use a pc. Still didn't stop him from eventually 'knowing best' and then inevitably getting scammed.¬†


Tried to crawl back for help, told him that he already knew best, now he pays some pc repair shop. Some people refuse to learn.¬†
That's an impresssive level of naivety.
How was it hacked?
did you not have 2FA on your PayPal account?
Funnily enough I was involved the initial partnership of Quantium and CBA. It was something that Matt Comyn referenced when speaking at Parliament on the need for an ecosystem approach in 2022.
You need something to conserve to become a conservative.
Only if you disbelieve the ABS, which literally gives the figures age by age.

Further, this is replicated in the US as well. 

https://bbbmarketplacetrust.org/riskreport/

I suggest that people refusing to listen to facts are exactly like those people who are scammed refusing to take advice from the banks when it looks like they're being scammed.
Sure are. But the ABS data for under 65s is listed, and clear.
Yep, my mother has picked up technology and such well and knows how to navigate this stuff well.... my uncle on the other hand know's jack shit about technology and refuses to learn the basics and just wastes money by getting a technician (or me, edit: doesn't pay me though to be clear) to help him, my other uncle played bridge and civilisation 4 perfectly fine online.

this is just him being stuck in his ways, not cognitive decline.
>show the account name when someone enters a BSB and account number

Er... no, that's a massive privacy violation. The correct way to do it is that you, the person making the transfer, input the payee name, BSB and account and the online banking web page tells you if there's a mismatch between the name and account details. Which has been a standard thing in the UK for years but somehow is taking a very long time to implement in Aus (they announced about a year ago that it would be brought in over the next 18-24 months, I forget the exact details).
I think you can simultaneously hold the view that Labor are massively better than LNP, and also that both major options are crap. One is less crap than the other, but that doesn't mean we stop demanding that our parties aren't crap. No matter who holds the job, no matter how good they are, we should never stop pressuring them to try to get even better - and all parties currently have a lot of room for improvement.
Which should slowly improve things, except for how a lot of Australian voters will continue to vote for the doubleshits because they get off on the possibility of others eating shit, no matter how much shit they must wade through themselves.
Also that they‚Äôll get old too. The whole thing started off as wedge politics and these idiots swallow it wholesale.

If we put the liability on the banks, this is what they will do to protect their assets. They're not just going to carry on the way things are if the losses are coming out of their pocket. This is what happens. We all say 'oh, this should happen' without accepting there are going to be negative consequences. 

Banks are building tech to better detect fraud, but the fraud keeps getting more sophisticated as well. So it's like an arms race. Currently larger banks detect or recover around 75% of frauds, but tech spend is expensive and smaller institutions struggle.
Okay, apart from the ACCC, ASIC, FWO, OAIC, APRA, and the AHRC.

[What has Australia's governance ever done for us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qc7HmhrgTuQ)?
Explain to me how AUSTRAC, ATO and ABF/customs want to jump up and down if I want to move $10,001 of cash, but they can't catch criminals moving millions?
The ABS reports are adjusted to show percentages rather than raw numbers as in the ACCC report.

When that's done, the younger cohorts are generally worse for all types of scams.
Sure, the high profile cases are ones where large amounts of money are concerned. 

But if someone is younger, and has very little money, losing a hundred dollars and being on centrelink and renting might be worse than someone losing $100k while on the old age pension who lives in their own home. Losing that $100k actually increases the pension by about $7800/year.

I know who I'd rather be financially.

One of the problems is that people think it will never happen to them. They think it's granny who isn't tech savvy that's most likely going to be a victim, whereas,  by being complacent, they themselves are open to scams.
Eh.. Starving Nigerians or South Americans smart enough to con some old coot to feed themselves? Go for it. Starvation is a powerful motivator.


Organised crime scam rings already dripping in wealth doing it cos they can? Fuck them.¬†
I assume my password was compromised with my email (PayPal log in) elsewhere. 

The bank when I spoke to someone suggested raising a dispute with visa but it's takes 45 days and offered to cancel the card.

I activated my PayPal again to talk to them who said they'd investigate and refund me. They advised my card details are encrypted so no need to cancel. 

That day I got an email the case was raised, rejected, escalated and then approved. I got the money (a few hundred dollars) back I think two days later.
I didn't at the time but do now.
At least your stubborn uncle paid you üò≠
Or use payto which will show the registered Alias. Something that has been in Australia for something like 5 years or so. 

Or the dest bank could verify the transfer details using the meta data on the transfer line.. something that used to do but largely stopped doing in the last decade.
Of course, I do not disagree.  

However, my point was that you cannot compare Labor to Liberal (one party was set up by the elite and is funded by corporations for fucks sake), and this line of 'they're both bad - vote doesn't matter' is actively harming our country.
It doesn't, though. The ALP keeps getting dragged further and further right to the point that they are basically a neoliberal centre-right party at the moment even though the LNP is shrieking about how they are woke commie leftists.

Which is only true by comparison.

But unless the ALP follows them and is left only marginally and by comparison to the LNP, they get crucified in the mainstream press and nobody will vote for them. And strangely all of the mainstream is owned by right-wingers. Even the ABC has had two consecutive Murdoch picks and has lurched considerably to the right of late.
Aquaducts.
Moving over 10k in cash is definitely a fraud and/or money laundering red flag.
This is like how older people had 17% interest rates (17% of SFA lol)
Being scammed when you're young is a learning experience. When you're older it's a sign that you either didn't learn anything or you forgot it.
They're all organised crime rings bud.
Did you have a shared password or was it a unique password snooped in another way? Having a single password across sites is very common but makes you massively vulnerable especially when you consider how many sites have had data breaches that mean shared passwords are pretty much open slather.

https://haveibeenpwned.com/ is your friend here
haha yeah totally! (he just pays the technicians, once he offered $10 bucks but when I got there he just gave me a shitty watch :\^). I mean I don't do it with the expectation of getting paid but if you say you're going to give me $10 bucks you better give me $10 bucks.)
> The ALP keeps getting dragged further and further right

It's not really getting dragged when they go willingly because they've been a neolib party for decades, but it's also the perfect example of the Ratchet Effect and the natural end result of capitalistic societies.
Sure. Moving millions is also a red flag, so how are they not caught?
It's literally ABS data.

Over several years. 

Not only that, it's replicated in similar reports from Singapore...and the US.

But you believe whatever you want.
This was at a time when they were being paid SFA too, so quit the winge.
Well, you might say that perhaps up to age thirty, but when the susceptibility to scams extends to people from their thirties through to their sixties, it's a fairly long bow to draw.
I'll give you that its hard to discern, especially when you add Russian hackers scamming bitcoin for the state. Also Ruzzia and Wagner operate in Africa so who knows what's possible. And anyway, who really knows who's who on the internet in the end.¬†
Get ready for the stubborn type to belittle and yell and undervalue you and most people you know of your age for the next two to three decades.

Don't worry tho because they can't help it and respect your elders and worked hard all their life discourse will be there the entire time.

That's my point: young people getting scammed is understandable, whereas I have to wonder how older people manage to be so unaware of the dangers out there in the world. Back in my 20s I did get scammed out of $20 by a woman with a sob story about how she had lost her handbag with her phone and purse bla bla.... I fell for buying stuff on a website that was too cheap to be true. But since turning 30 a few years ago I have been a lot more streetwise and switched on to the warning signs. It's really sad that there are people who apparently haven't learned anything over their many years at the university of life.
Right, if everybody's money is returned eventually, why are the banks so scared of helping customers?

So, the recovered money you mentioned are probably the minority. Either the government is incompetent or they don't care. I don't like either case.
