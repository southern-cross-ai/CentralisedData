>"The bollard severed under the mooring loads, landing in the sea," Mr Donald said.

"Fortunately, no-one was harmed."

>The incident was reported to WorkSafe Tasmania, as well as other marine authorities.

>Mr Donald said the safety of people and assets was of the highest importance, and a detailed investigation by TasPorts was ongoing.

  
That's Tassie for you.

  
Here's a gem from another article.

>Last month, [Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek expressed concern](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-06-13/tanya-plibersek-threatens-to-take-antarctic-base-from-hobart/103972412) that state-owned company TasPorts estimated the upgrade would cost $515 million over 30 years.

To put that into perspective; France just rebuilt the Notre Dame Cathedral for about 1 billion dollars over the last four years.

Maybe Dutch engineers would be more efficient than TasPorts management.

It's all a big mystery.
Outsource it to the Chinese, problem solved.
We better have an election before the public hears about this ...

It's expensive because pretty much anything the government has control over has decayed badly due to continuous underfunding. This is the bill coming due...
Step 1. Lease the old one to China for 99 years

Step 2. Complain about the lack of Australian owned ports, propose a new port to be build next to the old one at 50x the cost of upgrades/repair

Step 3. ???

Step 4 Profit
