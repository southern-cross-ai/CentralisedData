Some people are doing it really tough right now who may not have stable housing, money or have a chronic illness leaving them unable to care for their pet. Stands to reason they'd try to rehome home them to someone with the resources to do right by the animal. 

This article implied that owners were fed up and just dumping them which I doubt is the majority of people and even if it was then  perhaps councils, pet organisations and retailers should be better educating people about the full responsibility that comes with owning a pet.

If you aren't sufficiently resourced to afford veterinary care, food, grooming and the correct enclosures to secure your pet to your property then you shouldn't be a pet owner. Sadly the commercialisation of animals will ensure this situation continues unabated.
Toodles to the -oodles. ðŸ¥²
Too soon?
Many of these headlines should also emphasize how big an impact the cost of living and rental crisis affects this too. While it mentions it in the article, choosing between a house you can afford and keeping your dog isnâ€™t a fair choice to be forced to make. 

Regarding Doodles, the necessary work and cost to maintain their coats is often underestimated, but theyâ€™re also just so popular that theyâ€™re bound to be turning up in rescues, especially when adoptions are down.

Is the obvious connection to "designer drugs" deliberate?

It sounds terrible.
I don't think so. Designer breeds are *so* common around where we live that they're just another type of dog. Groodles may be the most common breed here on the insular peninsula. And that could well be because they are lovely dogs.
Couldn't they have come up with a name which doesn't bring white-powdered upper lips to mind?
I don't think you live on the insular peninsula.

That's the Northern Beaches, which can be cut off from the rest of us by closing a single bridge.
