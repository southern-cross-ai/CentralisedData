Hello! Looking for apps and/or websites that allow searching for roommates. What are some good resources for this? Thanks in advance!
Gumtree and flatmates
[flatmates.com.au](http://flatmates.com.au)

[flatmatefinders.com.au](http://flatmatefinders.com.au)

[https://www.gumtree.com.au/s-flatshare-houseshare/melbourne/c18294l3001317](https://www.gumtree.com.au/s-flatshare-houseshare/melbourne/c18294l3001317) (for Location in the left column you can drill down to state > region > council area so it can get quite specific)
[Flatmates.com.au](http://Flatmates.com.au) and Gumtree are pretty popular for finding roommates in Australia.
