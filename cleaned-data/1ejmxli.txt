They really need a ban for gambling ads on the web.  
The amount of gambling ads I've seen on Reddit is too damn high.
The fix is in.  Fuckers. It's disgraceful even with the proposed curbs.

This is the tipping point for me, I'll preference a minor party before ALP - LNP.  I'm in Chisholm.
Piss weak from Albo

Maybe he’s too busy doing a multi with mates to care
Weak AF
Vote independent,  let the majority know why
Cowards, both LNP and ALP.   
  
Love how die-hard Labor followers are screaming "They're not Liberal Lite!" ...Then stop enacting policies you'd expect the LNP to enact, especially with both bent over the table at the Gambling industries beck and call.
I really feel for anyone who is trying to overcome a gambling addiction. If you have any interest in sport, you pretty much can't watch anything unless you want to be bombarded with ads every commercial break, plus during the games as well.
Fucking lobbyists. Shit is worse than tobacco advertising ever use to be.
Very strategic from Labor to spend 3 years practicing as a minority government for when the real thing happens in 2025.
Joke’s on them, who is watching free to air these days? I’d much prefer a ban on gambling sponsorship. Nothing is more depressing than seeing a child wearing their favourite team’s jersey and having a gambling companies logo plastered all over it.
My kingdom for a government with a spine.
Can we have weed? “No, because you already have gambling, alcohol and cigarettes, entirely harmless things you can freely use. Now, on your way”
I would also love to ban advertising on the actual sports fields like the grass area. When I do watch sports now like nrl, rugby, basketball ect they have advertising on the ground field. When I'm watching the players and they go near the advertising, it takes me out of the moment as I can't help but try and read the advertising ect.

FYI this is the graphic advertising they put on live broadcast. When they switch to another camera on the ground the advertising is not there but only on the upper cameras
Pollies know where their bread is buttered and it’s not from you and me
Bloody hell, grow a pair.
Australia has less than 0.5 %  of the world’s population but 20% of its poker machines. 

We really need to double triple down on gambling addiction by whatever means. It’s destroying our society.
As a compromise, how about we ban the use of actors in gambling ads. No more depictions of “my squad of larrikans” having a “cheeky punt”, or images of group chats where everyone is so happy to burn money on any sport. Just show your app features in a solemn voice and get the fuck off our screens.
The afl is owned by gambling, ofc it won't get banned
Gambling advertising needs to stop!!!  I'm not prepared to have my son watch sports, whist being bombarded with ads, odds, etc.  Growing up thinking this is a normal/acceptable affiliation between the two things is NOT ok!!!
The kids at mums primary  school talk out what odds their football team is paying at recess is this really what we want?
Labor just proving they are liberal lite
Clearly a lot of you didn’t read the article.
And money wins again!!
God I hope they end up in minority government next term.
Tbf at the very least Labor has said it wants a blanket ban on betting ads on social media and other digital platforms. Who knows if that will actually happen, but it would be a huge step in the right direction.
Let’s not take away the fact that the gamble responsibility adverts are there to cover their arses too. Let’s be real someone who is already addicted by gambling isn’t going to be influenced by a disclaimer.
Ever since his pet project was defeated he’s paranoid about doing bold reform so instead we’re just getting liberal lite
Lol corruption is so obvious in this country  
Prices only go higher, the vulnerable gets exploited even harder and the future outlook for the country is bleak with quality of life only degrading further for the average person.
Article is paywalled
Fuck that. No way in hell i vote alp in the future if they're this toothless
I smell stakeholder meddling
TBF, and I couldn't read the article, it seems like it's still a big step forward.  As someone who does occasionally watch FTA TV, it's not at all unusual to be spammed at every single ad break.  Sometimes, twice per break.  Limiting to two per hour definitely is going to hurt them and make life very slightly better for the rest of us.

Now if only they could get YouTube under control because it's horrendous.

Edit.  Just found a better thread over on Australian Politics.  It includes a blanket ban on social media and digital platforms.  Ah, that is actually huge.

So, yeah, weak as piss, ALP are LNP lite, etc.,  etc.
The Albanese government needs it's majority taken away at the next election.
It’s almost as if we’re all just voting for the same person with a different colour tie 🤷🏻‍♀️
[deleted]
This is pathetic. We are the biggest gamblers yet Ambo does fuck all. This really is Labor Lite!
Of course. It would mean the end of commercial tv.
Well, Albanese just attended Murdoch's soiree for the 60th anniversary of the Australian so he could hardly go and cancel Foxtel's only real source of advertising revenue. It'd be interesting to see how the Murdoch empire in Australia stacks up without gambling revenue offsetting losses everywhere else.
So when I watch foxtel catch up, all I see are sportsbet ads
:(
Yeah course they did money hungry Fucks
Absolutely spineless.
I'd rather they were banned entirely but this would at least be an improvement. I imagine they're going to leave alone all the advertising in the stadium and on the jerseys? If so that's pretty fkn poor.
Because the sheer amount of money that advertising brings in employs a lot of people and most of the other big advertisers on sporting events have already been banned. Junk food, tobacco and alcohol. 
How can sport bet365 or Sportsbet, and such make mutual public realations? Not possible because most are proud sponsors of teams NRL and AFL. So fuck all integrity.
People still watch TV?
This is my reading of it... and I don't think the gambling industry is the biggest loser if advertising is banned because at the end of the day if none of them can advertise then they equally lose that form of promotion. The media that sells the advertising is what loses big, and in turn their investment in big ticket sports such as AFL becomes so much harder to recover so then those big industry sports that employ thousands become less attractive.

The pollies would be lobbied hard from a lot of areas than just the gambling companies
Yep.  Labor knows not to fuck with the money... That leads to campaigns against them.
Got some bad news: [we already know who scratches their backs](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/i-will-not-take-money-from-sportsbet-rowland-admits-public-expects-better-20230221-p5cm45.html), [it happens all the time](https://www.afr.com/politics/federal/labor-rakes-in-5m-of-hidden-money-from-big-corporates-20240212-p5f44c) and [they aren't shy about it. ](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/dark-money-and-gambling-companies-flood-political-donations-20230210-p5cjgs.html)They're just banking on the fact no one will try to do anything about it.
Yeah, but one of those thing makes them money.

Well, I suppose illegal vape shops might make them some money as well, depending on their connections.
It genuinely is insane to put in those anti-vaping measures but do nothing against gambling ads
The worst part is now (and anyone else using it to quit) I have no option but what I think's the more damaging and expensive one.

Yay !
No. What's disgraceful is treating housing as a speculative instrument. gambling is just a less glamorous cousin of that.
Every 3-4 advertisement on Spotify that I get is usually a gambling one. Especially the unskippable thirty second ones.
You're on Reddit without an adblocker?
It should REALLY be done by default but most services actually do provide a way to limit the kind of "harmful" categories of ads you can be shown.



There are a few different ones you can turn off but gambling is always there .


You can turn them off for Google/YouTube somewhere in the settings and I recently discovered the Reddit app introduced it too.


The internet is so much better without being waterboarded with Sportsbet ads.
Social media companies will obey the law, Aus govt just needs the courage to make it. When I access Reddit from the gulf, there are no gambling ads. When my Aus VPN is on, the ads are back and overwhelming.
Use old.reddit.com and an ad-blocker, no ads. This website is a POS as it is, let alone with ads
And crypto
If you read the article they are literally blanket banning online gambling advertising.
But then we have gambling ads on Mainstream media that is not considered gambling. Keno for example can advertise without the need of a gambling warning as Keno and lotto are not considered gambling.
Every time I load up a podcast to listen to, out of the two ads that play before the podcast begins (not controlled by the originator of the podcast, these ads are controlled by the hosting company), one is always a gambling ad.
Make sure you write to the ALP to tell them that's why you're switching.
This is another area where [The Greens have stronger policy](https://greens.org.au/campaigns/end-gambling-harm). I just wish they weren’t economically illiterate in other areas.
Did you even read the article?
> Piss weak from Albo

That's kind of his deal.
I'd preference greens first, they are fiercely anti-gambling and have more impact than the ragtag independents
No thanks. The majority of independents at any election are further right than the LNP. There's the odd exception, like Andrew Wilkie, but in general, they're extremists. 

Also, I don't regard Teals as independent. They may not have a party, but they still act largely as a bloc.
And you get the labor supporters blaming the previous government for the innactions of the current government.
> Love how die-hard Labor followers are screaming "They're not Liberal Lite!"

[The Rachet Effect](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F0b17a739-b49e-4bfa-9277-04edf68cf3bd_1199x498.jpeg) perfectly describes the Labor party and what is destroying Australia.

Liberalism and capitalist parties will never change, Labor continue to allow everything to move further and further right. People need to stop voting for **both of them**.
I mean I am left-wing and tend to vote Independent > Greens > ALP so despite my views on politics I'm functionally an ALP supporter, especially where I live, I know that's where my vote is going to stop and am I pissed at this and other things?  Sure, but I will take the ALP any day over the Liberals.
It’s been 10 years of liberal governments, they have to be liberal lite or it’ll scare off North Sydney.
Two wings of the same bird.
*”Instead of the box factory we’ll be going to . . . the box factory!”*
Absolutely agreed. Parties in power are piss weak if they don’t stop gambling ads. If you don’t have a spine to stand up against the gambling lobby, how on earth will they stand up against the mining lobby?

If tobacco advertising were still around, today’s politicians wouldn’t have the spines to ban it.
As someone who was massively impacted by a gambling addicted family member, it's horrendous and ptsd/fury triggering to see these ads. I paid for stan for the Olympics solely to avoid sports betting ads
Minority government would have banned the ads, as the green's price for something.
Ladbrokes ads are fucking everywhere. Only started this year in Perth. They're at the cinema. They pop up in podcasts. It's ridiculous
There's still value in SBS. Their subtitling in particular is better than any paid streaming service.

SBS on Demand injects gambling ads by default, but you can opt out at least. It's truly everywhere.
> Joke’s on them, who is watching free to air these days?

Millions of Australians do.
Yes, once we work out how to control and tax it ...
The worst is they don't even put the markings on the ground andmore but are greenscreened or whatever on.
Read the article.
They are utterly vanilla. Any disclaimer should be contiguous with the ad and use the same voice and inflection as the ad itself.

"Remember! Only fools bet online!" - or similar.
[removed]
Read the bloody article. In full.
\^This. also never paid for streaming, haven't owned an antenna in 30 years plus avoid all forms of MSM like the plague. Currently watching AFL on a pirate channel whilst pirating this weekend's UFC round and I'll grab a few more movies / tv tonight for the week. 

Want me to pay? Then make this foreign owned corporate island not such an end stage dystopian pilfering pot.
The simple solution is to vote Greens and tell people to vote Greens.
Read the article.
My feeling is that gambling advertising should be restricted as if they were pushing those other adult entertainments known as brothels, strip clubs or massage parlours.  Haven't seen them on any team strip ... yet.
Found the ad placement wonk. Do your job. Go get a SUV account, a health insurance account, a sports equipment account, a web streamer account, an internet provider account, an energy account, a (whoever can afford the new reduced rates card) account ... even HN or CW ffs.
Just because a social disease has taken hold is no reason not to attempt curing it. There are plenty of other sponsors available.
I get that argument. 
Remember the benson and hedges cricket series? 

Sports got past that, they can get past gambling cash. 

Really comes down to what we accept as ok.
Boohoo. They got along just fine before online betting arrived.
It's makes it harder to start a new gambling company

Correct know so high ups in the the sports betting.  Advertising atm is an arms race,  the company capable/willing to spend the most get biggest cut.

They tried multiple times to get caps on sports betting advertising, not a straight ban.  But they were competing against media and sporting codes who were using the betting companies money against them
You can use the exactly same argument for advertising of cigarettes but at the end of the day some people are getting hurt.
Yeah it's pretty disgusting.

The gambling lobbies have enough cash to court both major parties too, so they have a mate no matter who wins.

Should be illegal for them to "donate"
Large fines have been issued for selling vapes to many businesses.  All have paid and kept operating, profit on vapes is wild
One of them makes money for influential people i.e. Murdoch. Who gives a crap about vapes other than the consumers.
[deleted]
Huge kickbacks in both cases. Philip Morris paid well to ensure that only their products survived the vape ban. All non-tobacco company vape related products became illegal overnight.
> I have no option but what I think's the more damaging and expensive one.

Well no, you absolutely have another option of just quitting, you just don't like that option.
Are you unable to get a prescription for nicotine liquid? Wouldn't that cheaper than smokes
And as we all know, only one thing can be disgraceful at a time, and anyone who chooses the wrong one should be patronised rudely and abrasively.

Well done mate, you're doing god's work.

Btw.

You can turn off gambling ads in Reddit settings. I'm in  Australia and I hardly ever see gambling ads.
Noted.

Unfortunately the LNP are no different
> they weren’t economically illiterate in other areas.

Like what?
My problem also.  If an independent emerged with otherwise sane platform planks I think they'd carry Chisholm.
And you did? Bravo. What's your **USEFUL** contribution?
It’s pretty common tactic to take something like this. Act like it’s the biggest thing in the world whilst ignoring everything else. 
I don't respect the greens, their spokespeople are insane like Max Chandler-Mather. Gambling is less of an issue to me than housing and the Green's stance on housing is hyper idealised.
Yeah of course. I'm on board with the direction of things Labor are doing in general but other than their standing up to the Pharmacy Guild I can't think of many instances of Labor showing guts and risking their policy capital against a powerful party this term. I understand they need to choose their enemies to stay in power but it's still a shame to see how sheepish they're being on selective issues.
That seat is held by an independent and is to be abolished.

If they wanted to claw back "Teal" seats they need to steal their policies and Teals HATE the gambling stranglehold on politics.
It has been 70 years of Liberal and Labor governments.

They both had the lowest party votes since WW2 at the 2022 election. 

Even Albo Labor tried a LNP-lite approach without NG policies and got less party votes than Shorten Labor did in 2019. LNP just lost far more party votes than Labor.

Almost like both are committing political suicide in trying to appease rich class at expense of poor and middle class.
And the public kicked out the Libs. The people wanted actual change. Labor haven't done that, and now the LNP vote is rising. It's this timidness that's causing the problem
That somehow makes it worse because you can tell it is an overlay and it makes it even more distracting
Agreed, if you meant the disclaimer of the ad is not to be taken seriously, considering the tone of the ad itself yes I agree. Similarly to tobacco industry, the reliance on revenue is too much of a loss to consider it outright banned if they cared about the people’s health.

Of course there are corporations willing to take the chair in parliament , stop using the word disease. You are already exposed for corruption…
Cry a river about teams with gambling on the shirt
Majority of clubs are proud sponsors by gambling agencies, hate the fact even kids are persuaded into unlocicitated gambling.

Feels like you know more than you willing to answer, a lot of questions
Stop using the word disease it’s kind of disrespectful and offensive to people actually suffering.
The social experiment should end up the prison gates. With a criminal record for change. yeah motherfuckers

its what i expected, meh
Let’s not call everything we dislike a a disease otherwise we will be here for a long time.

Packer to get the Crown casino license in Sydney without a tender. The license is/was worth circa $1 Billion.  He got it for free.
There's a reason why every tobacco shop still sells them lmao, and despite the cost they're still cheaper than buying actual tobacco, it's nuts.
Having done both, the food scene is much better here in Melbourne, a lot more variety. Sydney definitely has some awesome standouts that hand it to Melbourne, but Melbourne is better on average.


That said, there are plenty of people that know how to avoid the gaze of the government, you've just got to know the right people.


Go hang out with some musicians.
Fair. Tho the amount of times I've tried and failed, removing the only substitute that worked for me and a reasonable number of people using it legitimately was definitely the better option, rather than regulating it of course. 

At least now I'm contributing extra in tax I guess.
hmm did I strike a speculative nerve? 

>anyone who chooses the wrong one should be patronised rudely and abrasively.

yeah nah i don't think mentioning something that's magnitudes more destructive for greater number of people is patronising, rude nor abrasive. It's nothing more than mentioning that something is magnitudes more destructive for greater number of people...
I think it's very reallated. Gambling is just a symptom, a bit like people spending $1000+ for a Taylor Swift ticket when the cost of living was and is so outrageous.
Most do. Which is why Reddit dropped the API to have your own app, because most of them were adblocking. However, there's still a bunch. And most are easier to use than Reddit's own app.
Narwhal for iOS is a good alternative
It's just a data point in their "why we lose votes" database, but at least it might impact policy if they end up with enough of those data points. 


I haven't voted for either of the major parties as a first preference at any election in my life (I'm nearly 30 for reference), but I still write to them to tell them how to win my vote from time to time 🤷‍♀️. 


So far, money has usually won over my electoral concerns, but at least we try I guess...
Rental caps aren’t supported by mainstream economists
You could try reading what the Greens actually want to do.
Teals say they want to save the environment and ban gambling. But really what they're about is a LNP stalking horse to [start](https://theconversation.com/we-can-talk-about-a-higher-rate-of-gst-in-australia-but-it-will-never-happen-212380) and [finish](https://www.macrobusiness.com.au/2023/08/posh-teals-outflank-chicken-chalmers-on-gst-hike/) the "discussion" about increasing the GST - the most regressive tax we have. They'll do this by harvesting the disenfranchised Labor vote and then wedging them in minority government.

After that's done they'll vanish into a whirlwind like the Democrats did - the environment unsaved and with pokies intact.
It’s not realistic to expect them to just go out and flatly ban it. Thinking that’s possible just shows a complete lack of understanding of the political landscape, as well as all the different factors at play. 

Nothing is black or white. Grow up a bit.
The status quo has failed. 'Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.'
> are insane like Max Chandler-Mather.

Because he points out the hypocrisy and constant contradictions by the major parties?

> and the Green's stance on housing is hyper idealised.

"This stance brought to you by Murdoch Media Ltd."
They’ve done exactly what they promised. If you want them to get in and break promises then you’re pretty much guaranteeing a liberal government.
Not LITERALLY North Sydney, its the easiest way to describe/generalise Liberals that think they are progressive. The ones that voted against Scomo cause he simply go to weird and annoying. The ones that you don't threaten their investment property portfilo or else will vote against you no matter who its against.
[deleted]
If its true then why the fuck would you want to go back to Liberal? You give Liberals 10 years but Labor 4?
Yeah when they change camera angles mid tackle in the NRL the graphic disappears and I always think about it.
Essentially, it’s not a full ban but the restrictions are extreme in some cases, including a total ban on gambling ads on social media.
Wut? /r/worldnews permabanned me months and months ago.

>At least now I'm contributing extra in tax I guess.

You will be pleased to know that the tax on nicotine products far, far exceeds the cost to the tax payer in additional medical expenses. 

Tobacco users die faster and younger, and actually cost the state less as a result (pension, more frequent medical intervention as you age, etc).
I firmly admire your optimism, cassiacow.
And where has mainstream economists' logic gotten us? Into the current nightmare   
   
   
From what I see, the economists always compare it to places that have put on rental caps as the sole solution. Greens have never suggested it solves the housing problem, they see it as a necessary immediate step while simultaneously boosting supply exponentially
And a housing crisis and people too poor to pour money into the rest of the economy is? Can you provide evidence where economists agree a housing crisis is good for the economy?
> mainstream economists


Yeh, let's trust them!


To be more charitable, their models are infested with presuppositions and assumptions that go unstated and unscrutinised. It's not even clear most of the time that the average economist even realises this catastrophic flaw in their methodology.
Lol fuck mainstream economists. That's what's got us in this mess.
Price caps have been "totally working great" for GP bulk billing for like a decade now. Price caps are being applied to rooftop solar and home battery feed in, when a free market rate should be giving solar/battery investors massive dividends. Price cap of $0 was applied to 3 uninterrupted months of my time when it was needed to fix Morrison's vaccine bungle.

The two majors are fucking retards in exactly the same way.

"Price caps don't work" except that successive governments impose them all the fucking time, and usually against the interests of the people they are supposed to represent.
Mainstream economists in general have their finger in the pie, too. I rank them up with property managers in their level of trustworthiness.
Well it depends.
The example Labor kept throwing out was a single city in Germany that had to scrap them due to it being against the national laws.

But elsewhere it's been met with mixed results.
Worked great in some places, not so good in others.

Basically it seems that rent caps alone don't do much good. However, rent controls with other laws have performed better. 

They typically perform best in countries where the government still maintains housing stock and publicly owned social housing. But that could also be a false correlation because basically every housing market performs better when the government maintains housing stock and publicly owned social housing. 
Well performs better for people wanting a home to live in anyway. Since Australians are only wealthy on paper because our houses are "worth" A stupidly high amount compared to our median salary, then they seem to be able to be convinced that we need house prices to keep going up. And to a degree it will hurt homeowners if the market crashes, but for a house to go from costing four times the median annual wage to 13 times the median annual wage means that something went very very wrong. 

Coincidentally this happened to coincide with the government selling up all their housing stock which they had previously been building to provide social housing rentals and even selling to some people. We went from 100,000 houses to basically none over 5 years and let the private go nuts. 

The reason why in some countries it has been necessary to provide rent control is because housing is a captive Market, as in you don't get to choose to just not live in a house. So what this means is that people who continue to buy up property can charge the maximum amount the market can bear. 

So basically rent controls can work in conjunction with other laws but typically you also need a government ready to step in and buy up the houses that investors are suddenly selling because instead of making ridiculous profits, they are now only making normal profits and other investment avenues become viable, which has the bonus effect of injecting Capital into our society, making it productive Capital again.
> mainstream economists

Wait, you mean the capitalists don't like the anti-capitalist party? No way...
Better than 99% of Australians getting fucked over because the rich want to get richer.
They are quite the mixed bag. 

But you and I should not vote for a party in the Reps instead should vote for the individual. The ALP does run a tight ship disallowing any deviation from the party line which is, imho, inimicable to representative governance.
No reason to ban gambling, in fact that would just open the door to the Mob.

Rather, like brothels, its existence can be known, but not advertised in any way.
No, you keep trying until you succeed inch by inch if you have to. 
Propaganda's goal is to make everybody else identically bad so there's only one real choice "the saviour is the Greens"
If you meant the entire North Shore [(TonyAbbottLand)](https://www.arc.unsw.edu.au/generated/450-600/tharunka-2011issue4-cover-jpg.jpg?1453082008) then just say so.
Thanks, Basil. I know how to suck eggs.  "Teal" is a loose, lazy journo's collective noun for a bunch of independents with no real herd instinct.
Well I support the Greens. People have short memories, and even though it's (mostly) not Labor's fault, cost of living has really fucked up the lives of people. Labor has sat around and refused to do anything meaningful. I wish I could wave a wand and make people get past the two party system binary, and that is changing slowly, but for most people they are drowning and that makes them desperate for change.  
  
The good news is LNP is unlikely to win, more likely is a minority government. That would be wonderful and might lead to some actual bold policy
> why the fuck would you want to go back to Liberal?

Because Australians vote as if we only have two parties. 

"Liberal fucked us for 10 years, I'm voting Labor this time!"

"Labor have done fuck all to help me, I'm voting Liberal this time!"

Then anytime you say "why not vote Greens" they come back with "not them idiots!!!!" so nothing changes.
That sucks I guess we are polar opposites?
Can I ask why seriously? Because it’s easier to get banned from news.
Why girl?
Crazy the guys in China selling them load them off at about $4 a pop. So all the rest is middleman markup.
I got charged 50 bucks not long ago, mental.

Was always a minmum of $30, but maybe that's just outer Melb.
If you say so, mate.

As a night owl, I did not enjoy my time in Sydney.
Almost like the solution to a housing crisis isn’t to reduce the amount of houses on the market?
This is the only reply I’ll give an upvote to.

I and ,to be fair, most economists will agree that “all models are wrong, some models are useful”
I’ll give this one a hearty upvote and a reward. 

If the siblings replies are a representative sample, the Greens should do really well in future elections.
Individual first of course, it just happens the Greens have the individuals who want what I want.
> They are quite the mixed bag. 

An empty nothing statement, really shows you have no actual reason to dislike them beyond some ingrained notion from years upon years of propaganda.
The senate want a ban. The public want a ban. The inquiry and the late Labor MP Peta wanted a ban. Polling shows the public overwhelmingly wants a ban. A bill banning it could pass today.    
   
The only thing stopping a ban is the Labor cabinet. So with all due respect, you're talking out of your arse.
> Then anytime you say "why not vote Greens" they come back with "not them idiots!!!!" so nothing changes.

And whenever you ask them what the issue is they just start vaguely gesturing in the air and spluttering about nothingness. They'll then turn around and complain that Murdoch has too much power and control, completely blind to the contradiction.
Close but it’s around $7.80USD for orders of a few thousand Iget bars from the factory. I looked into it before the ban and the factory didn’t want to deal with orders of less than a hundred.
25 was pretty standard before but I used to buy 10 at a time and my local vape store were cool and sold them just above cost at $16. Even he had to up it to $40 in bulk.

That's fair.



But the only way to ascertain to what extent and in what ways any given model might be useful, is to discuss the presuppositions and assumptions openly and honestly.
There was a report recently Don, that showed the first voter preferences of each generation millennial and older each election from 2002 to 2022. 

It showed showed a previously unseen swing towards the progressive side of politics as a generation aged. Historically, it has always been true, at least in Australia, that as you aged your generation would start trending conservative.

For whatever reason, for the first time in Australian history, this has not happened in the last 20 years. The primary vote share for the greens by millennial voters in 2002 was 7%. And I think it was 29% by 2022. The data for these polls came straight from the Australian electoral commission. Looking at the polls that are being taken in the current term, when you divide the respondents by age bracket, 34 and under are voting at around 30%. first preference greens.

My theory is that this trend is what has caused labor to suddenly become so hostile to the greens in the media because they seem to be losing a number of their progressive voters to the greens. This won't matter if the greens don't get enough votes to get to at least the top two in an electorate so preferences can come into play, because despite the current hostility from labor, Green's preferences will normally flow that way because the alternative is significantly further right wing. 

The other interesting thing is that because most Millennials and younger don't watch the mainstream media outlets, the parties will need to figure out different ways to try and engage those people. I would not be shocked to find out that there is some astroturfing going on in some of the bigger Australian subs because it is a very simple and easy thing to do and for little effort. You may be able to swing some votes from the younger generations as they typically engage more on social media platforms like Reddit or tiktok or whichever social media platform is currently popular.
They also have the odd joker I don't. Not sure who'll pop up in my electorate.
Huh? I respect most of their policies and politicians however you'd be blind, deaf or dumb to deny some have been far less than stellar. I am on their mailing list so am kept in the loop with what they promulgate.  It's hardly propaganda. I agree or disagee. 

So thanks a bunch for your vapid condescension, fanboy.
Well, excuse me for not knowing something you didn't tell me.
I would suppose that the generational shift in politics is tied to the generational gap in wealth. A vote is favour of wealth distribution is rational. 

At the same time, Labor have leaned right after their election losses and allowed space for the Greens on the left. I think your analysis on preferences is spot on. 

Personally, I’d be happy for the trend from the last election to continue and the Teals and Greens to hold the balance of power.
> So thanks a bunch for your vapid condescension, fanboy.

This is peak irony given that right before it was nothing but vapid nothing once again, you've just once again vaguely gestured at some notion of them being wild and unbelievable while saying nothing, expecting peoples pre-conceived biases to fill in the blanks for you, biases which are formed by..?
Whew. Please take a powder and go lie down. 

To set the record straight, I believe the Greens, like any party,  present candidates and policies both impressive and not so impressive - that is to say a mixed bag. I may even vote for them, depends on whom they select, and what they say.

Politics is nuanced, not a team sport. Grow up.
