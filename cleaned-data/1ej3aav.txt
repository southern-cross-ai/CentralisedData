'I Made It', 'Amazing', and 'Heaven (Must Be There)', can go die. Especially 'I Made It', who interrupted itself with– itself. 

Why do they constantly repeat these ads?
Almost like the companies pay a shitload for their ads to run heaps of times or something…
Every Olympics I yearn for  "Go you good thing" to make a comeback.
The worst was the ads in lead up with that awful cover of 'Land Down Under'
I came here to post this. Fuck these fucking adverts. 

Jokes on them though. Despite them being repeated like a jackhammer in my brain, I have no idea what any of them are selling.
I wish the Australian anthem was Waltzing Matilda too.... But that's a bit harsh right?
Thanks for making me LOL.
I prefer Regurgitator - Crush The Losers
