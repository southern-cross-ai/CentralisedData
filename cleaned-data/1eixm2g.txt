The coverage has been awful, however the app is great, just sport none of the crap. Does anyone know if it‚Äôs possible to do multi view some how with the app, I want to consume as much sport at once as possible.

I've only seen an option for it when using chrome or Microsoft browser.
There's no way to watch full matches after they have happened using 9 or the app?

Wonder if Stan is any different
I wish they put a ‚Äúlive‚Äù icon in the corner so I know I‚Äôm not watching some bull shit replay
I‚Äôll give it a go
Stan has full replays of all events. The 9 app has *some* full replays, usually if Australians are in it.
9Now has full replays
Stan has full replays.   Everything is in its own category and makes finding the event easy. 


If im being pedantic The "full replays" can be a bit annoying

Example. Was watching jess fox in her k1 event and you will have to skip through 1+ hour of absolutely nothing but water running  as they don't edit anything.. 

They also get a bit lazy and combine events. Like men's and woman's  bmx park. You have to skip through 2 hours of the event you don't want to watch to view what you do.
Cheers. Just wondering if it's worth the $36 for one month of 4k and sports package üòï
