Well, I aint spendin' no time on *this*!
Man, that's morbid.
Thats really bad luck, I wonder who was responsible for maintaining the "established path " that people used and one that was in such poor condition in a dangerous area.  I don't see what all the lectures are all about   on feeding crocodiles when the victim was not doing this. He fell into river because the pathway that he was walking on  collapsed?
Very very sad and tragic especially since they were on a proper path. But I'm not understanding why the crocodile had to be euthanased? To recover the body?Â 
Nightmare fuel ðŸ˜°
And their kids.
I think the no feeding reminder was added because while the deceased and his family were not feeding, a group had recently been given a fine for feeding a croc in the spot, possibly coaxing the croc towards the shore ðŸ˜”
I agree. I read in one report the place he was standing on is very slippery when wet. I donâ€™t know he so many people choose to be callous on here.

It's a remote area of Australia. An "established path" just means a bush track along the river bank that's been worn down by various people. 

Not an actual built/maintained footpath.

This is the ["path"](https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/15090cdcfef32f36986b20d89a7d41fc?width=1024)

Horrible that the kids have to live through this, but article says the kids didn't witness it
You donâ€™t have to feed a croc for them to hang around known fishing spots. Theyâ€™re smart, they know.
Thatâ€™s good news.
