I’m just an American, but today we all grieve the loss of Jack Karlson. In memoriam, I’ll be watching this beautiful recreation by one of my favorite bands and gifts from Australia, The Chats. R.I.P. Jack Karlson, I hope you’re enjoying a succulent Chinese meal wherever you are. 

(If you don’t like the music, skip to around 1:30)
The fact they used the original guy that said ‘democracy manifest’ from the 80s. Pure gold. RIP to that guy
If you like the chats and want a similar style (but less basic) give the band coffin a go

Best punk band in australia
I’ll have to check them out, I already have Dune Rats, Amyl and the Sniffers, and Stiff Richards on my playlist as well. Gotta say, no one is doing punk right now better than you Australians. At least when it comes to the more modern bands. A lot of newer American punk bands either rip their sounds from more popular bands from the 80s or sound too emo to me. Turnstile being a notable exception. 

I’ll always take more punk recommendations.
Right up your alley then

Through the sewer was my favourite song off their newest album, I'd give that track a go
You might want to check out Clowns and Private function too.
Bet thanks man, they do sound pretty good
Mine is faceless.

But I really really love entirety of the On the Gronk album and listen to it once a day.
