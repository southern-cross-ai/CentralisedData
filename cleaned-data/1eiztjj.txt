Social cohesion has to be faltering for these groups to make in-roads in the first place. These groups are a symptom of a problem, not the cause.
Obscene cost of living and housing is a threat to social cohesion, and allows or causes the rise of extreme groups. Like someone else said, the groups are a symptom of a problem, not the cause.
If you don't want young men to gather in groups that you feel are damaging to society, don't create the conditions which make those groups close to the only groups available for young men to gather into.
As a black-Aussie, i'm already starting to see the radicalisation seep out. The main reason is social media sites, sites like twitter are enflaming tensions.
Fucking meathead coward sissies - hiding their faces. Society has no place for their hatred of others.

I'm sure while showering together, washing each others back, they ask themselves "why are we fuckwits?"
In a move to help address concerns of disharmony in Australia, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese announced a new Special Envoy for Social Cohesion during the unveiling of his refreshed cabinet.

Oh good a new special envoy, we are set now.
Fuckwits gotta be fuckwits I suppose.
Cowardly little arseholes who hide behind a mask.

Chicken shit fuck heads.
Not committed enough to show their faces tho. Pass
Ah so we're doing the Skinhead arc again are we?
They don't even have the courage to show their faces. 🤷🏽‍♂️
And with mass immigration this type of thing is going to get worse.
What do they actually do in these 'club'? Sit around, drink piss and talk shit?
It's [nothing new](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usta%C5%A1e_in_Australia).
Supremacy based on skin colour or racial origin is a flawed argument.

Every nationality has more than it's fair share of cunts.

These redneck / bogans that embrace this crap are the Caucasian cunts.

And not to put a too fine a point on it, maybe Europeans should have stayed home rather than rape the resources of Africa, South America, Middle East, Asia. Not to suggest these folks weren't cunts themselves.

All of our ancestries are guilty of atrocities but we apparently don't fucking learn.
Agreed. The fissures created by government failures we should be focusing on. If we can create a good life for (ideally) everyone then people won't be susceptible to these hate groups.
Why aren't they focussing on white immigrants then.
Who put the kibosh on meeting up in a group without being a literal Nazi?
Are you saying we need to re-implement a white Australia policy or are you saying we need to ban Facebook and telegram because both of those things are hilariously impractical.


We could easily shut down sky news though. Radio jockey opinions masquerading as news has no place in our society.
Baseball bats at the ready!
Why?
Combat training, planning for their "white revolution," moderating Australian politics subreddits etc.
It's easier to blame the "other" if they don't look like you. These groups enflame existing biasses, using stress and alienation to do so.
No, I'm saying that modern Australian society has all but eliminated [third places](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_place) unless you're willing to pay exorbitant fees to join.

People are struggling to find housing and jobs as it is but let’s bring in more. 

Look at what is happening in France and the UK. Yes a lot of the people causing issues are 2nd generation immigrants but it’s the net result of opening the flood gates in the first place. 

It’s not racist to say mass immigration is causing issues.
Let's be real, for most people the third place is phone internet. Like we are doing right now.
Except if that were the cause, why is it only men that are falling into such toxic extremism? There's been plenty of other groups historically and currently ostracized from society that didn't devolve into white supremacy, so do you think there might be something else at play?
When 'people talk' about the negative effects of 'migration' they call it 'immigration' so they can introduce their racist sentiment and you wonder why they get 'shouted down'? They already have established and exploit their 'us vs them' mindset and desperately want you to engage reasonably to legitimize their prejudices.
More accurately, the benefits are concentrated amongst a few whole the burdens are shouldered by the many. For example, cheap labour for business owners but more competition for housing.
So its government policy causing issues but you want to focus on brown people.

Do white yanks and poms and saffas and  kiwis not live in houses or something.

How dumb are you. If you believe what you wrote then I'd have to say pretty fucking dumb.
Yeah, which is the problem.
What's your contention? White people (a group defined purely by what it isn't) are genetically predisposed to joining racial supremacy groups?
White men don't typically have coherent cultural group to fall back on when times are tough that other groups do.

Immigrate is to come into another country to live permanently. Migrate is to move temporarily 


We are seeing mass immigration
Did I ever mention the colour brown in my comments?

Colour has nothing to do with it. 

Sounds like you are trying to justify your own narrative.
You’re the only one here who keeps saying “brown people”.


Tone down your projection mate
Which circling back to your original point of "not creating the conditions" how do you propose to 'fix' people using their spare time by trawling the internet and how does this achieve anything?
> White people (a group defined purely by what it isn't) are genetically predisposed to joining racial supremacy groups?

That's definitely a take and a fairly disingenuous one at that, but no, given that we were discussing social factors to start with, I would posit that perhaps there are other social or cultural factors at play influencing the situation.
It is racism when it only focusses on brown people and ignores white European, US, Brit, Kiwi, Saffa immigrants.
All forms of migration can be [temporary](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/research-and-statistics/statistics/country-profiles/temporary-migration) or [permanent](https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/research-and-statistics/statistics/country-profiles/permanent-migration).

Immigration is migration into a place. Emigration in migration from a place. All migrants are both immigrants and emigrants.
You said this type of thing will get worse because of immigration.

"This type of thing" is white supremecy. That's what the article is about.

What do you mean "colour has nothing to do with" white supremecy?
CJA and Australian poster.

Yeah righto little fella.
The government has priced third places out of the market by causing land usage to be extremely expensive, and at the local level banning (for example) skate parks and the like. There is no simple fix to this, it's a failure at all levels of government over a very long time.
I'm not particularly interested in trying to tease out your thesis; what are the social or cultural factors that you feel are at play?
You forgot greentext


When your argument is weak attack the person
My suburb is supposed to benefit from a pump track. Given all the local bushland filled with community trails this is a great proposal and a family friendly one that literally all ages can enjoy. 

There's massive petitions against it and how it's going to bring shit people into the area. Because people with mountain bikes are... Something?
Righto little fella.
