The Aussies look absolutely devo.
Hahaha I genuinely laughed at the unexpected realisation that what I was reading and seeing were in fact both correct but for reasons that took a moment to coalesce. Bravo 😂
Is Australia not trying?
LOL... A toast to the gold-winning US Mental Gymnastics team!
They'll count them as 4 medals.
If you check the NYT right now they have their medel table order by number of Medels and guess what! USA are winning!
Bronze + Silver = Gold. Simple mafs, mate.
Can probably cut this now. USA has overtaken us on gold
For a country w the population of California y’all’s gold medal count is really impressive
2 dads in the twilight of their career beating both higher ranked opponents to win gold. They need a statue to commemorate this legendary performance
US are sure doing a great job at being first and second losers this Olympics aren’t they?
I think everyone's actually got it all wrong.

The reason that most of the world counts by gold is so that smaller countries have some time in the sun. It allows for more shifting of places for longer, and a more international score board.

Since most of the world is one of those non-China, non-USA (and back in the day, non-USSR) countries, it makes sense to use number of golds.

But that doesn't mean that it's actually a better or more logical way of showing which country is doing better in the Olympics.

Country A: 2 gold. 20th place in everything else.

Country B: 1 gold. Silver in everything else.

Should we actually consider country A to be winning? Isn't at least reasonable to say that there's another way to think about it?
Fuck me it's like the Americans ate a bunch of sour lemons.
This took me a while lol. Its 3.30am so I’ll give myself a pass
Could someone explain? I dont get it
How did this end up turning out?
And dont they look so happy about it?
congrats :))))
They are going for the Constructors Championship
This aged well
Update?
🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸Better luck next time Steve Irwin and company.
I mean look at the poor Aussies. I hope they are offered counselling for such a shattering loss.
The USA will win most gold and most medals they always do
the looks on their faces
India. 1.4 billion people. 3 medals.

That’s fucked that India has 1.4 billion people. Swear it was 900m last time I checked.
yeesh. someone tell the aussie men to smile some more.
I love how upset the yanks look.
Hahahha we sh1t in their cereal.
Scoreboard 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
The Americans are so upset that they’ve won…  the Aussies so happy they get to sit in cattle class on the flight home with all the other non-winners
Ebden and Peers are both 36. Silver medalists Krajicek and Rajeev Ram are 34 and 40, respectively. Men's Dad-bles :D
Four medals to two.
I didn't see this in any of the American threads...
Glad to see Matty Ebden still playing and the fact he took a gold is incredible, he's a nice guy.
take that, aukus!!
Surely this is 4 medals to 2 so merica wins by 2
A population of 300+million compared to one of under 30million but we still punch above our weight especially in women’s swimming🇦🇺
Which sport is this? The guy second from the left doesn't look like an athlete :😜

You guys will shit on the us for anything at this point
Ah America. Where quantity is more important than quality and 3rd is as good as first.
Oops, looks like Australia has too much oil, and needs some democracy. Damm socialists and their " universal healthcare.. "
You people literally cannot stop thinking about the USA can you
USA USA USA
[deleted]
Poor dudes. The picture caught them literally in the middle of trying to rip those medals off. My heart goes out. 
I think they’ll be ok
Hahaha sense when is silver and bronze so depressing enjoying the spirit of the games guys? Lol
No. We only try to send winners, not a steady stream of 1st and 2nd losers. /s
They need to up their doping program
This didn’t age well 😂

Luckily for you, you're up to win gold for it now

Time to break out the 'per capita' table.
they do that every Olympics -- it's how they stay in the lead
What's with this Aussie obsession with **winning** the Olympics?  Every time there is so much crying about a table sort order that, at the end of the Olympics, does not matter.  And then all the extra cope about medals-per-capita, doing the exact same thing you're accusing the US of.

Just be proud.  Why can pride only happen at the expense of America?  Like I get that America is **too** patriotic, but you can be proud of Aussie athletes without bringing other countries into it.
That;s because they can't handle reality.
It's honestly so cringe the way they always do that.  Even back in Sydney 2000 they were reporting it that way.
lol look now…and look again at the end.
Do they switch if the USA has most gold medals?
Copium!
Thats because the USA is number 1 ^(at coming second and third)
I think everyone's actually got it all wrong.

2 + 3 = 5 and 5>>>1
melt the bronze and silver together to create a larger, more salubrious medal.
Gg ez
If you saw what lurks in the waters off our coast, you'd become a fast swimmer too.
Funny you say that because 80% of the USA's medals (similar ratio for golds) are from California. 

No hate and not to emphasize US domestic politics with what I'm about to say.

I just find it funny how there are definitely unpleasant peckerwood types from say Kentucky or Mississippi shouting how the USA is the best country in the world and use Olympic medals to back up that statement, when "commiefornia" is the reason that's so lol
No, Canada has the population of California. Australia has a smaller population than Texas.
Not California, a little less than Texas.
Yeah we do pretty good. 97% of our population live in only 3% of our total land mass & 85% of our population lives within 50km of the Coastline.
Take into account that Australia has more people competing this year than China does.
in what way is "y'all's" meant to be shorter to say and type than "your"?

you blokes are bonkers.
Nah, ebden is at the top of his career right now having won aussie open and also was no 1 in double briefly.

Some of the americans are singles players.
They will have the most gold before the Olympics are over. They are really strong in track and field and team sports, which occurs mostly in the second week. China dominates diving, that's why they jumped out to a lead.

The same thing happens every Olympics. This isn't an anomaly.
Well they’re about to take most golds soooo…
Yes they are Bruce
Totally! Losing so much
I look at Brazil - at one point Brazil had 1 gold but 10 total medals, but Azerbaijan had 2 gold, so they were “ranked”
higher. It’s silly.
How happy does Ram look?
Americans just surpassed Australia in gold, so now you've been beaten in both gold and total tallies.
I was reading your comment and thought to myself "wtf is he even talking about?" Then I tapped the photo to enlarge it. Lmao.
It's a joke about how the US generally sort the medal table only by total medals, not by number of gold medals. It's easy to see how flawed the logic of this is when you consider a single event like this, because the US would be considered the winners, with two medals, while Australia only has one.
Taylor Fritz always looks like that to be fair
Same thing happened on the pool deck when Kaylee McKeown won the 100m backstroke - the American swimmers Regan Smith and Katharine Berkoff looked like they'd each just swallowed a bag of sour lollies.
Steve was a gem. Don’t compare that man to your typical Aussie.
2008 called with a fact check on gold medals.

(Also, you feel the need to say you'll probably beat a nation with fewer people than Texas lmao)

Edit for the idiots beneath this comment: if the nation fifteen times larger than Australia in everything but land area was even half as good at sport as Australia, then it wouldn't even be close and Mr. 118 years ago wouldn't have needed to say anything.
America won more golds than Australia, seems your comment aged very poorly in the grand scheme of things.
Did you now? Seems you had your ass bent over your own bowl
I’d point out, as an American, I’d be happy that our ladies beat yours in rugby. Would be enough for me, but might as well top gold and medal counts
I chuckled at this.
And for number 2 and 3. So 2x3 + 2x2 > 2x1
America still won the most gold in overall swimming events.
New Zealand has a higher medal per population count than Australia, so....
You also send more athletes than China to the Olympics.
Men's doubles tennis.
>The guy second from the left doesn't look like an athlete

So errrr... what DOES an athlete look like in your mind?

Ahhhh Australia, where the copium doesn’t cope hard enough
LOL
What do you mean "you people"?
Bro's really come to the AUSTRALIAN subreddit to comment this, lol.
They really can't can they? Even when they're winning golds it's all about the US
yeah how weird, silver and bronze medalists are from the US and on the photo and people think about them.
Truuuuuuuuuuuuue! 😂😂😂😂

I know, it’s hilarious
Literally the [bronze medal meme](https://amp.knowyourmeme.com/memes/bronze-medal) happening here.

Err.. the Trump rally is over there.
Calm down I was trolling. Lol
Good thing it's not counted by totals then. Maybe the US needs to win a few more gold
Who didn't win the event?

And China has the most gold.

America the most silver. Second is great, but it's ain't first.
You're sounding very north Korean with this comment.
US ended up with more gold and overalls 😊
*Swigs energy drink and eats another tim tam while watching the telly*

"Pathetic American olympians" /s
This didn’t age well 😂
aged like milk
So I take it that any Australians who win silver or bronze gladly return their medals to the IOC in solidarity with your stance on them being mere participation trophies?
LLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL
Why not both?
Using a sarcasm warning is un Australian 

Particularly bad with such an extremely obvious joke what would the risk be here of not adding it
You belong there.. because that comment was a bloody winner! Upvote gold!
... Sweats profusely looking at the team sports besides the women's hockey..
too bad you have less golds and less  total medals than us.. :)
???
Huh?
???
No we don’t liar. We are busy laughing as Australias obsession with medal count. lol, shot right past y’all today.
I got you: [https://www.medalspercapita.com/](https://www.medalspercapita.com/)

Kiwis have got a leg up, but we're not far behind.
It's how they *tell themselves* they stay in the lead
They usually win most golds anyway so that’s not it
actually we’re in the lead by both metrics now
The US has had more golds in every Olympics since 1996 than any other country except in 2008.

They also still have more golds than Aus.
They’re in the lead by golds now as well 🖕🏻
The US has more golds, too.
Australia team didn’t send canoeists because they would not be a medal contender even though they qualified. It’s not a public thing it’s a sports board thing. Probably other sports that did the same thing. Olympic flag images showed Australia with 2 competitors until a few days before.

The kicker is Australia paddling said no money then had photos of them staying in a castle.
It’s just how they’ve always done it. It’s not some conspiracy. I swear this happens literally every Olympics and everybody makes a huge fuss about how American media portrays the Olympics to Americans it for some reason.

They’re about to have the most golds anyway
lol this comment and this whole thread did not age well...
What’s the reality?
[removed]
Meanwhile you guys just resort to "population per medal" to make you feel better lol
Once track and field starts I’m sure they will.
No it’s just done differently by different news outlets. Some are by gold some are by total.
They don’t it’s just how they’ve always done it
Probably. At the last world swimming championships the US were happy to list by number of gold medals....until Australia overtook that tally, then it was switched to total medals
No
Number 1 in Gold, number of medals, etc.
The only real way to indicate which country is “winning” is to have a points system that operates a bit like the Brownlow votes system in the AFL. 3 points for gold, 2 points for silver and 1 point for bronze.
California puts a huge emphasis into Olympic sports. USC, UC Berkeley, Stanford, and UCLA are Olympic sport athlete factories.
TIL California and Kentucky are not a part of the same country
It's not supposed to be shorter it's called dialect lmao
It's a contraction of "you all" just as "it's" is a contraction of "it is". Surprised anyone could escape watching/hearing southern US accents enough to not pick this up.
Y'all removes the ambiguity between you (singular) and you (plural).

The Australian equivalent would be youse, but it's seen as a mark of low education to a much greater extent here, and many of our younger generations use "y'all" anyway, especially in text.
This is what usually happens, we go really well in the pool (though not usually this good) then fall back in the second half
Had to get something in. Just unusual the US is this low in the count this far in. It’s always between them and China as countries that pride themselves on being #1
We have a tenth of your population
Counting only gold is also problematic, of course.
Mate I’m Australian I want Australians to win but the reality is that the USA always win’s , Beijing was once by1 gold medal in their own country get real 
And talk about population well look at China or India your statements make no logic 
What does is the total amount of athlete’s sent by each country yes the USA is a bit higher but they are simply the greatest winners of medals Gold Silver and Bronze by a wide wide margin
U.S just won the most gold medals. Your comment aged very poorly it seems.
Ah yes 2008 that really makes a difference when USA has led with what 18 soon 19 different Olympics with medals/Gold let’s just skip 2012 2016 2020 and soon 2024 too ,as for population let’s not throw out excuses India and China has more people than USA there was so much talk about Australia 5 days ago now there’s excuses.
Lol you really held on to my comment until you could say this didn’t you 😂
Because he looks like a 46 year old IT worker
We're all good thanks. We just celebrate the results we get without having to pick and choose how we rank the tally differently to make ourselves feel better. If we're in first spot, that's great. If we're 10th, that's where we are. All the athletes do their best and deserve our praise. We just don't need to demean everything by pretending that going further isn't a success.
I mean... as someone who lives in Australia and is an Australian citizen (immigrated many years ago), I too notice that there are a lot more posts and comments about the US than seems reasonable.
Seems like the US subreddit the way we’re talked about a lot
Well yeah, you guys are like top 3 in hating on USA for dumb shit.
Bro we dont think its a rivalry. We just dont hesitate to call out USA's bullshit unlike most other countries.
There’s no rivalry, we appreciate you giving up healthcare to have a better military to keep us safe. Like a self sacrificing doorman ;p
> that most Americans are unaware of

...you think most Americans are unaware of the Olympics?
Poor fellas dyslexic.
To be fair to the USA, they have indeed won a few more gold overnight
Actually there is no official count. It’s all made up.
Just don't mention adjusting medal totals by population
It completely depends on the hosting country. Sometimes the winner is decided by who wins more medals…
They will have the most gold before the Olympics are over. They are really strong in track and field and team sports, which occurs mostly in the second week. China is poor in track and team sports. China dominates diving and men's gymnastics, that's why they jumped out to a lead.

The same thing happens every Olympics since the 90s, outside of Beijing. This isn't an anomaly
Yeah nice one lol there are more Texans than Australians btw
Don't most Americans wear jeans rather than overalls??
Smashes down veggiemight toast at 6:30 am Friday to see our RUGBY team lose to USA.

[deleted]
This was always gonna happen once track and field started. 

Everyone knows this. It’s like stating the pope is Catholic.
What are you doing here seppo
For a nation of 26mil vs 330mil, I think it's safe to say we're kickin' ass.  

...let us have this while it last(ed)s
The Vatican has the opportunity to do something really funny.
Dominica is probably going to win (71,000 people and 1 gold medal), and it's even in gold medals (women's triple jump).

P.S. congrats to them for their first-ever Olympic medal, and doubly so for it being gold.
We’re not cracking that top 3 but we’re doing well if you base it on golds. Can we be like the US and count it to benefit us? Let’s say Gold medals/per capita with at least 5 gold. Yknow, to account for outliers with 200k population.
The 95% confidence interval on the NZ population per medal (where lower is better) is 333,705 to 1,422,125; for Australia it is 649,107 to 1,374,144. They overlap (in fact the NZ estimate spans the Aus one), so we can’t really be sure they are any better.
I'll take it, our cuzzies across the ditch are choice people.
How has India got so few medals with a billion people?
Keep digging.  What about gold medals per capita?
Shakes fist
Kosovoooo!
To make things fair, you'll need to filter that for minimum population. Otherwise the extremes of 70k population will be impossible to beat. So I say set a minimum of population of like 5 mil. 

Seems like that might put Australia first and eject the kiwis from the count, how unfortunate for them.
Go KiwiBro's. It's your turn to shine
We now have more golds in swimming than Aus. What do you have to say about that?
They only overtook us in the last day or so.
USA typically finish first but they often lag behind as they're strongest in team sports and athletics that give out medals at the back end. 
When they take the lead usually depends on how well everyone went in the swimming
It is more like the fact that they choose to do it a different way to everyone else to make them look like they are the best all the time. Then when they get to the point of having most golds, only then is it OK to do the table in the way that literally every other country's media do it from the start. 

It gives the impression that the collective ego of the US is so fragile that they have to pull fuckery until they actually earn their place.
Tht the tables in every other country in the world is by # of golds then silvers then bronze. Just like the value of the actual metals - gold is the most valuable, bronze the least
I think a more fair version of that would be competitors per medal as there are 460 Australians competing. Compare that to 594 for the US, and Chinas 388. Comparing that to the population size for each you can see that Australia has far more competitors per capita.
US beat the aussies in swimming, to boot.
They won’t.
I am not aware of any outlets outside the US that do this.  Maybe there are others but just low profile.
I think that's probably right. Of course, if the US did it that way, the same people downvoting me would still say that the US does it to look good.
Well Michael Phelps retired. Last year he got the US 5 golds in swimming
Gold = 4 points

Silver = 2

Bronze = 1
Oh my gosh you're smack-talking Texas but with fewer people. The second-largest economy in the world, third-largest population, sixth-highest per capita GDP, and you feel the need to brag about beating Australia.

If you were good at sport, it shouldn't even be close, and if you were good at thinking, you would know it. Now go shoot a Presidential candidate or whatever you do with your spare time.
Americans are currently all over this sub talking shit to the commenters for the past few days. Americans have a short memory but we remember the past 3 days with all the smack talk the Aussies did.
What is the exact number of reasonable comments and explain your logic on why it’s that exact number? 

The US playa big role in the world and we are allies with them plus part of the world, it’s not shock what happens in the us and what they do is discussed here
Definitely an inferiority complex
It's more of a calling out our bullshit so nobody focuses on yours and treats you the same.
"We" Australia followed the US into Vietnam **AND** Iraq lmao. Pathetic.
“USA’s bullshit” oh yeah, like winning in golds AND total medals? Call us out all you want bro
I mean if the Americans have any rivalries in the Olympics its with the Chinese I do think most are worried about Australia
 yes I don’t know anyone here in America who is following the Olympics at all. I remember for a time how people here were talking about how terrible the viral clips of the opening ceremony was and then the Turkish shooter guy for the average guy went viral and that’s been about it for the average guy around here.
Most Americans are unaware with some rivalry with Australia in medals
So by everyone else's standards, they are coming 2nd, and I'll pay them that, which is fair enough
Most of the tables I have seen in many different media over 50 years go by the number of gold, then ranks by numbers of silver then bronze. 

Of course the Yanks HAVE to be different, they can't handle reality. They prefer an "alternative reality"...
You spelled Vegemite wrong twice in 29 words.
Damn bro, you're crazy
[deleted]
 Cool, so you gloat until you can't gloat. Makes sense.
New Zealand has a higher medal per population count than Australia, so....
Now they just need to get the 100m Blessing introduced as a sport for the 2028 games and they're golden.
...what, break from tradition and *not* diddle choirboys?

sorry, low hanging and all, see myself out
Some genius came up with a variable to account for the outliers, using probability, he’s called mushing’s on YouTube and I don’t think he has done the maths for this Olympic Games yet but he did one for all the Olympic Games of the 21st century and suprisingly Australia ranked 1st and the dude isn’t even Australian so it wasn’t biased
>Yknow, to account for outliers with 200k population.

Try 71 thousand people. (The real leader without the restriction is Dominica, whose first-ever Olympic medal of any metal came in the women's triple jump.)
>How has India got so few medals with a billion people?

Because historically most of that population has been more concerned with surviving than sports. This will probably change with the increasing affluence (it takes time for that to filter through to "more time for recreation) and with cricket now becoming an Olympic sport
NZ has 5m people
Depends if winning cricket scores you 11-12× medals, or just 1.
I say y'all can stop lying now about the medal tally, it was just embarrassing for everyone seeing US desperately trying to twist the numbers...
Aussies couldn’t help running their mouths the first few days. We are going to happily return the favor 3 fold for the rest of the competition. Thank you and be prepared
But US also did better at swimming than Australia
The USA doesn’t switch to most golds after they win more than everybody else though; they keep their lists ordered by most medals. They just happen to also have most golds.

In the 2022 Winter Olympics the USA got the 5th most medals total so they ranked themselves on their graphs 5th. They did have the 3rd most gold medals but they didn’t give themselves third. They suck with ordering the list by most medals because it’s just how they do it.
Doesn’t matter now. We are top in everything atm and only tied for gold with China (that’ll change) but for now, our graphs seem to be the most accurate
Also doesn’t work because of team sports. You send one team and that’s 20+ people that can only earn one medal. This is the worst metric.
If we don’t, does this conspiracy theory keep holding up or what
Lol, they already are mate
Some do in Canada, such as the CBC.
I guess the other question is whether all events should be classed as equal. For example, should a medal in a elite event like the 100 metre sprint (where the Olympics is the pinnacle of the sport) be classed on the same level as a medal in a less popular sport like Breaking; or a sport like tennis where the Olympics is no more than a glorified exhibition event?
If the US did it that way, most of the people in this sub would still accuse them of doing it to look good.
American here. I've always thought it should be 10, 3, 1. This maintains a big emphasis on gold while giving some points to silver and bronze.
hahahaha god that is just about right for them lmaooo
Do you demand an exact number if someone says that there's an unreasonable amount of sugar in our diet, or delays to public transportation? WHAT'S THE EXACT NUMBER THAT'S REASONABLE?

Sorry. I don't think I need to provide that.

The US comes up in Australian subs more often than in other subs that I pay attention to (which includes French subreddits and general European ones).

There are often comments completely out of the blue. We're talking about... chickens... and someone will mention some nonsense like chickens in the US are filled with cancer. Upvotes and  a hundred comments about how shitty the US is.

Or about how that country, on the other side of the world, tallies their medals.
Doesn’t stop the one sided beef aussies have
Major
So they're aware of it? cool.
Especially as at the time of Ebden & Peers winning the Gold Medal in the OP Australia was second on the overall table.
"fake news" They have a yuge medal tally.
The US almost always has the most gold medals and total medals, it doesn't really matter which way its counted.
And I'll do it again. Vegymyte.
Haha. 

This all stems back to Gary Hall saying he was going to smash the Australian relay team like guitars. That was ok but we return fire and all hell breaks loose. Fucking funny. 

/plays air guitar
Wah wah
Gary Hall and smashing guitars mate. 

When swimming comes up we have long memories lol
Australian population < 27,000,000

Australian Olympic Medals (so far) = 27

Population per Medal = 1,000,000 : 1

USA population > 341,000,000

USA Olympic Medals (so far) = 61

Population per medal = 5,590,164 : 1

It’s very simple maths and quite comprehensive really…
So... what? No one mentioned NZ. I'm assuming they're boasting about it over on r/NewZealand
Well it is in the city of angels
There you go, the completely objective and real medal tally.
So it was a lie until it wasn't a lie? That's the theory  you're going with? How do I lol in an aussie accent?
We've always counted it that way? Then win the gold count anyway what's your point?
US overtook Aus on the final day of swimming, hence I say it depends how the swimming goes
Why be different to the rest of the world then? Then again the US still refuses to join virtually all the rest of the world using the metric system.  Switching to metric makes it a lot easier for people to estimate and understand measures, so I think it would actually help many people.

I truly just don't understand this huge need to be "different" in ways that makes the US look backward or arrogant.
It’s the same every Olympics. The kids on reddit can’t remember two years ago.
No they aren’t.
Probably.

You can't count total medals, but like you said you can't just count gold. Because if you did a country that got 20 silver, 30 bronze, would rank below one that got a single gold and nothing else.
Yes I would ask what a reasonable amount of sugar intake is, why would you think that’s an absurd question? It’s exactly how diets and nutrition works 

I’d imagine European countries are pretty focussed on what’s happening in European countries yes

The Olympics are happening and there’s a discussion on why a country tallies their medal differently, yes a shock horror.
And????????
The advantage of being an economically developed country with 13x our population. But it does not change my point that most of the tables I have seen in different media sources over 50 years are done in the way I describe. If I have the choice between a gold necklace, a silver necklace and a bronze one, which one is more sought after ie worth more?
😡 how dare you insult my precious black spread 😡
Thorpedo and the boys playing air guitar after getting their medals was pretty lit, wasn't it?
New Zealand has a higher medal per population count than Australia, so....
Population per medal is the ultimate copium lol
USA might be more likely to have more talent thanks to a larger population, but at the end of the day, they do have more talent.
Medals per capita is a bunk metric.
Right but “they lag behind because they’re strongest in team sports and athletics that give out medals at the end” is odd to say as if they’re not also the best at swimming
Didn’t even bring up metric but ok; It’s just how they’ve always done it, that’s literally it. They don’t do it because they have a “need” to be different. They sort medals by total count because they just do, they use imperial because they just do. Americans don’t choose not to switch to the metric system out of a desire to be different, they just know imperial better and stick with it.

It’s honestly a little weird how much people obsess over how the USA does stuff. If it works for them, great, why do you care?
>Yes I would ask what a reasonable amount of sugar intake is, why would you think that’s an absurd question? It’s exactly how diets and nutrition works

But the person on reddit that you're talking to isn't usually a nutritionist. They can say that there's an unreasonable amount of sugar in the Australian diet without being expected to know the "exact" amount of sugar that's reasonable.

And In fact, even a nutritionist probably wouldn't have an "exact" number, but a range that differs from person to person.

Same goes for delays to public transportation, as I said.

Asking for an exact number is rhetorical device that isn't going to work.

>I’d imagine European countries are pretty focussed on what’s happening in European countries yes

That doesn't explain why they'd have fewer posts and comments about the US than we do here. Wouldn't you also imagine that we'd be focussed on what's happening here?

>The Olympics are happening and there’s a discussion on why a country tallies their medal differently, yes a shock horror.

I don't remember saying it was a shock horror. I think you're confused.
Right, my point was more towards your 'can't handle reality' comment. The US is still likely to win the most golds. And silvers... and bronzes... and thus total medals. 

You are insinuating that somehow the US media is doing this to climb the rankings and my point is that we're going to do very well regardless of how you rank the medals. The US media (some of it, some are switching) have been doing it like this for as long as I've been alive. It's not like they pulled it out of their ass for this Olympics because they were behind in gold medals for a week. IDK why or when they started but it's just how they do it at this point.
Brother in my defense it's my precious black spread as well. I was taught phonetics as a kid. I can't spell for shit my guy. <3 don't hate me to much.
Choice.
And Saint Lucia has an even higher count after the Woman’s 100m, so what’s your point…
It’s more grounded in reality than gross…
Australia used to "do it because that is what we always have done" and went metric 50 years ago. Sweden changed from driving on the left to driving on the right. Big changes can be done if a country has the will.

As to why I care? It is a bit hard to claim you are the greatest in the world if the way that a basic condition in life like measuring stuff is out of whack with what virtually every other country in the world sees value in using. Being grouped with Myanmar on anything isn't what I would want my country to be,
Then they haven’t thought about their position very deeply if they think there’s too much but have no idea how much is happening or what a reasonable amount is. 

Because they have land neighbours all around so a lot of their talking will be about those countries 

Once again what is the reasonable amount of things the people are allowed to talk about? Instead of saying it’s unreasonable for discussions to happen why couldn’t you just engage in discussions you like instead? You here are engaging in it and even going as far as to be in subs for other countries to take a note of how much they talk about America which I’ll be honest is very strange

Edit: odd you’d reply to me then send me a DM saying “enjoy the block you US simp boy I win” bro you are unwell
They ARE doing that. The Yanks can't stand anything that doesn't put them on top. I guess that explains why the Orange Fuhrer has so much support over there.

There is a whole world that exists outside the US but so few Americans travel overseas that they are caught up in their own world.  And the US passport is a lot cheaper the Aussie one (most expensive in the world now, thanks for nothing!)
Yeah duh. Exactly my point.

All I'm saying is that per population is kind of a weird metric. USA will win the most golds and the most medals which is what really matters.
Yall have 461 athletes to America's 591. Not that big of a difference 

"Per capita" means nothing
It actually isn’t . We wear it as a badge of pride. As a big “fuck you” to the rest of the world because in reality, what are you going to do but bitch about it on the internet? Nothing.  Which country is receiving nuclear subs and tech from the other?? You guys aren’t even close to having our clout and influence where you can do things your own way and other countries respect it. So sorry but that’s the deal we were giving the rest of the world
>Then they haven’t thought about their position very deeply if they think there’s too much but have no idea how much is happening or what a reasonable amount is.

That's a laughable position to take.

> Instead of saying it’s unreasonable for discussions to happen 

Another thing I never said. You're tiring.

> going as far as to be in subs for other countries to take a note of how much they talk about America

And another. I don't need to deal with you, troll.

I've blocked this person for obvious reasons.
I don't get it, are you caught up in the same world that Americans are caught up in? Why do you care so much about how our media has ranked it for decades at this point? They are simply using the Associated Press ranking system. 

As for these politics and other insults, grow up! This is the Olympics, it is not this serious. I get it, you hate America and will look to any opportunity to insult it. You are completely incapable of being objective about anything related to the United States, you're practically frothing at the mouth here.
Only to an American…
As does “Intelligence Quotient” in the United States of America, apparently…
And that attitude is why there is so much animosity towards Americans. I am not saying it is good (it isn't). Most of the Yanks I have met have been great to hang out and work with, as usual, it is the minority that ruins it for the good majority. In my school, I work with quite a few American teachers (I am the only Aussie in an Canadian international school) and we get along great. 

 But I am not the only one who looks at the carrying ons in the USA and just can't understand the mentality over there. I certainly don't hate the US by any stretch of the imagination, I do hate the arrogance that seems to be so strong with so many people there. We can ALL learn something from the way other countries do it eg public transport is sooooooo shit in many places in Oz but is great in China which is the advantage of population numbers and Oz having so much area that is simply not inhabitable that severely restricts the population that can be sustained.
