Is there any games comparison website or app which compares the prices for games on jbhifi and ebgames?

i constantly have to check both and other websites to compare and find cheapest price

would really appreciate if someone is aware of such app/website and would like to share
Both stores price match so you may just ask for the cheaper price at the store
[Static Ice](https://www.staticice.com.au/) may be what you're looking for.
