Stolen chopper
Can't land there, mate.
At that time of the morning, the only choppers that are usually flying are Ambulance/Rescue or Police, and it wasn’t those. At 2.00am, it wasn’t tourists. There is a good chance you are right about it being stolen. There is an unconfirmed report that the chopper was seen flying very fast and erratically 5 mins earlier in the same area. I’d suggest a drugged up student pilot or kids joy riding. Maybe they’ve run out of Audis for kids to steal in Cairns?
Youth crime out of control
News reports are saying the helicopter pilot was killed.
Sounds like it could have been a Nautilus machine?
