Looks like dude across the street just wanted to get his car out to get the Aldi Saturday specials. 

(Btw cool vid - thanks for uploading)
Love the family out the front, great day for people watching, they should have brought out camp chairs.
And Barry thought he could pull a sickie and compete today without getting spotted, bad luck Bazza, sprung badly!
Had no idea they went so fast, how do they keep up that pace? Incredible athletes.
Is it just me or do they look like they are running away from something?
Cool race.
If I'd known they were going to speed it up, I would have walked.
can they atleast leave a lane open
There are 100k people running on those roads today. So no - they can't.
