Happy to have a couple of bush chooks (orange footed bush fowl) living in my huge backyard. 

But they are spending a lot of time on my roof because there is a tree shedding leaves on it. Funtimes for them to scrabble in 

It's a rental, and a great tree, so i don't want to cut it down. But i'm not sure about trimming it? Would that work?

Any suggestions? Is there a natural enemy i could make a scarecrow of?

I had cockatoos that were chewing the railings on my deck so I started giving them a bit of a blast with the hose.  It only took a couple of times and they stopped coming on to the deck.  Might be worth a try with the turkeys.

Hmmm i wonder if the leaf blower might work? Evil laugh but thank you!
Cheers, any excuse to get to bunnings this weekend!
