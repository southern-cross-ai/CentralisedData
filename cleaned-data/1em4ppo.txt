Can I have the B2 spirit come to our airshow please
It's just moving the chess pieces around, I wouldnt call cycling bombers from Guam a deterrent, if anything it's even further from where it needs to be.
Fear mongering? At this time of year? At this time of day? Located entirely within this publication?
If shit does hit the fan Oceania/ Pacific will be the front line.
Australia should stay neutral, like Singapore and other Asian states. The US wants to drag us into yet another unwinnable war, this time with our main trading partner. The cost will be catastrophic, both in lives and financially. Let's stick to our own hemisphere.
Damn, we seem determined to wage war with China. We only just stopped killing ppl in the middle east ffs, give it a rest
Ah, I've been waiting for this. The US has been telegraphing this for years.

Of course, by "escalatory behaviour" they mean that China has developed missiles that can destroy US airfields closer to China in Japan, Guam, Korea, Philippines, etc.
Its so funny how US gets to escalate conflicts and then pretend it was caused by their target
Not a problem for us.
Fucking sick of worrying about being dragged into Afghanistan 2 - Electric Boogaloo next time Northrop Grumman need to pump their share price.

There's only one safe future for this country: leave AUKUS, reinstate Australian Defense Force as the Australian Self-Defense Force which is constitutionally forbidden to operate overseas, divert military funding used for overseas deployments towards hardening domsetic defenses instead, achieve based isolationalist neutrality, every anti-USA terrorist group no longer wants to attack us for being friends with their enemy, no wuckas. 😎

Think about it: we're teamed up with the USA, because we need their protection, because some regimes would want us wiped off the earth, because we were teamed up with the USA when they sent soldiers to violate the modesty of their cultre by shaking down their households - do you see the circle?

INB4 *Chaynuh!* - Myanmar's a fuckload closer to china, and in a hell of a lot worse state than us right now, but still ain't become a Chinese province despite having no defence agreement with the USA. Frankly, if you believe China would want a crumb of Australian soil just cos they're up to some sus shit in the south china sea, then you basically believe the modern equivalent of that "forward defence" shit they used to justify Vietnam.
Australia loves to be a cuck, first Uk, now USA. I’m sure having bombers in Australia makes us safer not a future target 🤔
Please stop giving China more potential reasons to want to attack us. Thanks America, appreciate it
China hasn’t been in a war since the 70s. They are not the violent country. The one deploying the bombers is.
We better not be paying for this. Albanese is a sellout
No you bloody won’t
Guessing, they need to run engines and use fuel that would otherwise spoil, and Aus is an ok destination as we can't piss that high, we are already pretty flat, nor will they hear our joyful strains as we sing, because we're.. low to the ground without barely any hills even?
Good strategy. Carpet bomb Chongqing, Guangzhou and Shenzhen with incendiaries and that's all of Southern China out of the war.
Watching a B2 fly over the farm would be gorgeous
hopefully in a few years we'll have B-21's appearing at airshows

they're supposed to be building over 100 of them
I’d like to see the new one too.
That would be sweet, but I'd rather have a B1 on full afterburner.
Take a small detour to Indonesia airshow too please
Guam will be smoked pearl harbour style in a Taiwan war. So to complicate Chinese war plans, we have decided to accomodate US bombers in our airbases. This means 2 things. Firstly, it gives the Americans a faster response time to launch a retaliatory strike, rather than launching it from mainland America, which is almost double the distance to the South China Sea, or Hawaii, which is an extra 1000km further than Darwin is. Secondly, the only Chinese missiles that can reach us from mainland China, is nuclear ones (for now anyway). This means that Chinas only option to take out these bases is by launching nuclear weapons, which they obviously will not do. So now the for the Chinese to stop an American counter attack, they will have to spend time developing a long range conventional ICBM to hit Australia and take out our airbases. This will take years to develop and forces the Chinese to postpone their invasion. It’s all about strategic messaging here and making the Chinese plan to invade Taiwan as complicated as possible, and hopefully as time goes on and the western allies power grows in the pacific through things like AUKUS, we will complicate their plans so much that they simply never attempt the invasion in the first place.
Guam is likely to be hit with first strike to isolate Taiwan as invasion begins same for forces in Japan.  Spreading them out and around a bit  helps counter this.
Yes.
It’s not fear mongering, china is getting ready to invade Taiwan. The US  does plenty of stupid things but this is not one of them.
Nothing ever happens
Pacific front, when the pacific became the center of all hope. Starring Rob Schneider. Coming to a theatre near you
That’s fine to want Australia to be neutral, but would you also support the accompanying defence policies that would have to follow so that Australia’s national security is still guaranteed? For example Singapore has introduced conscription, we would have to do the same. Massively expanding the ADF to give ourselves the strategic reserves we need to defend ourselves with no backup. And considering we are an island nation, we cannot rely on the imports of foreign weapons. This means way more money needs to be spent on weapons RnD and manufacture. Because Australia is no longer under the protection of the US nuclear umbrella, we would also have to pursue our own nuclear weapons. All this would cost an exorbitant amount of money. Expect the defence budget to spike up to 8% of GDP immediately, although it would drop back down to something like 5% over time.
It isn't a choice between being impacted by what happens in the Taiwan strait or not. It's a choice between doing something about it or freeloading and hoping for the best. 

Deterrence makes conflict less likely, cowardice makes it more likely.
And then who will help us when we need it?
Maybe China should pull its head in then? 

If China was approaching on Australia you’d be fine with allies saying “ehhh nah fuck em not our problem it’s in their country! We want to make money from China!”?
Australia is not 'on the front line' against China.

Australia is not facing invasion by China.

China is 7000km away from Australia, far beyond PNG, Indonesia and the Philippines.

Beijing is closer to Berlin than it is to Sydney.

War with is not inevitable, it is avoidable.

Does anyone seriously envisage a scenario in which a post-war China would be contained and subject to regime change, with the US being the dominant economic and military power in East Asia?
Singapore has more soilders in Australia than Australia does. Plus I’d rather die on my feet against tyranny than live on my knees like a cuck
Stopped? 

We stopped? When?
War machine go brrrrr
People are still dying in the middle east and Australia is still supporting it. 
No, I think they're more talking about behaviour like the artificial island military facilities that the Chinese keep building in the SCS to restrict navigation, the frequent violation of territorial waters of countries like the ones you've listed as well as their habit of showing extreme hostility towards the coast guards and navies of said countries when they try and intervene.

It wasn't that long ago [when a Chinese warship deliberately used active sonar near one of our frigates that was on a UN mission to enforce sanctions against North Korea while our ship had divers in the water.](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-11-18/naval-chinese-warship-injury/103121900)

China has given the United States more than enough excuses to do this.

But yeah sure all these nations don't have any cultural, political, or historical understanding of China. China is completely innocent.
Exactly how is the US escalating China?

Making them to build islands and claim more of the ocean? And forcing them to consider taking Taiwan?
I wonder if you’ll remember commenting this when china invades Taiwan?
Plenty of people in the US have stated that they will do anything to keep China down and maintain US hegemony. China is being aggressive by doing military drills, but the US is the nation of peace by its multiple invasions, military actions, and support of Israeli occupation.

China is the enemy now, in a couple years, we will have the same stories about an aggressive India.
discourse power/ media power or hegemony. How many people know Chinese/Spanish/French? How many people receive information directly from China? Almost all of our information is monopolized by the media. This is the hegemony of the media. Social media has eased the voice of the United States to some extent, just like we can learn more about Israel and Palestine from social media. This is also why TikTok must be banned, just for monopolizing discourse power.
So if we leave AUKUS, these aggressive regimes would just decide not to invade us for our wealth of minerals & resources and land and agriculture? They would probably find it too hard to find an entry point in our 25,000km of coastline anyhow and give up as soon as they saw an Australian naval patrol boat.   
Besides, if did actually attempt an invasion, they know we would be backed up by our mates from New Zealand and possibly Vanuatu so they know we’re stacked.
Are you even aware of why the US invaded Afghanistan in the first place?
China is backing and arming the Myanmar Junta.
I'm bot even sure why your getting down voted. We had a few cool years as a regional power in between being Britain and now the US' regional bitch
jesus fucking christ, read the fucking article.
You talk about bombing a major city in a country that has nuclear weapons? ? ?

China now has 500 nuclear missiles, and one DF-41 can simultaneously destroy more than ten cities 12,000 kilometers away
How's the serenity?
It also adds to the escalatory risk factor for China, attacking two sovereign nations as well as Taiwan if it happens.
May you give me a reason?
How is China any more likely to invade Taiwan than they were 4 years ago? 

Genuinely asking
In other news, "Old Man Yells At Cloud"
/automatic-radish1553

How many Australians do you think should die to defend Taiwan from China? 

How many of those would be relatives or children of yours?

At what stage do you think conscription should be introduced, because the Chinese defence forces number than 2 million, whereas ours is circa 50,000 - so we will clearly need more. Plus, they have nuclear bombs, and we don't. Should we get some nuclear weapons, because fighting a war we plan on losing seems like a bad idea - we should be preparing to win it, don't you think?
How are they getting ready to do this exactly?
You send your children to die for taiwan and Ukraine
That’s kind of the point; hopefully you do such a large and military buildup that people think it’d be stupid for them to try.

>Does anyone seriously envisage a scenario in which a post-war China would be contained and subject to regime change, with the US being the dominant economic and military power in East Asia?

Yes? Post-war China would be crushed.
The 17-nation coalition formed in 1950 failed to defeat the Chinese army on the Korean Peninsula.

At that time, the PRC was only a year old. It had no aircraft, no tanks, and no intercontinental missiles. Let alone defeat the current China.
I'll die on this hill with you. Australia should be neutral. 

The ADF should be restructured towards primarily A2AD with a secondary capacity to help out in the south pacific with humanitarian and peacekeeping missions. 

We need a defensive pact with Indonesia and we need to do a lot more to help the small island nations of Oceania to avoid them becoming staging grounds for China or anybody else.
Most of australia is already content with the latter
Yeah unfortunately Canberra’s probably more of a threat than China in that regard.

He’ll be clapping.
I ll be reminding people that US was very happy with the china situation until it decided they benefit from having a beef with them and Taiwan suddenly became a popular issue, nobody cared about it until the US propaganda machine started its anti-china rhetoric.

So yeah, US once again escalated.

  
But i dont mind, im a permanent resident, if there's a draft you go throw away your life for the US shareholders xD
India's currently ruled by a fascist autocrat. China the same. It's not that hard to spot evil.
They don't need to invade us. They just buy it. We're practically giving our resources away.
Coersion and market manipulation.
People who think that China is going to invade us for our resources are absolutely insane.

China is over 4,000km away from Australia over ocean, and even then you don't get to the population centres. An amphibious assault is incredibly hard, and one of the reasons China would have issues with Taiwan. Attacking Australia over that vast distance and maintaining logistics supply that would constantly be unnecessarily costly.
I'd like to think that you're joking but you probably are serious. Seriously wrong and deluded.

China has never ever once threatened Australia with military force. They have made ZERO additional extra-territorial claims that they didn't make in the 1950s. They do not and have never demonstrated any desire to invade ANYWHERE outside of a very well defined sphere close to home.

Beyond that, China cannot now and cannot in the foreseeable future invade Taiwan successfully, let alone a country many thousands of kilometres away. This is just literally impossible. The only people who pretend to believe that are the exact same people who want to sell us obsolete ships and armaments.
There wont be any minerals left for China to "steal" at the rate settler-colonial government are ploughing through the land.
So what are these aggressive regimes and how big are their armies exactly?

Would they be able to grow their population and thereby armies faster than us if we solved the housing crisis instantly by actually building a meaningful quantity of public housing and ending negative gearing, allowing young families to afford to have children and immigrants to come in with no ill-effects?

Greater military deployment in taiwan straits, increased military exercises, increased frequency of violating Taiwan's sovereign air / sea space, specific language from leadership talking about reunification.
Because Xi has ordered his military to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027.
China has a mock Taiwan building that they practice to attack.
They salami slicing their movements slowly but surely are testing Taiwan with very close fly overs.
Same with the Philippine region, they are getting bolder and bolder. 
It is not just If, it is when.
It will be s potential Russia Ukraine scenario with the addition of Japan, Phillipines, (Vietnam?). US and other western allies.
1. Enhanced military capabilities 

Significant enhancement and expansion of the PLA & PLAN including an increased frequency of large scale invasion rehearsals and planning for amphibious assaults. 

2. Taiwans political dynamics

Taiwans democracy can be seen to have been strengthened under the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party. This intensifies Beijings resolve to assert control of the island as it makes China’s regional influence look weak as piss.

3. Geopolitics

The strategic rivalry between China and the US has heightened and the US has made its intentions to defend Taiwan from invasion clear. This has lead to a more aggressive and confrontational stance form China as it views unification with Taiwan as central to its national rejuvenation and long term goals

All three of these have been ramping up way harder over the last 4 years.
It’s what xi has stated, china aims to reunify Taiwan by 2027. Due to the fact the majority of Taiwanese want sovereignty, the only way china can “reunify“ Taiwan is with an invading force.
Not for nothing because a bunch of posters have been commenting on what they’ve directly done but china are notorious for boiling the frog so to speak. 

The one china policy is still very much doctrine and they have been ratcheting it up regarding Taiwan ever since they revassalised Hong Kong
Waiting until the Olympics is over
You are asking a loaded question here. A more appropriate question would be “how many casualties would be acceptable for Australia to sustain in a conflict over Taiwan?” Clearly a successful Chinese invasion would not be in the interests of Australia, and therefore we would commit resources and personnel to stall or halt that invasion. The question then is how much.
So what’s your point ? Should we just roll over and let china invade whoever they want? 
This article is about America increasing its military presence within Australia. The idea is to make it less likely for china to invade Taiwan by increasing the negative consequences on china if they do invade.

If we sit idly by why china invades other countries, future generations will suffer greatly. 

I agree australia needs access to nuclear weapons to defend ourselves and our allies. And I’d argue that is a good reason for keeping America a close ally as they currently have much more nukes and a much stronger army than china.
It’s part of chinas publicly stated goals within the 2027 plan. 

As the majority of Taiwanese do not want to give up sovereignty it seems likely china will try to invade some time before 2027.
Thanks, Xi bot.
Ooh found a propaganda bot in the wild!
The nine-dash line was inherited from the 11-dash line of \[Republic of China\] 1947.



The Republic of China moved to Taiwan after 1949, and Taiwan still controls the largest island in the South China Sea: \[Taiping Island\]

Warmongers accuse anyone who opposes war as a China shill. I’m summarizing the points from that well known China shill Kevin Rudd, our former PM and current ambassador to the US - the [Avoidable War](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Avoidable_War): you should read it.
+ nonaggression pact with China. None of these things are worth the paper they’re printed on when weighed against national interests, but like AUKUS, a useful symbol.
🤣
Yeah and the common thread is China. 


Go to Vietnam and see if the average person on the street is worried about being invaded by America more than China. They're not. They fought America for 10 years, the French for 50 years before that. But everyone in that region has fought China for thousands of years and they know that the easiest way to avoid that again is to have a few American ships in the harbour.
It's not the same, the local citizens don't get raped by deployed soldiers on the Chinese islands. 
You mean the same nations (Taiwan, South Korea, Indonesia) that only allowed democracy after they finished murdering the last civilians who supported communism?
So you think it’s ok for china to invade Taiwan ?  I’m curious where did you immigrate from?
The US position on Taiwan has been to promote its independence since the Chinese Civil War though.
Not just resources. Farming and dairy businesses have been bought up en masse by Chinese companies.
> China has never ever once threatened Australia with military force. 

That is because they are not in a position to do so. If China succeeds with Taiwan and beats the Americans out of the pacific, then in 50 or so years time they may decide that they can. 

> They have made ZERO additional extra-territorial claims that they didn’t make in the 1950s. 

China had shown interest in dominating the pacific out to the third island chain. That’s PNG by the way. We cannot allow that to happen. 

> They do not and have never demonstrated any desire to invade ANYWHERE outside of a very well defined sphere close to home.

Let’s not minimise what the Chinese want to do here. 

> Beyond that, China cannot now and cannot in the foreseeable future invade Taiwan successfully, 

Impossible to know this as fact. The Chinese are clearly preparing to at least attempt an invasion. We have to attempt to stop them.
You’re kidding right ? 
The aggressive regime is China and they have 2 million active soldiers. That’s twice the size of the US military by headcount.
No
Well meatbot5000 you are an odd fellow but you do make a good shitpost.
You forgot a nosediving birth rate since the 70's meaning their highest quantity of available soldiers / conscripts is right now.

>“how many casualties would be acceptable for Australia to sustain in a conflict over Taiwan?” 

How many do you think? Because that's what I asked you? Ten? A hundred? A thousand? A million?

>Clearly a successful Chinese invasion would not be in the interests of Australia,

Because what? Can you explain to me how that would impact my trip to work in the morning, or the flowers in my back garden, or my local school, or hospital? I like going camping - how would that affect my camping trips? Do you hear noises in the dark outside of your window at night, and think it's the shadow man coming to get you - when it's actually just the wind in the leaves outside of your window? Tell me anything in practical terms of your daily life how you would be worse off - countries are invaded all the time, and Australia is just too small to be the world's policeman - that's just a ridiculous concept to believe. Are you being serious in thinking that Australia should be the world's policeman - because that's a full time job - to fund this dream of yours, all the schools would have to close, all the hospitals would have to be shut, there would be no social security, pension or unemployment benefits. 

>and therefore

What? Did you know that there is a blue teapot orbiting between Saturn and Jupiter, "and therefore" there must be a more advanced civilization somewhere in our solar system? Is "and therefore" really your level of deductive reasoning, or are you just pulling my leg?

>The question then is how much.

You just claimed that when I asked that question, it was a "loaded question", and your strategy is now to ask the same question? Incredible.

You haven't answered a single issue that I raised, have you - you are not interested in having a discussion. You just have some ideology, and want to get it off your chest for some reason. 

Can you name a single country that China has invaded in your lifetime? In your parents lifetime? In your grandparents lifetime? Just one will be fine. The USA doesn't even have an embassy in Taiwan, because the USA actually considers Taiwan part of mainland China - look it up if you don't believe me. Did you know that Taiwan is not a member of the UN - because the USA won't allow Taiwan a seat in the UN for the same reason - it's part of China - look it up. The USA officially recognised Taiwan as part of China back in circa 1947 when some unhappy Chinese General Chang Kai Shek robbed the Chinese central bank of all it's gold and fled to Taiwan in circa 1946 with it - look it up if you don't believe me.

Here is a list of countries that the USA has invaded / bombed / overthrown:

/automatic-radish1553

>I agree australia needs access to nuclear weapons to defend ourselves

Would your strategy be to wait until they strike us first, or would you launch a pre-emptive strike, like George Bush and John Howard did with Iraq?

Then, what's your suggestion for which cities in China would you use nuclear bombs on - I guess you would go for the big ones first, like: Chongqing (31 million), Shanghai (24 million), Beijing (21 million), Chengdu (21 million) and Guangzhou (18 million). 

Do you think more than 5 nuclear weapons for our arsenal would be sufficient to deter China from invading Taiwan? Or, would we need more?

In return, I guess they would target Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Adelaide and pine gap. Do you live in one of those cities?

What's your plan for the remaining 1.3 billion Chinese? 

Presumably there will be some Australians left to continue your fight, once our mayor cities are gone - what's your estimate on the minimum number of people we would need remaining after the first strike to continue the fight?

>future generations will suffer greatly. 

Your right - we can't afford to ruin the place, can we. Where would these future generations live after we have "protected" them - do you think they could return to those capital cities to live, once the radiation levels have returned to safe levels? When do you think that would be?


>Should we just roll over and let china invade whoever they want?

All these questions - I'm looking forward to your answers. I'm so glad to have someone knowledgeable about defence matters in this thread.

And - have to you ever considered the possibility that when you hear a noise outside your bedroom window at nighttime, that rather than it being the shadow man come to get you, it could just be the wind blowing in the leaves of the tree outside?

Also - are you a baby boomer?
You've got such a strong opinion, but have you read even one book about China?
you going to be on the frontlines white boy?  i hope so

> I agree australia needs access to nuclear weapons to defend ourselves and our allies

you going to nuke china white boy?  will that make your life less pointless and you less small?
They publicly stated they want to invade Taiwan by 2027? You have a source for that surely?
Where is a source where it's China saying "publicly stated goals within the 2027 plan" because all I can find is a US admiral, and a US CIA director saying they heard it, and then the U.S. Secretary of State repeating what the CIA said.
Instead of just deflecting

explain why we should go to war after what happened in our adventures in the middle east because america told us to?
I was just poking at the conspiracy malarky.

But all things considered, the main dispute is localised to the nine dash line.

Protagonists are all with in Australian economic / influence areas.
It's no longer an avoidable war. China's out for blood. Xi has pushed ultranationalism too far. Why do we have to capitulate to them? It's China that's harrassing other nations in SEA and using intimidation tactics and economic threats. They need to fuck off.

You have a clear bias to China, I don't know who you're fooling.
Veitnam was already bombed into oblivion by America, for no reason at all. 
Because those islands are completely artificial constructions built by China in a vain attempt to reinforce illegitimate territorial claims and the only occupants are uniformed PLA personnel.

Though honestly, we should be thankful for that considering China's treatment of minority groups.

Run along, Sino shill, you're not going to fool anyone here.
The critical difference here is that the US acknowledges that molesting the locals is a bad thing. Sometimes they'll even do something about it. In contrast, China unironically believes the entire SCS is their sovereign territory.
It's funny how half-Asians like you think that if you shill hard for the CCP they'll embrace you as one of their own. They hate you, you're a traitor after all.
China and Taiwan are in a civil war and have been since WW2 (actually before kind of), why do we need to get involved in someone else's domestic dispute?
Be scared of the boogie monster, made up to sell weapons. China, who very much knows what they want, and lets everyone know what they want, haven't threatened us ever. 

Our "friends" have launched countless wars of aggression, dragging us in completely unnecessarily many times, so some of our dumbest citizens can commit war crimes, and we can become targets of asymmetric attacks (Bali bombings). But we're supposed to be scared of our biggest trading partner?
I simply don't believe China would annex Australia if they had the opportunity. I have not yet heard a truly convincing, fact-based argument that this would be the case.
Because China has such a rich history of overseas invasions...
I'm not bothered if your opinion on the matter differs from mine, just understand I'm not making shit up, here.

MEATBOT THE AIRFIELDS ON FIRE!
so when they dont invade what are you going to do
The West could probably stop the invasion by offering asylum to any PLA soldier who politically objects to the invasion. Even with the deep internet censorship in China, most young Chinese know how to bypass these controls. They certainly know about the horrors in the Ukraine war. When everyone has money and a full belly dying for a pointless war would  not be something most young Chinese today would not want to entertain. However if the economy runs into the ground in China these attitudes might change.
Yes, but it is still plausible because the CCP is actively working towards that goal. If we sit on our hands then the likelihood of an invasion is much higher.
I have done a bunch of research over the years. 
I’m curious what books you would recommend?  

Im trying to understand the issue from different perspectives as much as I can. I obviously tend to side with Taiwanese/ western options however I wasn’t initially favouring the western / American narrative until I looked into it.
If we go to war more then likely yes I will. Nukes should be a last resort they are disgusting weapons. 

Whats up with the white boy comments ? 
😂
Them talking about the politics around this should not prompt a deranged "R U Gonna FiGhT?.

Also, why are you calling people "white boy"?

Racist af.
That is wrong. 2027 comes from US intelligence quoting an alleged Xi speech that they haven't released details about.
Because it's fun!
I mean, there was a whole South Vietnam that didn't want to be communist, that wasn't a terrible reason. Go ahead and ask your local Vietnamese family who immigrated here as refugees in the 70s and 80s why they left Vietnam after the war, it's because Ho Chi Minh and his friends didn't exactly make living in Southern Vietnam as pleasant as it is today.


But there's not much ill will towards Americans (or Australians, yeah we participated) today, the same can't be said for China.
Because Taiwan is our ally, Taiwan is a democracy, and china has no right to just invade and conquer Taiwan. 
Our nation was founded by a shameful invasion by the British empire, Australians should understand more than any other nation that this must never happen again.
So when Japan DOUBLES its defence budget, and changes its constitution to rearm due to Chinese aggression, and the Phillipines allows 4 new American bases to be constructed after kicking out the Americans in the 90s, that’s all just made up? When Xi ordered his military to be ready to take Taiwan by force by 2027, that’s just made up? And if China manages to take Taiwan, they will capture the majority of the world’s advanced computer chip manufacturing, that’s just made up? If the Chinese beat the Americans out of the pacific, Australia will probably loose the protection of its biggest ally for the last 70 years, therefore requiring us to massively increase defence spending to guarantee our own national security, is that just made up as well? get your head out of your arse mate. China invading Taiwan is not in Australia’s interests and we need to act to deter them from ever attempting.
Well Australia has 57,000 strong active military so China could easily just throw 800,000 military personnel at a wall and still have a very good shot at it.  If it’s a war of attrition they would win. 

That said I don’t think a direct invasion of Australia in the short term is what they have in mind, it would be more of a situation where they take control of resources and agriculture and foster a favourable puppet government similar to what they are trying to do in the pacific islands and more in line with what was tried by Imperial Japan or the British Empire. 

But if the USA is removed from Asia there is really no stopping China from doing anything because like I said , 57,000 strong military v 2m. Once we lose air superiority it would be one and done.  It would be foolish not to consider the possibility as long as Xi is in power.
Tibet, Xinjiang….. shall I go on? and now cruising the South China Sea, Taiwan and pacific islands as we speak?
I’m confused as to what you are trying to say here. Are you suggesting that the Americans invaded Afghanistan because the CIA armed the muhajadeen during the Soviet-Afghan war?
No mother, that's just the APS returning to office work.
They would be happy about that.

Don't act in bad faith.
China has nuclear weapons, nuclear submarines, and intercontinental nuclear missiles
If you don’t want to believe what the US says I can understand but there is a bunch of evidence china is preparing to attack. 
For example china has built multiple full scale mock ups of Taiwan’s presidential office used for military training. What reason would china have to do that? 

Listen to what xi says "The reunification of the motherland is a historical inevitability "

China will invade Taiwan it’s just a question of when.
US “intelligence” lead us into war in Iraq and Afghanistan. I’ll take what they say about an alleged Xi speech with a huge helping of salt.
Relax, China and Taiwan will never be reunited by force. Anti-ship missiles are currently far too good. Have you seen what happened to the Russian Black Sea fleet? 

The USA couldn't launch a naval invasion of any serious country these days. China is well behind them. 

And again, China has made zero new threats to anyone in seventy years. They're not like the Americans, they don't think they have a right to invade wherever the fuck they want.
Maybe then we'd finally get some serviceable bloody public transport, proper rail lines, and some appropriately aggressive public housing public housing policy 'round here.

We could easily be doing as well as China, and even be competitive against them on our own, but we choose not to innovate or build for the long-term.
Tibet, a bordering country. Xinjiang, a bordering country.   Who has China gone to war with let alone invaded in the south China sea?  And china certainly hasnt invaded taiwan, and frankly the only reason the country exists is due to American fuckery. 

In the entirety of china's history I struggle to recall an event where China boarded it's ships and went an invaded some random country it didn't share a border with. Meanwhile that's just a Tuesday for the country that we have allowed ourself to be vassalised by.
Tibet and Xinjiang have been part of Chinese territory longer than the founding of the United States.



In 1912, the newly established Chinese government inherited \[the land of Tibet and Xinjiang\] with a formal document, which was the \[Edict of the Qing Emperor's Abdication\], which clearly handed over \[the ownership of five pieces of land including Tibet and Xinjiang\] to the newly established Chinese government.

(This Chinese government refers to the Republic of China, which had not yet moved to Taiwan at that time)
As British foreign secretary Robin Cook put it, bin Laden and al-Qaeda were "a product of a monumental miscalculation by western security agencies".

Now, who were the perpetrators of 9/11?
Not sure why you have been downvoted as this is worth mentioning. I would argue if Australia had nukes china or anyone else for that matter would be less likely to strike Australia.
American intelligence also warned of Russia invading Ukraine days before it happened. Nobody took us seriously, everyone said we were being hysterical. 

Maybe, just maybe, we *are* worth listening to.
Iraq maybe, but Afganistan? No, Afghanistan was invaded to kill the man responsible for 9/11. Which took 10 years.
> Relax, China and Taiwan will never be reunited by force. Anti-ship missiles are currently far too good. Have you seen what happened to the Russian Black Sea fleet?

The Black Sea fleet is mostly old Soviet warships, and they were destroyed with the help of western intelligence no doubt. Obviously there are huge differences between what would happen in Taiwan and what happened in the Black Sea. The main one being that the numbers are astronomically different. As well as Taiwan being an island nation, so no land bridges to quickly transfer western weapons. 


> The USA couldn’t launch a naval invasion of any serious country these days. China is well behind them.

False, please explain why the US cannot launch a naval invasion. 

> And again, China has made zero new threats to anyone in seventy years. 

Wrong, Xi has threatened invasion of Taiwan, threatened the Phillipines, they have even threatened Australia!. 

> They’re not like the Americans, they don’t think they have a right to invade wherever the fuck they want.

Ok but it China does invade Taiwan, and the succeed. And then people on reddit get angry because they “don’t have the right!!”. That does nothing for the situation. Taiwan is still in Chinese hands. It’s a waste of time arguing about who is morally superior or who has the right to do what.
China has a pool of over 1bn people to pull from. No wonder they are progressing their infrastructure. They want to be at the forefront of world order and are positioning themselves to challenge the US. That's not something that is beneficial for Australia at all.
Well it only took 80 years to agree on the site of the second Sydney airport so I would say yes, it is more likely that China will invade than Australia building a high speed rail 😂
Forget it, they've got no interest in real world facts, they've fallen for propaganda or are invested in selling the propaganda (and associated armaments) themselves.
This isn’t true.

The first time Tibet ever became a “part” of China was in 1950.

The ROC had no rights to Tibet as Tibet was a *vassal* under the Qing. The Qing who were Manchus and not Chinese purposely kept and administered Tibet separately from China. As the relationship with the Manchus was over, Tibet could do as it wanted.
Actual wumao lmao. It's going to be so satisfying seeing the Western coalition hunt you fucks down.
I’m still not seeing the connection here. So the Americans armed the muhajadeen to fight the Soviets, in which bin laden was supporting from Pakistan. And then 8 years after the war ended with the Soviets, Bin Laden then attacks the US?That justifies the American invasion even more. This guy kills the civilians of the country that was helping defend Afghanistan less than a decade before, primarily because he was an Islamic extremist and wanted to establish a global caliphate. To be totally clear here, the US invaded Afghanistan to kill the man who attacked and killed 3000 US civilians in New York. That took over 10 years to find and kill him by the way.
My point is clear, there are no winners in a nuclear war
No, you aren't worth listening to. 








For every one where you are right, there are thousands where you are wrong, and the aggressor.









I haven't trusted US since the Nayirah testimony. And after learning about Operation Condor, and other neocolonial attrocities I don't believe the US has good intentions, anywhere.
Ever hear the story of the boy who cried wolf?
maybe china isn't russia

maybe you should have thoughts of your own or at least attempt it
The man the CIA put into that position in the first place? That man?
>As well as Taiwan being an island nation, so no land bridges to quickly transfer western weapons. 

In addition to that, can also easily deprive taiwan of the type of intelligence Ukraine has benefited from.  Even if they don't hit the US/Japan, between cutting taiwanese fibreoptic cables, incessant jamming, and destruction of command and control, they just like aren't going to be able to recieve data or employ force that well.  Will probably rapidly turn into a houthi type situation where they are just blindly flinging missiles with almost zero coordination at all and praying they can hit something.

This is a historical document, you can't deny it.

Unless you travel through time and modify history

Imperial\_Edict\_of\_the\_Abdication\_of\_the\_Qing\_Emperor

\[Edict of the Qing Emperor to abdicate\]:



Yuan Shikai, having been formerly elected [Prime Minister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_Imperial_Cabinet) by the [Advisory Council](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advisory_Council_(Qing_dynasty)), now standing at this juncture marking the transition to the new Government from the old, has himself devised a plan for unifying the South with the North. May Yuan Shikai organize with full powers a [provisional republican Government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provisional_Government_of_the_Republic_of_China_(1912)) and confer with the people's army as to the methods of procedure for the Union, such that peace may be assured and restored to the people and country, all while retaining the complete territorial integrity of the lands of the [five races](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Races_Under_One_Union)—Manchu, Han, [Mongol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongols), [Hui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hui_people), and [Tibetan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tibetan_people)—which shall combine to form a great Republic of China. I, together with the Emperor, may retire into a leisured life and spend our years pleasantly, enjoying the courteous treatment from the citizens, and witnessing with our own eyes the realization of great governance. Would this not be a grand feat? End of Decree.

\[The Qing Emperor’s edict to abdicate\] slaps you directly in the face

Western coalition lol








Colonies, regurgitating seppo propaganda, ready to be their simps? Some "coalition" you guys have created.
I definitely agree with you there. A nuclear exchange would be terrible for everyone which is why it’s a good deterrent, as messed up as it sounds…
Condor ended 40 years ago. Powell lying about WMDs in Iraq was over 20 years ago, and nobody who was involved in either is involved in American politics today. I wish they had been held accountable too, but we all know that doesn’t happen to powerful people no matter the country. Maybe one day that will change, but not these times. 

Time to let it go, and move on.
Maybe China invading Taiwan is a threat to be taken seriously. Just a thought.
So the Americans helped the Afghanis repel a Soviet invasion, in which Bin laden supported from Pakistan and then 10 years later this guy turns around and flies 2 airliners into the World Trade Centre. The CIA didn’t need to put Bin Laden into any position because he was already the son of a Saudi billionaire. But even if you believe the conspiracy theories, Bin Laden turned on the Americans after they armed Afghanistan. Any rational person wouldn’t do that, but Bin laden was an Islamic extremists.
Did you not read what I wrote above? 

The Qing couldn’t just hand over Tibet to the ROC as Tibet was a *vassal* under the Qing.
The "communist" PRC inheriting the imperial territories of an empire just goes to show how not-communist it is. In a modern world of anti-imperialism, China needs to relinquish it's vassals if it wants to be seen as a real good-faith partner to the global south.
