did she get to WFH?
My wife became a sex worker and also found it very empowering. She had good and bad experiences but overall the good outweighed the bad. She was fortunate to have not only her husband for emotional support but a couple of close friends who were also sex workers wished could lean on when she needed it. Other women she worked with didn't have that support and they had many more struggles. Not only did they have to deal with any negative consequences at work without support, but they had to hide their work from those close to them. It was evident that the secrecy/shaming/isolation takes a bigger toll than anything that happens at work.
Asking the real questions bro
