I don't think its just them.
"Don't vote for so and so, its just a vote for blah blah blah..!"

No, actually, you get to choose where your preferences go. You just need to do it.
Neither do most born here Australians!
This [Chicken nation comic ](https://www.chickennation.com/voting/) by Patrick Alexander is probably the best explanation on how voting works in this country than all the years of primary schooling ever could.
Mate, half of Australia’s voters don’t fully understand the political system. 

School barely scratches the surface, then you’ve gotta just wing it when you turn 18, you’re in your uni/party years and you just turn up to vote with the fear of a $20 fine bankrupting you if you don’t.
Yeah no sh*t , ppl born here dont fully understand it themselves.
There are people running for office who don't understand it either! And some who have won!
This isn't an migrant issue, most people don't understand our preferential voting system NOR our preferential PR-ish senate. I definitely wasn't taught this at school and happen to watch a CGP Grey video on how it works before I turned 18. If it wasn't for that, I wouldn't really know neither. 

I don't understand why there isn't ANY easy to digest explanation of this, our best one is that comic strip.
Most Australians know next to nothing about politics and many younger one's know more about American politics than they do about their own countries politics. Most are single issue voters and couldn't tell you what the relevants parties policies are.
Most Aussie’s don’t either. So it’s no wonder the referendum failed - I’d suggest more than half the population has no idea what the Constitution is.
No shit. If not for my primary school having a school parliament on a fortnightly basis, most of my peers and I might not care about its significance or have an interest in it at all. 

Side note: School parliament was awesome.
This is exactly what certain political parties want. It helps them get votes without you voting for them
Many Australians don’t too.
Vote for the least dodgy person!
I teach high schoolers. None of them do either.
The AEC really needs to come down hard on anyone attempting to use their imagery to mislead voters. Hell, I'd be all for getting rid of those damned How To Vote cards altogether.
I've heard many born and raised here say, 'I vote for X, because my family has always voted for X'. It's not like picking a football team.
Most born and bred Australians don't understand the Australian political system. Very little education around it.
Labor bad for economy, Liberal good for economy and will tax poor people.

Oh, and both parties hate boat people.

Did I get that right?
Survey would also find many citizens don't grasp the difference between state and federal or the division of responsibilities.

Federal highway, state government roads and council roads etc.
Now do born and bred Aussies.
Who would have possibly thought that cramming hundreds of thousands of migrants into a country without proper civics education would have this effect. I’m shocked, I tell you. Shocked!
Recent arrivals? Conversations with people in their 50s who've lived here all their lives around the Voice referendum made it crystal clear none of them had a clue how it all works. 
We've gotten fairly bad at on-boarding new arrivles
I've had a few people ask me how it works over the years. This helpful guide always works best (seriously)

Brisbane Council election proved that voters do not understand optional preferential voting and waste their vote. Hence the same conservative council for 20 years.
Lol nearly every comment in here being a supercilious boofhead about “aussies don’t know either!”

The insecure paranoid self-hate is palpable...
Yes, Australia is complex. Stand in line at a school every three years to vote for red or blue cunts. In order to govern ourselves, we need more government programs. 

  
WeChat is full of Vote No ads because they care about indigenous issues.  They imprisoned 2 million Uyghurs and interfered with Taiwan, Tibet, and North Korea because they have a perfect democracy and know better.
Lol...How much did this ridiculous research cost?? I could of told them that for free. This is nothing new. My family came out in the mass migration boom in the 1950s. That whole generation of migrants are all practically no longer on this earth and I'm pretty sure the majority of them died not understanding how our political system worked. 

To be fair, I'm born here and I'm also certain a lot of people born here and who have had the opportunity to go to school  here, still don't understand our political system. I don't just think it's a migrant thing...
Two prty system, nothing else matters
They download it into our brains via 5G at birth. I feel privileged too.
I just had an argument with a guy who thinks our preference votes are chosen by the parties, and that the numbers he writes after 1 are meaningless.
There’s a reason “how to vote for [party]” cards get handed out in such large numbers on Election Day.
What do you mean, you get told by one guy on a whiteboard on your trip to Canberra in year 6. What more do you need?
If anything it's proof immigrants are integrating into Australian culture very well
I had to explain to my own mum how preferential voting works.
So true . My local friend doesn’t know the difference between federal and state government .
Go to any thread where a referendum is mentioned lol.
Yeah. No big conspiracy. The so-called "two-party system" that these idiots rant about is because most of them choose to vote above the line for Labor or Liberal. There is no great conspiracy theory.
Huh. I know how the system works, and still thought that was great. I can definitely see that being easier for the lowest common denominator to grasp than the typical how to vote bollocks.

  
Scary that I can't vote but know more about the bloody process than some people who are fined for not voting.
That was great thank you. Will definitely be sharing it in the future if the opportunity comes up.
We had mock elections and everything in school to teach it, this is like 25 years ago.

Every time i hear someone school doesn't cover something i always wonder if it is just people didn't listen so they assume it never got taught.
It's in the school system, it's just that:

1. Kids disengage hard in that subject, they don't think it's important.
2. It stops at Y10, which isn't great, as it gives them two years to forget most of it in the lead up to voting.
I rocked up when I was 18 for the freedom sausage, great for the voting day hangover!
Also the fear of bankruptcy 😞
It's nothing new. Back in the day then Queensland Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen cheerfully admitted not having a clue what the separation of powers doctrine meant.
> So it’s no wonder the referendum failed 

I mean referendums have a 75% failure rate full stop.
For a referendum to get up a majority of states must vote Yes and an overall vote must be Yes.

3 states voting No would have killed it. All states voted No. Here are the 3 most No states.

WA=64%, QLD=68% and SA=64%. That's 2 out of every 3 people in each state voting No.

The overall total for No was 60%

It was not a close run thing by either metric. By comparison the republic vote was 54% No, which also wasn't regarded as a close run thing (as no states voted Yes).

Possibly the Australian population increasing 25% in 20 years might explain something, but they'd probably be even more likely to vote No regardless due to lack of familiarity with the issue, or historical stake in it.

I'd almost say it's the other way - people who are unfamiliar with the system do not appreciate how *not at all close* the referendum was.
Half of Australia is functionally illiterate, so yeah...
That's the thing that gives us freedom of speech right?

/s
Which one?
I moved here when I was 16, and I know that’s a bit late-ish (I pretty much only did year 11 and 12), we were not really taught much (if at all) about how the voting system works.

I was thinking it could be because of the subjects I chose, but I don’t remember if there were any subjects that would really tackle this at all.
Both parties look pretty damned similar quite often. Liberal traditionally viewed as good for the economy but have shat the bed as much as labour. Add in the nutcase personalities in Australian politics and I wonder sometimes how this country manages to almost function!
On the contrary. You are one of the ignorant ones.
Yeah, I wonder who pushed that idea.
Sounds like they never bothered to understand the changes that came with optional preferential voting above the line in the federal senate ballot. Group Voting Tickets, where the party specified their preferences, got abolished.
I once had an argument with a Liberal party person handing out how to vote cards who didn't understand how preferential voting work flat out. It ended up with me and another Liberal person trying to explain how it works and we just gave up after a while. The conversation was actual the Teal candidate need to first beat Labor so Labor candidate exhausts their votes before the Teal candidate but got derailed very quickly. We tried googling and showing him resources (other how to vote cards) but the guy simply could seem to grasp that its not first past the post, while handing out how to vote cards for preferential voting.
That was how Group Voting Ticket worked for Federal Senate elections and most state upper house elections until recently, with the exception of Victoria which still uses that system.

Over 90% of people voted above the line and the preferences for those votes were decided by the parties themselves and while they were published before each election, they were far too complex for people to reasonably know where their preference actually would go. It also resulted in preference harvesting by micro parties.

I can understand someone believing that it still applies (if they are in Victoria and talking about state elections then they would actually be correct), or that they are mistaken and believe that it works the same way for lower house elections.
The difference between handing out HTVs vs not can be 2 to 4% swing on a booth.
This is about the wider problem of not having the informed choice as mentioned in the article, the How to Vote card is non partisan so it's not part of the problem.
For sure. We also had sex Ed in school, yet plenty of people risk it for the rawdog. 
People just never paid attention because they thought "this doesn't/wont ever apply to me"
mate I did a year 6 trip to Canberra.

got the questacon / AEC special. 

Blew me away that the cunt who won didnt win.
Did you guys not get a music video featuring Genghis Khan singing about how to get elected without using violence? Unironically taught me everything I needed to know about the system - well, that and the unit in English devoted to explaining how Murdoch's bias works
I suspect old Joh didn't care... because no one could effectively stop him doing anything he wanted to do.
I think we can assume one of the reasons for that is a lack of understanding about the Constitution.
That's the trick none of us have mastered.
Funnily enough the party they voted for
Que?
I considered that there should be instructions at the top of the ballot to have to tick a box to have your vote counted. That would exclude all those that can't be bothered to put in even the minimum effort to know what they are doing.
Automatic run-offs 

Not great but vastly better than first past the post.
Last election I voted in a relatively safe Labor seat. LNP didn't even show up to hand out forms, apparently wasn't worth their time.
To be fair raw dog is more enjoyable then politics
"Questacon / AEC special" is cracking me up lol. I did the Canberra trip in year 8
If you don't know, vote no.
It used to be that you could only put a single 1 above the line for the senate. Then the group you gave the 1 to would distribute your preferences as they saw fit.

Voting below the line also required fully numbering every box, which was rather tiresome (and somewhat pointless). Together, this meant that the vast majority of senate preferences were chosen by the political parties, not the voters.

Now you have to number at least 6 boxes above the line, which puts all meaningful preference distribution back in the hands of the voters.
If voting is a pain in the arse you’re doing it wrong. xD
