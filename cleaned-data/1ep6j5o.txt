The same article has Meares stating Raygun is ‚ÄúAustralia‚Äôs best female breaker‚Äù. Are we sure?
If she indeed qualified with that type of breakdancing then I would have to question who were the judges. I rewatched it again, her moves were not naturally flowing, its seems shes trying to exert effort in her movements, and im speaking as someone who grew up watching really good breakdancers.
Are we sure this isn‚Äôt a new Chris Lilley character? Has The D Generation or The Chasers resurfaced at the Olympics? What about Fast Forward?
I reckon Raygun has just pulled off one of the better trolling events in Australia's modern history because in no fuckin' way was that serious üòÇ
‚ÄúAustralia's Olympic chief has slammed critics of breakdancer Rachael Gunn as typical of misogynistic abuse that female athletes have historically had to endure.‚Äù

Oh get the fuck out of here with that. It has nothing to do with her being a woman and all to do with her being completely delusional, going to an elite sports event and performing like a clown.
The whole choreography looked based around showing off Australian culture and desperately finding ways to avoid doing a handstand
Ironically it was a phd holding, well connected, white women who represented Australia. The least cultural or social diverse person imaginable. I don't know any break dancers, but when I was at uni I saw dozens of hip hop dancers who could have executed raygun's routine with a hundred times more flow.

Her selection for the Olympic team remains a national embrassament.
When this news first broke I thought it was a Chaser bit. I had no idea breakdancing had actually become an Olympic thing and the way she moved made me think of Kath and Kel on Dancing With the Stars, or Mr G or Jonah on Summer Heights High. It's got nothing to do with misogyny, I would have had the same "wait, this ISN'T a joke??" reaction if it were a guy doing those moves.
I'm not critical of 'Raygun' herself.  She might be the loveliest person, but her breaking was shit.  It just wasn't good and that was reflected in her score.  

What absolutely makes me angry is that this is tax payer funded.  Someone thought that was a really useful way to spend our money, to have some daggy dancer in a trackie nowhere near competitive in a non sport at the Olympics.
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èNo she was just bad. She even said herself that she knew she was not going to be able to compete.
Looked like an insect dying after being blasted with mortein
It's because she's a woman..... No. It's because she sucked
All I have to compare is Electric Boogaloo.  Nothing she did even got close to that movie...and its 40 years old.  

If that was her best, then how did she get chosen?
If this is the best we have to offer, why did we even compete?
Can everyone just calm down‚Ä¶.its break dancing.
nah keep clowning, its the Olympics and other better, younger dancers should have gone in her place. Makes the sport look bad on their first shot at the games.
I feel like it‚Äôs satire, but still reckon it‚Äôs annoying. Now she‚Äôs done videos with the inspired unemployed too (who stopped being funny in like 2021).

I‚Äôm all for letting people have a go and pursue their passions, I used to play in shitty metal bands. But I wasn‚Äôt playing in those shitty metal bands in national (or even worse, highest level international events) just ‚Äòhaving a crack‚Äô.

Just making another undeserving person famous.
Why on Earth is breakdancing in the Olympics to begin with?
Say some gangsta is dissin your fly girl, you just give em one of these
Breakdancing is such a sick style, somehow they managed to make it look lame and cringe
On yer bike Anna. This was rubbish and people are allowed to say so. Especially taxpayers who probably contributed to her being there.
Smacks more of cronyism and corruption than anything else.

And her rebuke of criticism is just dumb as hell. I'm sure she got her jib on merit rather than familiar connections /s

I'm sure her nose aint brown

I've seen better breakdancing on the back streets of the cbd in Melbourne at 1am kudos to thise underclass unappreciated artists
It's sad because there are hundreds, maybe thousands of passionate breakdancers in Australia with actual talent, and seemingly not one of them had a chance to show off their skills in front of a global audience.

Instead, that opportunity went to this troll who gamed the system for her own self satisfaction. 

This was a systematic failure to promote Aussie talent in a new Olympic event. Raygun knew it, and went along for the ride anyway.
Her performance was pretty shithouse, but then when you see the gold medal performance you realize noone was sending their best anyway.
Napoleon Vegemite.
I don't know if she did it on purpose but either way, people are talking about it. It was entertaining. 

My vote is she's camp and good for her for doing something notable.
It‚Äôs sad to see that what seemed like the only opportunity for breakdancing to stay in future games has been sabotaged by the organization allowing people like her to participate. Nothing against her in particular‚Äîshe‚Äôs very brave and has her own style‚Äîbut the implications of her performance go beyond her individual routine.
"What some of these cunts fail to appreciate", began Meares, "is the truly Australian nature of our art". 

She finished by telling everyone to "get fucked if you don't like it".
She absolutely engineered this to advance her own career. Probably just knew the right people. I‚Äôve seen better break dancing at my local high school.¬†
I think we should just call her a bloody legend and put her straight in the pool room and call it good. 

Bloody legend
I'm still convinced its all a big troll.
It shouldn‚Äôt be in the Olympics (amongst a bunch of other things) but the real blame should be at the government department level that signed off on the qualifier process. This wasn‚Äôt competitive. If we are going to spend $ sending people over it should have attracted a diverse group of entrants.
She was the most qualified person‚Ä¶ on paper.
Credit to her,  she made me realise breakdancing was in the Olympics
Serous question - she was really the best Australia could offer? Like ‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no other best female breakdancer out there??
A phd she may have but she clearly lacked the self awareness to make a call and say ‚Äúthere are better people than me at this, you should send them‚Äù‚Ä¶nope, she let her ego get in the way so she could be on the stage for her 15mins of fame.
Sorry but there's no defence for how bad she embarrassed us all.
All I have to compare is Electric Boogaloo.  Nothing she did even got close to that movie...and its 40 years old.  

If that was her best, then how did she get chosen?
If this is the best we have to offer, why did we even compete?
Yeah according to her we're all horrible people but the hockey player who tried buying coke on a Paris street is a nice guy who made a bad mistake.
I watched it live and it was a bit cringy but there has certainly been an overreaction to this.
Some people really need to lighten up. Acting like it‚Äôs a sad day and a national embarrassment like have a laugh it was so funny. She gave us a gift really.
Recognise that the performance was bad, but remember the human.

Basically don‚Äôt be a cunt.
Raygun‚Äôs routine was funny but the level of uptight butthurt about it online is peak comedy.
Don‚Äôt personally attack, threaten, harass or intimidate her because that‚Äôs not on. By all means have a laugh and make memes. I watched it live and this has nothing to do with race or gender or anything else, she was just simply horrible and the performance was really cringe worthy. Didn‚Äôt score a single point either and she also has a phd in that sport she was competing! Can‚Äôt make that shit up lmao.
She needs some cool tunes, not just any will suffice

But they didn't have Ice Cube, so she bought Vanilla Ice

Now cruisin' in her Pinto, she sees homies as she pass

But if she looks twice, they're gonna kick her lily ass

So don't debate, a player straight
You know she really doesn't get it anyway

Gotta play the field, and keep it real
For you no way, for you no way

So if you don't rate, just overcompensate

At least that you'll know you can always go on Ricki Lake

The world loves wannabes, ah
Hey, hey, do that brand-new thing!

Now she's gettin' a tattoo, yeah, she's gettin' ink done

She asked for a 13 but they drew a 31
Friends say, she's tryin' too hard and she's not quite hip

But in her own mind, she's the, she's the dopest trip
I think it's a rubbish take to just dismiss the commentary on this as misogyny - we watched the routine at work and we were all equally (male and female) a bit aghast and a bit confused. That was about the worst of it though - it was all a bit of a head-scratcher and we weren't sure whether or not she was taking the piss. Quite the conversation in the tearoom for a short time, but it really is of no consequence aside from being yet another quirk in a generally quirky Olympic games.

But then of course there's Reddit, and a steady trickle of articles linking the footage with what appears to be the same (presumably) young dudes who are putting their Playstation controller down only just long enough to post what a national embarrassment she is. 

At the end of the day, you can think what you like about her performance (and again, I agree that it was a bit of an eye-opener) but she is *competing in the Olympics* which is something I would never be able to do and nor would easily 99% of those posting derisive comments. Her worst is probably better than our best.
I‚Äôm just picturing some poor brown western Sydney kid who would have killed for the opportunity to represent us and show her talent. Instead we sent a raging narcissistic dickhead to make a mockery of a sport that already faced derision and scorn.
That routine was like Bowser‚Äôs dying cutscene at the end of every Mario game
Not one flare, windmill etc; all those iconic moves that made breakdancing great.  If you‚Äôre going to Benton the world stage you should maybe accept a tiny form of criticism.
Anna Meares was going to spearhead the mining industry's attack on the Rudd-era mining super profits tax (TV ads were made).

Fk Anna Meares 

No wonder they're all wearing Gina Rinehart's boots.  Suckholes to wealth and power.  Why are so many athletes, who get so much from society to play at their hobbies, so reprehensible?
Had nothing to do with being a woman and anyone using that as an excuse is as pathetic and embarrassing as what this "Raygun" showed. It was a total joke and shouldn't be anywhere near the Olympics ever again
Go through the top ranked Aussies on the Dance Sport website and tell me they didn't plan these events themselves so one of them could qualify, the whole thing stinks to high hell. 

She doesn't deserve any threats, but she deserves all the criticism she gets. You went out on the country's dollar to represent us and it was a joke.
If this has proven anything. It's that just because you have a phd in what you're doing it doesn't mean you're actually good at it
She's an academic, I'm half expecting this whole "event" to be the thesis of a PhD somewhere down the line and she was taking the p1ss from the get go.¬†


My kids were super hyped for the breaking and when I put on the replay for them to watch, it ruined any excitement they had. AOC should be ashamed of themselves.¬†
Reminded me of Eric the eel
The most Australian thing to do is hang shit on each other. It was crap, but it‚Äôs put her on the map. She‚Äôs an icon of our Olympic meme history now and there‚Äôs no shame in that.
Sounds like Anna Meares was behind Raygun's selection.
She was trying the Bradbury technique, but none of the other dancers broke their legs so her plan failed
At least Raygun seems to have a much better sense of humour, than those trolling her do.
It‚Äôs not misogynistic but some attacks on her are so personal.

It‚Äôs as if some people think she has no value or committed a crime.

‚ÄúYou are an embarrassment‚Äù
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a joke‚Äù

That is too far, too far. Do all you keyboard warriors think you can do better?
Shes a legend and will be celebrated for decades.
Did you see this degree of nastiness and ridicule against Eddie the Eagle? An older bloke who lived a dream while an adoring world watched on. Was he reviled as a national humiliation? No he wasn't. Was he out of his league, having fun and went down as a legend? Yep. What's different here?
Christ...I just watched it after only seeing clips.

French kid actually had some athleticism and flow to his moves.

Our "Raygun" was firing blanks. üò≠
That is such BS to claim it‚Äôs all just because she‚Äôs a woman. Everyone has just spent a week praising our girls on the pool and the two Fox sisters have become overnight celebrities. It‚Äôs almost as if we can recognise when a person excels in their chosen field despite their gender, as well as recognising when someone does the complete opposite.
The fact that there is more outrage around this than the literal pedo that was allowed to compete says plenty.
I‚Äôm in the science field. The funding, in particular towards vaccines and other medicine have increased since covid. It‚Äôs created some high skill jobs in this field. 

The arts also deserve funding. We need people to be creative and it improves mental health. However, I don‚Äôt know who she knows or what boxes it ticked when she submitted her research proposal. But it ticked something for her to get funding for her PhD.

There needs to be more discretion in what is allowed for a PhD. Lack of funding results in lack of engagement in important issues such as housing since many good economics and commerce PhD‚Äôs end up working at banks or finance companies. Their interest will be with the banks and not the people.
So Mears just admitted it was a pity selection because Gunn had a tough time in the 'sport'.
Give me a break
I can now say I can dance like an Olympian
Honestly half of the problem is the dorky outfit
As a tax payer Anna needs to wake the fuck up.
I agree wholeheartedly with this guy.. 
https://youtu.be/_ctD3zqfWck?si=B5lFmjWCLWSPLHV7
I think it‚Äôs utterly disgusting. Why does Australia spend so much money on sport? I am offended that this person got a lovely holiday to Paris just so she can flop around in the floor  for a few minutes like a fish out of water. Surely that money could‚Äôve been better spent elsewhere!!
Raygun gave us all a good laugh. No need to get defensive and weird about it.
This whole thing is emblematic of university culture in Australia. She studied it to death but never once worked it, but teaches the theory and considers herself an expert.

People legit enter a time warp in higher education where they shut themselves in their offices and are so detached from the reality of whatever their chosen area is. 

In this case the additional element was the involvement of the ballroom dancing mob too.
Good on Anna for this, the pile on is stupid, Rachel seems like a nice person with a hobby she enjoys and now she is an Olympian. She hasn‚Äôt done anything wrong but try to compete. Let‚Äôs lay off her please.
> What has occurred on social media with trolls

I see only 1 troll here Anna
Hopefully raygun publishes newspaper articles and more serious research on her experience
Meares going so hard in her defence looks really stupid. Trying to blame misogyny for the meme pipeline is such a lame attempt to misdirect valid criticism.
I wouldn't put a lot of water into some qualifications, here in Australia we have a massive fraudster named Mr Philip Alpers.

The man refers to himself numerous times as a reporter, a firearms expert, a professor and so on.

He gets routinely used as an expert witness by an extremist interest group to support their claims and campaigns and he tried to get himself injected into foreign affairs being an "expert" on foreign policy for places he'd never been to, evidence that couldn't be verified and so on.

To cut a long story short and feel free to do more research on this fraudster, I got to meet him at several government panels and workshops where it quickly became clear that he had no idea what he was talking about and was a complete idiot just with huge levels of confidence.

We later found out that the "professor" as he had himself referred to not only held zero qualifications... he was not only associated with the extremist group.... he ran it...

His allies in this group were high up at a university as well that had been funding and resourcing the extremist group and yeah.

The whole thing absolutely stunk, later on from what we heard he was gifted an honorary qualification or given an honorary title or some crap.

Having since met many others who have actually gone out and gotten qualifications and so on in fields they've never worked in, or poor qualitiy qualifications and the such.

It's really not hard for people to stack panels, groups and even fraud the government to get personal advantage.

Given what i'm reading now that a group who control ballroom dancing and had nothing to do with breaking were told their sport was not being chosen and breaking was... immediately pivotted their association to be the breakdancing authority..... and the lady who was chosen to represent was not only associated with them but high up as were her associates...... absolutely stinks.

Given that all the breakdancing crews that have been annoyed by this had never been notified of the qualifiers, or who had participated and been struck down by a ballroom dancing group that stacked their panels with their own people..... this is actually begging for an investigation.
‚Ä¶.‚Äùtypical of misogynistic abuse‚Äù‚Ä¶no mate you and this dogshit candidate embarrassed a nation and we are rightfully being critical about a self centred twat who thinks they can breakdance. It‚Äôs neither misogyny nor abuse you‚Äôre representing me and all mates and you embarrassed everyone so we want you to feel how we feel.
Why is Anna trying to make this person a victim in all of this? The story she told about this person locking herself in a room in 2008 during a break dancing competition because she was the only female in a male dominated "sport" is ludicrous and reeks of toxic feminism. How is that relevant? Ridiculous.
I think albo should keep quiet
I'm almost certain what's happened is the Australian Olympic Committee (is that what they're called?) didn't understand or care to understand what the competition would actually be.

You knew something was up when everyone else had breakdancing 'costumes' that accentuated their persona, and then our loser came out in an official Australian Olympic tracksuit and hat like the nerd kid at school on free dress day.

I'm imagining that even if the conversation was had about it, the fuddy-duddy Aussies in charge probably shot it down for being 'unprofessional'.
This is why some feminists get abuse. The woman was woefully bad. I watched her competition to get to represent Australia and she was bad and there was a least one young woman that was much better. I think they were wowed by her bio of being a professor of ‚Äòstreet dance‚Äô, whatever it is she studies she has never actually watched old time breakers on video before that nonsense she did and if she has, she obviously learnt nothing
[removed]
I'm so out of the loop I actually thought she had won a medal.
I think she should carry the flag in the closing ceremony. Let‚Äôs embrace this.
The top three Australians she beat to qualify apparently competed in another international competition to try to qualify and finished 37th, 38th and 40th out of 40.
Speaking as someone who knows nothing about breakdancing, I have seen buskers and even school kids practicing at Darling Harbour that would mop the floor with her‚Ä¶ The performance just seemed so unnatural and had no flow or rhythm whatsoever.

Like can we honestly and truthfully say she would pass even the first stage of Australia‚Äôs got talent with that performance? This talk of misogyny etc is all effing bollocks. She‚Äôs just shit, end of story. They could have given the position to any number of young up and coming teens, instead they chose a middle aged Karen. What on earth.
i don't get it.

are there not young, hip australians who do breakdancing to a competitive level?

you go on youtube and type in bboy or bgirl and all these dancers from all over the world are infinitely more impressive, cool and just generally have swag. They actually have skills that make you go "wow." 

i also heard she was doing a social experiment for her uni thesis and that's why she's up to these shenanigans. But that's disrespecting the olympics and the other serious participants.

i will give her this. I did think she had good athleticism and stamina for her age, body type and someone who just does not come across like an athlete, let alone a professional breakdancer. It just wasn't to olympics level and she looked like she was taking the piss.
I guarantee 100% there are better female breakers than her. In no world is she the best Australia has to offer.
TIL I had a shot at the Olympics.
Pretty certain Meares doesn't get out to Mt Druitt that much.
Best "white middle class" break dancer
There is a video of the preliminary competition she won to her to the Olympics and there was a young woman much better than her.
Meares has to say that.
this tells me, like 99.9999% of the australian populatio, she has no idea of the female breakdance scene.
It's really interesting about how it came to be and pretty much the short of it seems to be that olympic breaking being a thing was orchestrated by the body that controls ballroom dancing and it seems to have been a shitshow from the get https://www.smh.com.au/sport/insulting-the-sport-dragged-into-the-olympics-without-its-consent-20240715-p5jtu4.html
I speak as someone who grew up watching no breakdancers at all, and I can tell that this was not Olympic-level anything.

I'm all for the 'have a go' attitude of sport, where getting out there and doing something is better than sitting on the sidelines wishing you could, but not at the Olympics. 

This was more like a local street dance school's 'come and try' day at a local mall.
I know nothing about breakdancing, but anyone in the Run Dmc vs Jason Nevins music video are way better than whatever that was.
Honestly, she danced exactly like i'd expect a phd in cultural studies to dance. A lot of interesting (albeit meta/decnstructivist) ideas, a good understanding of vocabulary/choreography, but lacking in stage presence and poise.

I'm living in Canada atm and listening to the Canadian commentators they were both saying the same thing. That she had a lot of interesting ideas, but was lacking the athleticism to stand up to olympic level competition which prioritises faster footwork and more physically demanding holds.
You can see her performances over the last few years on youtube and she hasn‚Äôt improved at all.  

It‚Äôs a complete lack of self awareness to the point that it reminds me of the old school Karate McDojo Sensei‚Äôs of the 80‚Äôs that grift their way through life convincing gullible people that they can teach them how to defend themselves (Rex Kwon Do from Napoleon Dynamite).  

What we witnessed at this years Olympics reminded me of a ‚ÄúKung Fu Master‚Äù getting the shit kicked out of them by Chinese MMA fighter Xu Xiaodong when he travelled China showing how fraudulent they all were.

When you spend so long sniffing your own farts you think they smell good but they still smell like shit to everyone else.
100% hard agree.... I have seen that qualifying series in which she won through to the Olympics. 
Judges need to go to Specsavers. I wouldn't be surprised if there were favours done or something dodgy.... Something definitely isn't right.
She was the best of the people.who went to the trials. It's not the judges,  or the competitors at fault.

It's the ridiculous society that runs ballroom dancing that coopted breaking into their society without the support of the breaking community so they could get the clout of organising for the olympics
For one of them at least the slow music didn‚Äôt help, saw a video on YouTube of her doing very similar moves and being able to carry momentum between them better so had more of a gap to floor
We have a theory that she is just straight taking the piss. She supposedly won an Australasian competition, and we have the feeling that someone dared her to go out with the worst, most stereotypical dance moves, knowing that she wasn't going to win either way.
I believe I saw a source that said her husband/coach was one of the judges at the Olympic qualifiers. So there's that.
Jonah Takalua would breakdance fifty times better than this
I‚Äôm convinced it‚Äôs satire. It has to be.
Instantly makes me think of the [Grievance Studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grievance_studies_affair) papers hoaxes. Where they made up bullshit papers, got them peer reviewed and even won awards for them. 

There is a whole air of sniffing ones own farts about this.
But, almost impossible to believe, she wasn‚Äôt trolling. She seems to be an academic into socio-babble with no self-awareness. She acknowledges an athletic deficit but it‚Äôs just that you don‚Äôt understand or appreciate her creativity and artistry. 

She‚Äôll get a lifetime of academic papers out of this - which will probably be as hilarious as the routine.
Fully. High level troll. Too many olympic sports
The word psy-op gets thrown around a lot these days ‚Ä¶
I'm convinced its a troll.
If she practiced a bit more and polished it, she‚Äôd be competent

Personally, think it shouldn‚Äôt be in the Olympics at all
The ball dancing federation was running the breakdancing qualifiers and tried to tank it on purpose, because they were mad breakdancing got into the Olympics and they didn‚Äôt, so you‚Äôre probably right
Just earlier this morning I was heading in to Sydney CBD turning on to Campbell Street, I saw a strip of wall that had a lot of tagging on it. There was a nice (suspiciously fresh) big "Raygun" on it.
Doesn't Australia spend gigantic amounts of money on sports? Kinda weird the sports institutions didn't go out looking for actual talent to represent Australia for breakdancing events.

Trolling would imply you understood the underlying culture, can you elaborate how she was trolling?

Hip-hop culture that breakdancing was born in, is a creole culture of Latin, African and migrant intersections and the lack of financial or institutional resources that their richer neighbours had access to.

Famously the 1977 black out in New York is credited with giving kids access to the musical instruments that made hip hop music possible which would lead to the breakdance scene in the 1980s

....do you think Raygun is familiar with that history? Or just prancing around like a clown because she was able to gain access to financial resources allocated to represent Australia?

Edit: I've been told Raygun is a PhD in cultural studies and is familiar with Hip-hop culture.

Confirmed irl shit poster dunking on Australian sporting and dance establishments and their inability to engage wider Australian diasporas.
We need to realise this is one of the great moments of our history.
That came to mind when I saw her literally pull out 'The Sprinkler' in her routine lol.
Her kangaroo hop move followed by flopping a fish on a BBQ.... it was very patriotic?
Aussies haven't been trolled this hard since they lost the Emu war.
Jesus fuck. I‚Äôm a woman and her performance made my insides curl up into a black hole. It had nothing at all to do with her gender and everything to do with the fact that she looked like the mother of a ballgirl at the tennis having a seizure.
Australian Olympian goes 0 - 54, quite literally the worst score you can get. People ridicule said performance for its comical style and lack of more athletic tricks that others performed:

"Nah bro, people just hate women in sports. It's that simple."


It's such a shame that during an era of pretty decent support for women's sport (see Matilda's game turnouts especially), that the Australian Olympic Chief decides to slap a misogynistic label on everyone being critical of such a shocking lack of competitive performance from Australia.

Clearly the Australian breaking team isn't anywhere near their competition at the moment, and the scores reflect that. Jeff Dunne, the male breakdancer, also didn't perform well during his events, scoring 2 of 54 available points. The main difference between the two Australians is he's actually doing what I'd imagine the typical person would think breakdancing would look like; he's actually up on his hands and spinning around on his head, etc.
Anna Meares makes it sound a bit like only men are shitting on her. What a fucking cop out of an accusation to say its because she is a woman.
I'm a woman and find this comment incredibly condescending. The idea that people can't be critical of a poor performance because the athlete is a woman is absolutely lacking any credit. Meares should have been embarrassed to say it. 

Raygun is an academic and as such should be used to peer review. If she can't handle the fact that she was essentially laughed out of the Olympics with the literal worst score she could have achieved, then perhaps something needs to be investigated at a selection level instead. 

It just reads as Meares attempting to downplay that someone completely unworthy (compared to other athletes) was there in the first place.
Making statements like this damages Meares‚Äôs credibility.

The next time she speaks about a genuine issue of misogyny, it will be more easily dismissed by many of the people she is trying to persuade because all that they will remember are these Raygun comments.
Guarantee that if a bloke turned up and was that embarrassing we‚Äôd all be saying the exact same thing. Just like we celebrate and acknowledge all the female champions of this Olympics, the ones who turned up and gave it a great go even if they didn‚Äôt win.
It's just bad objectively.. which ever way you spin it. Whether she's trolling, or being artistic, the scoring and public reception speaks for itself.¬†


Edit: can we stop framing any and all criticism as sexism, it is offensive and patronising in itself.¬†¬†
If you think this level is good enough for women to compete at the Olympics, then _you_ are a misogynist who believes that female athletes aren‚Äôt capable of better performance.

EDIT: that doesn‚Äôt justify bullying on social media for any reason though.
I saw the clip via this subreddit and thought it was crap and I didn‚Äôt know I was watching a female so that didn‚Äôt come into it. Didn‚Äôt hit the rhythm or the timings and scores of zero back that up.
I hate this because it denigrates the legitimate misogyny that exists.
Putting her there actually makes it harder for women athletes to be taken seriously.  She is now one of the most well known women athletes, or at least Olympians, and all people know is how terrible she was. She is not a serious athlete at all.
I will always call out misogynist bullshit I‚Äôm not shy about it but this is not the case with this situation AT ALL hahaha
They were all women. It's the women's competition. She didn't get a 0/10 for being a woman. Most of our gold has come from women. Plenty more don't  medal or don't qualify for the Olympics but have worked incredibly hard to even get close to qualifying and devoted their entire lives to their sport. They have our respect. 

The reason Raygun is being talked about is that she was the only athlete taking the piss. If it was a genuine troll (which I initially thought) I'd say good on ya, you larrikin legend. But it is starting to seem like it was real.
Raygun should not have put herself in this position. She‚Äôs openly quoted as saying she can‚Äôt compete with the younger girls.
Sweet merciful crapola. I am a woman and I now have secondhand PTSD after watching that unadulterated shit fest that was an Olympian performing at what was supposed to be the highest level and then Anna decides the best way to deal with it, is to gaslight us.
Precisely. It was just embarrassing. We had top quality athletes sent over... And she thought she belonged with them because she wrote a few articles?

She might not deserve the online bullying headed her way, but that's a next level arrogance.
Everything is misogynistic. Men breathing is misogynistic.
Omg that‚Äôs so laughable.
I don't think Raygun was delusional at all. She knew.she wasn't up to it and tried to do something different, which is fair enough, and honestly good for her. It didn't work out but that's just how it goes.

The problem is the whole.selection process, obviously there is something wrong there. There's clearly no proper pipeline to get the right person into the games for this sport in Australia.
It mightn't be so bad if the FEMALE competitors from other countries had been equally terrible. But muh-soggy-knee
If she won qualification I need to see who she beat
I mean both can be true. That the performance was terrible and worthy of derision. And that she's getting more abuse and commentary than a male performer of a similar display would have. 

Also the chief de mission's job is to look out for the athletes. And in this case that includes trying to minimise the (deserved or not) blowback that Raygun is getting.
I dunno, when I think about it, I have a feeling that if it was a bloke, it would be seen as 'larrikinism' at its finest.

Aussies taking the piss out of the dumb IOC trying to codify something to make a quick buck.
I feel like she blanked in parts and just made it up as she went.
How the fk is hopping around like a kangaroo while break dancing showing off Australian culture?

What part of our culture revolves around hopping around like a roo?

I‚Äôve lived here my whole life.
To add to the irony she actually wrote a paper suggesting it shouldn‚Äôt join the olympics for this very reason. It has its own comic value:

‚ÄúBreakdancing‚Äôs institutionalisation via the Olympics will place breakdancing more firmly within the sporting nation‚Äôs hegemonic settler colonial structures that rely upon racialised and gendered hierarchies.‚Äù
She managed to discredit breakdancing and academia in minutes. It was quite a feat.
If I get a PHD in the theory of triple jump maybe I can be selected in 2028
She‚Äôs also 36. I don‚Äôt know much about breakdancing but I‚Äôd guess that‚Äôs not where most athletically peak.
It‚Äôs crazy how far white guilt will take you these days
It's an issue of judging artistic competition. The judges for Olympic Breaking are primarily ballroom dance people, which might go a long way to explaining why a phd holding, well connected white woman was able to get through. I knew a figure skater back in uni who explained why Australia wouldn't be sending our best to Sochi: all the judges are parents of competitors and give their kids higher scores.

Raygun knew she was out of her league and put on a show anyway. Her artistic choices were led by this knowledge. Her performance is the only one anyone is talking about and I consider that a win.
It is improv, they don't know the music and the scoring values not repeating moves so you can imagine why this has a very different feel to choreographed routines we are used to. Its like comparing jazz improv to orchestral. 

Which is not to say I think she's the best at what she does. I imagine that this kind of organized competition which seems to take it's model from gymnastics and ballroom is a kind of gentrification of this style of dance anyway. It would not shock me if this style of "breaking" is not a culturally diverse scene in Australia.
My mum thought it was a joke. It wasn‚Äôt till we spoke last night and she asked me which comedian she was and I had to correct her that she realised it was real.
Devil's advocate, but it was money well spent in my book. I've ignored most of the Olympics but have spent the last 24 hours spontaneously laughing in glee whenever I see her pop up on a 5 dollar note and whenever someone comments "this is worse than gallipoli". It's the gift that keeps on giving!
It fascinates me that people are getting so triggered over this.
I don‚Äôt get the hand-wringing over it being taxpayer funded, it would have been a fraction of a fraction of the amount our government puts towards much worse things like bombing Palestinian children. In comparison I don‚Äôt give a shit about the cost of a plane ticket and a track suit.
She qualified for the event. 

Can you imagine the controversy of a Sports Minister denying an athlete‚Äôs a chance to participate on ‚Äúdaggy‚Äù grounds?
The irony is that this is how many people feel about the olympics as a whole. Breakdancing is no sillier than swimming in the scheme of things if you‚Äôre not impressed by swimming. . As a taxpayer I don‚Äôt mind paying for either event, they all look like they are having fun.
I love it for all those reasons.
[removed]
None of it should be taxpayer funded, neither the good nor the bad performances.
Her getting tax payer money is no different to any other athlete getting it. It‚Äôs all a monumental waste.
Wow, this is perfect... reminds me of when I fart and my missus sprays me with eucalyptus spray. I move just like Louie the Fly..
Yeah because like she was competing in the women‚Äôs comp with you know.. other women? 

Other women who actually knew how to break dance like Ami who won gold. She was oozing cool.
It's the sequel 'Electric Boogapoo Floor Cleaner'
The host nation are allowed to choose select sports, so France picked breakdancing. 

Worth noting that breakdancing is massive in France.
Just a different type of floor gymnastics in my eyes
I don‚Äôt mean to cherry pick your post about this directly but I really wish we stopped this narrative. We have horses doing events, we have women dancing in a pool, athletes doing flips and spins off a diving board and rhythmic gymnastics doing effectively the same as breakdancing just with a rubber ball and some hula hoops. The breakers were 100 times more athletic than everyone‚Äôs favourite Turkish air pistol ‚Äòathlete‚Äô.

Why does every modern inclusion in the Olympics get met with someone criticising it instead of getting behind it? The event was hype and immediately got me interested to watch more on YouTube.
Hey it's still not as random as modern pentathlon.
It's definitely more athletic than the gymnasts twirling the ribbon.
Yo yo yo, I am kangaroo, everything you say sticks to you like poo, and I hop hop away boy.
Lol
Interesting to compare newscorp‚Äôs response

with the more thoughtful 

https://www.salon.com/2024/08/10/australia-put-a-unique-spin-on-breakdancing-at-the-olympics-leading-to-disappointing-ridicule/
Instead of finding real talent, they get these privileged delusional people to make a fool of themselves and breakdancing. She has a PhD in breakdancing and doesn‚Äôt have any awareness that there must be others more talented than her!
If she‚Äôs happy to have a laugh at herself, I‚Äôm happy to celebrate her. I have a feeling it might not go that way though‚Ä¶
Generated some good memes so I think money well spent sending her.
Nothing says ‚ÄúStraya‚Äù like rocking up to the Olympics, saying ‚Äúshe‚Äôll be right‚Äù and giving it a red hot go. Raygun is an Aussie hero as far as I‚Äôm concerned
Exactly. DanceSport Australia should have been finding and reaching out to breaking groups around the country, encouraging them to send their best. It doesn't look like that happened at all.
Or even good breakdancer? Or not terrible?
Fuck no. Go walk down the CBD of Melbourne or Sydney at night and odds are you'll see a group of kids/young adults polishing the concrete. Yes, females too.

She was so bad. Full stop.
She qualified in a competition with like 15 entrants. The thing was set up by a ballroom dancing organisation and actually talented less well off breakers either didn‚Äôt know about it or didn‚Äôt have the means to go to it
I agree with your thoughtful post, but I can‚Äôt forget that being a female far from stops a lot of women being misogynous, deliberately or otherwise.
I'm doing my sport science PhD in AFL footballers, which obviously has nothing to do with my ability to physically play the sport. What's with the anti-intellectualism false equivalence?
There‚Äôs hanging shit, and then there‚Äôs blind vitriol.

Some commenters in this thread should be ashamed.
Yeah yeah. So amazing. So brave. So good.
Could I? No.  
Could the 8 teenage kids I saw dance in a recent competition in a suburban school hall? They'd wipe the fucking floor with her.
She literally had negative value because we all paid for her to be there
Women tend to attract greater levels of abuse on the internet, so yes it does follow a misogynistic pattern. People feel more entitled to denigrate a woman.
Yes.
Along with a tonne others
I think the key difference between these two are the underlying competition within the country in the sport(and I believe he set a British record). He was the best ski jumper from his country at the time. Whereas if you watch the qualifying (available on YouTube) it‚Äôs kinda obvious that ray guns competitors were more athletic(completing multiple power moves) and just overall better skilled at the sport/art.
Her qualification for the Olympic team just feels like there was underlying bias in the selection.
Many people said it was a mockery of the Olympics to send someone who is no good at the sport when Eddie did it too.
That‚Äôs a great point.
Wow, excellent point.
I see you‚Äôre taking up the newscorp approach.

https://www.news.com.au/sport/olympics/travesty-how-the-olympics-breaking-farce-was-allowed-to-happen/news-story/b6ff855d78232f4e6d7da82e7475bc64
The shocking part is we all assumed Raygun chose that lawn bowls looking outfit. Nope, the male dancer also wore it, that was a choice by the Aussie team lol
People ought to lighten up a bit
She worked it. For years prior to the PhD. It's why she studied it.

She doesn't teach it. She teaches cultural studies. Which research University do you think teaches dance?
The outfit was an Australian team decision because our male breakdancer wore it too üò≠
That‚Äôs a distasteful and low comment.
When you have a break dancing competition in the morning and then lawn bowls in the afternoon.
The qualifying competition was organised by a Ballroom Dancing organisation. How did they advertise the competition? Did they engage the subculture of breaking or use their network of Ballroom Associations around Australia?
It‚Äôs best to just tap out at this point
Who got 39th place ?
Yes. Thank fuck someone has come out and called it what it is. A clusterfuck of absolute bullshit. She was so so out of touch, absolutely no flavour or rhythm. 

We would have been better served to not have a representative at all, she was that shit.
She 'pulled a Raygun'.¬†
I think it looks pretty natural as in I could do it while real breakers look supernatural.
As somebody close to her age who still doesn't have their shit together, I kindly request an extension of at LEAST 4 more years before you refer to us as middle aged
Speaking as someone who is 4 years younger, I am appalled at her level of athleticism. 36 is hardly an age where you should be struggling to get up off the floor.
Just speaks volumes of the corruption in the system. I actually hate the Olympics, World Cup etc just for this reason. Massive corrupt rich organisations have taken the fun and enjoyment out of these events
>you go on youtube and type in bboy or bgirl and all these dancers from all over the world are infinitely more impressive,

But not from Australia apparently. I keep asking people to name a good Australian b-girl or provide a video of one and nothing. Breaking is a very male dominated sport, it could simply be that Australia doesn't have any world class female breakers. No one has provided any evidence that there are.
She looked like she was having a seizure on stage üòÇ
Why are we so bent out of shape about this?

So we sucked at one of a bazillion Olympic sports -- welcome to how it goes for the lesser funded sports. For a country complaining that the US and China can't take a ribbing from us about medal counts, we sure are getting pretty butthurt about this.
> are there not young, hip australians who do breakdancing to a competitive level?

I really don't think there is. There's like a handful of people in the country who do this, it's a hobby not a sport.
She is a middle aged White baby boomer's idea of a "breaker".
Ray Gun wouldn't have even been to the backstreets of Blacktown, Liverpool, Fairfield, Penrith , C Town, or Bankstown.

She is from elite, White, classist blood stock trying to make her existence relevant for some reason. This stinks.
She was a little better, she would have still lost every round of the Olympics. That same girl entered the international qualifying event and came 38th out of 40.
If it was Interpretative Dance competition, then I‚Äôll give her that.
i'd bet that everyone in that video would still be able to do better than raygun, even if they're in their 50's.
This is on point. 

I think she over-intellectualised whatever she was doing. She was probably trying to do something so clever and meta that she just totally missed the mark.
It's understanding something vs being able to perform it. I understand how you're meant to perform cello pieces but I would struggle to actually play the cello.
> but lacking in stage presence and poise.

Pretty much. As someone who knows very little about breaking but did grow up working class in the country, her performance reminded me a lot of people I see now living in Sydney who put on a larrakin act and wear the RMs despite growing up in the city and often middle or upper class upbringing at that.
Love your Napoleon Dynamite reference. Especially considering I‚Äôve seen suggestions she should be renamed ‚ÄúNapoleon Vegemite‚Äù
She has a PHD in breakdancing. 

She probably dances like that because of some shit about "skill barriers being elitist" or dancing with no practice/study being the "re-democratisation of rhythm". Some avant garde shit you'd need to write a thesis to explain.
In other countries that society sourced the world's best breakers. The men's breaking was the best of the best.
Yes, Chris Lily is actually a half talented breakdancer.
Maybe that's the grand plan, she will be set academically for life.
> She acknowledges an athletic deficit but it‚Äôs just that you don‚Äôt understand or appreciate her creativity and artistry

tbh i think *that's part of the troll*
>athletic deficit but it‚Äôs just that you don‚Äôt understand or appreciate her creativity and artistry. 

So she's victim blaming...
She's a painfully self involved snooze fest who is surrounded by simps who keep telling her how great she is at break dancing. She's the William Hung of dance.
She hopped like a kangaroo..
It has a "Hello fellow kids" vibe doesn't it.
The only thing she polished was the floor when she was spinning around on her back
Break dancing in the Olympics is a bit of a cringe.¬†
[Looking at some stellar dancers](https://youtu.be/DUroSgWIVEY?si=ZcvSmGl1ugVBaOdm) I can see why it could be showcased in the Olympics. But the entire competition felt very out of touch. Felt like the scoring was based on what was cool 20 years ago, rather than showcasing the standards for today.
Her [qualifying performance](https://youtu.be/MorhA98eK7M) was better

Edit: not *good* by any competitive standard, just better than her Olympic performance.
It probably won't be after this. Maybe that was her plan ü§î
She‚Äôs been an elite breaker for a decade, National and Oceania champion, has a coach and trains 3-4 hours a day while working. Whatever circumstances created this situation, lack of practice isn‚Äôt the story here.
That, and about half of the other events currently in the Olympics.
Not sure about that. Some of her moves were okay but she really didn‚Äôt seem to have much of a sense of rhythm compared to some of the other competitors.
She's been a dancer most of her life, she knew exactly what she was doing
breakdancing appeals to younger generations.

ballroom dancing, to a much lesser degree.
Yes the balltoom dancing took over the breaking, but there is no reason to beleive they tried to tank it, you just made that up. They just ran is badly because they are a ballroom dancing organisation and not a breakdancing one. Making dancing a joke does nothing to advance their actual goal of getting ballroom dancing into the Olympics.
Lol so it is a psyop
> Doesn't Australia spend gigantic amounts of money on sports?

We do, but only a very select group of them, anything that isn't one of the major medal winners literally get told to figure themselves out.
She should be familiar with the history. She studies break dancing for her day job.

I think thats why so many people are annoyed. She was well aware that she wasn't good enough (shes said it herself) and she should have been in a good position to help someone who was actually good but may not have understood the qualifying side of things
Pretty sure she is a sociologist of hip hop culture, so I would hope she is familiar with the history. Kinda the job.
I think she‚Äôs definitely familiar and knows all about the art form, she‚Äôs just kayfabed herself into thinking she can participate in the art form
Now your preaching to the Choir. Amen and Hallelujah!
I remember when I smoked too much weed one time as a teenager and I couldn‚Äôt get off the couch because I couldn‚Äôt get my arms and legs to work properly but I had to pee so I rolled off the couch onto my face and shoulder and kind of straightened my legs to inch my way closer and closer to the bathroom, twisting my hips as I alternated shoulder and cheek to finally reach the bathroom.   When I finally got there I realised I didn‚Äôt actually need to pee so I rolled over and flopped myself back in between the couch and the TV and continued watching some weird episode of Neighbours when Toadfish was a lawyer and in court.
If the whole performance was a troll, then it was brilliant. But if she was taking herself seriously...¬†
Massively tone deaf from Meares. Even if she was dumb enough to think it (and in her job, most of the blood goes to the lower half of her body), you NEVER insult the customers by saying that out loud. 

Everyone loves the Matildae, and (more deservedly) the cricketers. We watched the swimmers at all hours of the night. We would certainly have mocked a male ‚Äúdancer‚Äù for a clownish Skippy impersonation.
To be fair a lot of her 'research' isn't peer reviewed because it's personal opinion and not actual research
Agree. The fact that so many people are talking about this, chatting on social media platforms etc signifies that a lot of people detected that there was something not right about this and rightly so. We the taxpayers help fund the Olympic team going to the Olympics, so surely we have the right to question when something does not seem right! This has nothing to do with misogyny
> The idea that people can't be critical of a poor performance because the athlete is a woman is absolutely lacking any credit.

Go say that in r/StarWars (substituting "actor" for "athlete")

I dare you ;)

Meares would be at home there.
Of course people can be critical, but there have been thousands of comments calling her a national embarrassment, attacking her career, one implied her partner was also at fault etc. maybe its not misogynistic in nature, although it's not as if the Internet has had a good track record with not leaping at the opportunity to ruthlessly tear into women who had the fault of being bad at something. Like peer review doesn't go around personally implying that someone is a national embarrassment.

If anything has been the embarrassment out of all of it's been the outrage that a bad breakdancer has gotten to the point where it feels malicious to an extent. Like it's a one off Olympic event, it's not that serious. Frankly no Olympic event is that serious, certainly not enough to constitute the shit people have been saying over the last 24 hours. Seriously, you'd think they had committed actual crimes and not danced badly. Like are you going to say that the nature of the like criticism has been at all reasonable? Because I would not be surprised if the other Olympians say something very similar to Meares here. Like well done Australian internet we have had our most successful Olympics ever but the thing that will probably take up significant headways is mocking a 36 year old who had the audacity to win a qualifier even though they dance badly.
True and it‚Äôs also patronising to women. I‚Äôm sure there are women that are capable of doing much better than her as well.
Exactly. She had to defend Gunn. No issue with that. But to claim it‚Äôs misogony?
Tough job for Meares but she did quite well. Just one unforced error which is a bit better than Raygun
Agree, she was way off the mark there, trying to garner the public's sympathy with some bullshit story about this person crying in a locked room at a break dancing competition because it's a male dominated "sport". Always having to play the victim, toxic feminism at work.
She's gaslighting us.
That is exactly what happened. The performance was awful, self-indulgent and embarrassing, and she's also getting more hate than a 36 year old man would have.
Except there was no whiff of irony or larrikinism. It wasn‚Äôt a pisstake, it was unironic.
Hip hop culture doesn't have self-deprecation or larrikinism in it like that. This is not what breakdancing looks like whatever your gender.
Yep, if it were a man he'd be bailed as a "legend" for two days, had a few clips played on Sunrise and then it'd be all forgotten about, but because it's a woman it's being given nationwide attention and plastered everywhere imaginable.
That is kind of what breakdancing is about. You make it up as you go because you don‚Äôt know what music is about to play and what moves the opponent is going to do in the dance battle. 

The key is to actually do break dancing moves while improvising. 

It‚Äôs like she went into a freestyle rap battle but instead of rapping she sang nursery rhymes.
"I'm a kangaroo!"
the kangaroo part
It was a bit like the Finally scene in Priscilla?
She wrote that and then went on to, literally, create the reality that made what she wrote undeniably true? I dont know if that is brilliant or appalling.
Why compete then? Doesn‚Äôt that go against her own research?
from one of the other threads on this, apparently the body that represents ballroom dancing that was trying to get added to the olympics effectively took over breaking, basically saying "we can't have what we want, so we'll take the one that did get in, thanks". Would explain why the contestant picked by that organisation was someone who didn't believe in the sport.

I don't follow any of those sports though, so not sure if that's just one version or the truth.
TBH academia in Australia discredited itself long before this.
She said in an interview she wasn't athletic enough so went for creativity
A lot of people do. If they put the effort in.
>"this is worse than Gallipoli"

I laughed hard. Then felt bad. I'm definitely going to hell
Unironically, if someone competent competed and won, 99% of us wouldn't have really cared. This, though? Absolutely worth it, she's a legend in my book.
> It‚Äôs the gift that keeps on giving!

I‚Äôm absolutely loving the level of unhinged vibes coming from uptight people who don‚Äôt realize they look absurd. 

Some of the finest examples of Poe‚Äôs Law in the mix too.
All these people with their Aussie egos a little bruised, lol. 'Setting the sport back 20 years', a 'national disgrace', 'taxpayer dollars that I never cared about until right this second'. And literally no one else gave this more than a few minutes thought. Every other non-Australian reddit thread about it is just full of embarrassed Australians unable to let it go, and few other bemused people who thought it was funny and would have never thought about it again if we didn't keep harping on about it. We are doing it to ourselves.
She qualified for the event through a private organisation who introduced breaking to their organisation because the ballroom dancing they are known for would not be an Olympic event and they wanted to go to the Olympics for something.
Surely they could decide not to send a competitor to an event where we don't have a shot in hell of being competitive at all?  She failed to score a point.  54-0 or something like that?

As a Sports Minister, you'd have to weigh prudent use of taxpayer money when making a decision as to the size and composition of our delegation?
There were athletes in track cycling that qualified and weren't allowed to participate because of funding. Did you hear any controversy about that?
Well in the Women's marathon on this afternoon we've sent our runners with the 1st, 2nd, and 5th best qualifying times. 3rd and 4th ran faster than 5th in the same race but weren't selected.
Raygun just did more for breaking in Australia than any competent middle ranking could have possibly.
It's about $500m annually in funding for the whole sports thing.  I don't disagree, I'd be happy to send a far smaller delegation, commensurate with our population, for a fraction of that budget.  If they were all funding themselves or sponsored, go nuts.  But if it's on the taxpayer, I'd much rather have that tax money back or spent on something better.
At least in swimming the winner is measured clearly and easily. These judge scored "sports" are stupid.
What she did is sillier though. I haven't seen anyone saying we shouldn't have sent the other break dancing competitor.

Agree
They should have done parkour
The Brisbane Olympics will have ‚Äúreal handball‚Äù and there will be similar articles/rants/outcry  about Europeans when their teams get done over outside the mt Gravatt state high tuck shop.
Massive in France... because there is a huge immigrant population. North Africans, West Africans and other cultures have taken this Hip Hop culture to cites like Nice, Lyon and Marseille.. 
It's how people from rough upbringing or poorer societies   give back to each other... it's camaraderie for them, like a brotherhood or sisterhood.
Yeah it's great to keep the tourists gazing while your mates take everything out of their back pockets. Shame they didn't choose pickpocketing as an Olympic event.
Doesn't change the fact that the average mall-busker breaker is more polished and entertaining to watch. I notice her comments about creativity and not trying to compete directly came after the fact, so I'm not sure that I buy it. Unique doesn't necessarily equal good.
Fuck news com au

>While mainstream Australia had yet to turn its eye to the new event, we were being exposed as international also-rans.

Plucky underdogs when we win. Shameful embarrassments when we lose, apparently.

In all this, I‚Äôm yet to see what Raygun has done wrong in being selected to deserve the hate she‚Äôs receiving.
Well alot of people are taking themselves a wee bit too seriously then.

If she's not on the next season of dancing with the stars then channel 7 have let themselves down...even more...again....
Australian of the year material right there. All Australian children should have to learn that kangaroo move.

So whatya call that then... 'That's the kangaroo' ... bloody legend
Well yes but you‚Äôre not pretending to be a playa
Mate, don't expect people who have never done a PhD or have any concept of what it means to do a PhD.
Whilst I agree with you, you aren‚Äôt at the Olympics representing our country in AFL, are you?
[deleted]
And since they‚Äôre entirely accurate in the article, why would that be a bad thing?
Funny because I just read that Raygun used to be a ballroom dancer. Coincidence?
The only participants in the qualifying event were all of from Rayguns group called "Ausbreakers". The secretary of the group was one of the judges. Registration for the event was only done through the ausbreakers website.
I only know what's been in the news the last few days, same as anyone else. But I would say that it was announced as an Olympic sport in 2019 and I think any competitive breaker (or whatever they call themselves) with Olympic aspirations had ample time to find out how to qualify.

Some people may have chosen to boycott the event because they didn't like how it came to be, but there hasn't been any suggestion that anyone noteworthy just didn't know about when the competitions were or anything like that.
Every qualifying comp worldwide was organised by the same org. Not the cause.
Probably not, bit it's doubtful they did that in any country, and yet our breakdancers came last.

I feel personally attacked by this.
We have gun control.  You can't just throw out strays like this
where there are humans, there will always be varying degrees of abuses of power and corruption, unfortunately.

things always sound nicer as abstract concepts compared to in practice or reality, but despite the behind-closed-doors manoeuvrings, i guess in some way, global sporting events do achieve what they set out to do which is bring all the world's people's together when they converge in one country, using sport as the uniting factor.

who knows - you could also argue that it's a vehicle for wealthy countries - who have the funds to invest in developing their athletes - to massage their egos and another way to display their power and might to the rest of the world.

that's arguably why on US news websites, early in the competition when china was ahead in gold medals, they would still put themselves as #1 leading the scoreboard because they were going on total medals. Maybe other western countries followed suit and put US number one.
i think that more than anything people are embarrassed. The word "cringe" comes up a lot.
Yeah, breakdancing never really gained traction here, probably because shuffling is/was incredibly popular.
You really think this shits happening in CTown, Bankstown and livo?

Mate I live in CTown and I can tell you that there isn't the sort of counter-culture you think there is lmfao.
Chuck D, Ice Cube and Snoop Dogg could all dance with more rhythm and they're all over 50 and stoned outta their minds!

She wouldn't even know HIP HOP if it smacked her on the backside..
I don't think she over intellectualised it at all. 

She just didn't have the athleticism/technique to pull it off.

Which isn't even that unusual. Plenty of athletics coaches can't run as fast as the athletes they coach. Plenty of gymnastics coaches can't pull off the tricks their Olympic level students do.

Plenty of choreographers are worse at their routines than the dancers that work under them. Plenty of conductors are worse at playing an instrument than the musicians under them. Plenty of top tier directors are worse at acting than the actors.

I think she knows that she can't compete against the the crazy tricks, and so figured she may as well do something *interesting/artistic* rather than something *boring*.

Plus, the whole "this is why academia is a sham" angle that a lot of people seem to be taking is just culture war bullshit coming from people who clearly never had any interest in dance before this, and probably will continue not to have any interest in dance after this.
I grew up rural and moved to Sydney for uni. 

Your comment reminded me of someone i knew at uni. The private schooler wearing the boots, hat, and a plaid shirt who would talk about being true blue and thought he was gods gift to women x'D


**RAY-GUN-DO**

I'm Rach, founder of the Ray Gun Do Break Dance system! 

After one week with me in my dance school, you'll be prepared to defend your breaks with the **STRENGTH** of a grizzly, the reflexes of a **PUMA**, and the wisdom of a man.
PhD in Breakdancing! Did she invent that? Has she spent time with dance groups in the US, Asia or Netherlands? Has she spent time living the culture?

This whole thing stinks... She must live in a bubble if she thinks she is any good.
Honestly kinda wild that you just made up a bunch of reasons to be angry about someone that have no relationship with reality
How did the Aussie guy do though? I didn't see him listed in the finals so it seems like Australia wasn't big into it.
Best in the suburb.
Did she say that specifically, or is that how you've chosen to interpret her words?
TRUE! Man I‚Äôve been the victim of seeing these clips for the last couple days. It feels like an eternity. She may not have the self awareness to feel shame, but by god do I feel it for her. Absolute cringe inducing embarrassing performance if you can call it that.
Which then got hit by a car.
As a non Australian I'm finding the kangaroo hop hilarious üòÇ maybe you are all getting cultural cringe
+1 for that fo sho
She seemed to integrate a few animals. Some of her routines looked like a lizard as well. Thought it was fitting tribute to our Aussie wildlife.
it has a Fatboy Slim 'praise you' filmclip vibe.
They allow prancing horses...
All the top break dancers were doing thr kangaroo hop 20 years ago, I take it?
Newsflash. It wasn‚Äôt cool 20 years ago
That was still awful. She has no fluid movement. Half the time she's rolling on the floor pretending to be dancing.
Jesus. That coach is stealing a living
The men's breakers are on the record as having commented from a place of knowledge and the worst thing any of them have said was her routine was a bit old fashioned.
Yeh but who does **ball dancing** appeal to...?
I read an article on reddit like 12 hours ago that heavily implied exactly that
Ahh, the lack of a cheer squad to support them and get eyes on it.

I have a cousin who got on the international cricket team, he only played a season....but he basically became royalty after it. Celebrity is Hella strange.
Not just that, but has written about how breakdancing is being colonised and is losing its charachter by going into the Olympics. 

So she turns around and does this? It‚Äôs even more offensive. 

Look at our male competitor Jeff Dinner (J-Attack) He wore the exact same outfit and looked so much better than she did because he has talent.
I think you might just overestimate the Australian lady breaking scene mate. I've seen this line now a number of times but I've seen zero footage of any female Aussie breakers that are good provided as evidence they exist.
She's now become an indelible part of breakdancing history - perhaps the most iconic breakdancer of all time! 

Accidental or diabolical?
I guess I'm confused that emotional self expression can be a highly competitive sport, given how subjective emotional resonance can be to a given piece of art especially a form that is inherently contextual to vibe the audience is giving off.

I've tried to, but I was born with two left feet.


I'm more into the electronic scene, but I've been learning up about the history and why it resonates so much with queer neurodivergent weirdos like myself.

Finding out that Hip-hop is a cultural sibling to the electronic scene both being born in the shards of the dying exceedingly queer and brown disco scene was a cool piece of connective history.

Makes you wonder what the death to disco rioters were really thinking when it happened.
Was this when you first realized your Olympic dreams were achievable?
I had a sinilar experience trying to get to my hotel room from a tuk tuk in Cambodia, except it was after 3 jugs of vodka/redbulls.
Are you telling us you are Raygun?
Is that you Raygun?
The above is Rayguns thesis on Breaking she submitted for her PhD
Another woman here. Please don't pull the misogyny card.



Today I saw my cat try to get poop off his butt by scooting on the floor, and I swear his performance was better breaking than whatever this is.
Hard Agree. Anna Meares, champion herself, no doubt, is way out of line. I have backed the Aussie Girls all the way in this Olympics, as I do every Olympics. Our Girls are the best in the world in International competition. Our spirit, fight, tenacity and will to win, never say die attitude is a badge we all wear with pride. Our girls always do us proud. We gave the best female athletes in the world.

But this wasn't it for RayGun. It was a mismatch of mammoth proportions. It needs to be called out.
It is a national embarrassment.

If going to the world‚Äôs premier sporting competition, acting like a clown and scoring the worst possible score because you‚Äôre an academic not an athlete and shouldn‚Äôt have put your name in the hat to start with ‚Äî and we‚Äôre competing with other countries on the global stage ‚Äî if that isn‚Äôt a national embarrassment, what is?
But she was crying in 2008! This was the least we can do!
Apparently the judges at the Oceania championships don‚Äôt think there are. And the results of the üá¶üá∫ reps that finished WAY below her suggests they‚Äôre correct.
What percentage of people that are commenting on this know anything about breakdancing?
Far enough, thank you for the info, I didn‚Äôt realise that it was part improv. Still looked really bad.
> I dont know if that is brilliant or appalling.

appalling.
Brilliantly appalling.

Or maybe appallingly brilliant.
Narcissistic
Her stated reason for the turnaround: ‚ÄúSo we‚Äôd better make sure that we‚Äôre (breaking community) are not being misrepresented‚Äù. 

And it just so happened that this representation best came from her - a privileged, middle class, white woman bereft of talent but brimming with self regard.
If her goal was to tank the sport, even at the cost of personal ridicule, maybe she's the real winner out of all of this?
She's a selfish grifter.¬†


This kind of hypocrisy is everywhere in liberal arts academia. People making a big fuss in their essays about colonial racial hierarchies blah blah, but they are all too happy to continue taking advantage of it when it suits them.¬†


She could've used the opportunity to guide other actual talented female breakdancers through the Olympics system and genuinely promote the sport/art on the world stage, but instead she chose to do... This.¬†
Maybe she was doing like the guy who willingly drank the stomach ulcer bacteria to prove they caused stomach ulcers? She volunteered as tribute to prove her own theory.
For satirical value? Which in some ways doubles down her point.
This is the olympics haha the whole point is being the most athletic. AOC shit the bed.
Amoebas and single cell organisms show more 'creativity' than she did. What a shit show!
agree to disagree. I can‚Äôt think of one world class athlete who was more explosively athletic in their mid-30s than their mid-20s. Better at the sport maybe, but not as fast/strong etc. Most profesional athletes retire by then.
Ha yep pretty accurate. The whole reaction is quite bizarre. I think it will be remembered in a more endearing light years from now.
Ok, and? Did she personally prevent every other competitor from attending? Like what's your point?
To be fair, the scoring system is kind of naffed. The judges all vote on who is better of the two, there's no sliding scale or anything.

The Aussie b-boy was infinitely better than Raygun. From a non-breakers perspective, he was much better than his first opponent, and only scored a single point out of 18 against him.
Prima facie, she was nowhere near the worst qualified. Oceania champion. Short of actually watching videos and saying ‚ÄúBut this is shit‚Äù the Minister‚Äôs office would not have been able to foresee this farce. And probably would have been crucified had they intervened.
Yeah, but #3 and #4 were daggy. How could we send them.
Do you think kids are going to emulate her? What good? Showing younger, talented kids without her money and privilege that money and privilege is literally all you need to compete? She got all zeros. It did nothing but piss people off that she's there at all.
Raygun has been outspoken in criticising that Breaking received a whopping 35k in funding, which equates to 0.007% of total funding. The only sport which received less was *Frisbee*. She is not the enemy of the Breaking community which everyone seems to be implying - and has actually spent years working at the grassroots level advocating for it.
That‚Äôs the thing. It‚Äôs not sillier than swimming if you don‚Äôt care about people flailing in a pool for 10 minutes. Neither of them are important human activities in the scheme of things. The Olympic are supposed to be a spectacle, and this is a spectacle in every sense.

The actual controversy is that the qualifiers were run by Ballroom Dancing Australia, and they didn‚Äôt invite anyone from the actual breakdancing scene!
Dude parkour would have been amazing
I would so watch it
If you watch the performance she was clearly basing her moves off of Australian animals. Those comments make sense given what she did, moreso than ascribing it to a post hoc excuse.¬†


As well I don't think she was asked about her intentions before she performed.¬†


She did have a few interviews prior but they covered more general topics, noone was like "wtf you doing" in interviews prior.
All true. That Eddy the Eagle was an underdog in a rich man‚Äôs (dangerous) sport, but he ended up with world fame and a film made as well as all the breakages he had to get fixed.  This is an academic woman in a poor man‚Äôs sport, interesting reversal, and complicated by how people respond to gender. Then there was the Jamaican bob sleigh team, also underdogs, hence the success of the film made after. None of them got any medals but gave lots of entertainment to all.
I look forward to doing the Kangaroo alongside the Nutbush at the next wedding I go to
Re-read this small thread discussing PhDs again.   
Warzonexx stated, in other words, that PhD F1 car engineers may not be good F1 drivers, to which I agreed, highlighting the absurdity in the statement. Neither comment makes any reference to the specific Olympic selection issue being discussed elsewhere on the post.
This is exactly it. 

Go walk the CBD of any Australian city at night and odds are you'll spot a group of concrete polishers. If she had a PhD, then she HAS to know a few of these groups. 

Most of these kids/young adults definitely come from fuck all. This opportunity would transform their lives. The truly Australian thing would be to support the new, hungry talent and being fucking proud to do so.
She qualified. And best I can find, she qualified by beating others in local competition.
Her PhD in "breakdancing" was awarded in 2017 and it was only announced as an Olympic sport in 2019 so it would be a pretty incredible conspiracy. Probably should give her a couple of gold medals if it's been a 10+ year plot!
Food for thought I guess
Yes, but I think this proves my point. She went too deep thinking about the culture and meaning of "what breaking culture is all about" and tried to do something creative and artistic. When in reality, at the Olympic level, people want to see flips and spins and crazy feats of athleticism. 

Yes, she knew she couldn't compete at that level and she diluted herself into thinking that the routine she did was acceptable at this level. 

I don't think academia is a sham but I do think that she went so deep into it that she fooled herself into thinking that she was able to perform at this level. It smacks to me of someone who couldn't see the forest for the trees. 

Just my opinion of course.
> PhD in Breakdancing! Did she invent that? 

Feel free to read her thesis and find out https://figshare.mq.edu.au/articles/thesis/Deterritorializing_gender_in_Sydney_s_breakdancing_scene_a_B-girl_s_experience_of_B-boying/19433291?file=34528847
Found the person with another PhD in break dance gender studies¬†
He scored 2 points out of 54. He was the lowest scorer. Eye test he was better than her. He "looked like a breaker" as it were.

People are just refusing to accept we suck at breaking and trying to find fault and coming up with insane conspiracies to account for the simple fact we suck at this thing. 

Sucking at the Olympics is not a crime. Fucks sake we celebrated Eric the Eel as a global treasure.
And then the road crew came and mopped it off the bitumen¬†
It was the funniest thing I've seen in ages!

Do people seriously think she did the sprinkler going "fuck yeah, I look cool as shit!"

Honestly, she's the highlight of the Olympics for me. How seriously were we meant to take the Olympic Sport of Breaking? The judges had bucket hats on for fucks' sake!

"All the flyest B-Boys and B-Girls repping their C-Countries in P-Paris! Yo cuzz, I'm from the streets! Aw jeah!"
oh fo sho man fo sho
I spotted a fish on land.
Treating the olympics like eurovision
Legless Skink comes to mind.
What we need is breakdancing horses.
The coach is her husband
They were being nice... it wasn't old Skool. That's a big slap in the face to Old Skool Breakers..
well, i thought i was being generous, lol
Here's some footage from [Perth](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C-e5auFBjRi/?igsh=enAwNGdybnlqcDNp)
and you've been provided with [footage](https://i.imgur.com/bC5t8Md.mp4) multiple times.

footage you could've googled faster than it took you to write that comment.
Check out Vivica Laver online. Young girl, full of potential.  Probably not the financial clout behind her. Would have been better sending some youngster with some flavour than the actual end result.
I've got at least 10 years on her mate.  That episode of Neighbours aired around 1998 or 1999.  Raygun would've been around 9 or 10 years old.
I'd be shocked if their weren't Australian 500 gymnasts who could breakdance better with 10 weeks effort.


It was a publicity stunt that worked. she's now the most well known breakdancer on the planet
Oh, she's highly regarded. That much is obvious.
she got to go to the olympics and troll the very people who made it a sport.

she definitely won
This is what got me. She clearly had the financial means, but if she was so passionate about it and really knew she couldn't compete, why not sponsor a talented, up-and-coming b-girl to qualify and attend? It comes across as purely ego driven when she even admitted herself that she wasn't on the same level as the competition.¬†
Ok that‚Äôs a different argument. 

World class? Agree with you. 

But athletically peak? A lot of people do. 

Hell a lot of people athletically peak in their 40s or 50s. 

She looked unfit out there. She didn‚Äôt even move well.
Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, Justin Gatlin, Kim Collins. I think they qualify, considering their job is to be fast.
Possibly, we don't know yet. How was the qualification promoted? Did the ballroom dancing associations that ran it approach the break dancing community at all? Or did they just get their ballroom dancing friends to have a go?
Not personally. I don't think anyone holds her personally responsible for anything other than the performance. 100% someone more deserving out there though.
LMAO she might as well have, set back the sport 100 years and was an utter embarassment

Good on her though, managed game the system and get an all-expenses paid trip to Paris for being talentless
All this talk of privilege is just speculation, the reason she‚Äôs there and not someone better is because breaking isn‚Äôt taken seriously as a competitive sport in Australia.

Now, all of a sudden, there‚Äôs 26 million Aussies who don‚Äôt want to be embarrassed like this again*.

*not withstanding that the whole response is overblown.
It‚Äôs definitely tapped a vein of class hatred.

As per usual, though, everyone‚Äôs attacking individual instead asking how it is that others weren‚Äôt pushed forward.
BYO cardboard box to break out the headspins
Fair enough, and I did state that I agree with your point.¬†However I don‚Äôt see it as anti-intellectualism at all.¬†

People aren‚Äôt having a go at her breaking skills because she has a PhD, they are having a go at her because she is supposedly the best our country can offer.

I have watched the competition that won her a spot at the Olympics and I simply cannot understand how the other competitor didn‚Äôt beat her in that last round.¬†
Check out the comment i just added on this.... It actually stinks way worse than you would think and if we had half decent regulators i'd be suggesting an investigation into the organization that has claimed authority of this event having zero history of doing it until their sport was not chosen.
I think you're forgetting, she had 5 years of practice before her Olympic performance.

Even ignoring her performance, how the fuck did Dr Raygun get a PhD with this shit?

Not a good look for Macquarie University.
Bro, he was 16. He was so much better than her... The other BBoys were really good, that's all.
It's not as popular in Australia, dancing in general isn't. 
You almost have to have come from other cultures and backgrounds to appreciate dancing. 
Aussies just don't do it. 
Breaking in Asia, Europe and the US is huge!

We don't dance here.
That‚Äôs magikarp from Pokemon
I expect to see more from you then, your future is looking bright!
Mate don't let your dreams just be dreams, it doesn't matter if you're poking 50 with a short stick, take your inspiration from 51-year-old Andy Macdonald of Britain, who competed in the men's skateboarding park preliminaries.
I think the real story will prove more interesting than just a piss take publicity stunt, which we can rule out. Why would they train ballroom dancers or gymnasts in break?
It rhymes with regarded.
Yeah touch√©. 

I guess I was under the assumption that the people we send to the Olympics are world class athletes. But Ray Gun‚Äôs proved me wrong.
> She looked unfit out there. She didn‚Äôt even move well.

That wasn't lack of fitness, but lack of talent.
only 15 people competed throughout all of oceania. either they didn‚Äôt promote it or actual break dancers couldn‚Äôt afford to travel to it

edit: and now saw in a different comment that the runners up in that tournament tried to get in another actual tournament and placed in the bottom 4 places out of 40
Her breakdancing ability is not a reflection on the quality of her PhD. She doesnt have a "PhD in breakdancing" she has a PhD in cultural studies with a thesis about breakdancing.
Australian universities have bigger problems at the moment than PhDs you don't agree with
It's been paid for.... she is a lecturer at the Macquarie Uni. She went to Barker College.. All these things cost money...

One the breakdancing BBoys, the Ukrainian guy, I think, gave his lunch money to his dance teacher to pay for his lessons, until someone found out.. His teacher then gave him free lessons... he has slept in parks, other people's couches etc, to gain experience in the Hip Hop world of Bteakdancing.. This guy has lived and breathed Breakdancing.

Raygun is fake AF. Everything paid for with old money!
I agree.
I'm already following my dreams of being an internet shit-talker.  

I wish I could still skate though, I fucked up my legs about 15 years ago and haven't been able to ride since.  Muscle memory is still there but the balance hasn't been right since surgery.
Not everyone is. 

But the people who aren‚Äôt are usually from countries who don‚Äôt have the resources to make it by qualifying. 

People keep comparing her to Eric the Eel from Sydney and it‚Äôs so wildly offensive it‚Äôs making me angry. 


Eric lived in a country with no swimming pool. He went along when he heard and literally learnt to swim to qualify. 

He did his performance. 

He then learnt more about swimming and went home and was a national hero. He used that to teach swimming to more people and Equitorial Guinea now has TWO swimming pools and athletes going to events. 

He‚Äôs a fucking hero. RayGun is colonialism personified.
Is that not part and parcel?
And awareness.
Which makes this entire thing so much worse. Dance group that govern this should be shamed. Gonna be such an interesting story when everything comes out
Can you link that comment please?
I disagree.  If she really understood the culture she would recognise she can't dance.
People are generally dumb as fuck when it comes to understanding how this all works but that won't stop you from telling you how this all works
>It's been paid for.... she is a lecturer at the Macquarie Uni. She went to Barker College.. All these things cost money...

You cannot pay to get a PhD in this country, get the fuck out of here with that nonsense. Of course coming from a privelleged background helps enormously but you still have to do the work to qualify for a PhD position and do the work to achieve the PhD.
Eric has a lot to be proud of and I hope he feels that pride in himself.
Eric is a fucking legend. Using his Olympic performance to promote the sport of swimming in his home country and teach a survival skill.
Yeah it‚Äôs inexcusable from the AOC and incomparable to Eric, he‚Äôs a hero.
You can disagree but you don't even know what you're arguing about. You're conflating wholly unrelated things.
EXACTLY!!! She'd get clowned on the street if she tried this shit in front of real breakers. Dance battles are like martial arts, she looked more like the wiggles.
Sure, Breaking and Breaking culture are entirely unrelated.  

B Karen got found out about her Breaking skills,  you're arguing she has a different skill set in her cultural knowledge? 

You saw what she thinks is Breaking right? Even I know that shit was whack and would only convince white middle class academics who had never seen a breakdancer....and you apparently.
She was doing Aikido while the competition were doing MMA
