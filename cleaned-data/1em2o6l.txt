Someone had fun calling this “Strikeforce Bandit”
Can the court please take a recess? I need a bush wee.
Has this been cross posted to /bluey?
His lawyers have entered a plea of "gotta be done".
Blue Heelers vs Bluey - The crossover I never knew I wanted!!
600,000 dollarydoos! Tobias!!
63,000 coins and only 189 seized. Wow.
Even Unicourse is disappointed!
Not the done thing
Chili is not going to be amused
Aur naur not the bluey dollary doos.
I don't they'll find their way over to me but I was kind of disappointed to have applied for the Mint release for a set or one of the the individual coins and not get anything. It's like the damn gnomes all over again!
What I noted was bail denied. What about the car-jackings and home evasions. Why did this guy get b denied bail over the many who do violet crime?
It's such a shame they couldn't just called these dollarydoos in the show.
How much is this in relation to our true national currency, the Dollarydoo?
*How rude!*
What a dog act.
That's not the done thing.
I thought it was 63,000 dollar bucks not 600,000
Why didn’t he just steal employee’s wages would have gotten away with a slap on the wrist
The worst part is he didn't even sell me one for cheap. The scalpers in ebay are just as criminal. Just want a coin for my daughter but of course they had to make it some limited bs which means 90% are on ebay for $250
“Oh, Biscuits!”
>The NSW Robbery and Serious Crime Squad launched an investigation under Strike Force **Bandit**.
Wouldn't get you much at Hammerbarn these days
If you want to get a lot of coins at least get them legitimately like Mario
Coming up with names like this would be my ideal job.
Has anyone mentioned the epic moustache the cop in the article has?

I see detective in his future
Well you should have done a tactical wee.
"Allegedly"
I thought I was on there for a sec.  There was a post there recently about which Bluey characters you'd assemble for a heist team! 
Until I read the other response to your comment, I thought I was on Bluey LOL now it's even funnier
Closely followed by "annnnnd why should I care?"
The judges response, "That's okay, mate, you're tough"
he's playing keepy-outta-prison
How tf do you even offload that much of a brand new collector's coin so quickly without raising suspicion? Like if you're paying for more than $30 in the exact same coin i'm suspicious. If it's over $100 i'm probably calling the cops.

Like i'm struggling to think of how you could transact $63 000 -$630 000 of goods in the space of about a week and a half in the same $1 denomination.
Have you seen how many of the damn things are on facebook marketplace?
Same lol.

At least the gnomes are coming back to Bunnings!
I got one coin and then looked on ebay to see how much it would cost to finish the set 💀
These are actually different coins that were due to be released in September. They're still Bluey, but not quite as pretty as the ones everyone (me included) missed out on.

Bunnings actually had the gnomes again this weekend too.
My local (regional east Vic) had a pallet of the gnomes this week. I really wanted a husband, but I was a responsible childless grown-up and thought of the kid that may miss out because of me lol
Dollaroos
63,000 dollarbucks. The 600,000 figure is the value in dollarydoos.
about tree fiddy
well snickers is a lock, obviously. and muffin is the getaway driver.
Pokies?
Perhaps pokies or casino given they both like to support money laundering.
Definitely should've gone to the pokies with them, friendlyjordies and boy boy have both shown how easy it is to launder money there.
Can you stick them in a change machine at a bank and get notes back? Or somewhere that doesn’t have a camera?
My guess would be a friend's house and a lot of eBay sales, which probably is what got him caught, perhaps. There is no way he sold that many individually. Probably sold some bulk amounts as well to people.
They weren't using these as currency, they were selling them to collectors - at a mark up of $10 per coin.
They were back on Saturday just gone.

And probably sold out again just as fast.
God damn Loch Ness monster
They were selling them to collectors.
Clubs NSW turn a blind eye.
I gave him a dollar.
Star/ Crown would like some of that action please
She gave him a dollar!
