I run them over on the roads. If on my verandah, I double plastic bag them and freeze. Disgusting horrible things who are killing our native wildlife and poisoning our dogs. Good luck to anyone killing these imported toxic pests.
Why are they unusual? The vast majority of Aussies eat stuff and wear every other animal under the sun (except dogs because that's unethical lol).

Juicing them is a bit weird though. Unless you drink milk.
My brother whilst living in QLD would send me pictures of them, splayed out in beautiful ballet poses after a good bat whacking.
Having been in areas where they’re at plague proportions, I’m not convinced there’s anything anyone can do about them. Kill as many of them as you can but their population is increasing exponentially faster than you’ll ever be able to kill them. It sounds defeatist because it basically is. They’re migrating further and further south and I honestly don’t know how we’d ever manage to stop them.
I'd imagine its because we get used to eating what we have been brought up with. It's why people from different cultures get grossed out at eachothers food. An example is my partner is like how could anyone eat rotten cabbage, and I'm like dude that's sourkraut (yeah I know I spelt it wrong lol) and it's delicious!
