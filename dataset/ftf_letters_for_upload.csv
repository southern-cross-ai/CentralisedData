Letter from Mavis Lamrock,"Letter written on ""Yonder"" stationery (3 pages).",Mavis Lamrock,4/10/1991,ftf_thankyou_lamrock,University of Western Sydney,"“Yonder” 74 River Road, Emu Plains, 2750 4th Oct. 1991 Dear Robyn, How nice to meet you yesterday. You stirred many memories. Wendy & Jennifer kept on reminiscing. Regarding amusement in younger days my age group had many parties in homes & picnics centred on the river & surroundings. In wartime a very active womens group in Emu knitted, sent food parcels & had meals for any army troops passing through. My mother, Mrs Hunter learned to make camouflage nets – a friend had an empty shop in High St, Penrith. Mother decorated the window with nets & needles & needles & measuring boards. Each Tuesday morning as my husband drove to the office he took Mother to the shop where she “netted” all day – also taught people who wanted to help. Also she visited our local Prison Farm 2/ each Monday evening & had a group making nets. Again my husband drove her, also he made the needles and wooden measuring boards. The needles were quite intricate(?) – also wood. A bundle of nets would be sent to Service H.Q quite regularly. The Land Army was formed on my parents property “Yodalla” my father not only had an orchard. He planted a large vegetable garden in part of it & was able to teach the girls all about land work. The wife of the Governor of N.S.W at that time subsequently paid my parents a courtesy call & had tea with them. Quite a number of younger women in my age group & a bit older attended First Aid courses(?). then later Home Nursing, having to go for exams at the end of each one. I do not know if I referred to the mission that brought half 3/ cast girls & young women from Groote Island and Arnhem Land because of a possible Japanese attack. My mother worked to place as many as possible. We each had one working in our home for some years. After the war some stayed on, some in family situations as husbands came down but most girls were glad to go back to the mission areas they came from. If you wish the piece about my husband can stay in. He was the only resident full time solicitor between Parramatta & Katoomba. Hope you can read this & I know I keep misspelling words because I write so quickly. Sincerely Mavis Lamrock",Paper
Second letter from Mavis Lamrock,"Letter written on ""Yonder"" stationery (1 page).",Mavis Lamrock,2/01/1992,ftf_thankyou_lamrock2,University of Western Sydney,"“Yonder” 74 River Road, Emu Plains, 2750 2nd Jan 1992 Dear Robyn, New Year resolution – write letters. Meant to send this copy before but thought it might get caught up in Christmas mail. Do not know if you want the tape back or is this a copy. Have not heard it right through  yet – I do dislike listening to my own voice, but will finish it soon. Best wishes for 1992, we are going today to Avoca beach for a few days. Sincerely Mavis Lamrock",Paper
Letter from Winsome Phillis,"Letter written after the interview, highlighting a few corrections needed to the transcript and providing additional detail around some points.",Winsome Phillis,22/02/1992,ftf_thankyou_phillis,University of Western Sydney,"67 Riverstone Rd. Riverstone. 2765 22nd February, 1992 Dear Robyn, After reading the copy of the transcript of our interview 13/12/91, there are just a few matters I would like to draw to your attention. 0.22 I have referred to Sister Barnes’ Hospital as a Nursing Home, but this is not correct. It was a Private Hospital for Mothers and Babies, so I should have called it a Maternity Hospital. Could you please adjust this. Sister Barnes was a fully qualified Sister, and occasionally helped out with the other medical problems in the town, but mainly she dealt with Mothers and Babies. I have been told that she was a wonderful woman – at times she would even sleep on a mattress on the floor to make room for extra Mothers in her Hospital. 3.51 When I said our toilet was ‘out the back’ maybe I should have explained more fully that it was a separate small timber building about 20 feet from the back door. It contained a wooden seat with a black Sanitary Can underneath; the used Can was removed every week by the 2/ Sanitary Carter and replaced by a clean empty can. 9.42 When I left school I went in to Sydney where I attended Peacocks’ Comptometer College in Martin Place. (You might like to edit the spelling.) Thank you for the tape and I hope the photos turn out well. Yours sincerely, (Mrs) Win Phillis.",Paper
