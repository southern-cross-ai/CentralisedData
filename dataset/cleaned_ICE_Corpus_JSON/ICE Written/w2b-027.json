    "text": "ECHIDNAS IN THE HIGH COUNTRY BY GORDON GRIGG, LYN BEARD MIKE AUGEE DEPARTMENT OF ZOOLOGY UNIVERSITY OF QUEENSLAND SCHOOL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCE UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES OF ALL AUSTRALIAS 150 OR SO native mammals, only the Shortbeaked Echidnas Tachyglossus aculeatus have a distribution that can be said to be Australiawide. They are found in deserts, wet and dry sclerophyll forests, rainforests and heathlands. They are even seen in the high country of the Australian Alps. This remarkable range of habitats does not fit well with the usual stereotype of Echidnas as primitive, egglaying holdovers from the earliest days of mammalian evolution. One would expect a living fossil to survive only in an isolated habitat to which it was specifically adapted. To be widespread and even common in such a diversity of habitats must require a great range of physiological and behavioural skills. We wondered if their secret was advanced adaptation or primitive plasticity. In the traditional manner of comparative zoologists, we decided to approach a general question by looking at an extreme. The Australian Alps, above the snowline, provide an extreme habitat, and we knew that Echidnas could be found there. Crosscountry ski enthusiasts told us of seeing Echidnas out and about in the middle of winter, poking about in the snow, and there was even a reliable report of one within a few metres of the summit of Mt Kosciusko. Such observations might be considered a bit unusual for a fox or a possum, but they begged further investigation for an animal often accused of primitive thermoregulation, heterothermy and incomplete homeothermy. Of course one explanation for such sightings could be that the individual Echidnas were outside their normal winter range, perhaps stranded at higher altitudes to which they had wandered during the warmer months. Alternatively Echidnas might live there year round, spending the winter under the snow and emerging from time to time, a pattern reminiscent of mammalian hibernators. But they couldnt do that One of us M.Augee had frequently stated that Echidnas are not hibernators. It was there in blackandwhite, in scientific journals. That conclusion had been reached because captive Echidnas would only enter torpor reluctantly. In early studies carried out at Sydney University by H. Wardlaw in 1915, most Echidnas that did enter torpor died. Besides, the mating season is usually stated to be in JulyAugust mid winter, a most inconvenient time to be in hibernation There were a few anecdotal reports of Echidnas found in a lethargic state in the wild during winter one reported to have been dug out by earthmoving equipment, but no field data where actual body temperatures had been measured. We felt that the only convincing data would be that collected in the field and the only way to collect such data would be by radiotracking see box. So we applied to the Australian Research Council for funds to solve the puzzle. In preparing this application we found very little in the literature about the biology of Echidnas in the field. The lack of field studies is probably related to the difficulty of relocating Echidnas and the impossibility of trapping them. The obvious technique to use was telemetry, employing modern, implantable, longlived, temperaturesensitive transmitters that are small enough to be easily tolerated by an animal the size of an Echidna. But first to find some Echidnas in the alpine habitat. We put out the word amongst the staff of Kosciusko National Park KNP that we particularly wanted animals from the highestridges, as well as a control group lower down in the WastePoint or Jindabyne area below the snowline. Meanwhile the grant had been obtained and laboratory work began at SydneyUniversity, with Grigg and Beard perfecting the techniques of implanting transmitters within the peritoneal body cavity.Whenever possible we went to KNP in the hope of finding Echidnas ourselves. As luck would have it, the very first animal that turned up in KNP was in a perfect spot for the study. Early in 1987John Whittaker, while delivering skitrail poles to Prussian Plain at 1,720 metres elevation on the crest of Ramshead Range southwest of Perisher, captured a tancoloured female weighing about three kilograms. We implanted a transmitter and released her at the exact site of capture. The weather was warm as she crawled out of the opened sack and took a couple of hesitant steps onto the snowgrass. After sniffing the air she hastily burrowed into the soft earth. Although designated E10 Echidna number ten, this was the first animal released in the Kosciusko study area. Over the next few weeks we plotted the position andmonitored the body temperature of E10 as she moved aboutPrussian Plain. We were pleased that she remained there and did not head down into one of the valleys. By now we also had two other Echidnas with transmitters E11 and E13 at Waste Point on the shore of Lake Jindabyne altitude 1,000 metres and another E15 at Rennix Gap 1,580 metres. We also came by a female E12 from Dead Horse Gap, another highaltitude location, and released her onto Prussian Plain after implanting a transmitter. Now we had three animals above and two below the normal snowline, and were ready to establish the summer patterns of behaviour and body temperature before the weather turned cold. IT WAS ALREADY KNOWN FROM STUDIES OF Echidnas in captivity that body temperatures vary on a daily basis, and we soon found this to be true in our summer field study. Most mammals have a small daily variation of a degree or so, being warmer when active and cooler when at rest. We found the Echidnas in KNP to vary daily by 68degreeC. The pattern set by E10 on Prussian Plain in those early weeks turned out to be typical. She was active all day, foraging for small black ants by digging along the edge of fallen timber and under slumps of snowgrass, with a body temperature of 3234degreeCregardless of the weather. Soon after daylight had faded she would hole up for the night in a suitable retreat a hollow log, under a rock, in a disused burrow or, as we observed several times, under a convenient clump of snowgrass. Shortly thereafter, as the lengthening times between pulses from the radio transmitter deep within her showed, body temperature began to fall, quite slowly, as she rested for the night. In these latitudes Echidnas tend to be late risers, avoiding the chill of early morning, so the minimal body temperatures at this time of year were measured between 9 and 10 am and were typically 2527degreeC. When E10 emerged and became active again, body temperature rose rapidly sometimes associated with basking in the sun but more certainly associated with heat produced from muscular activity. Sometimes, when Prussian Plain was swept with wind and rain, she would stay in her retreat and cool further for a day or two before reemerging to forage and warm up, body temperature always returning to 3234degreeC. This was typical pattern during the summer months for all our animals at KNP, and the field data agreed pretty much with conclusions from captive animals, going back to the pioneering work of Prof. C.J. Martin in Melbourne in 1902, that body temperature in Echidnas is highly variable for mammals. To us, following the animals about in their natural habitat, it looked to be a very sensible, energysaving pattern, rather than one suggestive of poor thermoregulatory abilities associated with a primitive animal. We quickly realised how much more data we could obtain and how much extra sleep we might get if we had an automatic sampling system that could gather data overnight. So we invented and deployed a couple of weatherproof systems to record body and ambient temperatures at preset times during the night onto cassette tape see box. It was not until the first apparent disaster in the study that the full potential of these boxes the system was enclosed in a large polypropylene box was realised. At Easter we returned, expecting to turn on the receiver in the vicinity of the last position of an animal and to hear the usual beepdotted linebeepdotted linebeep on the appropriate frequency and at the usual rate. Echidnas seemed to have wellestablished home ranges and were always in the same general area. But when we got together at lunch time Mike Augee, who had gone up to Prussian Plain to locate E10, was pessimistic. He had picked up the signal as expected but it was coming in slowly, with a full 5 seconds between beats. That equated to 3degreeC, which was close to ambient temperature, and Mikes gloomy conclusion was that the animal was dead. However, he had not been able to locate the carcass as the long interval between signals made it hard to get a fix. It did seem to be off Prussian Plain, amongst dense snow gum saplings on the steep southern escarpment overlooking the Bullocks Flat skitube terminal far below. We discussed the possibilities, including predation a fox perhaps and death from exposure. The first snow had not yet fallen but it had been very cold in the mountains. Maybe the Echidnas in the high country really were only strays, at the edge of survival, and this one had just not made the grade. With still a few hours left until nightfall, Grigg set off to Prussian Plain to find EIt was a quick trip over now familiar terrain to a rock cairn at the southern edge of the plain, overlooking the Thredbo River. After a patient search and a lot of scrambling through thick undergrowth on the precipitous slope, the source of the signal was located under a rock at the base of a large sunbleached stump. It was typical for an Echidna retreat and there seemed to be every likelihood that E10 had entered there of her own free will. But was she still alive Telemetry pulses still suggested nearambient temperature. Perhaps the animal was alive and in torpor Here was an exciting problem, but we were committed toleave for Sydney the next day. We needed some way to keep track of the animals body temperature until we could return. The solution was obvious set up a box to take readings not hourly or halfhourly, as we had been doing to make overnight records, but every eight hours to spin out the cassette tape for a couple of weeks until our return. So we climbed again to Prussian Plain early the following morning carrying all the necessary equipment. The sky was blue but it had been damp and cold overnight. On reaching the crest we hurriedly checked the signal. It was more rapid. The animal was now warm It took only 1 seconds for 10 beats, compared to the 45 seconds the previous afternoon. Far from being dead, she had now warmed up. The Echidna story was also hotting up Periodic and rapid warmups from torporare characteristic of hibernating mammals. Were Echidnashibernators too While it was not a sure bet, the odds were changing. We needed more data. We set up the box to record the body temperature every eight hours for the next 15 days and secured the lid down with a large rock gales are the norm on the Ramshead Range at this time of year. Fifteen days later in early May we returned and went straight to Prussian Plain. Yes, she was torpid again, and she had moved. But she had moved to the northern side of the ridge out of range of the carefully placed recording box Murphys Law applies especially to field studies. Our two other highcountry Echidnas, E12 and E15, were also torpid and so was one of the Echidnas in the control group well below the snowline beside Lake Jindabyne. Torpor was beginning to look like a normal event for Echidnas. Only E13 wa still active. The four torpid Echidnas stayed put, with low body temperatures, for the four days of this field trip. We had only two recording boxes, so we left one at the new location of E10 and left the second to record data from another torpid animal."
