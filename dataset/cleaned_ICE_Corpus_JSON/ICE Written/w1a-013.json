    "text": "Superficially it may seem that literary works appeal more to the intellect than the emotions given that active participation is required to decipher a piece of literature. Likewise it may appear that films appeal to emotions, especially of with the use of sensationalism and special effects used to grab an audiences attention. However this does not take into account the fl film makers and the authors ability to l manipulate their medium to create a work. The respective skills expertise of the authorfilm maker and the with and creative use of these, is enough the key to reversing this notion. Intellectual appeal is achieved through active participation, exercise of the imagination, the layering of detail and the multiplicity of levels. It cannot be concluded that only literature fall falls under these elements. Nowhere better is there an example of active participation in a film greater than in Greenaways Prosperos Books. The audience is required to combine all the elements and relate to them to some previous cinematic experience to extract meaning. Greenaway asks the audience to exercise imagination both visually aurally. He layers the images in great detail, using every aspect of photography. It is not the conventional means of achieving simultaneous action and it is the lack of convention that works the mind. Similarly he uses unconventional means in sound. Gielguds Prospero has the voice over for all the characters, a suggeslion suggesting that he has the power over the other characters. When this power is relinquished we hear a more natural realistic use of voices. Likewise sound is used to add depth to character, with distortions for Caliban, echoes and unsynchronised voices. In doing so Greenaway gives the narrative a figurative level as well as a literal one. Shakespeares tale of the Tempest is told but Prospero becomes the creator, and the with Shakespearean power over the content. His pen becomes his sword. The mise en scene is detailed and layered a showing multiplicity of themes. From disorder to order, violence to harmony, nature versus art is all visually presented to the audience, in the detailed imagery that parallels a Renaissance painting. Like Shakespeares poetry, the more Greenaways film is viewed the greater depth of meaning is revealed and on subsequent viewing an audience understands more. It is not the a film that is felt or willed but one where the mind is in control. Films cannot be categorised into those that only mostly deal with emotions as literature cannot be categorised into only appealing to the mind. Literature has the ability to evoke and feelings and tantalise senses. McEwans treatment of the Comfort of Strangers shows an authors skill in touching the disturbing the emotions. Simultaneously he draws the reader and repels. In the same way as Mary and Colin are fascinated with the repulsive the Freudian theory of Unheimlich so to is the reader tantalised by something that is quite disturbing. McEwans to emotional hold over the reader is embedded in the discourse. His style is economical and his careful word choice use make everything said, purposeful. There is the use of many wordunclears that express order and rationality along with those express discomfort and lack of control. Juxtaposition too, ps places routine and pattern alongside disorder and disquiet. Just as the reader feels secure in the text plot it they are imbalanced with something disturbing. There is no nominalisation of the setting, a feeling of insecurity and just as the reader is revealed more and becomes familiar with the known, the plot takes away that security. The reader is beholden to McEwans power, as the just as Mary Colin an are momentarily relaxed in Roberts company to be caught in his power. At this point in the story novel, the reader is not exercising the mind to come to grips with the plot. There may be some psychoanalysis of theme and characters at the conclusion, but the overwhelming ws urge is continue. McEwan has achieved a hold over the emotions while tantalising the senses of the reader. It can b almost be paralleled to Marys urge to scratch the mosquito bites, which knowingly worsen if she does. So the reader is urged to continue in a powerless fashion. Greenaways clever example of an intellectual film and McEwans unclear disturbing novel are fine instances of an film maker and author being able to manipulate their medium. If the art form can be worked to suit the purpose of its creator then it can be categorised into intellectual or emotional boxes. To do this is to deny the ability of a skilled artist. Texts and cinematic translations are fundamentally different medias. They have their own unique set of codes and techniques. It is the use of these codes and techniques that an author a film maker suit to their purpose. A reader or audience will adopt a particular attitude by feeling empathy with the creator or feeling confronted with by them. A playwright has the use of words to create images and time. Hi Themes and viewpoints must be embedded in the discourse and revealed through the characters on stage. Shaws play Pygmalion reveals a number of themes important to his notion of portraying realism. These themes are disguised in his comedy, the art of educating through entertainment. The these of comment on socioeconomic bin level class tied to money is expressed through his variety of characters the EynsfordHills have respectability and no money, Higgins treats all classes equally rude. Elizas independence comes with education, she will be able to teach as Higgins does to make her way, for. The theme of technologys effect on humanity is discussed, Eliza is Higgins Pickerings experiment, devoid of humanity and feelings not taken into consideration. Shaws use of comedy, Mrs Higgins athome party as an example, to enables his audience to escape the realism of the class struggle, they suspend their unclear disbelief momentarily in entertainment. By embedding his attitude in genre, style and technique, Shaw educates his audiences, reveals his viewpoint but disguises it in entertainment that allows diverts the audience to be from the immediacy of the world around them. The film maker must use a different set of codes and techniques to reveal point of view. Pascals, 1938, production of Pygmalion adopts a romantic attitude to Shaws play. Unlike Shaws Pygmalion with its nonromantic outlook between the sexes, the aim this film adopts the opposing view. Although it adheres to the text, for the most part, for it is in the conclusion where the film makers true intention lies. The ending is altered significantly, taking the romantic approach, one universally appealing. In addition to the screen play being a significant element so too are the visual images created. Pascals production has a younger physically attractive Higgins, a romantic quality, all making the romantic conclusion more acceptable. Similarly, Eliza is less repulsive, dirty, whose voice doesnt irritate as imagined it should. The realism if the lower class struggle, its poverty, lack of education and means is softened. These subdued images is creates a a fantasy for the audience and a form of escape. The big screen, with its commanding attention is size, proximity and movement may well overwhelm its audience with i unclear the ugliness of realism. The film maker, in addition to screenplay and characters has used sound and all aspects of mise en scene to develop the romantic notion. The music is melodramatic in Pascals Pygmalion and the to lighting and scenery is subdued concealing the true images of London lower class life. The filmmaker is concerned with making the visual aspects significant whilst the playwright making significant visual Robert Richardson Literature the Novel Both must use the codes and techniques of their own medium to develop attitude The playwrit playwright has only words which are revealed through character plot whilst the film maker has visual um immediacy full of detail, which mu The statement provided in the question do assist in analyzing the unclear story The Dead and the film The Chant of Jimmy Blacksmith. There are other issues touched on in both of these works, though the conflict between two sets of cultural values is evident in both. In The Dead, the conflict, or conflicts, arise essentially between past and present. The figure of Gabriel, product of a new intellectual order, seemingly happy with Gretta, is pitted against the old ways in the shape of many of the other characters. He is of a cosmopolitan viewpoint or at least a viewpoint encompassing more than Ireland, which is one of the basic tenets of the everymans emerging perception of himself versus the world. The old, insular notions of nonquestioning, nonintellectualism are displayed most of all by Gabriel two old aunts. Their old age is a metaphor for the decrepitude into which their thinking has fallen. This is the dying society of The Dead. One of nonquestioning being replaced by another intellectual one. The evidence is to be found at several points through the story. Firstly, there is the discussion of singers, in which despite even the evidence in front of their ears, as it were, of Mr Bartell Darcy, all the best singers were long ago. The golden age for these people is way back when. When it is suggested that such singers exist in other locales on the Continent, it is dismissed as an irrelevancy. They cannot adapt. Gabriel, in his speech, speaks of preserving the old fashioned honest values of welcome and kindness that Irelands famous for. They are being lost to the new hyperintellectuals. It is certainly a cynical and ironic speech, spoken certainly for the audience, given that he considers his aunts to be ignorant. In his mind even it is possible he knows that their kind is slipping away, and he most likely does not altogether mourn for that. There are surprises for him too, however, that are ironic in light of his new thinking. Upon arriving, his programmed chatting with a girl he has seen grow into a young woman, should by the polite game of conversation in this culture, see her happily and conventionally talking of taking her place in the culture regardless of her personal feelings. Instead her exclamations regarding her true thoughts on men demonstrate a break from the past. The fact that Gabriel is not prepared for this shows him to be a unclear raw product of this dying culture, even if he has attempted to refine himself. His The crow to pluck that Miss Ivors has with him points out an even different restructuring from a simple ignorance to intellectual thought. Miss Ivors, while clearly breaking with tradition in many ways, nonetheless seems to see Ireland and its wellbeing the first duty of any citizen. Her gently prodding of G.C. over his lit reviews seems at first a playful jibe, but her calling him, in public, a West Briton, mainly due to his holiday destination it would seem, show that there is not a onetoone correlation between becoming intellectually aware, and increasing ones horizons. The old society of nonquestioning is dying, but it is being replaced by a multitude of new thoughts, as bef its a critically analytical culture. Finally, the revelations that Gretta provides in terms of Michael Furey reveal how pointless Gabriels intellectual travail has been, how much it appears to have stifled him as a feeling person. It points out that the death of a nonthinking culture is not altogether a good thing if the capacity to feel is lost as well. In the end, it doesnt matter. The blanket of snow falls, death comes regardless of thought, and the struggle of birth becomes an irrelevance. Still, this is the central theme of the story, and is helpful to bear in mind in analyzing it. In The Chant of Jimmy Blacksmith, the story is played out against the backdrop of impending federation in Australia. This differs from the dead in that it is only a political realignment, rather than a fundamental cultural emergence."
