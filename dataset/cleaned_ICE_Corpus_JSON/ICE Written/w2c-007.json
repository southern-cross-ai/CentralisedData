The decision effectively ends a fouryear pursuit of World War II European war criminals thought to be living in Australia which has cost an estimated 30 million and failed to generate a conviction. The DPP made its decision on Wednesday after hearing evidence in the South Australia Supreme Court that Mr Wagner, 69, suffered a heart attack last month and a trial might kill him. Mr Wagner pleaded not guilty to being knowingly involved in the deaths of 104 Jewish adults and 19 children with Jewish fathers during Germanys World War II occupation of the Ukraine. He had been due to stand trial in the new year, following extended legal argument. A spokesman for the federal DPP said the charges against Wagner were among the last laid by the Special Investigations Unit of the Australian Federal Police. The unit investigated more than 800 possible war crimes cases between 1987 and 1992 but referred only four cases to the DPP. Charges were laid against only three men, all Ukrainian immigrants living in Adelaide, and the fourth case was abandoned when the unit was disbanded in September The DPP spokesman said yesterday further legal proceedings under Australian War Crimes legislation, which targets crimes committed in Europe between 1939 and 1945, were not expected. We are not aware of any more cases, the spokesman said. The first man charged, Mr Ivan Tymofeyevich Polyukhovich, 76, was acquitted by a Supreme Court jury in May while charges against pensioner Mr Mikolay Berezowsky, 79, were dismissed by a committal magistrate in July. Defence lawyer for the three men, Mr Michael David QC, said yesterday after listening to the evidence for 2 12 years none of these people should have been convicted. Mr David rejected claims Mr Wagner was let off on a technicality and declined to comment on whether the cost of the trials could have been better spent elsewhere. It would be unfair of the public to say Wagner got off on a technicality. he said. The fact was he just couldnt go to trial dotted line it was just objective evidence that he couldnt go to trial. Our client Mr Wagner had a heart attack two or three weeks ago. We called medical evidence in court, we wrote to the DPP and he ultimately, having seen the medical evidence, said the trial shouldnt go on and entered what is called a nolle proseque withdrawal of charges. Mr David said Mr Wagner, who was not available for comment, was very relieved at the decision. Estimated costs to taxpayers for the three cases, not including all the Wagner trial costs, have been put at about 30 million. There is a lot of public opinion about whether they should have gone on or not or whether the money could have been better spent elsewhere. All I can say is they were three very hardfought, difficult cases dotted line and they were very difficult to defend, as well as prosecute, I should imagine, Mr David said. The Jewish community in Australia accepted the DPPs decision not to proceed with the Wagner trial yesterday and defended the 30 million cost of war crimes investigations as the necessary price of justice. The president of the executive Council of Australian Jewry, Mr Isi Leibler, said last night due legal process hadbeen served. I am satisfied that, 50 years after the event, Australia has behaved as well as any country could have been expected to behave, the tragedy being that this the trials should have happened 40 to 50 years ago, when both witnesses and evidence were present in a form that they are not today, Mr Leibler said. He said criminal justice was costeffective in very few cases. Justice doesnt have a price and one doesnt evaluate justice at any other levels, why the question is being asked in this particular situation is beyond me, Mr Leibler said. Dawkins Resigns Treasurer puts his family first BY DENNIS SHANAHAN FEDERAL Cabinet will be reshuffled after Christmas, probably in the new year, after the snap decision by the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, to retire a move that will change the face of the Keating Government and unleash internal rivalries. The main contenders for treasurer include the experienced Minister for finance, Mr Willis, the Minister for Education and Employment, Mr Beazley, and the longterm Keating loyalist and rightwing Minister for industrial Relations, Mr Brereton. But the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, may be tempted to elevate one of his younger ministers. Mr Dawkins announced his desire to retire for personal reasons to Parliament late yesterday shortly after informing the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, and leaving some of his Cabinet colleagues unaware of his intentions. After 20 years in public life I think Ive given all I can give and I think I now look forward to other pursuits, which I am sure will be equally enjoyable. Mr Dawkins told Parliament in the presence of his wife, Maggie. Mr Dawkins said he would always look back with pride on his service as a minister in the greatest government I believe Australia has ever had . I take this step without any of the rancour, without any of the bitterness, without any of the disappointment that I have seen written on the faces of those who have stepped back from executive office, he said. Later, Mr Dawkins appeared at a formal press conference carrying his recently born baby, Alice, and in the company of Mrs Dawkins. He said the difficulties of mixing a family life with his job had been crucial to his decision. Not everybody understands what its like to conduct a sensible family life when you travel 3000 miles 4800km from Western Australia to work each week, he said. Asked what she thought of the decision, Mrs Dawkins said I think its wonderful. Mr Dawkins will remain as a caretaker treasurer until Mr Keating reshuffles the cabinet and appoints a successor. The Prime Minister will consider the options for, and the extent and timing of a Cabinet reshuffle during the Christmas break. Last night Mr Keating said he congratulated Mr Dawkins for a courageous personal decision to relinquish the post of treasurer. I am, of course, saddened at the departure from Cabinet of a friend and a colleague of such distinction, passion and ability, he said. When news spread to the financial markets of Mr Dawkinss decision, the dollar dipped in a kneejerk reaction almost US 5c, with a local closing price of US 40c, compared with a London opening price of US 90c, before it edged back. Government and financial sources said last night Mr Willis was the best qualified of the most likely contenders but that his previous brief tenure as treasurer and a hesitancy as a minister could count against him. Mr Breretons close personal links with Mr Keating and his recent appointment to the Expenditure Review Committee had boosted his chances. But his inexperience counted against him. There was some reluctance within the Right faction to Mr Breretons appointment, although the right would want to reclaim the treasury portfolio. Some labor MPs said last night Mr Beazley could serve as a middle candidate despite his relative lack of financial experience. There have been rumours in Canberra and Perth for months that Mr Dawkins was considering resignation. Mr Dawkins publicly raised the prospect of resignation in September, although after this incident the rumours were strongly denied. At a press conference in September Mr Dawkins appeared tired and declared that he had to admit that whenever it becomes necessary for me to leave Fremantle, get on a plane and come to Canberra, the prospect of political retirement does well in my mind. Mr Dawkins told the press conference he had finally decided to resign on Thursday night and had informed Mr Keating soon after 5 pm. Asked if he had consulted colleagues about the decision, he said it had been intensely personal. In a long speech to a crowded Parliament, Mr Dawkins said he was pleased to have been part of a great government, the government of Bob Hawke as well as the Government of Paul Keating. One couldnt have wanted to have two such important and helpful and indeed inspirational leaders to serve as a Cabinet minister as I have, different though they are, Mr Dawkins told Parliament. I want to say particularly to my friend the Prime Minister what a fantastic inspiration he has been to me during the course of the last 11 years dotted line This is the time entirely of my own choosing, its a time which I think in the natural course of events is the right time for me, at the age of 46, an opportunity to pursue other interests, he said. Although he said he departed without rancour or bitterness and was gratified that the Labor Party had given him, as somebody from a wealthy background,the chance to participate, he referred to his critics in the party in Perth who had not agreed with him. Crowds converge to welcome new year By MARTIN THOMAS and staff reporters HUNDREDS of thousands of people streamed into the nations cities last night to usher in the new year. In Sydney, greatly buoyed by its Olympic triumph, police said a record crowd of 350,000plus packed around the shores of the harbour to witness a milliondollar fireworks show in one of the most highly spirited celebrations in years. A police spokesman reported four arrests before midnight, three for offensive behaviour and one for assualt. But, given its size, the crowd had been remarkably well behaved. One man was retrieved from the harbour at the Quay by water police on a balmy, still, smokefilled night. In stark contrast rain threatened to dampen an already hollow celebration in Hobart. In the wake of one of the roughest SydneytoHobart Yacht races in some 40 years, just 14 boats were at Constitution Dock with their relieved crews ready to partake of the New Years Eve hospitality of the Apple Isle. Almost that many crews were spending their final moments of the year at sea and many more than that celebrating on the wrong side of Bass Strait at Eden, where they were still licking their wounds. Thousands of Melburnians converged on the City Square to welcome in the new year with a rock concert minus alcohol. The city precinct was declared alcoholfree zone for the night by authorities. Other revellers travelled to Lorne, on the southwest coast, for another rock concert where alcohol consumption was also limited. Many more travelled east to Phillip Island. The Victoria Police blitz on traffic, Project 100, was in its final stage with thousands of police on the States roads testing motorists for drink driving. In Brisbane a crowd of up to 80,000 descended on the citys South Bank to see a huge fireworks display. Police rostered extra patrols on the Gold Coast where crowds of up to 20,000 massed. Two hundred police, including mounted police, were on duty on the Gold Coast between Coolangatta and Surfers Paradise. Neither Queensland nor NSW police expected too much trouble, despite the anticipated 10,000 crowd which would throng to the border twin cities of CoolangattaTweed Heads for a double celebration courtesy of daylight saving. Last year 85 people were arrested for drunkenness and a further 75 were charged with a variety of street offences including obscene language and minor assaults. In Adelaide thousands of revellers were massing in King William Street for the traditional Lord Mayors Street Party. In Perth New Years Eve revellers packed the streets and nightclubs of Fremantle and Northbridge and filled the citys restaurants. With no fireworks to blast 1994 in, many were expected to attend concerts including the Hoodoo Gurus, Hunters and Collectors, Died Pretty and the Divinyls. In the wake of wild Christmas Eve celebrations when a crowd of up to 300 youths ran riot in suburban streets, smashing property and pelting police with bricks, police issued partygoers with stern warnings."
