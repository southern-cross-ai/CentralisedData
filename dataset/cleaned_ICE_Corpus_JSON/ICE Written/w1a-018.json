Since that time there has been much discussion about the role of women in Australian history, and ways to approach the portrayal of this role. There has been some impact on mainstream history writing, but much of it continues to perpetuate older images of the Australian past. Other factors and trends have also affected the writing of Australian history and womens place in it. In 1975 Anne Summmers published Damned Whores and Gods Police around the same time as Kingstons My Wife, my Daughter and Poor Maryanne and unclear Wilsons Meal Matilda appeared. Summers in particular was concerned with the origins of Australian sexism she was studying cultural identity. This work fitted very much with the feminism of the mid70s for instance, her attempts to show women as a homogeneous group were part of the contemporary feminist charter. These works are now generally outofdate but criticism of them had the virtue of generating discussion about women in Australian history, and creating discussion about approaches. For instance, reaction against Summers ideas of homogeneity of women as a group led to prompted the suggestion that class and race were significant factors, and thus a more sophisticated fin form of analysis arose the emphasis in these works on women as victims led to another view of womens roles. Despite the many criticisms of these womens histories, they were a radical change from previous st versions of the Australian past. Russell Wards Australian Legend was first published in 1958 it explained the nature of the typical Australian by the absence of women from the Outback, thereby excluding them altogether. Hence the typical Australian was a practical man , and the cult of mateship was generated by an absence of female company. For Ward, the features which enacted the stereotypical Australian were all masculine they did not include the virtues of cwa ladies. This has been a persistent view, despite evidence to the contrary the work of Mary Durack, for instance, has shown that women were an integral part of Australian pastoral and frontier history evidence exists in numerous diaries and letters of women. A revised version of to The Australian Legend was published in 1977, but Ward remained unaffected by the new form of history Summers et al. had suggested was possible. Other historians did make some effort to draw upon the idea that women should be included in history but Cornell and Irvings Class Struggle in Australian History, published in 1980, showed how women largely remained peripheral. The history writing of P. Robinson has attempted to put women back into colonial history. She actively tried to deny the picture of the Summers damned whores and in doing so, pe exaggerated the virtuous qualities of her women still, an interest in womens history allowed her to show that women were active, and in positive ways, in the early colony. One contribution which has been made s by womens and feminist historians is debate over methodology. There is a tension between the idea of writing womens history, which is, in a sense, a separate discipline of history, or whether history should be written with women at its centre. The approach of feminist historians like Summers has a polemic political edge, seeking to understand why, for instance, social structures which oppress women exist the form of history which is certainly more common now in mainstream journals and historical works aims to include women into a full history. The benefits of the latter approach can be seen, for instance, in the work of Kay Marking who, in the early 1980s, investigated the role of cheap female labour in the process of accumulation of capital in the early Australian manufacturing industry. In this way women are portrayed as an integral part of society. The contribution which the use of gender history can make has made to this the writing of Australian history is shown by unclear s article on the Masculinist Context, published in Here she studies gender relations the the masculinist image popular at the time, in popular jo culture such as the Bulletin she shows how this affected mens behaviour and their attitudes to and treatment of women how women suffered as a result, when mens pay went on drink and smokes, and domestic violence was common and how womens reaction against this led th to their participation in the temperance movement. Lake has shown how a study of men can be useful to a study of women and aspects of womens history gender history, the socialization of male female and their interaction, has been shown to play a significant role in history. However, dep despite the clear benefit and contribution of feminist and gender historians, their approaches unclear and methodologies have to not had a major effect on much mainstream history. There has been some effect Lakes article on The Masculinist Context was published in the mainstream Historical Studies, as was discussion generated by it in that sense womens history, is with or topics concerning women, are now regarded as respectable. B. Kingstons Volume III of the Oxford History of Australia shows how women can be suc made a part of a mainstream, general history she shows them to have been an active and integral part of the society she discusses. They are simply there in the main text no question of history and womens history as separate compartments. McCalmans use of oral history in her Struggletown similarly shows that it is possible to write a history in which women play a central part. However, not all is rosy. Jill Matthews in 1988 1986 was able to complain about the far greater number of male contributions to the Australian bicentenary project than women, and also to state that, in these volumes, the role of women generally remained confined to childcare and food production, and providing an audience while men got on with whatever real business . Ken Inglis Australian Colonists has been republished this year, but Inglis felt no need to revise his work to include some women. His index contains one reference to women in public life this consists of one paragraph on women in a 35page chapter on Australian Heroes . Womens feminist and gender historians have made a major contribution to Australian history writing and methodology since 1975 however, the effect seems to have been limited. Where the new approaches have entered mainstream history they tend to have been written by women Kingston, Lake, Moe. Male historians, like Inglis and Ward, remain largely impervious, or even resistant defensive hence Chris McCorvilles reaction to Lakes masculinist discussion he effectively questions whether feminists are the appropriate people to write about male socialization. Qu 12 Oral History. The rise in awareness that traditional history has many gaps and gives only a limited understanding of society has led to the a rise in the use of alternat different methods of gathering of information. One of these is the use of oral history or oral tradition. One school of thought claims that this material represents a valid primary source for historical inquiry if used with care, like that is with reference used to the methods used in the interpretation of other historical sources however, this is to take a very narrow view of what history is and how it must be written it is to run the risk of denying to both individuals and some cultures the right to their own history. Part of the question depends on the definition of history which is accepted. That which seems to be in the minds of those historians who deny that oral sources are history in their own right is the nowtraditional unclear form. This depends upon facts which are objective, and found in sources such as newspapers and parliamentary records. The history created by this approach is the very maledominated history of significant events on a national scale, politics and wars and so on. Oral testimony does not fit this mould, and is thus subject to suspicion from believers in this tradition. However, much older history relied on oral testimony Thucydides, for instance, largely relied on eyewitness accounts, and he is now regarded as largely respectable many medieval historians, such as unclear of Malmesbury in the twelfth century, also relied on oral testimony. These are the sources upon which modern history is based. There is a change of emphasis growing in history, which places more importance on social history, and also the history of groups which are neglected by Rankean history women, the lower classes, nonliterate societies. To many of these groups, oral traditions generally referring to the traditions of a group or culture or reminiscences individual recollections are the only way to retrieve and record their historical experience. It is not a perfect form of collecting historical records. Oral traditions change constantly according to the needs of the society to which they belong, and thus raise the problems for historians looking for facts personal recollections are subject to a wide variety of influences, including poor memory, sentimental overtones, unclear the influence of external sources such as media report which may affect memories. There is also the role of the interviewer questions asked, attitudes or perceived attitudes of the interviewer and som so on, all play a role in the creation of the oral testimony. It is these factors that lead historians to assert that oral traditions and reminiscences are raw material of history, to be interpreted, checked with other sources and, by implication, formed into a type of history which meets a rigid definition of what constitutes history. So, when Loh and Lowenstein published their Immigrants which included a number of oral accounts of migrant experiences without commentary Patrick OFarrell from unsw was able to assert that such a work was not history, although he conceded it might represent some aspects of historical reality. Similarly Forb asserts that history is more than the sum of collective experiences to create historical reality the historian must look for deeper themes and processes which remain hidden to the protagonists. Thus the material gained from oral testimonies is but one source among many on the creation of history. His Oral History can be used as raw material le Roy Ladunes Montaillou is an outstanding example of how oral testimonies, in combination with other resources, can be used to create an anthropological study of a community. This Testimony can be used to confirm or deny what is known from wil other sources Boltons history of West. Aust. in the Depression found testimony from someone concerned to deny the common conception that British immigrants of this period were all slumdwellers. However, to claim that trad oral history in only a raw primary material denies the right of individuals to a history of their own. The To Loh and Lowensteins immigrants, their experience represented a historical reality for Fork to assert that, in effect, they were simply swept along with no idea of the processes at work is a very patronizing attitude. It is one J. McCalman specifically denies in her introduction to Struggletown there she points out that, with moderntechnology, it is impossible to remain unaware of the events of the outside world she aimed to look at the effect of the public world on personal life. This The attitude to oral history and tradition represented by unclear is especially threatening to cultures who do not share the western definition of history so especially nonliterate societies. The ultimate effect of unclear unclears attitude is to deny such people the right to create their own history. A traditional attitude to the use of oral tradition is seen in J Varsinas work in Africa he suggested wrote that collecting oral tradition was rather like gathering various corrupt versions of a text and then studying all of them to find the correct one. Thus, history is facts. unclear Spear, writing on African traditions, claimed that this was entirely the wrong approach that oral traditions represented secondary sources."
