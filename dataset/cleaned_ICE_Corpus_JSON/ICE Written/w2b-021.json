    "text": "Secret world of the Wombat Far from being muddleheaded, as the childrens stories suggest, the energetic burrower has a betterdeveloped brain than any other marsupial. And its lumbering, bearlike exterior masks a remarkably agile frame. Text and photography by Mitch Reardon The cool autumn sun dipped below the rim of the Rams Head Range in Kosciusko National Park. In the golden aftermath, the mountains thickly wooded slopes and the bluegrey clouds were perfectly mirrored in the Thredbo Rivers glassy surface. Sheryn Woon, my guide, squeezed my arm gently, directing my attention from that visual feast to a sudden movement near the base of a spreading manna gum. Wombat, she whispered, gesturing towards a strangelooking, shuffling creature that had appeared at the entrance of a large hole beneath one of the eucalypts horizontally growing roots. I watched as it paused, one paw diffidently raised, its broad, blunt head drooping as if the animal were still asleep. Only its widely dilating nostrils indicated that it was carefully testing the evening air before venturing beyond the safety of its burrow. Reassured, it wandered into the darkening forest a rotund comical figure with inwardpointing hind toes, its broad bottom swaying from side to side on its regular nightly food run. It would pass the night in solitary contentment searching for a variety of native grasses and sedges. My patience had finally been rewarded. Although telltale signs of wombat occupancy were everywhere from an extensive system of burrows and wellused paths to droppings posted on tree stumps and in other prominent places the animals themselves were frustratingly elusive. In two bonechilling nights that crackled with frost, the only indication of wombats Sheryn and I detected at Thredbo Diggings picnic area was a quick scuttling sound in the undergrowth as one fled at our approach. It was not until our third evening that we finally had our brief encounter. It was, like the common wombat itself, without fuss or ceremony. I felt exhilarated by the perfection of our meeting as I retreated to the welcome warmth of Sheryns fourwheeldrive for a reviving cup of coffee. photo caption photo caption caption photo caption Noone knows better than Barbara Triggs that wombats are among the most difficult animals to study in the wild. Her quest to unlock the intricacies of their biology began in 1976, when she was faced with the problem of raising a young orphaned wombat at her home in Croajingolong National Park in northeast Victoria. She had successfully raised orphaned kangaroos and possums, but knew almost nothing about wombats when her husband, Allan, brought home Bruno, an almost furless youngster whose mother had been killed on the road. As we relaxed on the verandah of her homestead, Barbara told me that natural history books were no help as very little research had been done on wombats then. She knew she would have to learn from the animals themselves if she was going to raise Bruno successfully and return him to the wild. Her face lit up as she recalled spending all hours of the night, in all kinds of weather, picking her way through thickets after her elusive quarry. Some of her research was done near her home, but much was carried out in the east Gippsland mountain forests, a threehour drive away, where she used a caravan as a hide to observe wombats. photo caption photo photo caption caption photo A wombats life revolves around its burrow, and as it seldom leaves its subterranean refuge before dusk, my research would begin each evening at a burrow entrance, waiting for a wombat to emerge, Barbara explained. Her task became more difficult when she realised that a wombat uses up to 11 different burrows and that burrows may be used by several wombats, usually at different times. Lacking the resources and expertise to fit radio collars to make tracking easier, she devised her own system of keeping tabs on them. She placed twigs across burrow entrances and, if they were dislodged, knew a wombat was in residence. She also fastened sticky tape to the mouths of burrows to snag hairs from a passing wombat to help identify it. A few hairs may not seem much to go on, but coat colours vary so widely from glossy black to grey, brown, sandy and cream that they can be as good as a signature, she told me. Barbaras studies have made her an authority on wombat behaviour, and the author of two books on them. They have also helped her raise a string of orphans since Bruno, who to her delight still visits her. Id estimate he was nearly six months old when he came to me. He spent three months in a cloth bag slung around my neck 24 hours a day, then I started taking him out into the bush. He always stayed at my heel until he was about 18 months, when he began going out on his own and dividing his time between visiting the house and digging a burrow underneath it. Barbara believes that most people have a skewed perception of wombats. They are mainly nocturnal and shy of humans, so their true qualities remain hidden from most people, she said. Instead we cling to childhood memories of Ruth Parks tales of The MuddleHeaded Wombat, an endearing, lumbering fellow with stumpy paws and muddledup whiskers, who, with the best intentions, always manages to get things wrong. Professor Heinz Moeller, director of the Zoological Institute at Heidelberg University in Germany, discovered that far from being muddleheaded, wombats have the best developed brain of any marsupial. A colleague, Dr Regine Hilbmann, investigated their play behaviour and learning ability and found them very frolicsome and relatively quick to learn a sure indicator of a level of intelligence noone had guessed at. Wombats are remarkable in other ways too. They are one of the biggest animals in the world to dig burrows, which may extend 30 metres. Unlike those of other marsupials, their teeth have no roots and keep growing throughout their life, being worn down continually by the abrasive silica in their food. And although they are thought of as slow and bumbling, they can run at 40kmh over short distances when disturbed. They are also extremely strong. If chased into its burrow by a dog or fox, the wombat will lift its rump and crush the attackers head against the roof of the burrow. photo caption caption photo caption diagram photo caption caption photo photo caption photo caption Not everyone shares Sheryn and Barbaras love for wombats. Wombats are worthless Ron King, a sheep and cattle grazier in Victorias eastern highlands, fumed when I questioned him about them. Ive slaved on the land all my life and I have a fair knowledge of the destruction wombats cause. In my opinion, theyre worse than wild pigs. Ron is one of many farmers who detest wombats. He claims that since the 1960s, when wombat control was scaled down, their numbers have risen to plague proportions. Fences are impossible to maintain. Kangaroos in their hundreds come through holes wombats make and it is no longer economic to run sheep on a lot of my property because wild dogs get in the same way. Some farmers also accuse wombats of fouling their pastures and spreading parasites and disease, while their burrowing is said to undermine buildings and dam embankments and even cause soil erosion. Clive Marks, a biologist with the Keith Turnbull Research Institute in Frankston, Victoria, studied the pest behaviour of wombats for his masters degree at Monash University. He told me wombats were regarded as pests that damaged crops as far back as the 1860s. The problem was compounded in the 1880s when netting fences were widely used to control the spread of rabbits. Inspectors would fine farmers if they had rabbits on their land but farmers blamed wombats for making holes that let the rabbits in, he said. In 1906 the Victorian Government declared wombats vermin and their destruction was mandatory. A bounty system was introduced in 1925 and during the last decade it operated, 195565, payments were made on 63,000 scalps. Today wombats are protected in all states except for 193 parishes in eastern Victoria, where they are still shot, trapped and fumigated. I joined Clive on one of his regular visits to Tonimbuk, 70 km east of Melbourne, where aided by a grant from Australian Geographic he conducts field studies to determine the effectiveness of various fences against wombats. A storm was sending curtains of rain slanting down with a deafening crackle, and as we sheltered in his ute I asked him how he responded to landholder complaints. Wombats are stout, sturdy and strong, with the power to go where they want and by the most direct route through or under a farmers fence if necessary, he conceded. But a lot of whinges are more imagined than real. diagram caption photo The rain eased and Clive began tuning the antenna at the back of the ute, trying to pick up a signal from a radiocollared wombat in order to plot how far it foraged during the night. He wasnt having much luck. Its probably still down its burrow, he said. We persisted a little longer, but with the drizzle turning to cold rain, my heart wasnt in it. Clive caught my mood and shrugged sympathetically. Time to go home, he said. I asked him the best way of excluding wombats from farmland. Electric fencing, he replied without hesitation. The first recorded encounter between wombats and Europeans was in 1797 when sailors from the Sydney Cove, shipwrecked on Preservation Island off Tasmania, dined on wombat flesh. They likened the creature to a badger and a bear, and described the meat as being musky, not very agreeable flavour and very sinewy. In fact, the wombats closest relative is the koala. The two animals have similar rudimentary tails, paws and rearopening pouches, as well as a common ancestor that lived about 25 million years ago. Between 15 and 5 million years ago, several giant species of wombat evolved and the remains of some as big as cows and weighing 100 kilograms have been found from the Kimberley in WA to Bingara, New South Wales. The gradual drying out of Australia that turned threequarters of the continent from forest into semiarid desert led to the extinction of the giant wombats between 25,000 and 15,000 years ago. In the cooler, wetter highlands of southeastern Australia from Stanthorpe near the QueenslandNSW border south along the Great Dividing Range to the outskirts of Melbourne the common wombat continued to thrive, despite the clearing of forest for settlement and agriculture that shrunk its range. There are two subspecies, one in Tasmania and another on Flinders Island in the Bass Strait. But the lesserknown and much rarer hairynosed wombats, distinguished by their softer fur and longer ears, have fared less well since European settlement. photo caption photo When Epping Forest National Park was proclaimed in 1971 to protect the last population of northern hairynosed wombats, it was estimated that there were 35 animals, Matt Widt, rangerincharge of the 3300hectare sanctuary 100 kilometres northwest of Clermont in central Queensland told me as we stood in the sandy bed of an ancient watercourse, staring at a cluster of five burrows. Now there are Matt explained that the invasion of graziers and their introduced animals into the hairynosed wombats austere habitat precipitated a crisis they were unable to cope with. Sheep, cattle and wombats eat the same grasses but the wombats have narrower preferences, he said. It was no coincidence that the first wombat colonies to disappear were close to stock watering points, where grazing pressure was particularly heavy. A southern species of hairynosed wombat that once extended as far east as the Murray River is now confined to parts of the Nullarbor Plain and a few isolated colonies in southern South Australia. Northern hairynoses declined so quickly they first became known to scientists as a skull found in the Wellington Caves, NSW, in Fossil records indicate they were once widespread in Victoria, NSW and Queensland but by the turn of the century only two populations were known to exist, one near Deniliquin in southern NSW and another in the Moonie River area of southern Queensland."
