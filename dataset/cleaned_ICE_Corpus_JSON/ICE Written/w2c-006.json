The move is also a fresh bid to avoid breaches of United Nations guidelines on human rights. When the juvenile crime legislation was introduced in the Legislative Assembly late yesterday afternoon it contained significant alterations from the draft Bills released last week by Premier Carmen Lawrence. The concessions represent the second wave of backdowns by the Government on its juvenile crime laws, initially announced with considerable fanfare by Deputy Premier Ian Taylor. Last week, the Government was forced to remove clauses relating to the detention of serious repeat juvenile offenders at the Governors pleasure which, in turn, removed the potential for executive intervention in reviews of sentences. Yesterdays key changes are BulletInclusion of a sunset clause under which the new laws will lapse in two years. BulletEstablishment of a group chaired by senior Minister Ernie Bridge to review the legislation over the next two years. BulletExtension of the repeat offender classification, and the penalties which go with it, to cover adults as well as juveniles at whom the legislation was originally aimed. BulletA reduction in the maximum penalty for causing grievous bodily harm in the course of stealing a car from 20 years to 14 years. Several Labor MPs, including Mr Bridge, Jackie Watkins, John Halden, Julian Grill and Judy Edwards, have been concerned about the impact of the new legislation since it was announced by Mr Taylor last month. However, Dr Lawrence denied last night that she had softened the legislation or that the changes were due topressure from within the Labor Party. She said the sunset clause had originally been included in the draft legislation but then taken out. It was reasonable for Parliament to review the legislation after two years and the decision to extend the repeat offender classification to adults strengthened the legislation. Dr Lawrence said the reduction in the maximum penalty for causing grievous bodily harm while stealing a car had been suggested by Chief Justice David Malcolm to maintain relativities in sentencing. In her secondreading speeches on the two juvenile crime Bills in the Assembly yesterday, Dr Lawrence said the Government had yet to be convinced of claims that the legislation breached UN conventions. I should say, however, that the claims made by the Human Rights Commissioner that the UN conventions provide balanced protection of victim and potential victims of crime are frankly unconvincing, she said. In the light of the deficiency in the UN guidelines, the Government has had to apply its own judgment to balancing the protection of the public against the wellbeing of these most serious and dangerous offenders. Opposition Leader Barry MacKinnon told the Assembly the Opposition would support the legislation but questioned the Governments broader approach to juvenile crime. He said the questions included where would young offenders be held, what programs would be set up to deal with them and what was being done to tackle amphetamine use Explosion threat as big fuel tank roofs cave in By LIZ TICKNER and LEEROY BETTI BP refinery staff at Kwinana last night were working to drain eight tanks of crude oil and petrol after their floating roofs collapsed during record rains at the weekend, releasing highly flammable hydrocarbon vapour. Environmental Protection Authority spokesman John Ottaway said it would be another 18 hours before the place would be safe. It was a very tense situation. Until the tanks have been drained into sealed containers its literally a very volatile situation, Dr Ottaway said. Apart from the release of vapour into the atmosphere, one spark could result in the whole lot going up. Although it was dangerous, everything appeared to be well under control. BP health, safety and environment manager John Yates said the floating roofs collapsed into one crude oil tank and seven petrol tanks each with a capacity of about 4000 tonnes on Saturday night. There was no risk to the public. In the 24 hours to 9am yesterday, 215mm of rain was dumped on Kwinana. Perth had its wettest day since records began in 1876 with 6mm. The previous record was 99mm on June 10, The previous record for the month was 1 mm on February 17, Perths average February rainfall is a mere 12 mm. Jandakot received 173mm, Rottnest 141 mm and Perth airport 132mm. Medina received a massive 230 mm. Weather Bureau spokesman Chris Blackford said the freak deluge was the result of a very deep low which developed just off the coast overnight on Friday and early Saturday. Residents of some of Perths northwestern suburbs were woken to the eerie roar of an approaching hail storm about 30 am on Saturday. Hail the size of big tom bolwer marbles hit the northwestern suburbs, the worst affected area being around Glendalough, where windows were broken, cars damaged and trees uprooted. The Hills suburb of Roleystone was also hit hard. Some residents of the Amaroo Retirement Village in Gosnells had to be evacuated and were still in temporary accommodation last night. Banks of ponds at a wool scouring plant at Jandakot broke, spilling waste water on to nearby Yangebup Road and into backup ponds. The solid rain made driving conditions hazardous. A section of Brookton Highway was washed out after nearby dams overflowed and it is believed about eight vehicles were washed into fastflowing streams. On Saturday night, stalled cars, traffic lights out of action and flooded roads proved a nightmare for police. But despite a spate of accidents no one was seriously injured. The Fire Brigade said it was called out 49 times, mostly for false alarms. The SES received 350 emergency calls and the Department of Marine and Harbours also was kept busy emptying flooded boats. Saturday nights greyhound races at Cannington were abandoned when the lure mechanism became submerged. Other sporting events also were disrupted. Vandals ensured that the WA Symphony Orchestra was a victim of the weather twice. At the Quarry Amphitheatre, rain and hail on Saturday morning ruined amplification equipment worth 30,000 because vandals who took two extension cords worth 30 on Friday night did not replace covers. Then, Saturday nights concert was postponed because of the relentless rain. It will be held tonight and tickets are transferable. Houghton winemaker Paul Lapsley said the hail missed the Swan Valley vineyards but the grapes were very expanded and more rain would split them. Vegetable grower Laurie Sumich said market gardens could be damaged and the onion harvest would be delayed about a week. BulletIn NSW, 100 soldiers were flown to the flood weary central western town of Nyngan yesterday amid fears that the Bogan River would break its banks. An SES spokesman said the river was expected to peak at 5 metres early today. The 1990 floods, which forced a mass evacuation, peaked at 2m. Sydney and its suburbs were battered yesterday as torrential rain and wind closed roads, cut power, uprooted trees, ripped roofs off homes and caused a spate of minor road accidents. Most suburbs recorded more than 150mm of rain during the weekend, with Sydneys central business district topping the charts with 287mm. The Sydney Harbour tunnel was flooded with 500,000 litres and emergency workers stood chestdeep in water as they used pumps to clear the tunnel, which is still under construction. PhotoCaption Howe beaten on Medicare charge by PETER REES and DEANIE CARBON CANBERRA Federal Cabinet will dump the controversial Medicare copayment today in what will be a humiliating defeat for Health Minister Brian Howe. Mr Howe, the Deputy Prime Minister, yesterday conceded he did not have the numbers in Cabinet to keep the 50 charge which last year caused bitter divisions in the Government. Mr Howe said Prime Minster Paul Keatings wish to scrap the copayment was well known. I think the Prime Minister obviously has got a very clear view about that and his view will be very influential within Cabinet, he said. Government sources confirmed Mr Howes fears that the 50 copayment and the 50 Medicare rebate cut on scheduled fees, introduced on December 1, would be abolished after only two months. Mr Howe will offer Cabinet six options ranging from abolishing the Medicare changes to partial retention and full retention. But Government sources said these options would not be considered fully and, instead, Cabinet would confine itself to the decision to scrap the copayment. Mr Howe has fought hard to retain the charge despite strong opposition from caucus and community groups. The rebate cut and other changes to Medicare were originally expected to save 9 million in 199192 but this was reduced to about 90 million after Cabinet was forced to modify the copayment to head off a caucus revolt. The copayment became an issue in the Governments leadership turmoil last October when Mr Keating made it clear he was opposed to it. He later told Government MPs he would scrap it if he took over the Labor leadership from Bob Hawke. But Howe continued the fight after Mr Keating became leader on December 19 and persuaded him to take the matter to Cabinet for review. Yesterday, SA ALP Senator Rosemary Crowley called on Cabinet to scrap the copayment and restore the simple Medicare rules in force early last year. Its very bad policy and it has to be removed, she said. Senator Crowley, a member of last years ALP caucus working party on Medicare, said there should be no distinciton between patients depending on whether they were served by bulk billing doctors or between pensioners and nonpensioners. In a stronglyworded letter to Mr Keating yesterday, the Australian Medical Association advised him not to scrap the copayment. AMA secretarygeneral Allan Passmore said the AMA was annoyed that it had not been consulted about the possible changes. The AMA believes nonpensioners who are bulkbilled should make 50 contributions to their bills. Mr Passmore said it was unreasonable for these patients to get free treatment. This removes any incentive for either the patient or the doctor to show any restraint in the requesting of the provision of medical services, he said. Patients who were not bulkbilled should be entitled to a Medicare rebate of 85 per cent of the scheduled fee and should not make a copayment, he said. The AMA said that in August 1990, Mr Keating as treasurer supported a patient fee for pharmaceuticals and argued that a free system encouraged overuse by patients and doctors. Lawyer bowls at hit em for six law Criminal lawyer Richard Utting has a cautionary tale for the lock em up brigade who want repeat juvenile offenders jailed for a mandatory 18 months for serious crimes after six court appearances and convictions for lesser offences such as burglary and car theft. As State Parliament sits in special session today to debate tough new laws to combat juvenile crime, Mr Utting tells the hypothetical story of Janet who lived at home with her single mum, quit school at 15 and joined WAs 30 per cent of youngsters out of work. Her mother formed a relationship with a man and invited him to live in the family home but Janet did not get on with her new de facto father and resented his efforts to discipline her. Janet left home at 16 to live with her 18yearold unemployed boyfriend in a house he shared with other teenagers. The young couple started taking drugs and the boyfriend decided to break into houses to get money for their habit while Janet kept watch. They were caught and fined but repeated the offences. Eventually the boyfriend was sent to prison. By then Janet had appeared six times in the Childrens Court and pleaded guilty each time. She returned home to live with her mother when the boyfriend went to jail, quit drugs and formed a good relationship with her de facto father. She found work as an apprentice hairdresser, got her drivers licence and bought a little car."
