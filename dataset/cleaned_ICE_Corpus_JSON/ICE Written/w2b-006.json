    "text": "One tall pOppy BY MIA FREEDMAN The first thing you notice about Poppy King is her lips. Full, pouty and with a perfect cupids bow, theyre the kind of lips that look best bright red. And they usually are. The second thing you notice, or rather sense, is Poppys incredible energy and passion for her work. Simply asking her how it all began unleashes a flood of enthusiasm. I was just so sick of having to reapply my lipstick five or six times a day. Every lipstick I wore smudged, faded, bled onto my teeth or vanished altogether. When a friend gave me a matt lipstick from overseas, I knew immediately that this was what I had been looking for. But looking for a replacement uncovered a huge gap in the market matt lipsticks just werent available. So began Poppys twoyear trek from counter to counter with every query met with what would become an ironic response Sorry, we dont make a matt lipstick but if I had a dollar for every time a customer asked for one, Id be rich. The gap was so obvious, I thought I must be crazy. How could huge cosmetics houses overlook something that, to me seemed perfectly clear Women want matt lipsticks. Its that simple. The transformation from frustrated consumer to budding entrepreneur happened like so many things in Poppys life suddenly and by chance. I was reading Cleo and noticed an ad for The Nescafe Big Break Awards, offering six people under the age of 2l a 20,000 grant to pursue their area of interest. I immediately changed my attitude from why doesnt some company do this to Im going to do it myself. She was 17 years old, living at home and had just completed the first year of an arts degree. Up till then I didnt have a clue as to what I wanted to do with my life. After intense research for her submission, missing out on the award was a disappointment but not a great setback. A chance conversation at a party two months later was the break Poppy needed. I was chatting to a friend about matt lipsticks and how I wanted to produce them. She loved the idea and mentioned it to a friend of hers who was looking to invest in a business venture. A fortnight later, the friend called Poppy. They met, and in the space of a few hours Poppy had convinced him to back her ideas financially. Maybe I was ignorant or naive or overconfident or all of those things, but I just couldnt imagine it not being a success. After deferring university, Poppy threw herself into building a business from scratch. Everyone warned me that a recession was the worst possible time to start something, but in my case the opposite was true. When times are tough, manufacturers are forced to become more competitive and that made it easier for me to get a good deal. And Poppys research also showed her that a recession meant a boom in the sale of small luxury items. Women still want to treat themselves occasionally, they just have to do it on a smaller scale. A new dress or pair of shoes is too expensive, so they buy a magazine or a lipstick instead. The recession was an advantage for me in every way. After finding a lipstick manufacturer who was open to her ideas, Poppy began months of painstaking trialanderror in the lab. Creating the texture was the first and most important step I said to my manufacturer, Whatever amount of pigment youre used to putting in lipsticks, double it. No one had done that before. The result was a totally matt texture, designed to withstand endless cups of coffee and hours of social kissing. The second part of Poppys lipstick vision concerned colour and she managed to produce shades unlike any others on the market. The first seven were colours Id always looked for but could never find. If I saw someone wearing a colour I liked even if they were just walking down the street Id ask them what it was. Every time, theyd say they had to blend to get the shade they wanted. For me, that was further proof of a demand for lipstick colours that didnt yet exist. She began to collect petals, pieces of material, coloured paper, anything that matched the colours she wanted to recreate. I spent many afternoons mixing colours with my manufacturer, running back and forth to the mirror and applying different lipsticks while they were still warm. In January 1992, Poppy was finally happy with her seven colours. The next step was to name them. I didnt want to give them boring names like Poppy No.3 or whimsical, wimpy names like Tangerine Dream. I wanted to give them strong names that would show how far women have come and what we stand for in the 90s Ambition, Courage, Integrity, Virtue, Inspiration, Liberty, Unity. March saw the first production batch ready for collection and, as Poppy loaded 7,000 lipsticks into her car, she was thinking, Oh well, even if its a total failure, at least Ill have enough lipsticks to last the rest of my life. Soon after, Poppy convinced two of Melbournes leading fashion boutiques to stock her range and made a wishlist of 25 other stores she wanted to approach. But nothing could have prepared her for the flood of calls she received after a small magazine article on Poppy lipsticks appeared later that month. I was fielding around 300 inquiries a day from people across Australia. Thats when I realised my market was much broader that Id originally thought. From teenage country girls to 65yearold grandmothers, it seemed that all kinds of women wanted a lipstick that would last. Within three weeks, Poppys first production run was sold out and 90 per cent of the stores on her wishlist had contacted her. But all this was overshadowed by a call from the head buyer at MyerGrace Bros, who wanted to meet her as soon as possible. I went into that meeting as an ambitious 19yearold with a few thousand lipsticks and came out a nationwide operation. So staggering was Poppys success, that by June she was able to buy out her financial backer and appoint her older brother as codirector. Poppy spent the remainder of 1992 packing boxes, taking orders, meeting accountants, making instore appearances and developing her second range, The Seven Deadly Sins. Any spare time was devoted to renovating her huge studio apartment in central Melbourne, catching up with friends over a quick coffee or riding her bike. I let my gym membership lapse long ago so my bike is both relaxation and exercise. Not surprisingly, by Christmas Poppy was exhausted and decided to treat herself to a weeks break in New York after visiting a cosmetics trade fair in Paris. But her passion for business took hold, and she hadnt been in New York more than a few days when she began ringing department stores to gauge interest in her lipsticks. The brushoffs came one after another until she spoke to the head buyer at Barneys one of New Yorks most prestigious department stores, who agreed to meet her. Undeterred by the fact she had left all her promotional material in Australia, Poppy arrived at Barneys the following morning with nothing but her own halfused lipsticks. What followed was remarkable. This woman was blownaway. She adored the concept, loved the lipsticks and cancelled all her morning appointments so we could talk business. I was so overwhelmed I hailed a taxi and burst into tears. But Poppy Kings appetite for success is far from satisfied. Shes currently promoting her Seven Deadly Sins range and finalising the colours for Innocence, a range that will feature paler colours. Plans for an eye range Vision are well under way, with foundations, powders and a Poppy fragrance in the pipeline. Because of their thickness, heat resistance and rich colours, Poppy lipsticks are ideal for dark skin and hot climates. A Sri Lankan firm has already expressed interest, and expansion into the huge cosmetics markets of Sri Lanka and Pakistan seems just a matter of time. Meanwhile, in preparation for Barneys August launch, Poppy is flying to New York for a twoweek publicity blitz and Barneys is sending her lipsticks to some of the most famous lips in America, including those of Julia Roberts, Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell and Madonna. And instead of letting herself get swept away in this whirlwind of success, Poppy is proving she has a business instinct as acute as the Material Girl herself. Im giving myself one more year to stand up and be the front person for Poppy Industries. For longterm profitability, its vital that I step back and let the product speak for itself. Besides, theres only so long I can maintain goodwill in this country before people decide Im doing too well and its time to cut me down. But jealousy and bitterness aside, right now, at the age of 20, everythings coming up roses for Poppy King. NATALIES STORY Within a fortnight of receiving the letter, we had Natalie on a plane to Sydney. Given the precarious nature of Natalies condition, the letter had said, you understand we have to act quickly. Wearing a black hat and a white ruffled blouse, she strode into the airport lounge.
