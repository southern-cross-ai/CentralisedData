    "text": "62 Weil Ave Croydon Park NSW 2133 Australia 19th December, 1994 Dear Lesley, It sounds as if you are kept very busy, what with Magnuss infected leg, all the childrens activities and all the animals aswell. As you are aware last JuneJuly we travelled to America for one month. We visited and stayed with family and friends and Kate absolutely loved every minute. Phil also had a wonderful holiday. Kate has just celebrated her 5th birthday. She has a Calamity Jane party which was a success. We even hired two ponies for the kids to ride. Naturally, the ponies were a great hit with the kids. They were very well behaved and enjoyed the carrots that the children fed them. I made this huge cake that I thought looked quite ridiculous, however it tasted good and the kids all thought it was a wonderful cake with plastic cowboys, Indians and tepees on it. She received lots of Power Ranger toys. She is crazy aboout them and wants to be Trini. In fact the Power Rangers are currently in Sydney filming their first movie, but unfortunately for Kate they have not made any public appearances. The day after Kates birthday her first tooth fell out. She was SO excited I was with her and she didnt know whether to laugh or cry. It was the most precious moment to see. The tooth has been carefully placed in a plastic bag so that Kate can display it to any interested or oven not interested person. Her second tooth fell out two weeks later. My lectures have finished for the year and I continue to work on my research and business. Last month I received a letter to tell me that I have been awarded a scholarship, the King Amy OMalley scholarship he was an American who came to Australia and founded our first national, or commonwealth, bank. This allows me to studyresearch full time next year as the award is worth 10,000, although I will still undertake a little lecturing as the students have insisted to the head of the school that I teach them. I cant believe that Spoofie is about to celebrate her 13th birthday. She is still so spritely, jumping fences and getting into a bit of mischief and looks so well. Mushka has even turned Luckily, all the animals are very well, although Mushka suffered two epeleptic fits this year. We have had our first couple of hot days for the Summer. Kate has recommenced swimming lesson and her grand achievement was that she floated on her back for ten seconds water restrictions are getting tougher due to the drought. How is Tasmania bearing when it comes to water I hope it is better than here. Goodbye for now. 62 Weil Ave Croydon Park. N.S.W.2133 6th January, 1992 Dear Ellen, I hope that you all had a very happy Christmas and are now enjoying a happy It is such a long time since I have written. 1991 was a busy year, to say the least. I continued to lecture parttime which I enjoy, even though it pays poorly and involves a heavy workload. The other major undertaking was that I commenced further studies, also parttime for a Masters of Education. I have wanted to start my Masters for a long time and so I did. The workload is difficult and especially tiring as I can only work once Kate has gone to sleep at night and dont have the luxury of a block of time to read or study. Nevertheless I have really enjoyed the courses that I undertook this year I did 4 courses I find it hard to belive that I am enjoying studying as I can very clearly remember that when I left Teachers College I swore I would escape and never return and found that I learnt a great deal and that was exciting. Anyhow, the studies are going well and I shall be continuing this year. With parttime work and studies it means that my parents babysit for three and a half days a week. Kate just loves her Baba Russian for grandmother and Jeda grandfather and understands Russian and also Polish and is learning to speak them. My mother always talks in Russian to her and now my mother has a Russian guest over from Germany so that she also speaks in Russian and i think that this is the language that she will pick up most quickly. Its so interesting to watch her development and how she can pronounce Russian words so well. Kate talks non stop. This age is just wonderful She is now normally very good and loves helping us around the house. She and Mushka are devoted to each other. In fact when we returned from our Surfers Paradise holiday Mushka and Kate both went berserk with excitement. Kate screamed and hugged Mushka, Mushka jumped on and nuzzled Kate and they both ended lying on the floor together with Kate still hugging Mushka and saying beautiful Mushie. We could not separate them for three hours Kate is the same with the cats and loves hugging them they tolerate it for a while before jumping away and also joins me each morning in saying good morning birds to our budgies and peachface parrot. She knows each cat by name and calls them for meals and checks that they are all there and eating. Once when one cat did not turn up for dinner she became quite upset and I had to calm her down. At Surfers Paradise not only did she go to the beach for the first time which she absolutely loved, but she also was able to hand feed lorikeets and pat kangaroos. This was heaven for her. In fact on each occasion she was photographed and videoed by the many Japanese tourists who were there Last week we had another surprise holiday. A friend rang up and asked if we could help her. She had not had the chance to go to her holiday house in a year and could we go and have a holiday there and check that the house was O.K. Naturally, as Phil had a few days holiday from work we said Yes The house is at Huskisson, on the south coast of New South Wales. It was two blocks from the beach and one block from a nature reserve. We stayed for four days. We visited an animal farm, where once again, Kate went berserk with delight. This time she got to see a Koala and was so pleased that she kissed it. She certainly loves animals. She was again able to feed animals, but she also hugged and even kissed one of them. Then she was treated to a pony ride, so it was a very exciting day for her and now Kate asks for more holidays please. My sister Helen is also devoted to Kate and visits often so she can play and walk with her. She also spoils her with gifts. I believe that Kate is a very lucky child to have so many people devoted to her and to have already experienced two exciting holidays. She is at an age where she can now understand so much and that is very interesting. She had a birthday party and was very excited about that. My parents bought her a swing and a slippery dip and for weeks after she would sit at the top of the slippery dip, before sliding down, singing Happy Birthday to Kate. She thought Christmas was magical and was fascinated by the tree and decorations. She helped me decorate it and we also put a Christmas wreath on the front door. She them disappeared and I found her staring at the wreath. When I asked her what she was doing she said beautiful with a sigh while still staring at the wreath. We took her to a local church up the road to join in the carols, but the only word that she recognised was Jesus we have a manger under our tree and she knows the characters, so that each time the crowd sang or said Jesus, Kate would yell out, at the top of her voice Jesus I thought it was quite funny. Obviously, she also enjoyed all the presents at Christmas, bothe receiving them and giving them. She only gave on the condition that she could also assist in unwrapping them. For Christmas Eve we went to my parents for a traditional Polish Dinner and on Christmas day we went to Phils sisters home for a traditional Australian Christmas lunch. As the weather is so hot more and more people are tending towards cold pork and ham, rather than the hot roast. We are currently renovating our laundry again. It is now seven years since we moved into the house and time to start repainting for the second time. So, we are starting with the laundry and will work up to bigger rooms. The garden is looking great with the roses in bloom and masses of marigolds crowding the front plots. It was fortunate that only two weeks ago we received some rain as we have been experiencing drought conditions this year and even with watering the grass was always dry. Did the water reach you Now things are looking green and lush. This greenhouse effect is certainly changing things. A taxi driver, while at Surfers Paradise, told us how in the past five years the weather has completely changed there as well, with very little rain now. Have a wonderful trip to Melbourne for the Phantom, Im sure that you will enjoy it. Keep well and happy, 62 Weil Ave. Croydon Park. N.S.W. 2133 27th January, 1993 Dear Ellen Thankyou for your card at Christmas. We had a wonderful Christmas and it made more fun because Kate was SO excited. I can imagine it was the same for James and Amanda. Kate met Santa several times and wasnt at all greedy when it came to asking her what she wanted for her present a box. We even bought presents for all our animals and wrapped them and put them under the tree. Kate snuck into the hallway and told Mushka about her surprise and then came giggling back to me and revealed that she had told Mushka about the secret gift. We then went to the greengrocer and bought a large bag of carrots to leave out for the reindeer. Kate was literally jumping up and down with excitement. At Christmas Eve we had a traditional meal at my parents house, Christmas day we went to Phils family. On Christmas morning Kate couldnt believe that her stocking had been filled She was so happy and thought that that was itdotted lineof course, there was more under the tree. She was in kids heavendotted linepresents, presents, and more presents, as well as food and fun Kates third birthday went well. We organised a party at the Plaster Pot. I bought a large gingerbread house for the party and all the kids eyes were wide with delight,especially when it came time to eat it In November Kate was a flowergirl at a friends daughters wedding. At the rehearsal she played up, running around the church, etc. Fortunately, on the day, she was wonderful. We were extremely proud, of course . She stood at the alter holding her heavy basket of flowers and would occassionally ask if it was over yet, when told it wasnt then continued to stand there quietly. Her walk up and down the aisle was also perfect and she looked cute dotted linewell, I think so,dotted lineIve enclosed a photo, so see for yourself The union won my case for some backpay at work as I wasnt being paid for my marking, examination setting, etc and that has been a nice little windfall, so,dotted line, Phil, Kate and myself are off to Singapore in early February."
