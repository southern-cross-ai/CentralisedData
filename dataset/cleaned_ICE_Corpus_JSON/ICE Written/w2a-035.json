THE OLD BOYS SCHOOL WITHIN THE PERTH Cultural Centre was offered by the state government to the Perth Institute of Contemporary Arts PICA in 1988, together with an initial capital works allocation for redeveloping the public areas and services to suit the fundamental artistic tenets of the PICA charter movement, sound, language and vision. The principal spaces needed to be flexible and responsive to unconventional use. The brief called for exhibition spaces capable of responding to a radical range of activities, and performance space that can be redefined by the addition or subtraction of lighting grid, acoustic panels and seating units. Accommodation for PICA Press, artists studios, sound studios, libraryresource centre, coffeeshopbar, bookshop, administration and storage made up the minor spaces in the brief. PICA had its origins as an institution in the Perth experimental art group Praxis. That the architectural experiment is not highly visible in PICA needs explanation, and ultimately appreciation. The idea that architecture is one of the fine arts is not a widely held belief. Architecture is thought to be just the container in which art is displayed. But one cannot blame the architects, since they made architecture highly visible in their first scheme and in their comments since.1 Indeed, the coolness of the built project is largely the outcome of the client groups beliefs, the politics of the conservation movement and budgetary restraint. The first scheme boldly opened up the interior by removing the interior walls forming the twostorey central hall, and supporting the remaining structure with a steel truss from which amenities and services for the visual and performing arts could be suspended. A bridge that linked the building directly to the adjacent CBD was also proposed in the first scheme. Indeed, the model made of the first scheme, showing much of the south facade removed to allow easy viewing of the interior, consciously hinted at an even greater exposure for contemporary art in the city. In the executed project, suffering from an emaciated budget due to government restraint, the bridge was lost, the truss became a frame on the balustrade, and removed walls remained, but with larger openings. In addition, the bookshop and cafe were not fitted out. The balance between the historic nature of the building and the aims of contemporary art was critical to the project. Conservation bodies such as the National Trust thought that the first scheme would destroy the architectural integrity of the original building by replacing loadbearing walls with a dominant and alien steel structure. Conservative critics suggested that the aims and objectives of a contemporary art space do not sit comfortably with this heritage building.2 Both groups have static views of history that heritage buildings are old and should be preserved, and contemporary art needs a contemporary setting. In the PICA project, the architects demonstrate that neither belief is necessarily true. The architects have shown more sensitivity to the original school than previous tenants. For, just as the proposed bridge was suspended just short of the original fabric so as not to disturb the exterior, so various traces of the original have been left to allow for future reconstruction. In the first floor gallery, for instance, smooth plasterboard walls are set off the pilasters to create appropriate wall surfaces for contemporary art while preserving the original walls. The various added elements like the cast iron trusses in the performance space used to support the gallery above after the removal of load bearing walls, the new stair, the steel frame to the balustrade in the central space were all designed in small pieces and inserted into the space for site assembly. There is no effort to conceal the additions. They are placed within and apart from the existing. They are positioned offaxis. They are finished differently. They show their newness, thereby allowing for their later modification, or even removal. The lack of a suitable loading dock is an irony that the conservationists must bear since it was brought about by their insistence that the exterior should not be touched. The buildings origin as a school, with classrooms around a central hall, seems not unsympathetic to contemporary arts. The craftsmanship in the cast iron trusses in the performance space is refreshing here as it would be elsewhere. Artists are using the spaces and the possibilities provided by the inserted elements. Future plans for the current temporary galleries on the first floor call for artistinresidence accommodation, sound studio and installation spaces. Hopefully the bridge will also be built at some stage. Interestingly, the first exhibition at PICA was a retrospective of WA sculpture, featuring many artists who have regularly exhibited at the neighbouring Art Gallery of Western Australia AGWA. This brought the relationship of PICA to AGWA into immediate focus. Clearly, performance will define this relationship for PICA, although for the visual arts PICA and AGWA were already alternatives. One must suspect that the alternative alternative art space is now forming somewhere in Perth, presumably away from the centralising3 pull of the Perth Cultural Centre. Notes Geoff Warn. Constructing a Place for Architecture in ARM AprilMay p. Andra Kins. A Glance at PICA in Art Monthly November p.The logic of centralising art institutions in the Perth Cultural Centre has been regularly questioned on the assumption that the centre is culturally dead. See, for example, Duncan Richards. Dead Centre in Fremantle Arts Review March 1989, pp. 3 Emerging architects Enriching the culture In Western Australia, flexibility means survival for young architects and the reward is a richer architectural culture, according to Simon Anderson SINCE ARCHITECTURE AUSTRALIA LAST looked at the work of emerging architects, in May 1990, the economic recession has made it almost impossible for younger architects to develop viable practices or indeed to build within established practices. In the last two years, architects have found it difficult to even find work in architectural practices. This presents an ideal opportunity to focus on young architects varied and generally nonbuilding activities, in part precipitated by recession and certainly magnified by it. If unable to enter the profession in the traditional way, young practitioners must turn to other activities. They can teach, they can take the opportunity to study in Australia or overseas, they can travel, they can turn to allied activities like project management, planning, urban design, landscape architecture, curatorial work or public art commissions. Architectural competitions can provide stimulation as can shortterm contracts with established architects. All of these activities have proliferated in Perth over the last two years, adding a new dimension to the architectural culture of the state which has always valued building over ideas and drawings about architecture. Surprisingly, in this recession there has been no movement to control numbers of architectural graduates. The emerging Western Australian architects featured in Architecture Australia in May 1990 are all still active in Perth. Robert Moore has joined the practice of R.J.Ferguson and Associates and is learning the art of working for the large educational institutions that support that particular practice. Donaldson Warn have completed significant residential Chauvel House, institutional PICA refurbishment and commercial buildings ANZ Bank West Perth, as well as continuing to enter competitions, recently winning two South Perth Library and Claremont Fire Station refurbishment. The practice continues to contribute to the teaching programme at Curtin University. Paul Jones of Philip Cox, Etherington, Coulter Jones has gone on to design major projects here and overseas. The State governments architectural office, the Building Management Authority BMA, has traditionally trained young architects who choose to work there because of the public nature of the projects offered. In an economic recession, only the very best are employed and many projects are not built, like the Albany Agricultural Offices and Bureauwest published in The Architect in Spring 1990. In this recession, the BMA is almost the only local practice offering attractive work to young architects. The bureaucratic nature of a large government architects office is still apparent, yet the BMA has been very supportive of its young architects, accepting that their engagement might be temporary or even broken by extended overseas travel. Jandakot Primary School, designed by Dave Gulland and Steve Parkin of the BMA, is a new nineclassroom school on an undeveloped site with allowance for eight classrooms to be added later. Colour and texture are used to code the activities of the various parts of the school, while a more urban approach to planning than is customary in schools is adopted. Sculptural elements are added for climbing on, sitting on, letting light in and encouraging breezes. In its legible yet playful design, the school suggests that the rational and the wilful can happily coexist in even the most institutional environment. Another young designer at the BMA, Mark Krynski, has designed new engineering workshops at a Metropolitan College of TAFE, and alterations and additions to North Mandurah Primary School. Krynski teaches at both schools of architecture in Perth a situation which was rare until recently and reflects the increasing importance of design education within the schools. The BMA wisely supports its staff in their teaching interests, as it is clearly a major beneficiary of quality design education. The lack of work in the established offices has seen the emergence of various graduate design cooperatives which have been assisted in professional, liability and registration matters by practicing architects through the RAIAs WA Chapter and the Architects Board of WA. For without that first job it is impossible to even leave Perth. The most active cooperative has been InHaus, founded by six UWA graduates at the end of The group has been involved in small commissions, competitions, mounting exhibitions of architecture and art within their own office, and curating exhibitions of collaborative work between architects and artists. Group members additionally undertake contract work for other architects, teach at the schools of architecture, and even produce radio programmes on the visual arts and architecture. Activities like these suggest that architects need to be flexible if they want to remain gainfully employed. Yet architecture is still the central concern. Sarah Cope of InHaus has designed a small house at York which has all the simplicity of a youthful designers work, and a restrained economy which is lacking in many houses by architects. Flexibility also characterises the practice of Richard Black. Black is currently teaching fulltime at Curtin University. Since graduating in 1988, he has worked with both Donaldson Warn and the BMA, as well as undertaking postgraduate studies as a guest student with Peter Cook at the Stadelschule Hochschule Fur Bildende Kunste in Frankfurt. Blacks practice is currently based in Perth, and his studies in Germany bring to Australia the issues of complex urban centres. At the same time, his projects have a clarity of vision that surely must interest Europeans. His work has been exhibited overseas in the UK, Europe and Japan, and locally in January 1990 at the Perth Institute of Contemporary Arts reviewed by Duncan Richards in The Architect Autumn 1990. The PICA exhibition featured successful international and national architectural competition projects by a group of recent Curtin University graduates, including Parkin and Krynski. Blacks City SpaceCity Room creates a sequence of elliptical external rooms within the Baroque city grid of Berlin, distorting traditional streets and site boundaries. The strong form of the ellipses corresponds to the grand city grid, yet local forces of viewing angles and light are absorbed. The outer ring of each ellipse is office space bounding an inner ring of, respectively, sports hall, hotel and living accommodation. A fourth scooped and ascending space connects the elevated activities to the street and the subway. K. R. Popper, in an essay titled Towards a Rational Theory of Tradition in his Conjectures and Refutations, mentions the difficulty of establishing a research tradition in a small and young university. In a similar sense, there are difficulties in establishing a rich architectural culture in a small and young state. This recession seems to have helped in founding activities that might establish such a tradition. Young architects are no longer fleeing overseas. They are receiving the support of the schools, the government architects office, the RAIA, the registration board. The state is probably architecturally richer for the recession definitely not financially, but certainly intellectually.
