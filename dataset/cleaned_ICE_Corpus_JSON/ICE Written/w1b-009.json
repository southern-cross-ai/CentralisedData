Already 10 days have flown, the first 8 unbelievably warm dry, with a hose ban in force from Sat. However yesterday a few good downpours seem to have broken the drought more promised back to normal J J went off to Munich last Wed. John had 2 days work then a weekend for them away, from boys. As soon as theyd gone Rogers cough got worse so I had to drive the Golf to the doctor, two villages away. After a few trips Ive now conquered my fear of gears narrow roads but still dont fancy venturing too far afield. On Sunday took them to see Nuffield House, which was having an open day. Lord Lady M. lived there having built it in the 40s not a very good time for deeacutecor you should see the allgreen bathroom dotted lineIt was a bit too near in time to appreciate having it all set up as if they were still around dining table set for a banquet with very blue venetian wineglasses plates which would not improve ones appetite afternoon tea tray ready in the drawing room the only really elegant room all his court robes other uniforms standing about in a headless gathering. I heard a lady say in a worried tone They ought to be behind glass or theyll rot. I dont supose Lord M. would worry if they did For a billionaire it was an unpretentious house. He gave away 30,000,000 in his lifetime to charities. The most interesting things were 3 MorrisCowley cars in the driveway, all looking in mint condition, one of which is still driven every day. Apparently when a colour was being chosen for the new cars in the factory he said you can have any colour you like so long as its black. I remember in 1946 when I first came over here, being amazed to see so many black ones after our colours at home. Nothing much has changed in the village in 2 years except that the Honey Factory, Evelines only industry, has moved to a town the buildings are being demolished to make way for 17 apartments cottages. We hope they will be in keeping with the present mixture of old newer houses. The Honey Factory imports honey from all over the world bottles it including Oz Blue Gum. A pity it had to move. The big black horse in the field behind us has another foal exactly like the one when I was here last. Lovely to see them together from our upstairs windows. I go for my morning walks one day clockwise round the village next day anticlockwise, but sometimes venturing up another field path. Rabbits are back in force becoming a worry to the farmers I think. The sky is often crisscrossed with aircraft trails at that hour theres always something of interest. I even get a Good Morning from the any other early walker not many whereas later in the day the English are not friendly to strangers. On Tues. night we had our first quintet evening did the Schumann lots of noise fun. Good job the neighbours are well away across the garden. Next time it will be the Dvorak Quintet meanwhile Jenny I are enjoying playing together. Gill is going well they all had a great time in Corsica with suntans to show off, though they will no doubt fade from now on. On the day I left Friday 3rd you may remember we had very strong winds rain. A huge branch cracked off my big gum tree in the front garden hung there swinging. There was nothing I could do except leave it for Philip to cope with. Im glad I had the branches over the house lopped. Philip drove me in his de luxe office car to the airport where I was very disgruntled to find that all nonsmoking seats had been taken many prebooked which my travel agent should have told me to do. So I spent the entire trip to Frankfurt with a chainsmoker on one side across the aisle my neighbour on the other almost as bad. However I achieved my ambition to sit next to a German. He came from Bremen spoke no English we communicated well all the way, though I had to make him slow down. The plane was a new 747 with wings that looked normal level on the ground but lifted up at an angle in the air, with turnedover bits on the end like eagles wings. It was very comfortable except for not have enough nonsmoking places. As there were families with children in the same section it seems obvious they should do something about it. I must write tell them. Lovely being here with the family, who all send love to you all Lots from me too, Estelle iiTues. 16th Oct 90 My dear Pam, John, Fliss Greg Lovely to have your letter, Pam, written just a month ago. To answer your first question, we were on our way to London for the day as I read your letter in the car going to Reading train from there only 45 mins or so, we also drove up one night to a concert in the Wigmore Hall about 1 hour door to door. Contratulations Fliss on winning the Mitsui Scholarship Evan told me Angus too All in the family its very exciting for you. Pam you should be up to U by my reckoning I hope its on schedule. I wasted most of my time in England having a rather bad dose of bronchitis which led to a cracked rib from coughing honestly That took 6 weeks to completely heal, so in just the last week Ive been able to enjoy breathing deeply again. However it was better to have it happen in England I was feeling normal by the time I came over here on the 29th Sept. Then on the 4th I went by train to Ansbach, leaving Gill very well but very large and looking as though the baby wouldnt wait until I go back. They assured me they could manage anyway sent me off for my Italian holiday. I met friendly Germans on the train managed to communicate very well, if not in perfectly constructed sentences. On the 6th, Charlotte, Harold I went by train to Nuumlautrnberg where we joined the coach two coaches in fact 70 people, which was more than we liked but it wasnt too bad. At Munich a little old man got on had the seat next to mine. He turned out to be an exconsul general in the German diplomatic service, spoke perfect English was full of interesting information. What luck for me Hed been many years in Ankara but well before Philips time there. We had warm mostly sunny weather for the whole week in England also incredibly dry warm so could enjoy the sightseeing well most of it. Florence was rather a shock disappointment so much traffic noise people that the buildings one had dreamed about wanted to see for so long were nothing like their pictures in books. Well, I didnt expect A Room With a View but wasnt prepared for all the clutter. Never mind, Pisa made up for it with the marvellous Cathedral Square with the Baptistry, Cathedral of course the L.T. in sparkling white marble set off by brilliant green grass no cars. Lucca was interesting for tall houses narrow streets no traffic in the old part. Three Medici Villas were fascinating with murals in one of them amazingly fresh in their original state after nearly 4 centuries. Our Reiseleiter was a very erudite young man I wish could have understood all his talks, but caught enough to help appreciate it all. Verona was elegant Innsbruck provided a memorable goulash souup on our way back The drive in sunshine through the Eisack Etch Valleys in the Sudtyrol was one long calendar picture of Alps, forts castles on hills, green, green grass autumn colours in the trees. I could go on but cant wait any longer to tell you that we have a girl at last Charlotte after Oma of course pronounced the German way. She was born on the 8th which is Rolands birthday after trying all afternoon to ring him for that from Montecalim we knew something must be happening. Then at 9 pm he rang us at the hotel great rejoicing all round. Gill had an easy time came home next day They do it differently these days all much more comfortable than a week in hospital. Roland had the week off was marvellous. Sebastian was delighted is so gentle so sweet with his sister so far altogether everything goes well. Needless to say I was glad to come back on Monday night start my au pair job, they are glad to have me back. Charlotte is so cut with silky very dark hair all over her head. She weighed nearly 7lbs. but seems so tiny after one hasnt seen a new baby for so long. Shes feeding sleeping well looking a bit different each day its all very satisfactory A very good midwife has come each day to see that all is well is far better than a doctor. Well Ill have to stop this has been written in fits starts so excuse scribble please I just had to send you the NEWS much love from everyone from me always Estelle. I wrote to Greg the other day Gill worried she hadnt answered his letter never time but theyve asked him to come for Xmas. 12th Sept 92 Dear Pam John Time for a quick line before the days activity begins then its all go This is a lovely area for them to bring up the children in very little traffic on the road at the front the house set well down from it at the back side tall trees through the back gate a forest walk to kindergarten nur ein paar minuten or to the shops also to the Mischwald, a 3 or 4 sq k. forest the Stadtpark with lovely walks the Bille, a little river flowing through. Beech, birch, oak lots more Sebastian goes to kindergarten each day until 12 loves it. German is taking over from English, naturally, but Gill is determined to keep his English going. He tends to speak it with German constructions now vice versa sometimes Charlotte is a little person knows exactly what she wants her 3 chief loves are a cot cover, Made by my exneighbour, Softy Bear who was Gills but still looks like new a dummy. Theyre trying to get rid of the latter but its a bit of a joke now if it gives her some comfort, why not so long as its not in public. She trails around the house with her paraphenalia is putting words together very well so clearly. She divides syllables up carefully at the moment also likes things to be tidy I dont suppose this will last long. Gills quartet gave their concert as part of the Hamburg Festival on Thurs. The festival is really a lot of concerts over a month some in unusual venues. Theirs was in the Finance building in a small hall. Without audience the acoustics were so resonant I feared for them, but all these lovely people started rolling in from 30 onwards by 8 it was wellfilled."
