    "text": "Donors must be identified Olsen From DAVID WASHINGTON CANBERRA The head of the Liberal Party committee on disclosure of political donations has called for stronger Government moves to enforce full disclosure. The call, by South Australian Senator John Olsen, flies in the face of concern by Liberal Party organisational figures that the disclosure provisions will have a disastrous effect on party finances. Senator Olsen said yesterday the Governments legislation should be improved, to close loopholes which allow the true source of donations to be disguised. Liberal Party divisions on the issue widened at the weekend, with the Opposition Leader, Dr Hewson, hitting back at the NSW Liberal Partys senior fundraiser over his criticism of the Oppositions decision to support full disclosure. The chairman of the NSW Liberal Partys central finance committee, Mr Bevan Bradbury, has reportedly written to Liberal MPs criticising the decision. His letter said disclosing the identity of donors would have a devastating effect on the Liberal Party. The impact on the inflow of funds to the party of legislation that requires the identity of donors be revealed will be horrendous and it will be immediate, the letter said. Dr Hewson said he could understand Mr Bradburys frustration but he must accept that he and the party organisation do not make the policies of the parliamentary party. He said the Coalition would work to ensure that the Governments draft legislation was fair and equitable. Senator Olsen, in a statement which will anger party officials such as Mr PhotoCaption Bradbury, called on the government to toughen its disclosure legislation. With this disclosure bill, there is not true disclosure, Senator Olsen said. This was because the last person or group to handle the donation before it was given to the party was disclosed as the donor, but the real donor could be completely different. Full of rhetoric Senator Olsen said the bill was full of rhetoric and fulsome wording aimed at creating the perception of action. But careful analysis shows the Government is committed, as always, to protecting the prime source of donations from its mates, perpetuating the deviousroundrobin of bags of cash weve heard so much about from the WA royal commission, he said. Senator Olsen said the Electoral Commission should be given the power to conduct spot audits, to ensure the true sources of donations were revealed. The Opposition would propose substantial amendments to the disclosure bill, including giving union members the right to decide whether their union dues should go to the ALP. Senator Olsen said the bill made no mention of unions disclosure of the millions of dollars in affiliation fees and other donations they passed on to the ALP every year. Yet a massive 44 per cent of union members 32 per cent Coalition, 12 per cent Democrat do not vote for the ALP, he said. Liberal Party officials are concerned that many financial backers will refuse to donate if their identities are revealed publicly. Last week, the Government introduced the bill to ban political advertising and enforce full disclosure of donations but it is yet to be debated. Summit rebuff to Bannon From Chief Political Writer LINDSAY OLNEY CANBERRA The call by the Premier, Mr Bannon, for a national summit on unemployment faces certain rejection by the Federal government. Despite varying degrees of support for a summit from other Labor premiers, the Government will agree to no more than a full discussion of unemployment at the annual Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting on May The summit idea also faced opposition yesterday from employers and the ACTU. But Labor state premiers continued to support the push by Mr Bannon for the special conference. In BRISBANE, the Queensland Premier, Mr Goss, said Australia needed national policy changes, concrete public works programs and tax breaks for private industry to tackle the growing unemployment crisis. He said it was time for the Federal Government to look at some major national projects of public works. The Victorian Premier, Mrs Kirner, will contact other premiers in a bid to get agreement on a joint States push for national action on job creation. Mrs Kirner said she would contact the premiers before the May 31 Premiers Conference to establish an agreed agenda for the talks. Although no formal decision has been made about the summit, sources said the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, was a bit cool on the idea. There was doubt about what such a summit could achieve and there were dangers it could become purely atalkfest. Yesterday, the Employment Minister, Mr Dawkins, attacked Mr Bannons proposals to bring forward major infrastructure projects such as the DarwinAlice Springs railway and the multifunction polls to boost employment and provide Austra Table Banks, business to blame Keating blockThe Treasurer, Mr Keating, told Parliament yesterday there was no doubt Australia had substantial economic difficulties, but it would pull out of the recession with lower interest rates. blockHe blamed the business and banking community for many of the economic problems. blockThis recession is deeper than official policy would have had it be, he said. blockMr Keating said banks were the only institutions able to conduct a credit squeeze and were now doing so to some sections of the community. lia with infrastruture resources to take advantage of the recovery. You certainly dont want to go ahead with crazy ideas like building unwanted railway lines betweeen Darwin and Alice Springs, he said. It would cost a fortune and is just not appropriate for our current circumstances. The summit proposal was condemned by the Opposition employment spokesman, Mr Howard, as a stupid gimmick. He said it would do no more than raise false expectations and would not help the growing unemployment problem. You cannot solve unemployment by talkfest, he said. Unemployment will go higher.M One of the biggest problems is that people lack confidence. If the Government showed some confidence maybe this would rub off on the economy. The Confederation of Australian Industry chief executive, Mr Ian Spicer, said he saw no good reason to have an unemployment summit at this time. What needs to be done is no mystery, he said. There should be no need to gather everyone together to decide to do the things that obviously need to be done without delay. Mr Spicer said the Federal Government had to look at its interest rates policy, support the recent national wage decision and restructure the tax system with the introduction of a consumption tax. The ACTU president, Mr Martin Ferguson, said the union movement was not interested in an unemployment summit, as it believed such a summit would be just another talkfest. Meanwhile, the consumer price index for the March quarter, to be released tomorrow, is expected to show that price rises slowed almost to a halt. With the Government counting on a low figure to ease the battering its credibility has received over unemployment, another drop in interest rates is thought to be inevitable. The Reserve Bank board met last week to discuss levels of interest rates and is believed to be poised to cut 5 per cent from offical rates. The major banks are expected to pass any fall on to mortgage rates almost immediately, bringing their lowest housing rates to 5 per cent or lower. Yesterday, the forecasting group BIS Shrapnel predicted housing rates would go to 13 per cent in the JulySeptember quarter, with rates unlikely to rise again for two years. It said banks would be keen to increase their home lending through lower rates and this would encourage new buyers into the market, promoting a recovery in the housing market in the September quarter. This indicated that general economic recovery would be slow in the second half of this year but would quicken in The consumer price index release is likely to show the lowest quarterly inflation rate in many years, and will put the annual inflation figure on track for a result of about 5 per cent or less. There have even been suggestions that the CPI for the quarter will actually fall. No more Umines ALP From LINDSAY OLNEY and DAVID WALKER The Labor Party has ducked the issue of changing its uranium policy and will not permit more mines to be developed at its national conference next month. The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, who has described the existing threemine policy as illogical, is believed to have told backbenchers that a change would not justify the political aggravation of a conference row on uranium. The decision is expected to anger the mining industry and put the Government under further Opposition pressure for putting political considerations before the countrys economic imperatives. Party sources last night said the issue would be debated briefly at the June ALP conference but that the factions had agreed in advance that the policy would not change. A decision to retain the existing policy would contradict the recommendations of a party policy review committee, which said the policy should be overturned. Although Mr Hawke has not given a public view on the threemines policy for several years, it was understood he and other rightwing ALP figures favored a change to promote export earnings and increase developer confidence in the Government. But it is now believed that Mr Hawke sees no point in changing TableOpposition gaining support poll SYDNEY The federal Coalitions lead over the Hawke Labor Government has widened one percentage point to 17 per cent, according to the latest Morgan Gallup Poll. The poll, published in the Bulletin magazine, showed support for the Government remained on a record low of 32 per cent while support for the Opposition increased one point to 49 per cent. Approval of the way Mr Hawke was handling his job dropped one point to 38 per cent, while 54 per cent disapproved. Opposition Leader Dr Hewsons approval also dropped one point to 48 per cent, while 29 per cent disapproved. When electors were asked who would make the better prime minister, 44 per cent opted for Mr Hawke and 41 per cent said Dr Hewson. the policy, especially with a depressed world uranium market. Last night a spokesman for the Prime Minister would neither confirm nor deny the reports. However, he did say Mr Hawke had reached a position regarding uranium policy.Last night leftwing MPs claimed that leadership pressures had forced Mr. Hawke to adopt a nochange position although other MPs said that the main consideration was the generally low standing of the Government. In 1982 the ALP decided that uranium mining would be confined to Roxby Downs, Ranger and Narbalek, which has since closed. At the 1988 conference the party established a review committee on the policy. The committee decided, with a dissenting minority report, that expansion should be permitted. That report is now certain to be rejected by the conference. The ALPs national executive is due to consider the report on June 1, although this is now no more than a formality. Yesterday the convener of the Centre Left faction, Senator Michael Beahan, said he did not think there were sufficient numbers in the party to force a change. Senator Jim McKiernan, from the Left, said the faction would continue to fight to prevent any change and would not settle on anything less than a formal pronouncement that the push for expansion had been abandoned. Last night the Opposition spokesman on energy and resources, Mr Tim Fischer, said if Mr Hawke refused a change he would be walking away from his responsibilities to the national interest. The Prime Minister has repeatedly said that Labors policy is illogical, he said. Australia has missed another opportunity and is sending an extremely confused message to overseas interests who may be considering development projects in Australia. What may be good for the political unity of the ALP is an absolute disaster for the mining industry and Australia generally. A spokesman for Western Mining Corporation Ltd, which operates the only uranium mine in South Australia at Olympic Dant, said there was no major expectation of a change. Were steaming ahead pursuing new markets for our products, he said."
