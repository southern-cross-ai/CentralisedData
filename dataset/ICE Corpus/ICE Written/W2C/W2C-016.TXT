<p><#\>FOOD prices are set to increase with rises in bread, chicken, eggs and milk.</p>

<p><#\>Families will be hit with rises of up to 10c on some products as the crippling drought worsens across the State.</p>

<p><#\>Other essential foodstuffs are also expected to cost more if the drought con<l>tinues into next year.</p>

<p><#\>Some wholesale bread prices are already up between 5c and 10c with retailers pre<l>paring to pass on increases this week.</p>

<p><#\>Eggs will rise 10c a dozen while a special drought price of an extra 3c a litre for milk is being considered.</p>

<p><#\>The fishing industry is suffering as rivers dry up, pushing up the price of fresh<l>water species.</p>

<p><#\>And oysters will cost about 35c a dozen extra if the drought continues and oys<l>ters starve because of the lack of nutrients in rivers.</p>

<p><#\>The gain shortage, which has pushed prices up $100 a tonne in the past two months, has resulted in huge cost increases in most industries.</p>

<p><#\>Although the major pri<l>mary producers said there had not been any rises for consumers yet, they warned higher prices were only weeks away as production costs continued to rise.</p>

<p><#\>Bread prices will rise this week, a Bread Board spokes<l>man said.</p>

<p><#\>Consumers can also expect to pay between 15c and 25c extra a kilo for chicken before December.</p>

<p><#\>Executive director of the Aus<l>tralian Poultry Industry Asso<l>ciation Jeff Fairbrother said poultry producers were<bold><*>bullet</*>Continued Page 2 Food costs hit families <*>bullet</*>From page 1</bold>trying to cope with the shortage which had seen prices rise from $165 a tonne in August to $265 a tonne this month.</p>

<p><#\>He said for every $10 rise in the price of wheat, the cost of pro<l>ducing a chicken went up about 20c a kilo.</p>

<p><#\><quote>You can't just absorb that increase,</quote> he said.</p>

<p><#\><quote>All poultry products will go up.</quote></p>

<p><#\>NSW Egg Producers Co-operative sales man<l>ager David Watson said consumers could expect a price rise of at least 10c a dozen by Christ<l>mas if the grain price continued to rise.</p>

<p><#\>NSW Dairy Corpora<l>tion director of opera<l>tions Ron Hicks said the corporation was moni<l>toring the situation carefully.</p>

<p><#\>Mr Hicks said if the drought continued, pressure from farmers would mount to increase the price to consumers to help meet costs.</p>

<p><#\>Under consideration is a special allowance which would lift the price of milk by about 3c a litre while the drought continued.</p>

<p><#\>Mr Hicks said milk production had been holding up fairly well until now although far<l>mers were facing higher production costs.</p>

<p><#\>He said there had been no shortage in the liquid milk market but some shortages were starting to occur in the dairy foods sector.</p>

<p><#\>Possible price rises for cheese and other dairy products was harder to predict, he said, as these products were not regu<l>lated like the milk mar<l>ket.</p>

<p><#\>The fishing industry has been particularly hard hit by the drought with price increases of 10 per cent across the board.</p>

<p><#\>Commercial fisherman Keith Sewell said lob<l>ster was already selling <quote>on the floor</quote> for be<l>tween $40 and $45 a kilo <longdash> $10 more than last year.</p>

<p><#\>Bream prices have also risen to about $10 a kilo <longdash> up from about $6 at the same time last year.</p>

<p><#\>People hoping to have prawns on the table at Christmas will be pay<l>ing record prices above the present level of $28 kg.</p>

<p><#\>NSW Meat Industry Authority spokesman John Carter said no price increases were ex<l>pected in red meat in the short term as supply was still high.</p>

<p><#\>Supplies of fruit and vegetables also re<l>mained high, keeping prices constant, al<l>though suppliers warned that could change in a matter of weeks.</p>

<#\><h><bold>Bushfires: fear of a new Black Saturday</bold></h>
<#\><bold>By JOHN LARKIN</bold>

<p><#\>OUR parched farmers aren't the only ones who want the drought to break.</p>

<p><#\>NSW's bushfire fighters are praying for at least two months of rain to quench bushland they say is as tin<l>der-dry as the countless hectares devoured by the disastrous January fires.</p>

<p><#\>The drought has raised the spectre of another horri<l>fic bushfire season. <#\>The bush is bone dry, so dry that the NSW Bushfire Service had to scale down its burn-off last week after several of its fires got out of control.</p>

<p><#\>Last week's late down<l>pours did little to diminish the threat. <#\><quote>We need a couple of months of sus<l>tained rainfall to make any difference,</quote> NSW Bushfire Service official Ross Smith said yesterday.</p>

<p><#\>The signs of another tough summer are ominous. <#\>There were eight major fires in one day in the grass<?>-</?>lands around Campbelltown two weeks ago. <#\>Fires are ig<l>niting at usually wet areas around Picton. <#\>Last week<l>end, 14 brigades fought a 300 ha fire in the Hawkes<l>bury area. <#\>A house and two cars were lost.</p>

<p><#\>Last Tuesday, four-metre-high flames at a grass-fire near Blacktown kept fire fighters busy all day.</p>

<p><#\><quote>I haven't seen anything like that for years,</quote> said Dave Dawson, the deputy fire control officer at Black<l>town Bushfire Service.</p>

<p><#\><quote>I believe it's much worse than January.</quote> <#\><quote>We've had no rain since last year virtually, and it's winter-time.</quote></p>
<p><#\><quote>If we don't get rain be<l>tween now and October we've got real problems.</quote></p>

<p><#\>NSW Bushfire Service Commissioner Phil Koper<l>berg is a worried man. <#\>While confident NSW will not see the likes of the January bushfires for some time, this year is shaping as another tough one for thousands of volunteer bushfire fighters.</p>

<p><#\><quote>The events of January 1994 were fairly unique and not likely to impact often on a community like Sydney,</quote> he said last week in an inter<l>view at his Rosehill office.</p>

<p><#\><quote>Nevertheless if the drought continues unabated we will have a severe fire season around Sydney, the Blue Mountains, the South<l>ern Tablelands, the south coast, the north coast and the New England area.</quote></p>

<p><#\>The commissioner is care<l>ful not to inflame panic, but he notes gloomily that the Bureau of Meteorology, while not in the business of long-term forecasting, has said there will be below aver<l>age rainfall until October.</p>

<p><#\>The areas most at risk will be those that escaped Ja<l>nuary's flames and which have not been burnt off in one of the BFS's hazard reduction exercises.</p>

<p><#\>In these areas, combustible material <longdash> dry grass, vegeta<l>tion and dead trees <longdash> still lies on the ground. <#\>It is imposs<l>ible to burn all of it off.</p>

<p><#\>Mr Koperberg is con<l>cerned about the Baulkham Hills and Hornsby areas, St Ives, Pymble, Davidson, Bel<l>rose, Turramurra, French's Forest, Lindfield and Roseville.</p>

<p><#\>Other areas of concern are the Blue Mountains (from Mt Victoria to Lapstone), the grassland areas around Campbelltown, Penrith, Camden, Liverpool and Blacktown, the southern highlands from Picton to Goulburn and the south coast, from Helensburgh to the Victorian border.</p>

<p><#\>Pastureland from Dural up to the Hawkesbury River is also vulnerable this sea<l>son, as are dry tracts near Windsor, Richmond and Wilberforce.</p>

<p><#\>The commissioner stresses that these areas are not nec<l>essarily in danger, but are vulnerable due to their large amount of dry vegetation.</p>

<p><#\><quote>If you can have a fire of the severity that we had in Como-Jannali (in January) then you can have it at Dee Why or Palm Beach or Middle Cover or Lane Cove,</quote> he said. <#\><quote>That's the bottom line.</quote></p>

<p><#\><quote>If the drought breaks and we have normal spring and summer rainfall, then we'll have a normal fire season.</quote></p>

<p><#\>After January's horror, the BFS upgraded its haz<l>ard reduction burn-offs, but the heat has made a threat of even these.</p>

<p><#\><quote>We should be at the height of our burning now and we've had to terminate most of it,</quote> Mr Koperberg said. <#\><quote>We've slowed it down because some of them are getting away from us.</quote> <#\><quote>It's so dry and so unseasonally warm and windy.</quote></p>

<p><#\>With increased resources and new legislation obliging every landowner to take steps to reduce fire hazards, Mr Koperberg feels more confident this season about his unit's capacity to re<l>spond quickly to a threat.</p>

<p><#\><quote>Whilst with the benefit of hindsight there are some things we would do slightly differently, most of what we did we would do again, be<l>cause it was successful,</quote> he says. <#\>The State Govern<l>ment last week launched a video education program sponsored by NRMA, to highlight fire danger. <#\>A computer-based learning program for schools, Opera<l>tion Fireguard, will be launched shortly.</p>

<p><#\>BFS staff numbers have been increased. <#\>Volunteers are up by 5000 since January and the Rosehill BFS office staff now numbers 27. <#\>Forty new fire tankers will be put on the road in time for the bushfire season. <#\>In all, the BFS will have 100 new fire-fighting vehicles, costing $20 million, ready for action.</p>

<p><#\>New measures include highly trained incident management teams that will be deployed to help local units in an emergency, a computer-enhanced light<l>ening detection system and two mobile communications units costing $500,000 apiece.</p>

<p><#\>The BFS's State Tactical Assistance Response Group has been upgraded and equipped to go anywhere in NSW to support local fire fighters. <#\>A new $1 million operations centre at Rose<l>hill, including the latest in satellite technology, will allow better surveillance.</p>

<p><#\>Mr Koperberg sums up the changes: <quote>Better coordina<l>tion, better communications and better intelligence.</quote></p>

<p><#\><quote>The success or failure of dealing with a major fire de<l>pends on how early you know it's there, how early you're able to apply resour<l>ces to it and how good your intelligence is.</quote></p>

<p><#\>The January fires cost three lives and 204 houses. <#\>The toll could have been higher, according to the commissioner.</p>

<p><#\>With the new legislation, the householder's role in preventing or limiting fire in important. <#\>Mr Koperberg urged all householders to clear combustible matter from around the house, keep the roof and gutters clean and make sure gar<l>dens are not overgrown.</p>

<p><#\>If fire does approach, lad<l>ders should be nearby to give access to the roof, hoses kept handy, doors and win<l>dows securely closed and all ventilation ports plugged.</p>

<p><#\>And don't even think of confronting a fire in shorts and a T-shirt. <#\>Sturdy dress of cotton or wool is the fire-fighter's dress code.</p>

<p><#\><quote>It's a question of good housekeeping,</quote> Mr Koper<l>berg said. <#\><quote>If all these pre<l>cautions are taken and providing the house isn't surrounded by bush, then there is a very good chance that it can be saved.</quote></p>

<#\><h><bold>SILENT BIRTHS</bold></h>

<#\><h><bold>The baby hears the screams of labour</bold></h>

<p><#\>WHEN Jacinta Lyndsay cuddles her new-born daughter, her face be<l>comes imbued with the maternal pride that has inspired countless Ma<l>donna-child masterpieces.</p>

<p><#\>But then, theirs is a special bond that not so much as a moan has been per<l>mitted to jeopardise.</p>

<p><#\>That's because Jacinta is a long-time member of the Church of Scientology, which encourages its devotees to main<l>tain a vow of silence during birth.</p>

<p><#\>There was no thrashing, let alone any of the howls that normally erupt during labour, when Jacinta gave birth to Meg at her Vaucluse home two weeks ago.</p>

<p><#\>It may seem medieval to some and impossible to others, but Jacinta, 29, insists it is done with nothing but the baby's well-being in mind.</p>

<p><#\>Meg is Jacinta and husband Doug's second child born in this manner and, despite a slight hitch when the umbili<l>cal cord wrapped around Meg's head, all proceeded calmly <longdash> and quietly.</p>

<p><#\>Silent birth has always been a tenet of Scientology, but it became a conten<l>tious topic only after a number of ce<l>lebrities belonging to the movement went public on the procedure. <#\>Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman <longdash> high-pro<l>file members of the church <longdash> adopted their daughter Isabella Jane last month only after ensuring she had been delivered in silence.</p>

<p><#\>Other members who had their chil<l>dren delivered in accordance with Scientology teachings include John Travolta and wife Kelly Preston and Lisa Marie Pres<l>ley and her husband, Danny Keough.</p>

<p><#\>Lisa Marie, 24, is said to have endured nine excruciating hours of labour <longdash> without pain-killers <longdash> before she gave birth to her son, Benjamin Storm Keough.</p>

<p><#\>Lisa Marie, a devout member of the church since the age of 10, apparently gagged her cries of pain by clenching her teeth on a roll of gauze.</p>

<p><#\>According to Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, the fetus not only hears the sounds outside the womb, but makes a detailed mental re<l>cording of them.</p>

<p><#\>In his self-help best-seller Di<l>anetics, Hubbard explains that when an unborn child has a traumatic experience, includ<l>ing being bumped, knocked or squeezed in the womb, any<l>thing said by the mother or others around the mother is recorded <longdash> word for word <longdash> in the child's subconscious.</p></I>
