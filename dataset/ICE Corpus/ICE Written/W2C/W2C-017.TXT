<I><#\><h><bold>Smith report airing 'could hamper probe'</bold></h>
<#\><bold>By MARTIN SAXON</bold>

<p><#\><bold>POLICE</bold> investigations into possible criminal offences could be threatened by the release of a secret report detail<l>ing the private financial affairs of controversial Liberal MP Wayde Smith.</p>

<p><#\>Senior police and the Direc<l>tor of Public Prosecutions say that revealing the contents of the confidential document could seriously impair investigations and would also prejudice the hearing of any future charges.</p>

<p><#\>Police and the DPP have objected to the release of the report to the <it>Sunday Times</it> under the Freedom of Infor<l>mation Act.</p>

<p><#\>The DPP said disclosure of the document at this stage in the investigation was likely to seriously impair future inves<l>tigation of possible offences which might have been committed.</p>

<p><#\><quote>If charges do result, the publication <*>dotted line</*> is bound to have a prejudicial effect on any subsequent trial,</quote> it said.</p>

<p><#\>The report was prepared late last year for Premier Richard Court after questions about Mr Smith's personal finances and his business dealings with former Wan<l>eroo mayor Wayne Brad<l>shaw.</p>

<p><#\>At the time, Mr Court refused to release the report, prepared by accountant Ste<l>phen Mann, but the Premier said that it disclosed no evidence of illegality or impro<l>priety by Mr Smith.</p>

<p><#\>But in June, detectives seized the Mann report from the Ministry of Premier and Cabinet under a search war<l>rant after earlier raiding Mr Smith's home and electoral office.</p>

<p><#\>Senior police now say the document is <quote>integral</quote> to ongoing investigations involving <quote>particularly sensitive issues</quote>.</p>

<p><#\>They have not elaborated on the nature of the investiga<l>tion, but it is know that they have uncovered evidence that an alleged $50,000 council-related "kickback" to Dr Bradshaw was cashed through Mr Smith's personal bank ac<l>count.</p>

<p><#\>The <it>Sunday Times</it> applied for FOI access to the Mann report last December, the day that the Premier gave Mr Smith's financial dealings a clean bill of health.</p>

<p><#\>In February, the Ministry of Premier and Cabinet said it was refusing to release the report and another related document, claiming they were exempt under various sections of the FOI Act.</p>

<p><#\>The claimed exemptions related to the deliberative processes of government, the disclosure of personal, busi<l>ness and commercial informa<l>tion and a possible breach of confidence.</p>

<p><#\>In March, the <it>Sunday Times</it> asked State Information Com<l>missioner Bronwyn Keighley-Gerardy to review the Ministry's refusal to release the document.</p>

<p><#\>The Commissioner's review <longdash> supposed to take 30 days under the FOI legislation <longdash> dragged on for months and was complicated in June when police seized the Ministry's only copy of the Mann report.</p>

<p><#\>Six months after the review began, Ms Keighley-Gerardy handed down her decision late on Friday.</p>

<p><#\>She has essentially rejected the Ministry's grounds for refusing to release the documents, but she considers the documents are now ex<l>empt because of the police in<l>vestigation.</p>

<p><#\><quote>I accept the advice provided to me by the Assistant Com<l>missioner and the DPP about the status of (the Mann re<l>port),</quote> she said in her decision.</p>

<p><#\><quote>Taking into account that advice, and my own examina<l>tion of its contents, I am satis<l>fied that it is reasonable to expect that the disclosure of (the report) could reveal more than merely the fact that there was an investigation of some kind.</quote></p>

<p><#\>Ms Keighley-Gerardy, a former senior police officer, speculated about the effects of disclosure on the investigation.</p>

<p><#\><quote>Several possibilities come to mind,</quote> she said.</p>

<p><#\><quote>Disclosure may reveal for example the names of poten<l>tial witnesses, sources of evidence, the nature of the in<l>vestigation, the substance of the particular matters being investigated, the identity of possible offenders or other breaches of the law.</quote></p>

<p><#\>She decided the Mann report and another document, still in the possession of the Ministry, were also exempt because their release could prejudice any future trials.<618></p>

<#\><h><bold>Lodge fire sparks probe call</bold></h>
<#\><bold>By ANN TREWEEK</bold>

<p><#\>ANOTHER fire this week in a run-down Subiaco boarding house with mental<l>ly-ill residents has brought calls for a governmental inquiry.</p>

<p><#\>Claims of poor conditions at the Subiaco Lodge inspired Opposition health spokesman Dr Geoff Gallop to urge investigation <longdash> and Subiaco Council is suggesting improvements and wants a meeting on the issue.</p>

<p><#\>This follows a fire on Monday night when a man was taken to hospital after setting his carpet alight and locking himself in his room.</p>

<p><#\>In July last year, two elderly men overcome by smoke were rescued from a fire causing $25,000 damage to one of the three Subiaco Lodge buildings.</p>

<p><#\>As a licensed boarding house, it is subject only to council regulations, not to State legislation on hostels for mentally-ill people.</p>

<p><#\>The Coghlan Rd property advertises <quote>comfortable accommodation <longdash> excellent home cooked meals</quote>.</p>

<p><#\>Dr Gallop wrote on Friday to the Health and Fair Trading Minister, Mr Foss, asking him to investigate if disadvantaged people not in a position to complain were being exploited.</p>

<p><#\><quote>When the relevant authorities attended there was no fire extinguisher or hose,</quote> Dr Gallop said.</p>

<p><#\>He said problems with boarding houses were highlighted by the Burdekin report on the rights of mentally ill people, which urged stringent licensing and regulation by State governments.</p>

<p><#\>Dr Gallop said other concerns raised about the Subiaco Lodge were about the standard of food and facilities, and the supplying of medication by untrained people.</p>

<p><#\>Subiaco council chief executive officer Pat Walker made a brief inspection on Thursday afternoon after complaints.</p>

<p><#\>He said improvements were suggested and the council was interested in pursuing some other issues.</p>

<p><#\>Mr Walker said lodge areas he saw generally fulfilled minimum hygiene standards under regulations.</p>

<p><#\><quote>It doesn't mean you and I and other members of the population would be happy there,</quote> he said.</p>

<p><#\>On Friday, lodge licensee John Nowicki and his wife installed two fire extinguishers in each building and smoke detectors in bedrooms.</p>

<p><#\>The lodge has 28 residents, including disabled people.Mrs Terera Nowicki said: <quote>They have everything we can supply.</quote></p>

<p><#\>The rate was $110 weekly for a single room and $100 for a shared room with all meals.</p>

<p><#\>Asked about the alleged smell in one house, she said: <quote>They're not new houses.</quote> <#\><quote>I go in every afternoon to clean them.</quote></p>

<p><#\><quote>But if someone piddled in the shower <longdash> I can't spend 24 hours a day there. <#\>You can't stop them.</quote> <#\><quote>They're not normal people.</quote></p>

<#\><h><bold>Insurers treat us like dirt, say victims</bold></h>
<#\><bold>By JIM POLLARD</bold>

<p><#\>INSURANCE companies have been accused of "emotion<l>ally raping" injured workers through bulk referrals to controversial psychiatrists.</p>

<p><#\>The head of WA's Injured <w>Persons'</w> group, Mrs Peggy Nilon, said she believed that hundreds of injured workers were being sent to psychiatrists for little reason other than undermining their compensation claims.</p>

<p><#\>People were being put through additional torment by being questioned about their sex life, past relationships, their childhood and personal habits which had nothing to do with a work injury, she said.</p>

<p><#\><quote>Everyone goes on about victims of crime and while I sympathise with them, they at least are not shopped around among doctors and psychiatr<l>ists,</quote> Mrs Nilon said.</p>

<p><#\><quote>What injured people are going through is absolutely appalling. <#\>They are treated like dirt, as though all of them are frauds.</quote></p>

<p><#\>Insurance industry spokesman Tony Carter said if people believed that psychiatrists or medical practitioners were behaving improperly they should report them to the appropriate authority <longdash> the WA Medical Board.</p>

<p><#\><quote>If they are having those problems they should report it to the insurance company</quote> he said. <#\><quote>And they could express their concerns through any service provider to WorkCover WA.</quote></p>

<p><#\>Labor Relations Minister Graham Kierath said recently that WA's new <w>workers'</w> compensation system had ended the controversial practice of doctor-shopping <longdash> when injured people were sent to numerous doctors or psychiatrists until one questioned a person's injury or capacity to work.</p>

<p><#\>But Mrs Nilon said the practice was still widespread, only now, insurers were referring people to specialists and psychiatrists far earlier than previously.</p>

<p><#\><quote>The sort of psychiatrists they're using are, quite honestly, dangerous <longdash> and I don't use that term loosely,</quote> she said.</p>

<p><#\><quote>They're dangerous people <longdash> whether they are aware or not of the emotional damage that they do to injured workers.</quote> <#\><quote>And I would hate to think they are not aware of the damage they are doing.</quote></p>

<p><#\><quote>People have committed suicide after seeing some of them here in WA.</quote> <#\><quote>That means they are responsible for these people's deaths, as are the insurance companies.</quote></p>

<p><#\><quote>They start off sending injured people to medical specialists whose objectivity we question.</quote> <#\><quote>Then they end up sent to these psychiatrists and that's often the straw that breaks the camel's back.</quote></p>

<p><#\>Reports from one psychiatrist in the northern suburbs contained inaccuracies and dubious conclusions, she claimed.</p>

<p><#\><quote>They're digging into people's past traumas <longdash> whether they were abused as a child, whether their parents were separated, whether they are bisexual.</quote></p>

<p><#\><quote>But what's that got to do with a person's injury?</quote> <#\><quote>It's like mentally or emotionally raping all these people.</quote></p>

<p><#\>Mrs Nilon claimed it was a tactic, in the insurance <w>companies'</w> eyes, to undermine a person's case.</p>

<p><#\>Mrs Nilon expressed frustration that there was public outrage over victims of crime, yet injured people were still being treated <quote>like dirt</quote>.</p>

<#\><h><bold>PRISON PROBE INTO CONNELL</bold></h>
<#\><bold>By JANET WAINWRIGHT</bold>

<p><#\><bold>JUSTICE Ministry chief David Grant has ordered an immediate report into how Laurie Connell was given preferential treatment in Casuarina Prison</bold></p>

<p><#\>Mr Grant learnt this week that Connell had been allowed self-care in Casuarina just three months after he was jailed.</p>

<p><#\>Long-term prisoners in top security normally are considered for self-care after six months.</p>

<p><#\>This lets them to do their own cooking from food supplied weekly by the prison and to do their own laundry.</p>

<p><#\>It gives prisoners more freedom to move around and have their meals when they wish.</p>

<p><#\>Self-care is considered a perk, earned after being in a cell with meals supplied from a central kitchen at set times for the early part of their sentence.</p>

<p><#\>The inquiry into special treatment for the jail's most publicised prisoner is the latest in a list of inquiries launched by Mr Grant.</p>

<p><#\>He is working closely with Director of Public Prosecutions John McKechnie QC and Police Commissioner Bob Falconer.</p>

<p><#\>Mr Grant vowed yesterday to stamp out any intimidation within the prison service.</p>

<p><#\><quote>I will not tolerate any officers being intimidated because they are putting in place government policy,</quote> he said.</p>

<p><#\><quote>There are a small number of officers who lost their access to apparently endless overtime under the previous government, and I will not stand by and watch others being threatened if that is what is happening.</quote></p>

<p><#\><quote>There are those who will see all this activity as a sign of chaos, but it is absolutely the opposite.</quote></p>

<p><#\><quote>It is the product of relentless determination to find any kind of inefficiency, illegality, maladmin<l>istration or malpractice.</quote></p>

<p><#\><quote>I will make no comment on predecessors but I will not let anything lie,</quote> he said, indicating that a 1992 inquiry into millions of wasted dollars in the <w>prisons'</w> building services division was not yet over.</p>

<p><#\>The inquiry was tabled in Parliament at the end of 1992 and a subsequent report upheld the contention that millions had been wasted.</p>

<p><#\><quote>The problems go back 20 years and I inherited a WA Inc in miniature,</quote> Mr Grant said.</p>

<#\><h><bold>Connell jail perk probe</bold></h>

<p><#\>Previously with the NSW Prisons Department, he was appointed to head the Department of Corrections in 1992 by former attorney-general Joe Berinson.</p>

<p><#\>He replaced long-term head Ian Hill, who now heads WA's Training Department.</p>

<p><#\>Soon after his appointment, Mr Grant commissioned the report into the department's building services division.</p>

<p><#\>Part of that inquiry has been with the Fraud Squad for 18 months but this week police handed their findings to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>

<p><#\>Senior Crown Prosecutor Gerard Overman is now considering whether any action should be taken.</p>

<p><#\>Mr Grant's workload was increased when he was given the job of heading the new super Justice Ministry by Attorney-General Cheryl Edwardes.</p>

<p><#\>He was given information in May alleging drug running in the jails and this was passed to the police.</p>

<p><#\>In July, Mr Grant was given a report of an interview with jailed Wanneroo councillor David King, which was passed to the DPP.</p>

<p><#\>The most recent report was from prison superintendent Peter Moore, who said there were allegations of stand-over tactics by prison officers opposed to the industrial reforms introduced on July 1 and narrowly agreed to in a secret ballot by the Prison Officers Union.</p></I>
