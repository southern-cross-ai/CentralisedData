<I><#\><h><bold>Charges dropped against third war crimes accused</bold></h>

<#\>By BINA BROWN and ROHAN SULLIVAN

<p><#\>THE prosecution of alleged war criminals in Australia col<l>lapsed yesterday after the De<l>partment of Public Prosecutions withdrew charges against the third and final accused, Mr Hein<l>rich Wagner.</p>

<p><#\>The decision effectively ends a four-year pursuit of World War II European war criminals thought to be living in Australia which has cost an estimated $30 million and failed to generate a conviction.</p>

<p><#\>The DPP made its decision on Wednesday after hearing evidence in the South Australia Supreme Court that Mr Wagner, 69, suff<l>ered a heart attack last month and a trial might kill him.</p>

<p><#\>Mr Wagner pleaded not guilty to being knowingly involved in the deaths of 104 Jewish adults and 19 children with Jewish fathers dur<l>ing Germany's World War II occu<l>pation of the Ukraine.</p>

<p><#\>He had been due to stand trial in the new year, following extended legal argument.</p>

<p><#\>A spokesman for the federal DPP said the charges against Wagner were among the last laid by the Special Investigations Unit of the Australian Federal Police.</p>

<p><#\>The unit investigated more than 800 possible war crimes cases be<l>tween 1987 and 1992 but referred only four cases to the DPP.</p>

<p><#\>Charges were laid against only three men, all Ukrainian immigr<l>ants living in Adelaide, and the fourth case was 
abandoned when the unit was disbanded in Septem<l>ber 1992.</p>

<p><#\>The DPP spokesman said yester<l>day further legal proceedings under Australian War Crimes leg<l>islation, which targets crimes com<l>mitted in Europe between 1939 and 1945, were not expected.</p>

<p><#\><quote>We are not aware of any more (cases),</quote> the spokesman said.</p>

<p><#\>The first man charged, Mr Ivan Tymofeyevich Polyukhovich, 76, was acquitted by a Supreme Court jury in May while charges against pensioner Mr Mikolay Berezowsky, 79, were dismissed by a committal magistrate in July.</p>

<p><#\>Defence lawyer for the three men, Mr Michael David QC, said yester<l>day after listening to the evidence for 2 1/2 years <quote>none of these people should have been convicted</quote>.</p>

<p><#\>Mr David rejected claims Mr Wagner was let off on a technical<l>ity and declined to comment on whether the cost of the trials could have been better spent elsewhere.</p>

<p><#\><quote>It would be unfair of the public to say Wagner got off on a techni<l>cality.</quote> he said. <#\><quote>The fact was he just couldn't go to trial <*>dotted line</*> it was just objective evidence that he couldn't go to trial.</quote></p>

<p><#\><quote>Our client (Mr Wagner) had a heart attack two or three weeks ago. <#\>We called medical evidence in court, we wrote to the DPP and he ultimately, having seen the medi<l>cal evidence, said the trial shouldn't go on and entered what is called a 'nolle proseque' (with<l>drawal of charges).</quote></p>

<p><#\>Mr David said Mr Wagner, who was not available for comment, was very relieved at the decision.</p>

<p><#\>Estimated costs to taxpayers for the three cases, not including all the Wagner trial costs, have been put at about $30 million.</p>

<p><#\><quote>There is a lot of public opinion about whether they should have gone on or not or whether the money could have been better spent elsewhere. <#\>All I can say is they were three very hard-fought, difficult cases <*>dotted line</*> and they were very difficult to defend, as well as prosecute, I should imagine,</quote> Mr David said.</p>

<p><#\>The Jewish community in Aus<l>tralia accepted the DPP's decision not to proceed with the Wagner trial yesterday and defended the $30 million cost of war crimes in<l>vestigations as the necessary price of justice.</p>

<p><#\>The president of the executive Council of Australian Jewry, Mr Isi Leibler, said last night due legal process hadbeen served.</p>

<p><#\><quote>I am satisfied that, 50 years after the event, Australia has be<l>haved as well as any country could have been expected to behave, the tragedy being that this (the trials) should have happened 40 to 50 years ago, when both witnesses and evidence were present in a form that they are not today,</quote> Mr Leibler said.</p>

<p><#\>He said criminal justice was "cost-effective" in very few cases.</p>

<p><#\><quote>Justice doesn't have a price and one doesn't evaluate justice at any other levels, why the question is being asked in this particular situ<l>ation is beyond me,</quote> Mr Leibler said.</p>

<#\><h><ul><bold>Treasurer puts his family first</bold></ul></h>

<#\>BY DENNIS SHANAHAN

<p><#\>FEDERAL Cabinet will be reshuffled after Christmas, prob<l>ably in the new year, after the snap decision by the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, to retire <longdash>a move that will change the face of the Keating Government and unleash internal rivalries.</p>

<p><#\>The main contenders for treasurer include the experienced Minister for finance, Mr Willis, the Minister for Education and Employment, Mr Beazley, and the long-term Keating loyalist and right-wing Minister for industrial Relations, Mr Brereton. <#\>But the Prime Minister, Mr Keat<l>ing, may be tempted to elevate one of his younger ministers.</p>

<p><#\>Mr Dawkins announced his "de<l>sire" to retire for personal reasons to Parliament late yesterday shortly after informing the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, and leaving some of his Cabinet colleagues unaware of his intentions.</p>

<p><#\><quote>After 20 years in public life I think I've given all I can give and I think I now look forward to other pursuits, which I am sure will be equally en<l>joyable.</quote></p>

<p><#\>Mr Dawkins told Parlia<l>ment in the presence of his wife, Maggie.</p>

<p><#\>Mr Dawkins said he would always look back with pride on his service as a minister <quote>in the greatest government I believe Australia has ever had</quote> .</p>

<p><#\><quote>I take this step without any of the rancour, without any of the bitter<l>ness, without any of the disappoint<l>ment that I have seen written on the faces of those who have stepped back from executive office,</quote> he said.</p>

<p><#\>Later, Mr Dawkins appeared at a formal press conference carrying his recently born baby, Alice, and in the company of Mrs Dawkins.</p>

<p><#\>He said the difficulties of mixing a family life with his job had been cru<l>cial to his decision.</p>

<p><#\><quote>Not everybody understands what it's like to conduct a sensible family life when you travel 3000 miles (4800km from Western Australia) to work each week,</quote> he said.</p>

<p><#\>Asked what she thought of the de<l>cision, Mrs Dawkins said: <quote>I think it's wonderful.</quote></p>

<p><#\>Mr Dawkins will remain as a care<l>taker treasurer until Mr Keating reshuffles the cabinet and appoints a successor.</p>

<p><#\>The Prime Minister will consider the options for, and the extent and timing of a Cabinet reshuffle dur<l>ing the Christmas break.</p>

<p><#\>Last night Mr Keating said he con<l>gratulated Mr Dawkins for a <quote>coura<l>geous personal decision to relin<l>quish the post of treasurer.</quote></p>

<p><#\><quote>I am, of course, saddened at the departure from Cabinet of a friend and a colleague of such distinction, passion and ability,</quote> he said.</p>

<p><#\>When news spread to the financial markets of Mr Dawkins's decision, the dollar dipped in a knee-jerk reaction almost US 0.5c, with a local closing price of US 67.40c, compared with a London opening price of US 66.90c, before it edged back.</p>

<p><#\>Government and financial sources said last night Mr Willis was the best qualified of the most likely con<l>tenders but that his previous brief tenure as treasurer and a hesitancy as a minister could count against him.</p>

<p><#\>Mr Brereton's close personal links with Mr Keating and his recent ap<l>pointment to the Expenditure Review Committee had boosted his chances. <#\>But his inexperience coun<l>ted against him.</p>

<p><#\>There was some reluctance within the Right faction to Mr Brereton's appointment, although the right would want to reclaim the treasury portfolio.</p>

<p><#\>Some labor MPs said last night Mr Beazley could serve as a "midd<l>le" candidate despite his relative lack of financial experience.</p>

<p><#\>There have been rumours in Can<l>berra and Perth for months that Mr Dawkins was considering resigna<l>tion. <#\>Mr Dawkins publicly raised the prospect of resignation in Sep<l>tember, although after this incident the rumours were strongly denied.</p>

<p><#\>At a press conference in Sep<l>tember Mr Dawkins appeared tired and declared that he had to admit that <quote>whenever it becomes necessary for me to leave Fremantle, get on a plane and come to Canberra, the prospect of political retirement does well in my mind</quote>.</p>

<p><#\>Mr Dawkins told the press confer<l>ence he had finally decided to resign on Thursday night and had infor<l>med Mr Keating soon after 5 pm. <#\>Asked if he had consulted colleagues about the decision, he said it had been <quote>intensely personal</quote>.</p>

<p><#\>In a long speech to a crowded Par<l>liament, Mr Dawkins said he was pleased to have been part of a <quote>great government, the government of Bob Hawke as well as the Government of Paul Keating</quote>.</p>

<p><#\><quote>One couldn't have wanted to have two such important and helpful and indeed inspirational leaders to serve as a Cabinet minister as I have, dif<l>ferent though they are,</quote> Mr Daw<l>kins told Parliament.</p>

<p><#\><quote>I want to say particularly to my friend the Prime Minister what a fantastic inspiration he has been to me during the course of the last 11 years <*>dotted line</*></quote></p>

<p><#\><quote>This is the time entirely of my own choosing, its a time which I think in the natural course of events is the right time for me, at the age of 46, an opportunity to pursue other interests,</quote> he said.</p>

<p><#\>Although he said he departed without rancour or bitterness and was gratified that the Labor Party had given him, as somebody from a wealthy background,the chance to participate, he referred to his critics in the party in Perth who had not agreed with him.</p>

<h><#\><bold>Crowds converge to welcome new year</bold></h>

<#\>By MARTIN THOMAS and staff reporters

<p><#\>HUNDREDS of thousands of people streamed into the nation's cities last night to usher in the new year.</p>

<p><#\>In Sydney, greatly buoyed by its Olympic triumph, police said a record crowd of 350,000-plus packed around the shores of the harbour to witness a million-dollar fireworks show in one of the most highly spirited cele<l>brations in years.</p>

<p>A police spokesman reported four arrests before midnight, three for of<l>fensive behaviour and one for assualt.</p>

<p><#\>But, given its size, the crowd had been <quote>remarkably well behaved</quote>.</p>

<p><#\>One man was retrieved from the harbour at the Quay by water police on a balmy, still, smoke-filled night.</p>

<p><#\>In stark contrast rain threatened to dampen an already hollow celebration in Hobart.</p>

<p><#\>In the wake of one of the roughest Sydney-to-Hobart Yacht races in some 40 years, just 14 boats were at Constitution Dock with their relieved crews ready to partake of the New Year's Eve hospitality of the Apple Isle.</p>

<p><#\>Almost that many crews were spending their final moments of the year at sea and many more than that "celebrating" on the wrong side of Bass Strait at Eden, where they were still licking their wounds.</p>

<p><#\>Thousands of Melburnians conver<l>ged on the City Square to welcome in the new year with a rock concert <longdash>minus alcohol. <#\>The city precinct was declared al<l>cohol-free zone for the night by au<l>thorities.</p>

<p><#\>Other revellers travelled to Lorne, on the south-west coast, for another rock concert where alcohol consump<l>tion was also limited.</p>

<p><#\>Many more travelled east to Phillip Island.</p>

<#\><p>The Victoria Police blitz on traffic, Project 100, was in its final stage with thousands of police on the State's roads testing motorists for drink driv<l>ing.</p>

<#\><p>In Brisbane a crowd of up to 80,000 descended on the city's South Bank to see a huge fireworks display.</p>

<#\><p>Police rostered extra patrols on the Gold Coast where crowds of up to 20,<l>000 massed.</p>

<#\><p>Two hundred police, including mounted police, were on duty on the Gold Coast between Coolangatta and Surfers Paradise.</p>

<#\><p>Neither Queensland nor NSW police expected too much trouble, despite the anticipated 10,000 crowd which would throng to the border twin cities of Coolangatta-Tweed Heads for a double celebration courtesy of day<l>light saving.</p>

<p><#\>Last year 85 people were arrested for drunkenness and a further 75 were charged with a variety of street off<l>ences including obscene language and minor assaults.</p>

<p><#\>In Adelaide thousands of revellers were massing in King William Street for the traditional Lord Mayor's Street Party.</p>

<p><#\>In Perth New Year's Eve revellers packed the streets and nightclubs of Fremantle and Northbridge and filled the city's restaurants.</p>

<p><#\>With no fireworks to blast 1994 in, many were expected to attend concerts including the Hoodoo Gurus, Hunters and Collectors, Died Pretty and the Divinyls.</p>

<#\><p>In the wake of wild Christmas Eve celebrations when a crowd of up to 300 youths ran riot in suburban streets, smashing property and pelting police with bricks, police issued party-goers with stern warnings.</p></I>
