<I><#\><h>THE GULF:PREPARING FOR WAR</h>

<#\><ul><bold>Leading lights urge restraint as protest movement builds</bold></ul> 

<#\><h><bold>Growing chorus calls for peace</bold></h>

<#\>By LENORE TAYLOR, SCOTT HENRY and STEVEN WILSON

<p><#\>LEADING authors, ac<l>tors, clergy, federal MPs, academics and doctors have joined to urge the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, not to commit Australia to a war in the Middle East.</p>

<p><#\>And they have appealed to other Australians to join the peace effort.</p>

<p><#\>Authors Thomas Keneally and David Malouf, actress Reb<l>ecca Gilling, comedian John Clark, fashion designer Jenny Kee, historian Manning Clark, federal ALP left-wing MPs Frank Walker, Laurie Fergu<l>son, Daryl Melham, Jeanette McHugh, Stuart West and senators Bruce Childs and John Faulkner are among 135 people who have signed an ad<l>vertisement placed in <it>The Australian</it> today urging Australians to reject involve<l>ment in a war.</p>

<p><#\>The signatories condemn the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, but urge Mr Hawke to give the United Nations sanctions a chance to work.</p>

<p><#\>Mr Hawke has ruled out sending Australian ground troops to the Gulf, and has said there will not be an esc<l>alation of Australia's naval involvement.</p>

<p><#\>But with international opin<l>ion firming that war is in<l>evitable, peace groups have formed around the nation.</p>

<p><#\>In Sydney, Brisbane, Ade<l>laide and Perth rallies have been organised on January 19, to coincide with those
world<?>-</?>wide.</p>

<p><#\>Melbourne's rally is sche<l>duled for January 18, and Sydney activists have also or<l>ganised a lunchtime rally for Tuesday, the day of the Un<l>ited Nations deadline for Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.</p>

<p><#\>In Sydney yesterday, univer<l>sity unions representing 145,000 students condemned the use of military force in the Gulf and called on Mr Hawke to withdraw all Australian forces immediately.</p>

<p><#\>Students United Against War, made up of represent<l>atives from Sydney Univer<l>sity, the University of NSW, Macquarie University, the University of Technology, Sydney and the University of Canberra, joined the National Union of Students to oppose the Iraqi invasion and a first strike by US and allied forces.</p>

<p><#\>The students called on the Federal Government not to deploy any new armed forces to the Middle East, to bring the frigates home and to take an independent role.</p>

<p><#\>In Brisbane, 35 groups in<l>cluding peace, ethnic, envi<l>ronment, union, church and political organisations vowed to stage a series of protests.</p>

<p><#\>A spokeswoman for the group, Mrs Carol Dowling, said protests would include a week of all-night vigils and rallies at Brisbane's King George Square.</p>

<p><#\>In Melbourne, 30 people joined in a Gulf Peace Team march, gathering at the Shrine of Remembrance be<l>fore marching along the footpath into the city.</p>

<p><#\>In Western Australia, a 30<l>day vigil outside a city church continued yesterday.</p>

<p><#\>The State's strongest lobby group against the war, the Al<l>liance for Peace in the Middle East, plans a 24-hour vigil over January 15-16.</p>

<p><#\>As well as signing the peace network advertisement, the environment group Green<l>peace delivered a strongly worded letter to Mr Hawke.</p>

<p><#\>Its executive director, Mr Paul Gilding, wrote: <quote>Green<l>peace notes with alarm that you personally have not rule out an escalation of Australia's role in the event of war</quote>.</p>

<p><#\><quote>Equally, Foreign Minister Evans has not ruled out Australia's continued involve<l>ment in the event of nuclear war</quote>.</p>

<p><#\><quote>Prime Minister, you have grave responsibility to the people of Australia far greater than that which the United States demands</quote>.</p>

<p><#\><quote>Depending on the decisions you make regarding Australia's role in the Gulf, your name can go down in history as the Australian leader (who) merely repeated the mistakes of the past or one who had the courage and conviction to stand apart</quote>.</p>

<#\><h><bold>Export surge jeopardises rate cut</bold></h>

<#\>By CHRIS WALLACE

<p><#\>THE next cut in interest rates has been pushed back by new balance of payments figures showing continued imports growth despite the re<l>cession.</p>

<p><#\>The current account deficit for November was $1.37 billion according to Australian Bureau of Statistics figures released yesterday <longdash> squarely within fincancial market expectations.</p>

<p><#\>But after taking seasonal factors into account, import growth of 6 per cent outstrip<l>ped a 2 per cent rise in exports for the month.</p>

<p><#\>The balance of payments figures were described as <quote>fairly reassuring</quote> by the Act<l>ing Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, in Perth yesterday, given <quote>the uncertainties and the changes which have occurred since the time the Budget was put together</quote>.</p>

<p><#\>Mr Dawkins said they were an <quote>unspectacular set of fig<l>ures</quote>, but suggested that the government's balance of pay<l>ments strategy was very much on track.</p>

<p><#\>Current account figures for the first five months of the financial year <longdash> a total $7.65 billion deficit representing a 29 per cent improvement on the corresponding period last year <longdash> suggest the Budget forecast of $18 billion for 1990-91 will be met.</p>

<p><#\>Speaking in Geelong yes<l>terday, the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, was more bullish about the likely current account outcome.</p>

<p><#\><quote>It's in line with an outcome for the year which would be significantly below the $18 bil<l>lion figure projected in the Budget,</quote> Mr Hawke said.</p>

<p><#\>The reason for continuing strong imports following a record period of tight mone<l>tary policy which has pushed the economy into recession remains a worrying mystery to policy makers.</p>

<p><#\>The import figures for November were dragged up by big defence equipment and fuel imports, the latter reflec<l>ting higher world oil prices because of the Gulf crisis.</p>

<p><#\>But underlying imports, which are heavily influenced by prevailing economic condi<l>tions, nevertheless rose 2.6 per cent after taking seasonal factors into account.</p>

<p><#\>Merchant bankers BT Aus<l>tralia estimated that under<l>lying imports rose 8 per cent in November after taking sea<l>sonal factors into account and excluding BHP's import in October of a tanker from the comparison.</p>

<p><#\>Mr Dawkins conceded that the Government did not fully understand why import growth was still so strong.</p>

<p><#\>Treasury is waiting on quar<l>terly balance of payments fig<l>ures for December, due to be released in March, to work out whether the growing import figures reflect the dollar's depreciation during the past few months, or whether it is because of higher import volumes.</p>

<p><#\>The dollar depreciated by 8.8 per cent on atrade-weighted basis betwen September and November.</p>

<p><#\>On the basis of experience, import growth should have eased much more quickly given Australia's present posi<l>tion in the economic cycle.</p>

<p><#\>The merchandise trade bal<l>ance fell in November to $143 million after seasonal adjust<l>ment.</p>

<p><#\>But this represented the seventh positive trade bal<l>ance in the past eight months, and the cumulative tradebal<l>ance for the first five months of 1990-91 is an 82 per cent im<l>provement on the correspond<l>ing period in the 
previous year.</p>

<p><#\>Exports rose 2 per cent in both original and seasonally adjusted terms.</p>

<p><#\>But rural exports fell, drag<l>ging the overall result down with falls recorded in sugar and "other rural exports".</p>

<p><#\>The net in<l>come deficit, largely reflecting Australia's cost of debt-servicing abroad, also worsened significantly from $1.3 billion in October to $1.41 billion in November.</p>

<p><#\>Treasury expects the net in<l>come deficit to remain about this level for the rest of the fi<l>nancial year.</p>

<p><#\>Mr Dawkins said he did not expect the recession to be protracted, and that the pro<l>spects for domestic industry were <quote>pretty good</quote>.</p>

<p><#\><quote>I think the important thing for all of us <longdash> and for corpo<l>rate Australia particularly <longdash> is to look forward to the recovery,</quote> he said.</p>

<p><#\><quote>What we know is that there will be a recovery inevitably, and that we will go into that recovery in fairly good shape</quote>.</p>

<p><#\><quote>The cost structure in Ausl<l>tralia has been reduced (and) a lot of the inefficiencies within the Australian econ<l>omy have been removed</quote>.</p>

<p><#\>The Opposition's spokesman on Treasury matters, Mr Peter Reith, said the latest figures confirmed that Ausl<l>tralia was <quote>addicted</quote> to im<l>ports and that any imminent interest rate cut had been ruled out by the figures.</p>

<p><#\><quote>If the present trend con<l>tinues, it will be difficult to sustain the present interest rate cuts let alone see further reductions,</quote> Mr Reith said.</p>

<p><#\>Mr Reith said there must be a concerted attempt to correct Australia's fundamental eco<l>nomic problems, and renewed the Opposition's call for a mini-Budget to address the situation.</p>

<p><#\><quote>There must also be an ac<l>celeration in the rate of struc<l>tural reform which is imped<l>ing the competitiveness of our export and import competing industries,</quote> he said. <#\>He off<l>ered bipartisan support for the introduction of a broad-based tax on goods and services.</p>

<p><#\>Mr Reith said he and the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, would be prepared to discuss with Mr Hawke and the treasurer, Mr Keating, a pack<l>age of tax reforms designed to turn around the economy.</p>

<p><#\>The Opposition would back any move by the Government to have a consumption tax in place by January 1 next year, Mr Reith said.</p>

<p><#\><quote>We have not had a reces<l>sion of this depth and hard<l>ship for many Australians since the war, and I think it is time to do things differently,</quote> he said.</p>

<p><#\><quote>We genuinely offer our bi<l>partisan support for <*>dotted line</*> tax reforms which would give people some incentive and start to boost productivity,</quote> he said.</p>

<p><#\>Mr Reith had earlier told the Young <w>Liberals'</w> national convention in Brisbane that the introduction of abroad-based goods and services tax would pave the way for sub<l>stantial cuts in personal income tax.</p>

<p><#\>He said the Opposition's proposed tax reforms also provided for the abolition of wholesale sales tax and the exemption of export products from tax.</p>

<#\><h><bold>Our security poised to combat pro-Iraqi terrorists</bold></h>

<p><#\>SECURITY authorities in Aus<l>tralia are getting access to high-grade data from the Western intel<l>ligence network as they set in place their strategy to counter the threat of Iraqi-inspired terrorism.</p>

<p><#\>Canberra is being fed specific in<l>telligence from overseas agencies on the movements of known ter<l>rorists, the pattern of linkages be<l>tween Middle Eastern terrorist or<l>ganisations and their methods of operation.</p>

<p><#\><quote>There is very high-level co<l>operation on these matters,</quote> a sen<l>ior official told <it>The Australian</it> yesterday.</p>

<p><#\>While Australia has traditionally had ready access to information from friendly agencies overseas, the recent exchanges are seen as particularly valuable because of our limited exposure in the past to Arab and Palestinian terrorist groups.</p>

<p><#\>As well as sophisticated computer profiles that Australian immi<l>gration authorities have developed on terrorist suspects, the intelligence from countries such as Britain and the United States is regarded as critical to maintaining watertight barrier checks at airports around the country.</p>

<p><#\>The US and Britain have a longer and more painful history of dealing with Middle East terrorism.</p>

<p><#\>In other gulf developments yes<l>terday</p>

<p><#\><bold>SIX</bold> Iraqi helicopters containing an unknown number of defectors landed in Saudi Arabia yesterday as an Iraqi brigadier who defected earlier warned that President Sad<l>dam Hussein's forces could launch a pre-emptive attack.</p>

<p><#\><bold>PALESTINE</bold> Liberation Organi<l>sation leader Mr Yasser Arafat predicted a Gulf war would last be<l>tween three and six years and draw in <quote>the whole of the Arab world</quote>.</p>

<p><#\><bold>THE</bold> Israeli Prime Minister, Mr Shamir, ruled out a pre-emptive strike against Iraq but told visiting British MPs he believed this week's meeting between the US Secretary of state, Mr James Baker, and the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Mr Tariq Aziz, would make clear to Mr Hus<l>sein he had no chance of winning a war.</p>

<p><#\>The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, recognising the possibility of ter<l>rorist attacks in this country, ad<l>mitted yesterday Australia could be among Western nations targe<l>ted if Mr Hussein sought to en<l>courage a campaign of terror against his enemies.</p>

<p><#\>Mr Hawke also said he still be<l>lieved the odds were against war in the Gulf.</p>

<p><#\><quote>While the situation is very pre<l>cariously balanced there I think, still, war is somewhat less likely than likely,</quote> he said, adding that Iraq's decision to attend talks with the US in Geneva this morning was very significant.</p>

<p><#\>But if the crisis degenerated into open conflict, he was confident Australia's security agencies would be able to counter any threat of terrorism.</p>

<p><#\><quote>There is a general caution being exercised around the world <*>dotted line</*> all countries, let me say including Australia, have been aware of that possibility,</quote> Mr Hawke said.</p>

<p><#\><quote>I can assure you that in those circumstances our various resour<l>ces have been properly alerted, and would be in a position to deal with any such possibility.</quote></p>

<p><#\>While officials in Canberra would not divulge their assessment of the level of threat Australia might face, it is understood to be regar<l>ded as significantly lower than Western Europe and the US.</p>

<p><#\>In Britain <longdash> still smarting from the bitter experience of Arab and Palestinian nationals orchestrat<l>ing terrorist campaigns while resident in London <longdash> contingency plans for security clampdowns on likely Iraqi sympathisers are be<l>lieved to be extremely tough.</p></I>
