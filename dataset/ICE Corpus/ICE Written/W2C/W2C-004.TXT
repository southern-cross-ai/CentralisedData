<I><#\><h><bold>Donors must be identified: Olsen</bold></h>

<#\><bold>From DAVID WASHINGTON</bold>

<p><#\>CANBERRA: The head of the Liberal Party committee on dis<l>closure of political donations has called for stronger Government moves to enforce full disclosure.</p>

<p><#\>The call, by South Australian Senator John Olsen, flies in the face of concern by Liberal Party organisational figures that the disclosure provisions will have a disastrous effect on party finances.</p>

<p><#\>Senator Olsen said yesterday the Gov<l>ernment's legislation should be im<l>proved, to close loopholes which allow the true source of donations to be disguised.</p>

<p><#\>Liberal Party divisions on the issue widened at the weekend, with the Oppo<l>sition Leader, Dr Hewson, hitting back at the NSW Liberal Party's senior fund<l>raiser over his criticism of the Oppo<l>sition's decision to support full disclosure.</p>

<p><#\>The chairman of the NSW Liberal Party's central finance committee, Mr Bevan Bradbury, has reportedly written to Liberal MPs criticising the decision.</p>

<p><#\>His letter said disclosing the identity of donors would have a <quote>devastating effect</quote> on the Liberal Party.</p>

<p><#\><quote>The impact on the inflow of funds to the party of legislation that requires the identity of donors be revealed will be horrendous and it will be immediate,</quote> the letter said.</p>

<p><#\>Dr Hewson said he could understand Mr Bradbury's frustration but he <quote>must accept that he and the party organis<l>ation do not make the policies of the parliamentary party</quote>.</p>

<p><#\>He said the Coalition would work to ensure that the Government's draft legislation was <quote>fair and equitable</quote>.</p>

<p><#\>Senator Olsen, in a statement which will anger party officials such as Mr

Bradbury, called on the government to toughen its disclosure legislation.</p>

<p><#\><quote>With this disclosure bill, there is not true disclosure,</quote> Senator Olsen said.</p>

<p><#\>This was because the last person or group to handle the donation before it was given to the party was disclosed as the donor, but the real donor could be completely different.</p>

<#\><h><bold><ul>'Full of rhetoric'</ul></bold></h>

<p><#\>Senator Olsen said the bill was full of rhetoric and <quote>fulsome wording</quote> aimed at creating the perception of action.</p>

<p><#\><quote>But careful analysis shows the Gov<l>ernment is committed, as always, to protecting the prime source of donations from its mates, perpetuating the deviousround-robin of bags of cash we've heard so much about from the WA royal commission,</quote> he said.</p>

<p><#\>Senator Olsen said the Electoral Com<l>mission should be given the power to conduct spot audits, to ensure the true sources of donations were revealed.</p>

<p><#\>The Opposition would propose sub<l>stantial amendments to the disclosure bill, including giving union members the right to decide whether their union dues should go to the ALP.</p>

<p><#\>Senator Olsen said the bill made no mention of <w>unions'</w> disclosure of the millions of dollars in affiliation fees and other donations they passed on to the ALP every year. <#\><quote>Yet a massive 44 per cent of union members (32 per cent Coalition, 12 per cent Democrat) do not vote for the ALP,</quote> he said.</p>

<p><#\>Liberal Party officials are concerned that many financial backers will refuse to donate if their identities are revealed publicly. <#\>Last week, the Government introduced the bill to ban political advertising and enforce full disclosure of donations but it is yet to be debated.</p>

<#\><h><bold>Summit rebuff to Bannon</bold></h>

<#\><bold>From Chief Political Writer</bold>
<#\><bold>LINDSAY OLNEY</bold>

<p><#\>CANBERRA: The call by the Premier, Mr Ban<l>non, for a national sum<l>mit on unemployment faces certain rejection by the Federal government.</p>

<p><#\>Despite varying degrees of sup<l>port for a summit from other Labor premiers, the Government will agree to no more than a full discussion of unemployment at the annual Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting on May 31.</p>

<p><#\>The summit idea also faced opposition yesterday from em<l>ployers and the ACTU.</p>

<p><#\>But Labor state premiers con<l>tinued to support the push by Mr Bannon for the special conference.</p>

<p><#\>In <bold>BRISBANE</bold>, the Queensland Premier, Mr Goss, said Australia needed national policy changes, concrete public works programs and tax breaks for private indus<l>try to tackle the growing unem<l>ployment crisis.</p>

<p><#\>He said it was time for the Federal Government to look at some major national projects of public works.</p>

<p><#\>The Victorian Premier, Mrs Kir<l>ner, will contact other premiers in a bid to get agreement on a joint <w>States'</w> push for national action on job creation.</p>

<p><#\>Mrs Kirner said she would contact the premiers before the May 31 Premiers Conference to estab<l>lish an agreed agenda for the talks.</p>

<p><#\>Although no formal decision has been made about the summit, sources said the Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, was <quote>a bit cool</quote> on the idea.</p>

<p><#\>There was doubt about what such a summit could achieve and there were dangers it could be<l>come purely a<quote>talk-fest</quote>.</p>

<p><#\>Yesterday, the Employment Minister, Mr Dawkins, attacked Mr Bannon's proposals to bring forward major infrastructure pro<l>jects <longdash>such as the Darwin-Alice Springs railway and the multifunction polls <longdash>to boost employment and provide Austra</p>

<#\>Banks, business to blame: Keating


<*>block</*><#\>The Treasurer, Mr Keating, told Parliament yesterday there was no doubt Australia had substantial economic difficulties, but it would pull out of the recession with lower interest rates.

<*>block</*><#\>He blamed the business and banking community for many of the economic problems.

<*>block</*><#\><quote>This recession is deeper than official policy would have had it be,</quote> he said.

<*>block</*><#\>Mr Keating said banks were the only institutions able to conduct a credit squeeze and were now doing so to some sections of the community.


<p><#\>lia with infrastruture resources to take advantage of the recovery.</p>

<p><#\><quote>You certainly don't want to go ahead with crazy ideas like build<l>ing unwanted railway lines be<l>tweeen Darwin and Alice Springs,</quote> he said. <#\><quote>It would cost a fortune and is just not appropriate for our current circumstances</quote>.</p>

<p><#\>The summit proposal was con<l>demned by the Opposition em<l>ployment spokesman, Mr Howard, as a <quote>stupid gimmick</quote>.</p>

<p><#\>He said it would do no more than raise false expectations and would not help the growing un<l>employment problem.</p>

<p><#\><quote>You cannot solve unemploy<l>ment by talk-fest,</quote> he said. <quote>Un<l>employment will go higher.</quote>M</p>

<p><#\><quote>One of the biggest problems is that people lack confidence.</quote></p>

<p><#\><quote>If the Government showed some confidence maybe this would rub off on the economy</quote>.</p>

<p><#\>The Confederation of Austra<l>lian Industry chief executive, Mr Ian Spicer, said he saw no good reason to have an unemployment summit at this time.</p>

<p><#\><quote>What needs to be done is no mystery,</quote> he said.</p>

<p><#\><quote>There should be no need to gather everyone together to de<l>cide to do the things that ob<l>viously need to be done without delay</quote>.</p>

<p><#\>Mr Spicer said the Federal Gov<l>ernment had to look at its in<l>terest rates policy, support the recent national wage decision and restructure the tax system with the introduction of a con<l>sumption tax.</p>

<p><#\>The ACTU president, Mr Mar<l>tin Ferguson, said the union movement was not interested in an unemployment summit, as it believed such a summit would be <quote>just another talk-fest.</quote></p>

<p><#\>Meanwhile, the consumer price index for the March quarter, to be released tomorrow, is expected to show that price rises slowed almost to a halt.</p>

<p><#\>With the Government counting on a low figure to ease the batter<l>ing its credibility has received over unemployment, another drop in interest rates is thought to be inevitable.</p>

<p><#\>The Reserve Bank board met last week to discuss levels of interest rates and is believed to be poised to cut 0.5 per cent from offical rates.</p>

<p><#\>The major banks are expected to pass any fall on to mortgage rates almost immediately, bring<l>ing their lowest housing rates to 13.5 per cent or lower.</p>

<p><#\>Yesterday, the forecasting group BIS Shrapnel predicted housing rates would go to 13 per cent in the July-September quar<l>ter, with rates unlikely to rise again for two years.</p>

<p><#\>It said banks would be keen to increase their home lending through lower rates and this would encourage new buyers into the market, promoting a recovery in the housing market in the September quarter.</p>

<p><#\>This indicated that general eco<l>nomic recovery would be slow in the second half of this year but would quicken in 1992.</p>

<p><#\>The consumer price index re<l>lease is likely to show the lowest quarterly inflation rate in many years, and will put the annual inflation figure on track for a result of about 4.5 per cent or less.</p>

<p><#\>There have even been sugges<l>tions that the CPI for the quarter will actually fall.</p>

<#\><h>No more U-mines: ALP</h>


<#\>From LINDSAY OLNEY and DAVID WALKER

<p><#\>The Labor Party has ducked the issue of changing its uranium policy and will not permit more mines to be developed at its na<l>tional conference next month.</p>

<p><#\>The Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, who has described the existing three-mine policy as illogical, is believed to have told backben<l>chers that a change would not justify the political aggravation of a conference row on uranium.</p>

<p><#\>The decision is expected to anger the mining industry and put the Government under fur<l>ther Opposition pressure for put<l>ting political considerations be<l>fore the country's economic im<l>peratives.</p>

<p><#\>Party sources last night said the issue would be debated briefly at the June ALP conference but that the factions had agreed in advance that the policy would not change.</p>

<p><#\>A decision to retain the existing policy would contradict the re<l>commendations of a party policy review committee, which said the policy should be overturned.</p>

<p><#\>Although Mr Hawke has not given a public view on the three-mines policy for several years, it was understood he and other right-wing ALP figures favored a change to promote export earn<l>ings and increase developer confi<l>dence in the Government.</p>

<p><#\>But it is now believed that Mr Hawke sees no point in changing</p>


<O>Table</O><#\>Opposition gaining support: poll


<p><#\>SYDNEY: The federal Coali<l>tion's lead over the Hawke Labor Government has widened one percentage point to 17 per cent, according to the latest Morgan Gallup Poll.</p>

<p><#\>The poll, published in the Bul<l>letin magazine, showed support for the Government remained on a record low of <?>32</?> per cent while support for the Opposition increased one point to <?>49</?> per cent.</p>

<p><#\>Approval of the way Mr Hawke was handling his job dropped one point to <?>38</?> per cent, while <?>54</?> per cent disapproved.</p>

<p><#\>Opposition Leader Dr Hew<l>son's approval also dropped one point to <?>48</?> per cent, while <?>29</?> per cent disapproved. <#\>When electors were asked who would make the better prime minister, 44 per cent opted for Mr Hawke and 41 per cent said Dr Hewson.</p>

<p><#\>the policy, especially with a de<l>pressed world uranium market.</p>

<p><#\>Last night a spokesman for the Prime Minister would neither confirm nor deny the reports. <#\>However, he did say Mr Hawke had reached a position regarding uranium policy.<#\>Last night left-wing MPs claimed that leader<l>ship pressures had forced Mr. Hawke to adopt a no-change posi<l>tion although other MPs said that the main consideration was the generally low standing of the Government.</p>

<p><#\>In 1982 the ALP decided that uranium mining would be con<l>fined to Roxby Downs, Ranger and Narbalek, which has since closed.</p>

<p><#\>At the 1988 conference the party established a review com<l>mittee on the policy.</p>

<p><#\>The committee decided, with a dissenting minority report, that expansion should be permitted. <#\>That report is now certain to be rejected by the conference.</p>

<p><#\>The ALP's national executive is due to consider the report on June 1, although this is now no more than a formality.</p>

<p><#\>Yesterday the convener of the Centre Left faction, Senator Michael Beahan, said he did not think there were sufficient num<l>bers in the party to force a change.</p>

<p><#\>Senator Jim <?>McKiernan</?>, from the Left, said the faction would continue to fight to prevent any change and would not settle on anything less than a formal pro<l>nouncement that the push for expansion had been abandoned.</p>

<p><#\>Last night the Opposition spokesman on energy and re<l>sources, Mr Tim Fischer, said if Mr Hawke refused a change he would be walking away from his responsibilities to the national interest.</p>

<p><#\>The Prime Minister has repe<l>atedly said that Labor's policy is <quote>illogical,</quote> he said.</p>

<p><#\><quote>Australia has missed another opportunity and is sending an extremely confused message to overseas interests who may be considering development pro<l>jects in 
Australia</quote>.</p>

<p><#\><quote>What may be good for the political unity of the ALP is an absolute disaster for the mining industry and Australia gener<l>ally</quote>.</p>

<p><#\>A spokesman for Western Min<l>ing Corporation Ltd, which oper<l>ates the only uranium mine in South Australia at <?>Olympic Dant</?>, said there was no major expecta<l>tion of a change.</p>


<p><#\><quote>We're steaming ahead pur<l>suing new markets for our prod<l>ucts,</quote> he said.</p></I>
