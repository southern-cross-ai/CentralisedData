<I><#\><h><bold>Tax office looks at	ways to reduce blow-out in claims</bold></h>

<#\><bold>By TIM DODD</bold>

<p><#\>The Australian Taxation Office is considering a range of measures to reduce the $2 billion blow-out in personal tax deductions which is threat<l>ening to take back the savings in running costs made from the introduction of self-assess<l>ment.</p>

<p><#\>But no particular course of action has been decided upon according to a tax office spokesman.</p>

<p><#\>The $2 billion increase in deductions, revealed by <it>The Australian Financial Review</it> on Friday, costs the Common<l>wealth $700-800 million a year in lost revenue.</p>

<p><#\>The spokesman said that the tax office's latest figures showed the huge increase in deductions had tailed off in the 1989-90 income year.</p>

<p><#\>But the 1989-90 figures are still provisional because not all personal tax for the year has been collected.</p>

<p><#\>The tax office points out that some of the increase in deductions is due to a growth in the number of taxpayers (many from the lodgement amnesty), the effects of infla<l>tion, and more awareness in the community about employment related tax deductions.</p>

<p><#\>But tax officials do perceive the increase as a threat to revenue and are looking at what can be done. <#\>There are a number of alternatives.</p>

<p><#\>One would be to step up the number of audits and/or apply the substantiation rules more strictly. <#\>These rules require taxpayers to have documentary evidence to sup<l>port deductions claimed and are very specific as to the type of evidence required.</p>

<p><#\>If they were applied strictly in every case then a great many taxpayers would find they had not kept the correct receipts etc. to support the genuine deductions they had claimed.</p>

<p><#\>However, the Commis<l>sioner of Taxation, Mr Trevor Boucher, has taken a com<l>monsense approach to sub<l>stantiation, usually allowing deductions, even without the correct evidence, if it was clear that the taxpayer had incurred the expense.</p>

<p><#\>Last month Federal Parlia<l>ment passed legislation which specifically wrote this discre<l>tionary power of the commissioner's into the law. <#\>This means that a taxpayer can now appeal to the Administra<l>tive Appeals Tribunal should he or she disagree with the commissioner's decision on whether to allow a particular deduction.</p>

<p><#\>Another way would be to approach the Government for new legislation limiting the types of deduction allowed or the amount which could be claimed.</p>

<p><#\>The option to disallow the first $500 of $l,000 claimed <longdash>outlined by the tax office in documents obtained by <it>The Australian Financial Review </it><longdash>falls into this category. <#\>But this particular scheme is polit<l>ical dynamite for any govern<l>ment unless it is part of a package of measures which offers compensation to tax-payers.</p>

<p><#\>One practical possibility would be for the Government to deal with the increase in deductions as a part of its income tax simplification pro<l>gramme. <#\>The programme, most of which is still under wraps, has looked at ways to simplify deductions as a part of the wider scheme.</p>

<p><#\>It is not clear how far the simplification of the deduc<l>tion system will go, but many tax officials would prefer that deductions <longdash>which are diffi<l>cult to administer and offer avenues for tax avoidance <longdash> be largely abolished and replaced by a system which deducted all personal income tax at source.</p>

<p><#\>Under such a scheme the Government would compen<l>sate for the revenue gain by making tax cuts, but it seems unlikely that the Government would agree to simplification on such a sweeping scale.</p>

<#\><h><bold>Govt ends live-sheep trade to Saudi Arabia until new agreement</bold></h>

<#\><bold>By CATHY BOLT</bold>

<p><#\>The Federal Government has effectively shut down the trou<l>bled live-sheep trade to Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p><#\>In a demonstration of increasing frustration over the <w>Saudis'</w> continued rejection of Australian sheep, the Federal Minister for Primary Indus<l>tries and Energy, Mr Kerin, yesterday told the Saudi ambassador in Canberra, Mr A. Rahman Alohaly, that the trade was being conducted in an unacceptable manner.</p>

<p><#\>In a statement issued after the meeting, Mr Kerin made clear that exports to Saudi Arabia, formerly worth $120 million, would cease until a health and quarantine proto<l>col was negotiated between the two governments.</p>

<p><#\><quote>The point has now been reached where, as I informed the ambassador, I do not see how the live-sheep trade from Australian can be allowed to continue in the absence of a quarantine and veterinary agreement,</quote> he said.</p>

<p><#\><quote>I cannot simply sit back and watch the commercial interests involved continue to go their own way, regardless of the consequence both in terms of animal welfare and our relations with other gov<l>ernments that inevitably have to become involved.</quote></p>

<p><#\>While power to regulate the trade rests with the Australian Meat and Livestock Corpora<l>tion, it is unlikely the statutory authority would issue approval for another live-sheep carrier to leave for Saudi Arabia in light of the minister's statement.</p>

<p><#\>Mr Kerin said his meeting with Mr Alohaly was prompted by the <w>Saudis'</w> de<l>cision last month to spurn two more cargoes from Australia and New Zealand <longdash>80,000 head aboard the Mawashi Al Gasseem and 66,500 head on the Mawashi Al Tabuk which left New Zealand in Novem<l>ber. <#\>They were the latest in a series of rejections which began in mid-1989.</p>

<p><#\>The New Zealand sheep were finally unloaded in Jor<l>dan this week while the Mawashi Al Gasseem's cargo is still being held in quaran<l>tine in the United Arab Emir<l>ates. <#\>They face an uncertain fate given the UAE's com<l>mitment not to take sheep rejected by the Saudis on grounds of disease.</p>

<p><#\>The New Zealand Agricul<l>ture Minister, Mr John Fal<l>loon, suspended live-sheep exports from that country on Monday, also pending the establishment of a health proto<l>col governing the trade.</p>

<p><#\>Mr Kerin said he had asked the Saudi ambassador to pass on to the Saudi Government and the Saudi Minister for Agriculture and Water, Mr Al Shaikh, the Australian Gov<l>ernment's concern over the <quote>inability to come to sensible arrangements that would ensure the continuance of the live-sheep trade on a secure long-term basis.</quote></p>

<p><#\><quote>Without wishing to detract in any way from the sovereign rights of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia in quarantine matters, these difficulties and uncer<l>tainties can only be resolved by governments.</quote></p>

<#\><h><bold>ASX to grant greater leeway on buybacks</bold></h>

<#\><bold>By BARRIE DUNSTAN</bold>

<p><#\>The Australian Stock Exchange has produced a final draft that gives listed companies greater scope to buy back their shares on the open market.</p>

<p><#\>The new share buyback rules were the main part of a series of amendments to ASX listing rules released yesterday and now await formal approval by the Australian Securities Commis<l>sion.</p>

<p><#\>The new share buyback rules are not expected to be operative until the part of the Corporations Act that allows on-market buybacks is proclaimed. <#\>The ASX estimates this is unlikely to be before February.</p>

<p><#\>Under the new rules, listed companies have to establish a buyback scheme by lodging a notice with the exchange and advertising in a national newspaper.</p>

<p><#\>The notices need to give the maximum number of shares allowed to be repurchased, the reasons for the operation, whether directors and their associates reserve the right to sell shares on-market to the company (and which directors/associates) and any new information appropriate or relevant to shareholders.</p>

<p><#\>Once established, the buyback scheme can run for six months and can be reactivated to giver companies a virtual permanent right to buy on the market.</p>

<p><#\>This is a change from the second draft of the proposed rules, which the ASX now admits were <quote>inflexible and unnecessarily restrictive</quote>. <#\>The earlier draft limited companies to a shorter period and locked them into a fixed price for the buyback.</p>

<p><#\>Now, companies have the right to creep the buyback price upwards by a maximum of 5 per cent above the average of the last sale price on the last five days where a sale occurred.</p>

<p><#\>There are also provisions preventing direc<l>tors or associates from selling into the on-market offer if they did not reserve the right to do so in the original scheme notice.</p>

<p><#\>The rules also prevent a company from establishing a buyback on the market if the company or any of its directors are aware of <quote>an actual or proposed takeover offer or announcement for any of the securities of the company</quote>.</p>

<p><#\>The new rules also contain strict require<l>ments to disclose where directors or associates have sold to the company in an on-market buyback; sales by directors must be notified to the exchange before the start of business the day after the dealing.</p>

<p><#\>The ASX says in its supplement containing the rules that it concluded <longdash>after submissions on the second draft <longdash>that it should establish a straightforward, simple-to-follow mechanism to allow companies to repur<l>chase their shares at advanta<l>geous prices.</p>

<p><#\>It has agreed with arguments that it should rely on protections given to share<l>holders by legislation and common law to deter abuse of the buyback mechanism by directors and their associates who wish to use the market.</p>

<p><#\>The rules dispense with some of the notice require<l>ments under the second draft which the ASX says would have imposed substantial costs on companies with a large number of shareholders.</p>

<#\><h><bold>The real shape of Aust's war effort</bold></h>

<#\><h><bold>CANBERRA OBSERVED</bold></h>
<#\><bold>BY GEOFF KITNEY</bold>

<p><#\>Australia is making a vastly larger contribution to the Gulf war than a handful of navy ships and medical teams and would have a crucial role to play in what the Prime Minis<l>ter, Mr Hawke, promises will be a new international order emerging from the conflict.</p>

<p><#\>There has been little public discussion and only oblique government acknowledge<l>ment of the connection but the fact is that the US joint facilities in Australia are playing a key role in provid<l>ing early warning of Iraqi missile attacks on Israel and Saudi Arabia and intelligence on Iraqi defences, troop movements and military tac<l>tics.</p>

<p><#\>The Nurrungar satellite ground station in outback South Australia is the link to the US Patriot missile batter<l>ies in the Gulf which have had such success bringing down Iraqi Scud missiles. <#\>Nurrun<l>gar picks up through infra-red satellite sensors the rocket plumes at the point of firing thus giving early warning of the attacks.</p>

<p><#\>One senior government fig<l>ure yesterday suggested that even if Australia sent every aircraft, ship, tank and ser<l>viceman to join the allied force in the Gulf it would be less of a contribution to the war effort than the role being played by the joint facilities.</p>

<p><#\>It is understood that in discussions with other coun<l>tries involved in the multi-na<l>tional force in the Gulf, Australia has referred to the role of the joint facilities as its major contribution to the allied efforts to eject Iraqi forces from Kuwait.</p>

<p><#\>And the possibility has now been raised that the joint facilities will be given a significant new role in provid<l>ing vital information which would be necessary for the successful establishment of a new international order policed by the United Nations.</p>

<p><#\>The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Evans, in an interview with <it>The Australian Financial Review</it> yesterday, indicated that the joint facili<l>ties could be as important to multilateral arms control planning and enforcement in the post-Cold War period as they had been in policing bilateral agreements between the US and the Soviet Union.</p>

<p><#\><quote>If you are moving into a new arms control and verifica<l>tion regime, as part of a new world order in which there is a more rational approach to the resolving international con<l>flicts, the (joint) facilities have a very definite role in that,</quote> he said.</p>

<p><#\>The essence of the "new world order" (which the US president, Mr Bush, and Mr Hawke had talked of as being what was at stake in the Gulf war) would be a new interna<l>tional structure in which con<l>flict would be resolved through the co-operation of the great powers under the umbrella of the United Nations.</p>

<p><#\>There would be three essen<l>tial elements to this <longdash>an effective conciliation and peace-making process built around the Secretary-General of the United Nations; a strong peace-keeping force structure; and a process of arms control and disarma<l>ment policed by the United Nations.</p>

<p><#\>If multilateral arms control agreements <longdash>such as the chemical weapon regime which Australia has been playing a key role in seeking <longdash>replaced bilateral agree<l>ments between the super-pow<l>ers as the major form of international policing of the behaviour of countries, verifi<l>cation would be crucial.</p></I>
