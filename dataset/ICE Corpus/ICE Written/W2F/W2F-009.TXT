<p><#\>Thick blackness blanketed them, closing them in. <#\>There was a second's absolute silence, then an eruption of sound from the sitting room <longdash> a confused babbling and wailing, and a couple of ominous thuds.</p>

<p><#\>Birdie instinctively stretched out her arms and stepped forward, her fingers tangling in the heavy folds of the curtains, her elbow bumping something solid that grunted and swore.</p>

<p><#\>'Take it easy!' <#\>Edwina's voice was gruff but gloriously familiar in the enveloping dark.</p>

<p><#\>'Sorry. <#\>What the hell's <*>dotted line</*>?'</p>

<p><#\>'I'd say the powerlines have come down. <#\>A falling tree, probably. <#\>Not surprising in this weather.' <#\>Birdie heard a rustling sound as Edwina calmly felt her way to the window seat and sat down. <#\>She was a cool customer.</p>

<p><#\>The door across the hall clicked open. <#\>'Edwina! <#\>Verity!' <#\>Alistair's voice echoed across the vast space. <#\>'Are you OK?'</p>

<p><#\>'Yes!' they chorused plaintively in unison, and laughed.</p>

<p><#\>'Stay there,' he called unnecessarily. <#\>'I'll go out and start the generator. <#\>Won't be long.'</p>

<p><#\>'Hold on,' Betty Hinder's reedy voice carried as well as Alistair's shout. <#\>'I'm coming with you.' There was a scrape and a bump.</p>

<p><#\>'Betty, stay where you are!'</p>

<p><#\>'Don't be more of a fool than you can help! <#\>You can't go wandering around out there in the pitch black by yourself. <#\>What if you fall over and break a leg? <#\>What if the ting doesn't start? <#\>Then we're all in a fine mess.'</p>

<p><#\>'I'll go out and get William, then.' <#\>Alistair was weakening. <#\>Birdie grinned to herself in the darkness.</p>

<p><#\>Betty's snort was eloquent. <#\>By now she'd obviously reached him. <#\>'He'd be as much use as a pocket in a singlet. <#\>Here, hold on to me. <#\>I can find my way round this place blindfolded. <#\>And as for generators <*>dotted line</*> well, since Georg'd rather sit in the dark twiddling his thumbs any day than get his feet wet, I can handle them too. <#\>Now, let's go.'</p>

<p><#\>Alistair gave in. <#\>'All right, now, everyone just sit tight. <#\>It'll be ten minutes or so.'</p>

<p><#\>'No!' <#\>Another voice rose through the blackness, high and whimpering.'I can't stay here! <#\>I've got to get out! <#\>Stop it! <#\>Let me <*>dotted line</*>' <#\>There was a scuffling sound, and a clatter as something hit the floor. <#\>The voice squeaked in panic.</p>

<p><#\>'Belinda!' thundered Alistair. <#\>'Sit down! <#\>Have another biscuit! <#\>Josie <longdash> the candles on the sideboard!'</p>

<p><#\>'OK! <#\>Go on, Alistair. <#\>We'll be right!' called Josie. <#\>She sounded quite cheerful.</p>

<p><#\>'Famous last words,' grunted Birdie. <#\>She felt cautiously around, located the window seat somewhere down near her knees, and lowered herself gingerly onto it, beside Edwina who hastily moved along to accommodate her. <#\>They perched together uncomfortably for a moment.</p>

<p><#\>The darkness was complete, in the room and outside the window. <#\>The valley walls rose up, enclosing them. <#\>No light, not the faintest glow in the sky, relieved the blackness. <#\>Birdie hadn't been aware of the hum of the air-conditioning, but now that it had died its absence created an eerie sense of absolute stillness in the house. <#\>Outside, the rushing water of the swollen creek, the splashing of the rain on the rippling ground, were the only sounds.</p>

<p><#\>She held her hand in front of her face and squinted, trying to make out its shape. <#\>But the darkness was total. <#\>It was like being blind. <#\>With a shock, she remembered Dan Toby. <#\>He hadn't called. <#\>Why not? <#\>And now he couldn't call. <#\>The internal phones needed electricity to work. <#\>Involuntarily she caught her breath.</p>

<p><#\>'There's nothing to worry about,' said Edwina beside her.</p>

<p><#\>Birdie shook her head, realised her companion couldn't see her, and spoke aloud.</p>

<p><#\>'It's not the dark. <#\>It's Toby <longdash> and Milson. <#\>I think I should go up there. <#\>Try to take them a light.'</p>

<p><#\>'The proper lights'll be back on in ten minutes,' said Edwina reasonably. <#\>'They're big boys, aren't they? <#\>They can look after themselves.'</p>

<p><#\>Of course. <#\>Why then did Birdie feel this sense of fore<l>boding? <#\>The picture of Toby, waving so cockily at her from the head of the stairs kept coming into her mind. <#\>And it was dark, so dark that she could see nothing else.</p>

<p><#\>She pushed herself to her feet and felt for the desk. <#\>Maybe <*>dotted line</*></p>

<p><#\>'What <it>are</it> you doing?' Edwina's voice was amused.</p>

<p><#\>If there are cigarettes,' said Birdie, 'there might be a lighter.'</p>

<p><#\>If there are cigarettes,' Edwina replied, 'please give me one and <it>pray</it> there's a lighter.'</p>

<p><#\>Birdie felt around the polished surface, trying to remember what had been on it when she'd been in the room last. <#\>Her fingers brushed paper <longdash> the timetable <longdash> and a small pile of cardboard <longdash> the <w>guests'</w> files <longdash> nearly upset a vase of flowers <*>dotted line</*> yes, there'd been an ashtray and an enamelled box near the vase. <#\>Her hand brushed a corner. <#\>That was it! <#\>She grasped at the box and opened the lid. <#\>Cigarettes <*>dotted line</*> and tucked into one corner, a small, slim lighter. <#\>She flicked it, and the tiny flame appeared, bright in the darkness.</p>

<p><#\>Edwina exclaimed and stumbled over to join her. <#\>They both lit cigarettes. <#\>'I've given up,' Edwina remarked seri<l>ously, after a moment. <#\>She exhaled a plume of smoke, and watched it dissolve into the darkness with satisfaction. <#\>'So have I,' said Birdie. <#\>She took one last, long drag, sighed, and stubbed the cigarette out. <#\>'Poison,' she said. <#\>Edwina murmured muffled agreement.</p>

<p><#\>Birdie flicked the lighter again, and dimly the room's shapes appeared. <#\>The doorway was directly in front of her. <#\>'I'm going upstairs,' she announced. <#\>'I think there's something wrong.'</p>

<p><#\>'You're crazy. <#\>With that pathetic little light? <#\>you'll break your neck.'</p>

<p><#\>'I'm going. <#\>You stay where you are.'</p>

<p><#\>'Not bloody likely.' Edwina leaned over, felt for the ashtray and crushed her cigarette into it. <#\>'If you go, I go. <#\>I'm not sitting here twiddling my thumbs in the dark. <#\>There are limits.'</p>

<p><#\>They edged cautiously towards the doorway and out into the hall. <#\>Flickering light from the sitting room cast a dull glow on the marble tiles. <#\>More than enough to see by, now that their eyes had adjusted to the dark. <#\>But the stairway rose in front of them, disappearing into pitch black about halfway up.</p>

<p><#\>They moved silently, by unspoken agreement. <#\>Neither wanted Josie and Belinda's company. <#\>They reached the stairs and began to climb, one behind the other.</p>

<p><#\>Soon they were in darkness. <#\>They moved stair by stair, feeling their way, holding tightly to the banister, as if to a lifeline. <#\>The silence and the dark were think around them 'This is madness,' whispered Edwina. <#\>She was so close that Birdie could feel her breath on the back of her neck.</p>

<p><#\>Birdie flicked the lighter and held its tiny flame out in front of her till it got too hot to hold, straining her eyes to see. <#\>'We're nearly there,' she said. <#\>'Four or five more steps.' Her heart was beating hard, somewhere up near the top of her chest. <#\>It was as if she could feel it in the base of her throat. <#\>She felt like choking. <#\>Something was wrong, she could feel it. <#\>The blackness at the top of the stairs was in<l>finitely menacing. <#\>But she dragged her feet on over the thick carpet, grateful for the sound and warmth of Edwina behind her.</p>

<p><#\>She almost stumbled when she reached the top, though she'd been waiting for the moment when her raised foot met empty air. <#\>She heard Edwina's exclamation as she faltered. <#\>'It's all right. <#\>We're at the top,' she murmured, edging around the balustrade to give her companion room.</p>

<p><#\>They looked down at the vestibule below. <#\>From here they could see the faint glow from the sitting room. <#\>'We'll edge around the gallery, facing this way,' whispered Birdie. <#\>'So we'll be able to see the light from Josie's candles.' <#\>The thought cheered her.</p>

<p><#\>'Oh!' <#\>Edwina grabbed her arm. <#\>'I've just remembered. <#\>I think there's a candle on a table just here. <#\>You know, by the couch? <#\>A candle in a silver candlestick. <#\>I saw it yesterday.'</p>

<p><#\>'Yes!' <#\>Birdie flicked the lighter and they edged away from the safety of the balustrade, holding onto each other, free hands outstretched, bodies tensed against unexpected bumps. <#\>Birdie found the side chair and sank into it while Edwina stood clutching the arm. <#\>She reached across to the corner table. <#\>Here she'd found the pink envelope, the anonymous letter. <#\>It seemed weeks ago. <#\>The lighter cast a tiny pool of light on the polished wood, and at the back of the table a silver candlestick gleamed. <#\>Birdie grabbed it with a hiss of satisfaction. <#\>It was heavy. <#\>She pulled it towards her and lit the candle. <#\>The wick caught, and a big, yellow flame rose up, pushing away the darkness, lighting up the little sitting area, the stained-glass window in shades of grey, the door to the staff stairway.</p>

<p><#\>'Ah! <#\>That's better!' <#\>Edwina gave a long sigh.</p>

<p><#\>Birdie looked up at her and grinned. <#\>'Lucky you remem<l>bered it,' she said. <#\>'Let's go.'</p>

<p><#\>They walked slowly along the gallery, towards 'Eve'. <#\>No need now to feel their way, or turn to the second-hand light from the vestibule for reassurance. <#\>With the candlelight, Birdie's panic had eased. <#\>Now she wondered what Toby would say when he saw her <longdash> with Edwina in tow, too. <#\>Ten to one she'd just get to him and the lights would go on. <#\>Damn! <#\>She should have waited, like Edwina said. <#\>But she knew she couldn't have waited.</p>

<p><#\>It was very quiet, except for the rain pattering on the roof above them. <#\>They reached the corner of the gallery. <#\>Helen's door was ahead. <#\>Birdie's arm was aching with the weight of the candlestick. <#\>She lowered it slightly as they reached the door marked 'Eve'. <#\>There was no sound from inside. <#\>She glanced at Edwina, standing tall by her shoulder, lifted her free hand, and knocked.</p>

<p><#\>The door swing open under her hand. <#\>Inside it was black as pitch, and in the blackness, someone was breathing.</p>

<p><#\>'Dan!' <#\>Birdie thrust the candlestick high in the air before her. <#\>The flame blew back, faltered, recovered and flared up once more. <#\>Edwina gripped her arm.</p>

<p><#\>'Dan! <#\>Are you in there?'</p>

<p><#\>Nothing. <#\>Just breathing, hoarse and deep, in the dark. <#\>Birdie pushed the door wide and stepped forward.</p>

<p><#\>'No, Verity!' <#\>Edwina was trying to hold her back, but Birdie pulled away, holding up the light.</p>

<p><#\>Toby lay sprawled on the couch like a bulky bundle of old clothes. <#\>His arm was thrown over his face, as if to protect it. <#\>Birdie crept towards him. <#\>The candlelight threw shadows around the room, picked out something white lying on the floor beside the desk. <#\>Milson's shirt. <#\>Milson, lying crumpled, long legs sticking out under the desk chair.</p>

<p><#\>'Verity!' Edwina's voice penetrated the paralysed silence of her mind. <#\>Edwina's urgent hand plucked at her sleeve. <#\>She made herself turn around.</p>

<p><#\>Helen was sitting on the side of the bed. <#\>Very upright, very still, her hands in her lap. <#\>As they looked, she turned her head. <#\>Her eyes gleamed. <#\>'They're asleep,' she said softly. <#\>'Just asleep.'</p>

<p><#\>Birdie's scalp prickled. <#\>She backed away till she reached the couch. <#\>She held the candlestick high, like a weapon. <#\>She felt for Toby with her left hand. <#\>He was warm. <#\>Breathing. <#\>Breathing heavily. <#\>It was Toby's breathing she had heard from the door. <#\>She pushed at him, shook him, but he wouldn't wake. <#\>Wouldn't stir.</p>

<p><#\>'He's been drugged,' she said. <#\>Her voice sounded loud in her own head. <#\>Birdie saw the tray on the low table by the couch, its silver coffeepot winking in the candlelight. <#\>She saw one cup still on the tray, unused, one still a quarter full on the table where Toby had put it down. <#\>Where was the other? <#\>Of course. <#\>On the desk, where Milson had been tak<l>ing notes. <#\>She could see it now.</p>

<p><#\>She skirted the coffee table and sidled over to the desk, without taking her eyes off Helen. <#\>Crouching down, she touched Milson's cheek, felt for the pulse of his neck. <#\>She could hear him breathing too, now.</p></I>
