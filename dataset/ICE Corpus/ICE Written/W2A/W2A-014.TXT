and Technology in Economic Development: 

THE PLACE OF PSYCHOLOGY</bold></h> 

<p><#\>The following material was a submission made on behalf of the Society to the Australian Science and Technology Council, which is investigating the role of the social sciences and the humanities in the contribution of science and technology to economic development. <#\>The submission was based in part on comment and suggestions by Stephen Bochner, Nigel Bond, Jacquelyn Cranney, Ross Day, Graeme Halford, Beryl Hesketh, Ian Johnston, Jim Kehoe, Gitte Lindgaard, Robert McBride, Peter Sheehan, and David Siddle. <#\>Also, it was based in part on views expressed by participants in "Psychology for the Clever Country: A Forum for Psychological Science". <#\>Members are invited to send comments on this material to Kevin M. McConkey, School of Psychology, University of New South Wales, PO Box 1, Kensington NSW 2033.</p> 

<p><#\><bold>P<it>sychology discovers, describes and explains human experience and behaviour through the logic and method of science.</it></bold></p> 

<p><#\>Psychological research and application is based in a logical, empirical, and analytical approach, and that approach is brought to bear on an exceptionally wide range of issues. <#\>In the diversity of its investigation and impact, psychology contributes both directly and indirectly to economic development. <#\>[Some of these matters were canvassed in a previous submission to ASTEC entitled "The role of psychology in research directions for Australia's future".]</p> 

<p><#\>This diversity, and the consequent contributions, of psychology is constrained at times by categorisation problems. <#\>Although the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Australian Research Council list psychology as a Social Science, the Australian Academy of Science has a National Committee for Psychology; psychologists are Fellows of the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia and the Australian Academy of Science; and, internationally, psychology is represented on the International Social Science Union and the International Council of Scientific Unions. <#\>If the diversity of psychology, 
and its benefits, is not recognised by ASTEC, then the value of this discipline's contributions to economic development could be lost.</p> 

<p><#\>Just as other major industrialised countries recognise the wide-ranging benefits of psychology (see Gerstein et al., 1988; National Behavioral Science Research Agenda Committee; 1992; Rosenzweig, 1992; Simon, 1980; Smelser & Gerstein, 1986), the current study by the SSHSTED Working Party of ASTEC provides a key opportunity not only to highlight the place of psychology as a field of science, but also to highlight the way in which psychology can and should contribute to socioeconomic objectives. <#\>As the Minister for Science and Technology, Mr. Free, indicated at "Psychology for the Clever Country: A Forum for Psychological Science" on 23 April 1992, psychology is concerned with a huge spectrum of problems and virtually all those problems relate to the well-being of this country in one way or another.</p> 

<p><#\>Recognising that the core of ASTEC's interest in the current study is the role of the social sciences and the humanities in the contribution of science and technology to economic development, this submission turns now to consider "outputs" and "inputs" as defined in the SSHSTED Discussion Paper. <#\>In doing so, this submission emphasises that the translation of advances in science and technology into economic development involves, at base, human behaviour. <#\>Put simply, economic development occurs because the technology is available <it>and</it> because humans engage in appropriate behaviour.</p> 
 
<#\><h><bold>OUTPUTS</bold></h> 
 
<p><#\>The "outputs" of psychology are vast, but those outputs are neither understood nor capitalised upon broadly enough in this country. <#\>The following examples may help ASTEC's understanding of the range of outputs.</p> 
 
<p><#\><h><it>Training.</it></h> <#\>Training the workforce to use technological advances has not taken advantage of psychological knowledge. <#\>In fact, inappropriate notions of training limit the relevance of science and technology to economic development. <#\>From the perspective of psychological research, some major aspects of current approaches to training need to be reconsidered. <#\>First, in current approaches there is little acknowledgment of individual differences in the ability to acquire skills in the workplace. <#\>From a psychological perspective, it is necessary to target training more carefully, and to design training that is more appropriate to the ability levels of individuals. <#\>In this way the training dollar is spent more effectively. <#\>Such an approach requires psychological expertise in assessment and measurement. <#\>However, such expertise is not being used in most of the services that are currently delivering training. <#\>Second, developments in cognitive psychology have advanced our understanding of issues such as the nature of expertise, the changes in cognitive structures that follow knowledge acquisition, the skill acquisition process, and how these interact with general ability, motivational, and attitudinal factors. <#\>Again, these developments are essentially ignored in current approaches to training. <#\>Put simply, there is a great deal of psychological knowledge and expertise that will help people in the workforce to more effectively use technology. <#\>Unfortunately, the translation of research findings into practical strategies has not occurred in this country. <#\>The psychological knowledge and expertise is there, the interest of government and industry is apparently not.</p> 
 
<p><#\><h><it>Industrial relations.</it></h> <#\>The adaptation of the workforce to changes that are driven by advances in science and technology is often a core concern in industrial relations. <#\>The introduction of new technologies usually requires change in the workplace overall and in the people who operate the technology; it also sometimes involves a change in the thinking of management. <#\>All this change requires effective communication and effective skill-acquisition. <#\>The government has attempted to handle issues of reskilling and multiskilling through the development of "competency standards" for the workforce. <#\>This approach, however, has both advantages and disadvantages, and psychological research underscores the relevance of these advantages and disadvantages to economic development involving technological change in particular. <#\>The advantages include the provision of a structure with clear goals for training, and the increased portability of skills at the trades and technical level. <#\>The major disadvantage, however, lies in the danger of a "use by" date on the competencies that are specified. <#\>Specific work-related competencies relevant to the needs of today will date quickly with technological advances, thus leaving Australia in much the same position as before, with a workforce that possesses skills that are no longer required. <#\>From the perspective of psychology, if science and technology are going to be translated into economic development via the workplace, the competency standards movement must focus on (a) the development of generic or core competencies, (b) the training of transferable skills, and (c) the development of learning skills that will make future learning and adaptation to technological change easy. <#\>The issues, which require psychological expertise, do not appear to be given a high priority in the discussion of competency standards and industrial relations. <#\>In the rush to become apparently clever today, this country may be at risk of forgetting to become wise tomorrow.</p> 
 
<p><#\><h><it>Systems design.</it></h> <#\>The design of systems throws into bold relief the various ways in which people interact with technology, and technology interacts with people. <#\>Examples here could range from the design of office equipment to the design of control and monitoring systems in automated manufacturing, and the relevance of psychological research to system design can be seen in areas including manufacturing, transport, health, education and, communications. <#\>To illustrate the place of psychology in system design, this submission will make specific comment on the development and use of interactive computer systems. <#\>Economic development can occur either by enabling an increase in revenue generation or by bringing about savings on current expenditure. <#\>The potential for psychology to contribute in both these ways is real, but effectively untapped, in the development of interactive computer systems. <#\>Considering all aspects of current computer systems, clearly design, development, packaging, and presentation are not well coordinated. <#\>From what we know about human behaviour, there are obvious mismatches between technical and user documentation, help systems and tutorial packages, and the functions provided and the actual uses of computer systems. <#\>This is because the technology-driven approach to systems design does not consider issues such as the understanding of users, users' tasks, cognitive capabilities, and organisational needs and culture. <#\>These issues are in the domain of psychology. <#\>In terms of systems design then, the very issues that will make the difference between systems and <it>good</it> systems lie within the domain of human behaviour. <#\>The production of excellent systems will, of course, depend on multidisciplinary teamwork, but the time has come for a move beyond technological wizardry to effective-use technology; basic and applied research in psychology is what will allow that move to occur.</p> 

<p><#\>Some of the major economic potential for interaction between the social sciences and science and technology can be seen in communications and interactive technology. <#\>For instance, "multimedia" is a fashionable buzzword that means little more than the use of audio, video, still images, text, graphics, and all that moves, in integrated computer systems. <#\>However, even with all the technology underlying it, we have little understanding of how, where, when, for whom, in what situations, or why multimedia is of benefit. <#\>We really do not know the answers to these and many other questions, and the answers will not emerge from a technology-driven approach to communications and systems development. <#\>Yet, the success, or even public acceptance, of such systems depends upon an understanding of what "fits" and what "works" from the point-of-view of the user. <#\>The answers to these questions must come from the social sciences working with science and technology. <#\>It is the case that economic development is determined by issues that cross the boundaries between disciplines, rather than be delineated by them, and psychology plays a key role in this regard through its links with a variety of other disciplines.</p> 
 
<p><#\><h><it>Food technology.</it></h> <#\>The way in which psychology provides the essential link between technology and people can be seen in a variety of other industries, such as the food industry. <#\>Psychophysics, which is the area of psychology that links the perceptual/psychological world with the physical world it represents, has enormous potential on the industrial scene. <#\>Taking the food industry as a model, there is often a major gulf between the Technical R&D department and the Marketing department. <#\>People in Technical R&D focus on the physical aspects of products; people in marketing focus on the psychological world of the consumer. <#\>Yet the aim of both these departments is to build better products, satisfy the consumer, and create wealth. <#\>There are substantial data that show how the application of psychophysics can facilitate the link between Technical R&D and Marketing, and contribute to economic development. <#\>The value of this approach can be seen in activities within the CSIRO, as well as activities in the private sector. <#\>There is strong demand for this role of psychology, and the demand was outlined at "Psychology for the Clever Country".</p> 
 
<p><#\><h><it>Transport.</it></h> <#\>The effective design and use of transport systems are dependent not only on advances in technology but also on our understanding of human behaviour. <#\>The systematic study of road-user behaviour has facilitated road and vehicle design, improved our management of traffic movement, reduced the rate of death and injury from transport-related accidents, and is contributing to decision-making in the reduction of the environmental impacts and in land use and transport planning for the future. <#\>The contributions of psychology towards better road transport again demonstrates how much economic development involves, at base, human behaviour. <#\>Again, there is strong demand for this role of psychology, and this demand was highlighted at "Psychology for the Clever Country".</p> 
 
<#\><h><bold>INPUTS</bold></h> 
 
<p><#\><h><it>Education of psychologists.</it></h> <#\>Basic education in psychology typically occurs via an undergraduate major with an honours year in psychology that is characterised by its research emphasis. <#\>This basic education is in a healthy state in Australia (Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee, 1992). <#\>Almost all universities have departments of psychology, and most of these departments offer four-year programs of academic study in the discipline. <#\>That four-year program equips graduates with the knowledge base that allows them to obtain specific professional training; either supervised experience in the workplace, postgraduate education through masters degrees in areas such as clinical and applied psychology or, through doctoral degrees across the broad spectrum of psychological science and application. <#\>Largely because of employment opportunities, postgraduate education and training of psychologists have channelled the majority of psychologists towards areas of health and welfare.</p></I>
