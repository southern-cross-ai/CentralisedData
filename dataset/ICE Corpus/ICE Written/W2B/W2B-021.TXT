<I><#\><h>Secret world of the W<smallcaps>ombat</smallcaps></h>

<#\>Far from being muddle-headed, as the children's stories suggest, the energetic burrower has a better-developed brain 
than any other marsupial. <#\>And its lumbering, bear-like 
exterior masks a remarkably agile frame.

<p><#\><smallcaps><bold>T</bold></smallcaps>he cool autumn sun dip<l>ped below the rim of the Rams Head Range in Kos<l>ciusko National Park. <#\>In the golden aftermath, the <w>mountains'</w> thickly wooded slopes and the blue-grey clouds were perfectly mirrored in the Thredbo River's glassy surface. <#\>Sheryn Woon, my guide, squeezed my arm gently, directing my attention from that visual feast to a sudden movement near the base of a spreading manna gum.</p>

<p><#\><quote>Wombat,</quote> she whispered, gestur<l>ing towards a strange-looking, shuf<l>fling creature that had appeared at the entrance of a large hole beneath one of the eucalypt's horizontally growing roots. <#\>I watched as it paused, one paw diffidently raised, its broad, blunt head drooping as if the animal were still asleep. <#\>Only its widely dilating nos<l>trils indicated that it was carefully testing the evening air before ventur<l>ing beyond the safety of its burrow.</p>

<p><#\>Reassured, it wandered into the dark<l>ening forest <longdash>a rotund comical figure with inward-pointing hind toes, its broad bottom swaying from side to side <longdash>on its regular nightly food run. <#\>It would pass the night in solitary con<l>tentment searching for a variety of native grasses and sedges.</p>

<p><#\>My patience had finally been rewarded. <#\>Although telltale signs of wombat occupancy were everywhere <longdash>from an extensive system of burrows and well-used paths to droppings posted on tree stumps and in other prominent places <longdash>the animals themselves were frustratingly elusive. <#\>In two bone-chilling nights that crack<l>led with frost, the only indication of wombats Sheryn and I detected at Thredbo Diggings picnic area was a quick scuttling sound in the under<l>growth as one fled at our approach.</p>

<p><#\>It was not until our third evening that we finally had our brief encounter. <#\>It was, like the common wombat itself, without fuss or ceremony. <#\>I felt exhil<l>arated by the perfection of our meet<l>ing as I retreated to the welcome warmth of Sheryn's four-wheel-drive for a reviving cup of coffee.</p>

<p><#\><bold>N</bold><smallcaps>o-one knows</smallcaps> better than Barbara Triggs that wombats are among the most difficult animals to study in the wild. <#\>Her quest to unlock the intrica<l>cies of their biology began in 1976, when she was faced with the problem of raising a young orphaned wombat at her home in Croajingolong National Park in north-east Victoria. <#\>She had successfully raised orphaned kanga<l>roos and possums, but knew almost nothing about wombats when her husband, Allan, brought home Bruno, an almost furless youngster whose mother had been killed on the road.</p>

<p><#\>As we relaxed on the verandah of her homestead, Barbara told me that nat<l>ural history books were no help as very little research had been done on wom<l>bats then. <#\>She knew she would have to learn from the animals themselves if she was going to raise Bruno success<l>fully and return him to the wild.</p>

<p><#\>Her face lit up as she recalled spend<l>ing all hours of the night, in all kinds of weather, picking her way through thickets after her elusive quarry. <#\>Some of her research was done near her home, but much was carried out in the east Gippsland mountain forests, a three-hour drive away, where she used a caravan as a hide to observe wombats.</p>

<p><#\><quote>A wombat's life revolves around its burrow, and as it seldom leaves its subterranean refuge before dusk, my research would begin each evening at a burrow entrance, waiting for a wom<l>bat to emerge,</quote> Barbara explained. <#\>Her task became more difficult when she realised that a wombat uses up to 11 different burrows and that burrows may be used by several wombats, usu<l>ally at different times.</p>

<p><#\>Lacking the resources and exper<l>tise to fit radio collars to make track<l>ing easier, she devised her own sys<l>tem of keeping tabs on them. <#\>She placed twigs across burrow entrances and, if they were dislodged, knew a wombat was in residence. <#\>She also fastened sticky tape to the mouths of burrows to snag hairs from a passing wombat to help identify it. <#\><quote>A few hairs may not seem much to go on, but coat colours vary so widely <longdash>from glossy black to grey, brown, sandy and cream <longdash>that they can be as good as a signature,</quote> she told me.</p>

<p><#\>Barbara's studies have made her an authority on wombat behaviour, and the author of two books on them. <#\>They have also helped her raise a string of orphans since Bruno, who <longdash>to her delight <longdash>still visits her.</p>

<p><#\><quote>I'd estimate he was nearly six months old when he came to me. <#\>He spent three months in a cloth bag slung around my neck 24 hours a day, then I started taking him out into the bush. <#\>He always stayed at my heel until he was about 18 months, when he began going out on his own and dividing his time between visiting the house and digging a burrow underneath it.</quote></p>

<p><#\>Barbara believes that most people have a skewed perception of wombats. <#\><quote>They are mainly nocturnal and shy of humans, so their true qualities remain hidden from most people,</quote> she said. <#\>Instead we cling to childhood memo<l>ries of Ruth Park's tales of <it>The Muddle-Headed Wombat</it>, an endearing, lumbering fellow with <quote>stumpy paws and muddled-up whiskers</quote>, who, with the best intentions, always manages to get things wrong.</p>

<p><#\>Professor Heinz Moeller, director of the Zoological Institute at Heidel<l>berg University in Germany, discovered that far from being muddle-headed, wombats have the best developed brain of any marsupial. <#\>A colleague, Dr Regine Hilbmann, investigated their play behaviour and learning ability and found them <quote>very frolicsome</quote> and relatively quick to learn <longdash>a sure indi<l>cator of a level of intelligence no-one had guessed at.</p>

<p>Wombats are remarkable in other ways too. <#\>They are one of the biggest animals in the world to dig burrows, which may extend 30 metres. <#\>Unlike those of other marsupials, their teeth have no roots and keep growing throughout their life, being worn down continually by the abrasive silica in their food. <#\>And although they are thought of as slow and bumbling, they can run at 40km/h over short dis<l>tances when disturbed.</p>

<p><#\>They are also extremely strong. <#\>If chased into its burrow by a dog or fox, the wombat will lift its rump and crush the attacker's head against the roof of the burrow.</p>

<p><#\><bold>N</bold><smallcaps>ot everyone</smallcaps> shares Sheryn and Barbara's love for wombats. <#\><quote>Wombats are worthless!</quote> <#\>Ron King, a sheep and cattle grazier in Victoria's eastern high<l>lands, fumed when I questioned him about them. <#\><quote>I've slaved on the land all my life and I have a fair knowledge of the destruction wombats cause. <#\>In my opinion, they're worse than wild pigs.</quote></p>

<p><#\>Ron is one of many farmers who detest wombats. <#\>He claims that since the 1960's, when wombat control was scaled down, their numbers have risen to plague proportions. <#\><quote>Fences are impossible to maintain. <#\>Kangaroos in their hundreds come through holes wombats make and it is no longer eco<l>nomic to run sheep on a lot of my property because wild dogs get in the same way.</quote></p>

<p><#\>Some farmers also accuse wombats of fouling their pastures and spread<l>ing parasites and disease, while their burrowing is said to undermine build<l>ings and dam embankments and even cause soil erosion.</p>

<p><#\>Clive Marks, a biologist with the Keith Turnbull Research Institute in Frankston, Victoria, studied the <quote>pest behaviour</quote> of wombats for his mas<l>ters degree at Monash University. <#\>He told me wombats were regarded as pests that damaged crops as far back as the 1860s. <#\>The problem was com<l>pounded in the 1880s when netting fences were widely used to control the spread of rabbits. <#\><quote>Inspectors would fine farmers if they had rabbits on their land but farmers blamed wombats for making holes that let the rabbits in,</quote> he said.</p>

<p><#\>In 1906 the Victorian Government declared wombats vermin and their destruction was mandatory. <#\>A bounty system was introduced in 1925 and during the last decade it operated, 1955-65, payments were made on 63,000 scalps. <#\>Today wombats are pro<l>tected in all states except for 193 par<l>ishes in eastern Victoria, where they are still shot, trapped and fumigated.</p>

<p><#\>I joined Clive on one of his regular visits to Tonimbuk, 70 km east of Melbourne, where <longdash>aided by a grant from <smallcaps>Australian Geographic</smallcaps> <longdash>he conducts field studies to determine the effectiveness of various fences against wombats.</p>

<p><#\>A storm was sending curtains of rain slanting down with a deafening crackle, and as we sheltered in his ute I asked him how he responded to land<l>holder complaints. <#\><quote>Wombats are stout, sturdy and strong, with the power to go where they want and by the most direct route <longdash>through or under a farmer's fence if necessary,</quote> he conceded. <#\><quote>But a lot of whinges are more imagined than real.</quote></p>

<O>diagram</O> <O>caption</O> <O>photo</O>

<p><#\>The rain eased and Clive began tun<l>ing the antenna at the back of the ute, trying to pick up a signal from a radio<?>-</?>collared wombat in order to plot how far it foraged during the night. <#\>He wasn't having much luck. <#\><quote>It's probably still down its burrow,</quote> he said. <#\>We persisted a little longer, but with the drizzle turning to cold rain, my heart wasn't in it. <#\>Clive caught my mood and shrugged sympathetically. <#\><quote>Time to go home,</quote> he said. <#\>I asked him the best way of excluding wombats from farmland. <#\><quote>Electric fencing,</quote> he replied without hesitation.</p>

<p><#\><bold>T</bold><smallcaps>he first</smallcaps> recorded encounter between wombats and Europeans was in 1797 when sailors from the <it>Sydney Cove</it>, shipwrecked on Preservation Island off Tasmania, dined on wombat flesh. <#\>They likened the creature to a badger and a bear, and described the meat as being <quote>musky, not very agreeable flav<l>our and very sinewy</quote>.</p>

<p><#\>In fact, the wombat's closest relative is the koala. <#\>The two animals have similar rudimentary tails, paws and rear-opening pouches, as well as a common ancestor that lived about 25 million years ago.</p>

<p><#\>Between 15 and 5 million years ago, several giant species of wombat evolved and the remains of some as big as cows and weighing 100 kilo<l>grams have been found from the Kim<l>berley in <smallcaps>WA</smallcaps> to Bingara, New South Wales. <#\>The gradual drying out of Aus<l>tralia that turned three-quarters of the continent from forest into semi-arid desert led to the extinction of the giant wombats between 25,000 and 15,000 years ago.</p>

<p><#\>In the cooler, wetter highlands of south-eastern Australia <longdash>from Stan<l>thorpe near the Queensland-<smallcaps>NSW</smallcaps> bor<l>der south along the Great Dividing Range to the outskirts of Melbourne <longdash>the common wombat continued to thrive, despite the clearing of forest for settlement and agriculture that shrunk its range. <#\>There are two sub-species, one in Tasmania and another on Flinders Island in the Bass Strait.</p>

<p><#\>But the lesser-known and much rarer hairy-nosed wombats, distin<l>guished by their softer fur and longer ears, have fared less well since Euro<l>pean settlement.</p>

<p><#\><bold>W</bold><smallcaps>hen</smallcaps> Epping Forest National Park was proclaimed in 1971 to protect the last population of northern hairy-nosed wombats, it was estimated that there were 35 animals," Matt Widt, ranger-in-charge of the 3300-hectare sanctu<l>ary 100 kilometres north-west of Cler<l>mont in central Queensland told me as we stood in the sandy bed of an ancient watercourse, staring at a cluster of five burrows. <#\><quote>Now there are 80.</quote></p>

<p><#\>Matt explained that the invasion of graziers and their introduced ani<l>mals into the hairy-nosed <w>wombats'</w> austere habitat precipitated a crisis they were unable to cope with. <#\><quote>Sheep, cattle and wombats eat the same grasses but the wombats have narrower preferences,</quote> he said. <#\>It was no co<l>incidence that the first wombat col<l>onies to disappear were close to stock watering points, where grazing pressure was particularly heavy.</p>

<p><#\>A southern species of hairy-nosed wombat that once extended as far east as the Murray River is now confined to parts of the Nullarbor Plain and a few isolated colonies in southern South Australia. <#\>Northern hairy-noses declined so quickly they first became known to scientists as a skull found in the Wellington Caves, <smallcaps>NSW</smallcaps>, in 1869. <#\>Fossil records indicate they were once widespread in Victoria, <smallcaps>NSW</smallcaps> and Queensland but by the turn of the cen<l>tury only two populations were known to exist, one near Deniliquin in south<l>ern <smallcaps>NSW</smallcaps> and another in the Moonie River area of southern Queensland.</p></I>
