<#\><bold>Men and women are not equal when it comes to 
Australia's health-care policy</bold>

<#\><h><bold>men's HeaLTH scanDaL</bold></h>

<p><#\><typeface>Thirty years of feminism may have stressed the need for an equal society, but female gains have been at the expense of Australian male health care.</typeface> <#\><typeface>An old feminist slogan says: <quote>We don't want a bigger slice of the cake <longdash> we want the whole damn bakery.</quote> </typeface> <#\><typeface>In terms of health, women have taken the <quote>whole damn bakery</quote> while men enjoy the crumbs.</typeface> <#\><typeface>It's an understatement to say that more money is spent on women's health than men's.</typeface> <#\><typeface>Because in Australia's case, "more" means a difference of tens of millions of dollars. </typeface> <#\><typeface>One official reason why so much more of the health dollar goes to women is that because they live longer than men, there's always been more of them.</typeface> <#\><typeface>Why? </typeface> <#\><typeface>Because they are more health conscious and their health is superior.</typeface> <#\><typeface>Why? </typeface> <#\><typeface>Because the prevention of women's diseases and the promotion of women's health is important to the Government. </typeface> <#\><typeface>Important to the tune of $24 million to the Cervical Cancer Awareness campaign over the last four years <longdash> a campaign that has just been topped up with another $8.4 million for this year.</typeface></p>

<#\><h><bold>Men's Health</bold></h>

<p><#\>Important to the point that the recent Federal budget, <quote>reaffirming the Government's commitment to improving women's health</quote>, gave the National Women's Health Program $32 million.</p>

<p><#\>Women's health is so important that in New South Wales alone, $93 million has been set aside to provide specific funding for women's health.</p>

<p><#\>So important, in fact, that special Federal health funding of $29 million will be matched dollar-for-dollar by the states and territories this year <*>dotted line</*> and the whole sack-load goes to the National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer.</p>

<p><#\>Obviously women's health is impor<l>tant. <#\>But nowhere within the vastness of the Federal Health budget, or the jugger<l>nauts of eight State and territory health departments, is there even the mention of men's health, let alone a men's health budget.</p>

<p><#\>This may seem wrong, but rest assured, it is correct. <#\>In politically correct circles the non-existence of men's health at the expense of women's is called "positive discrimination". <#\>Positive Discrimination is the politically correct way of saying that we are all equal but some of us are women.</p>

<p><#\>And it pays not to disagree with the party line. <#\>One official from the Federal Department of Health told us: <#\><quote>Setting up affirmative health action for women is like starting a special whites-only health<l>care clinic in Alice Springs.</quote> <#\>But he didn't want his name used for fear of reprisal. <#\>Positive Discrimination is like that.</p>

<p><#\>An analysis of government health data shows that one gender is definitely disadvantaged. <#\>We know this gender is "dying of cancer". <#\>The Australian Bureau of Statistics calls it <quote>morbidity due to malignant neoplasms</quote> and it kills more Australians than anything else.</p>

<p><#\>Most cancer victims get their death warrants via lung cancer, which kills three times as many men as women. <#\>The next most common cancer is that of the breast. <#\>Approximately 2,500 women die of it annually.</p>

<p><#\>Cancer of the prostate gland kills approximately 2000 men each year and, as its incidence increases, the death rate rises.</p>

<p><#\>Which cancer are you the most aware off? <#\>While the Federal and State governments throw $58 million at the National Program for the Early Detection of Breast Cancer, a program that would attack the killer prostate cancer is still seen as inappropriate.</p>

<p><#\><quote>The only reason more men don't die of prostate cancer,</quote> according to one specialist, <quote>is that they don't live long enough.</quote></p>

<p><#\><quote>The only way for a man to definitely avoid it is to die young,</quote> says Sydney Hospital's Dr Basil Donovan.</p>

<p><#\><quote>It's a bit of a mystery because there hasn't been much research done into it. <#\>It receives nowhere near the attention nor respect it deserves as a male health issue.</quote></p>

<p><#\>As with breast and cervical cancer, the key to treating "male" cancers lies in early detection.</p>

<p><#\>How many men, asks one doctor, are aware that a basic testes examination is a far more accurate and effective pre<l>emptive anti-cancer measure than the breast examination that women are taught from widespread advertising and educa<l>tion?</p>

<p><#\>A nursing sister from a major STD clinic told <it>Australian Penthouse</it> she'd been trying for months to get hold of leaflets showing men how to examine their own testes.</p>

<O>excerpt</O>

<p><#\><quote>Young men in their teens and twenties are the most at risk from cancer of the testicles but I've been told there's no funds available.</quote></p>

<p><#\>Testes self-examination can be effec<l>tively taught in a matter of minutes, but there is not one education department in Australia that advocates or sponsors the teaching of testes self-examination to high school boys.</p>

<p><#\>There are plenty of funds available to educate women about osteoporosis <longdash> thanks to an exhaustive public health campaign there can't be a woman alive in Australia unaware that calcium rich foods help prevent the disease of bone deterioration.</p>

<p><#\>Osteoporosis weakens and thins the bones to the point where tripping over the cat could leave one in line for a hip replacement. <#\>The disease has become one of the "female" health issues but its as much a problem for elderly men (who die far more frequently following a fall) as it is for elderly women.</p>

<p><#\>If most men have even heard of it they assume it's an old women's dis<l>ease, largely because that is the only way it has ever been marketed.</p>

<p><#\>Many men are similarly unaware of the risks connected with vasectomy which range from testicular pain and erectile incapacity through to cancer.</p>

<p><#\>Equal numbers of men and women get skin cancer but twice as many men die from it.</p>

<p><#\>Women outlive men by an average of six years, perhaps partly because men are three times more likely to commit suicide.</p>

<p><#\>So who is disadvantaged? <#\>The gen<l>der with the highest death rate, whose best tactical bet for pre<l>empting painful, drawn-out diseases is to just die of something else anyway? <#\>Or the statistically far healthier gender who've somehow gone from being half of the human species into a disadvantaged minority group with a massive slice of the health pie?</p>

<p><#\>If one male-specific cancer kills prac<l>tically as many men as the major female cancer kills women, wouldn't both dis<l>eases get equal research funding?</p>

<p><#\>For an answer we went, logically enough, to the Federal Department of Health: <#\><quote>You're doing a story about <smallcaps>what</smallcaps>? <#\>What's <it>that</it>?</quote></p>

<p><#\>The switchboard operator sounded as puzzled and aghast as if <it>Australian Penthouse</it> had phoned the department for help with an article about dinosaurs.</p>

<p><#\><quote>Male health issue,</quote> we repeated.</p>

<p><#\><quote>What on earth do you mean?</quote></p>

<p><#\><quote>Never mind, could you connect us to the Women's Health section?</quote></p>

<p><#\><quote>Which one? <#\>There's so many different areas of it.</quote></p>

<p><#\>Eventually we were connected to the Health Minister, Senator Graham Richardson's office, where his spokesman said they <quote>absolutely reject any suggestion that men are being dis<l>criminated against.</quote></p>

<p><#\><quote>The reason there are special pro<l>grams for women's health, the disadvan<l>taged such as Aboriginals and so on, is not that we're placing a greater priority than needed, but that in the past a lot of issues were ignored.</quote></p>

<p><#\><quote>To do a special remedial health pro<l>gram for men would suggest that men aren't getting a good deal and there is nothing to suggest that.</quote></p>

<p><#\>But several high-ranking Government health officials say there's a lot to sug<l>gest that male health is neglected.</p>

<p><#\>One official admits that the obvious gender bias in public health is becoming an issue inside the department: <#\><quote>A lot of people would find it outrageous and totally unacceptable for a male health clinic to be opened up, so why is there something targeted at purely one half of the species?</quote> he asks.</p>

<p><#\><quote>Nearly everyone is targeted in the health budget <longdash> young, old, disabled, non-English speaking persons, persons with HIV, women<*>dotted line</*><#\>That leaves the white, English speaking <*>dotted line</*> middle Australian man untargeted.</quote></p>

<p><#\>This non-targeting is what yet another senior DOH official thinks has led to 500,000 Australian men "missing in action" each year.</p>

<p><#\><quote>From the age of zero, men die off at a much greater rate. <#\>It honestly reminds me of Flanders in the First World War.</quote></p>

<p><#\>An argument that's been advanced by feminists and women's groups is that it's men's own fault (obsessive, stressed, workaholic, incommunicative, drinkers etc.) that they're more likely to die.</p>

<p><#\><quote>That's blaming the victim,</quote> says the senior official. 
<#\><quote>She got raped because she wore a short skirt. <#\>He got AIDS because he was a poof. <#\>It's a politically incorrect argument that shouldn't be legitimate in human rights circles.</quote></p>

<p><#\>But, he explains, when it comes to Homo Australis the attitude becomes <quote>Oh, bad luck <longdash> men are just the weaker species <*>dotted line</*><#\>imagine if that argument were applied to a premature baby?</quote></p>

<p><#\>He doesn't even think "ordinary women" particularly benefit from the National Women's Health Program.</p>

<p><#\><quote>They don't see themselves as disad<l>vantaged and are exasperated at what is being done in their name.</quote> <#\><quote>Obviously one must have obstetrics and gynaecol<l>ogy but these women can't see the point in special women's health centres to provide what should be general health care for both men and women.</quote></p>

<p><#\><quote>It's a radical feminist objective and it's basically separatist.</quote></p>

<p><#\>Pointing out that he's not in favour of male health clinics either, the Doctor asks <quote>Why separate the sexes?</quote> <#\><quote>I thought the whole idea was to eliminate sexual apartheid?</quote></p>

<p><#\>Radical feminist and Women's Electoral Lobby spokeswoman, Eva Cox, was incredulous when <it>Australian Penthouse</it> phoned her. <#\><quote><it>What</it> are you writing about?</quote> <#\><quote>Male health?</quote> <#\><quote>Oh, you mean they're worried about their little appendages?</quote></p>

<p><#\>Explaining that as one of Australia's best known feminists we assumed she'd be in favour of equal rights, we asked her opinion of the clear disparity between the time and money given to female over male health issues.</p>

<p><#\><quote>Oh, the poor little blossoms,</quote> she says. <#\><quote>If I'm sounding unsympathetic, it's because I am. </quote> <#\><quote>I'm disconcerted by the sudden trend of men wanting to shove women over and become victims too.</quote></p>

<p><#\>Men, she says, have been running the medical profession for over 500 years and if men aren't looked after by the health system, then it's no-one's fault, but their own.</p>

<p><#\><it>Australian Penthouse</it> raised the sub<l>ject of prostate and testicular cancer: <#\><quote>I know women live longer and all that stuff,</quote> she snaps. <#\><quote>But men have stuffed it up and now they want to unstuff it up.</quote> <#\><quote>They want us to feel sorry for them.</quote></p>

<p><#\>It makes Eva Cox sick, she explains, <quote>that men are now whingeing and pre<l>tending to be victims<*>dotted line</*></quote> <#\><quote>They can sort themselves out and stop expecting us to take care of them.</quote></p>

<p><#\><quote>This thinking is dangerous for men <it>and</it> women,</quote> warns Dr Donovan, who specialises in sexually transmitted dis<l>eases. <#\><quote>As a venereaologist, I am opposed to singling out one sex for spe<l>cial attention. <#\>It's a recipe for disaster to treat just one half of the combination.</quote></p>

<p><#\><quote>There isn't much use,</quote> he explains, <quote>in having women aware of genital health, the need for regular smears and diseases such as chlamydia <longdash> sexually transmitted, symptomless, common in both sexes and can cause infertility <longdash> if men are being left out of the equation.</quote></p>

<p><#\><quote>Male health issues are seriously undercatered for,</quote> he says. <#\><quote>There's been an attempt to positively discrimi<l>nate in favour of women but it's forgot<l>ten that the health system has never actually been positively skewed towards men.</quote></p>

<p><#\>He admits that people with, for example, genital cancers, often used to be frightened, given barely any explanation of what was happening and were unin<l>formed of self-help or preventative mea<l>sures.</p>

<p><#\><quote>The situation's been reversed for women but when it comes to men, not a lot has changed.</quote></p>

<p><#\>As were all the medical professionals consulted for this article, Dr Donovan was at pains to stress he's not against women's health as such.</p>

<p><#\><quote>I'd just like to see a health service that didn't distinguish between the sexes.</quote></p>

<p><#\>If you visit the health section of any large book store, most of the books are about or relating to women: pre-men<l>strual tension, menopause, female depression, hormone replacement ther<l>apy, eating disorders, osteoporosis, fer<l>tility, infertility, female cancer, female orgasm<*>dotted line</*></p></I>
