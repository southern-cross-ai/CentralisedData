<#\><bold>Renowned for their remarkable variations in shape, colour and form orchids continue to intrigue photographers, botanists, florists and the general public, but rarely has anyone turned their attention to the less obvious attributes that they possess <longdash>their medicinal qualities.</bold>

<p><#\><bold>T</bold>he orchid family is the largest of the plant kingdom, with more than 30,000 species in over 750 genera. <#\>The wonderful <it>Dracula</it> spe<l>cies, the highly decora<l>tive <it>Cattleya, Cymbid<l>ium, Paphiopedilum, Phalaenopsis</it> or <it>Vanda</it> orchids are the most well-known in the horticul<l>tural trade, and they pro<l>vide an incredible collec<l>tion for the eye to feast on. <#\>Cosmopolitan in charac<l>ter, orchids prefer the cooler tropics and occupy a wide habitat range which includes terrestrial (land loving), saprophytic (living on plant litter) and epiphytic (growing on another plant).</p>

<p><#\>Many rely closely on special insects for fertilisation as well as having symbiotic relationships with specific fungi which reflects in the ease (or difficulty) of their propa<l>gation. <#\>As a result many still cannot be cultivated and we need to learn more. <#\>The Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew (london) recently instituted the Sainsbury's Or<l>chid Project in continuing the work of conservation. <#\>Much pioneering work using fungi to promote orchid growth was done by Mark Clements in Australia who had success cultivating a rare donkey orchid (<it>Diuris fragrantissima</it>). <#\>Under<l>taking further research at Kew another 20 spe<l>cies of orchid were matched with their fun<l>gal companions. <#\>The integral role of fungi in orchid growth has remained relatively un<l>known until recently and now has enormous implications for orchid cultivation and conservation.</p>

<p><#\>So specialised are numerous species that they can be found nowhere else but in the specific habitats where they have evolved and it is this endemic character of orchids which places them in a perilous position as their environments are being pro<l>gressively destroyed.</p>

<p><#\>One humorous incident recounted in 'Tan Bark', the News<l>letter of the Toowoomba Orchid Society, aptly illustrates this specificity of orchid species. <#\>New Zealand botanists had spent years searching for an orchid thought to be extinct when <quote>After four days of wallow<l>ing in a peat bog in search of the tiny native <it>Corymbas carseii</it>, the demoral<l>ised conservation de<l>partment botanists paused for a lunchbreak and found they were sit<l>ting on it.</quote> <#\>This little orchid blooms for just two days each year.</p>

<p><#\>Saving species from ex<l>tinction has now become an international objective for many governments and or<l>ganisations, with the result<l>ant list of most orchids in <smallcaps>cites</smallcaps> (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) in an attempt to limit exploi<l>tation of endangered species.</p>

<#\><h><bold>Tapping orchid power</bold></h>

<p><#\>It has been assumed by many that the only commercially useful orchid (aside from horticultural varieties) has been Vanilla. <#\>However the emphasis here is on 'commercial' and if we look beyond this definition we find unique orchid uses emerging from far-flung corners of the world. <#\>From the Amazon to the Orient, in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, orchids have served diverse purposes, some of which are completely unexpected, ranging from ice-cream in Tur<l>key to the provision of hot tonic drinks on the streets of London.</p>

<p><#\>Orchid tubers (primarily of the <it>Orchis</it> spe<l>cies) have been used to prepare a drink called 'salep'. <#\>Most of the tubers are starch-filled, which the herbalist Maude Grieve called Bassorin, describ<l>ing it as having <quote>a sweetish taste</quote> with a faint (somewhat un<l>pleasant) smell. <#\>She wrote that: <quote>salep is very nutritive and demulcent, for which properties it has been used from time immemorial. <#\>It forms a diet of especial value to convalescents and children, being boiled with milk or water, flavoured and prepared in the same way as arrowroot. <#\>A decoction flavoured with sugar and spice, or wine, is an agreeable drink for inva<l>lids. <#\>Sassafras chips were sometimes added, or cloves, cinna<l>mon and ginger.</quote></p>

<p><#\>In Greece and Turkey salep sweetened with honey was an early morning 'pick-me-up', and for centuries Turkey and Per<l>sia exported it for preparing nourishing drinks. <#\>Before the ad<l>vent of coffee salep was sold at stalls on the streets of London, popular for those reputed tonic and soothing actions. <#\>The best English salep originated in Oxfordshire but demand was so great that tubers were imported from Asia minor, Germany and other European countries.</p>

<p><#\>Over 2,000 years ago salep was familiar to Dioscorides and the Arabian physicians, as well as later herbalists of the middle ages. <#\>Its medicinal use included prevention of rotting sores, mouth ulcers and inflammatory problems. <#\>From the Indian ba<l>zaars salep misri (from a species of <it>Eulophia</it>) was renowned for its excellent quality and, as a result, commanded high prices. <#\>Its tubers contain almost 50 per cent mucilage, some natural sugar, potassium and calcium. <#\>These were blanched in boiling water to remove the bitter taste, the skin removed and then sun dried after which they could be ground into a yellow powder for dispensing.</p>

<p><#\>salep's reputation was so well accepted as a tonic that it was even considered essential for long voyages and ships included it in their stores as <quote>an ounce, dissolved in two quarts of boiling water, being considered sufficient subsistence for each man per <O>photo</O> day, should provisions run short.</quote></p>

<p><#\>The salep mucilage readily forms<space> a jelly, used medicinally to ease gastro<?><l></?>intestinal problems. <#\>Powdered salep mixed with boiling water was given to infants and invalids, particularly those suffering from recurrent diarrhoea or fevers. <#\>It even gained official acceptance in the German pharmacopoeia.</p>

<#\><h><bold>What's sex got to do with it?</bold></h>

<p><#\>It will come as a surprise to some to find out the origin of the name 'orchid'. <#\>Dioscorides loosely applied the Greek word 'Orchis' (meaning testicle) to what would later become known as the Or<l>chid family, his choice of term inspired by the oval-shaped tubers of some Eu<l>ropean species, particularly those which came in pairs! <#\>He described the swol<l>len bulbous roots as having one which was full and solid, while the other was wrinkled and soft, mentioning the folk tale that men should eat the full one to beget sons and women the soft one to conceive daughters!</p>

<p><#\>Local names often reflect this sexual connection i.e. Dog Stones, Goat Stones, Fox Stones etc. <#\>Therefore it was quite logical that beliefs relating to fer<l>tility evolved around these plants and all manner of rumours abounded. <#\>It was certainly a profitable idea for suppliers of the tuber to encourage.</p>

<p><#\>In the 17th Century the herbalist Gerard published a classification ac<l>cording to these 'stones' and noted the flowers of some orchids had interesting natural associations, resembling butter<l>lies, bees, wasps and flies. <#\>Goat stones gained their reputation from their <quote>stink<l>ing and loathesome smell</quote>, and the name Serapias Stones is particularly illuminating as <quote>sundry of them bring forth flow<l>ers resembling flies and such like fruitful and lascivious in<l>sects, as taking their name from Serapias, the god of the citi<l>zens of Alexandria in Egypt, who has a most famous temple at Canopus, where he was worshipped with all kinds of lascivi<l>ous wantonnesse, songs and dances <*>dotted line</*></quote> <#\>Sounds interesting.</p>

<p><#\>Obviously some quite remarkable and fanciful associations developed in orchid lore. <#\>The issue became even more con<l>fused when orchids used were known not only as promoters of sexual activity but were believed to be anaphrodisiac as well! <#\>Witches, of course, used the tubers in their concoctions, <quote>the fresh tuber being given to promote true love, and the withered one to check wrong passions.</quote> <#\>(Of course it is left to conjecture what 'wrong passions' actually constituted!) <#\>However their vir<l>tues did not stop here and Culpepper tells us of other practical applications as in crushed and <quote>applied to the place</quote> they heal the <quote>King's evil</quote> (scrofula <longdash>which was swelling of the lymphatic glands).</p>

<p><#\>The herbalist Gerard named one Orchis species (<it>Orchis maculata</it>) 'Female Satyrion', as orchids of his time were known as 'Satyrions'. <#\>Legend reinforced the reputed sexual enhanc<l>ing benefits of orchids recounting that they were the food of the satyrs, inciting them to carnal 'excesses'. <#\>Mythology related that Orchis was the son of a satyr and a nymph, and was killed by the wine-loving Bacc<l>hanalians for insulting their priestess. <#\>The devout prayers of his father were answered (in a fashion) when he was transformed into the flower that bears his name.</p>

<p><#\>Perhaps the most well known of all the orchids is the unusual climbing epi<l>phyte, vanilla (<it>Vanilla planifolia</it>) with its lovely green flowers. <#\>When fertilised they produce the five to ten inch pods from whence vanilla comes. <#\>Over the ages their delicious scent has been used in the making of perfumes and, as long ago as the Aztec empire, was prized as a spice for chocolate drinks. <#\>The familiar fragrance (from the chemical vanilline) is only produced from fer<l>mented vanilla-pods, there is no aroma from the fresh pod. <#\>Vanilla has been widely utilised for its aromatic proper<l>ties and also has a reputation medici<l>nally as a stimulant, digestive aid and choleretic when prepared as a syrup or tincture. <#\>Vanilla was also rumoured to have 'magical' benefits similar to other orchids and when used in love sachets was thought to incite lust or when placed in a bowl of sugar would impart 'loving vibrations'. <#\>The sugar could then be used to sweeten love potions.</p>

<#\><h><bold>Endangered species</bold></h>

<p><#\>Another famous orchid remedy of the 19th Century (unfortunately still used in some herbal preparations today) is the striking Lady's Slipper Orchid (<it>Cypri<l>pedium pubescens</it>) known as Nerve Root or American Valerian. <#\>In the British Herbal Pharmacopoeia of 1983 its action is noted as being sedative, mild hypnotic, spas<l>molytic and thymoleptic indicated in treat<l>ment of insomnia, hysteria, emotional ten<l>sion and general anxiety states.</p>

<p><#\>Once widely used it enjoyed a remark<l>able reputation, famous for being <quote>one of the most valuable of vegetable medicines. <#\>Its operation upon the system appears to be in harmony with the laws of animal life, giving tone to the nervous system and is, therefore, used in all cases of nervous ir<l>ritability, hysterical affections, spasms, fits and all derangements of the functions of the brain such as madness, delerium etc. <#\>Its properties are sedative and anti-<space>spas<l>modic. <#\>It has a pungent smell, somewhat nauseous. <#\>It contains ex<l>tractive, gum, fecula and a small portion of essential oil. <#\>Its benefi<l>cial effects are produced by allay<l>ing pain, quieting the nerves and promoting sleep. <#\>It has good effects also in nervous headache, epilepsy, tremors, etc. <#\>Its use is preferable to Opium since it has no narcotic ef<l>ects.</quote> <#\>[The America Botanist, Goode, in <it>The Family Flora</it>, 1845]</p>

<p><#\>So great was its popularity, overcollection resulted in shortages of the wild plant and it is now en<l>dangered almost everywhere it grows (so if any preparations have this herb in it, don't buy them!). <#\>It was thought to have magical affili<l>ations and was used in protective sachets to guard against all forms of evil intent including spells and the 'evil eye'! <#\>It was once official in the <it>United States Phar<l>macopoeia</it> (<smallcaps>usp</smallcaps>) and also found extensive use in treating the joint pains following scarlet fever. <#\>Tragically, in England its destruction was so extensive that now only two wild plants survive in a secret guarded reserve while researchers desper<l>ately try to save it from extinction.</p>

<p><#\>There are other striking species of 'Slipper Orchids', distin<l>guished by their slipper-shaped lip and many are prized for their incredible variety of shape and size in the horticulture trade, for example <it>Cypripedium formosanum</it> and various <it>Paphiopedilum</it> species. <#\>We know even less about their me<l>dicinal potential.</p>

<#\><h><bold>Orchids in Chinese medicine</bold></h>

<p><#\>Chinese culture has long revered flowers in their art, poetry and literature. <#\>Indeed the orchid is the emblem for those of worthy character, particularly historical figures known for their virtue. <#\>Symbolising love, beauty and elegance it has a special place in Chinese beliefs representing trustworthy friendships <O>photo</O> <O>caption</O> <O>photo</O> <O>caption</O> as well as privacy. <#\>The Chinese word for orchid is 'lan', which generally refers to the prolific <it>Cymbidium</it> species. <#\>However, there are over 1,000 species of orchids na<l>tive to China and various species have medicinal applications. <#\>Originally the word 'lan' referred to aromatic plants believed to ward off evil spirits, and as Chinese or<l>chids are renowned for their fragrance their eventual adoption of this word was a logi<l>cal development from about the 13th Century onwards.</p>

<p><#\>Chinese treatment employs various or<l>chid medicines, one of the most popular being <it>Blettia striata</it> (called Bai Ji) which is used as a haemostatic, to stop bleeding in the lung and stomach.</p></I>
