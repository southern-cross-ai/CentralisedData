<#\><bold>BY MIA FREEDMAN</bold>

<p><#\>The first thing you notice about Poppy King is her lips. <#\>Full, pouty and with a perfect cupid's bow, they're the kind of lips that look best bright red. <#\>And they usually are. <#\>The second thing you notice, or rather sense, is Poppy's incredible energy and passion for her work. <#\>Simply asking her how it all began un<l>leashes a flood of enthusiasm.</p>

<p><#\><quote>I was just so sick of having to reapply my lipstick five or six times a day. <#\>Every lipstick I wore smudged, faded, bled onto my teeth or vanished altogether. <#\>When a friend gave me a matt lipstick from overseas, I knew immediately that this was what I had been looking for.</quote></p>

<p><#\>But looking for a replacement uncovered a huge gap in the market; matt lipsticks just weren't available. <#\>So began Poppy's two-year trek from counter to counter with every query met with what would become an ironic response: <quote>Sorry, we don't make a matt lipstick but if I had a dollar for every time a customer asked for one, I'd be rich.</quote></p>

<p><#\><quote>The gap was so obvious, I thought I must be crazy.</quote> <#\><quote>How could huge cosmetics houses overlook something that, to me seemed perfectly clear? </quote> <#\><quote>Women want matt lipsticks. </quote> <#\><quote>It's that simple.</quote></p>
	<p><#\>The transformation from frustrated consumer to budding entrepreneur happened like so many things in Poppy's life <longdash> suddenly and by chance. <#\><quote>I was reading Cleo and noticed an ad for The Nescafe Big Break Awards, offering six people under the age of 2l a $20,000 grant to pursue their area of interest. </quote> <#\><quote>I immediately changed my attitude from <quote>why doesn't some com<l>pany do this?</quote> to <quote>I'm going to do it myself</quote>.</quote> <#\>She was 17 years old, living at home and had just completed the first year of an arts degree. <#\><quote>Up till then I didn't have a clue as to what I wanted to do with my life.</quote></p>

<p><#\>After intense research for her submission, missing out on the award was a disappointment but not a great setback. <#\>A chance conversation at a party two months later was the break Poppy needed. <#\><quote>I was chatting to a friend about matt lipsticks and how I wanted to produce them. </quote> <#\><quote>She loved the idea and mentioned it to a friend of hers who was looking to invest in a business venture.</quote> A fortnight later, the friend called Poppy. <#\>They met, and in the space of a few hours Poppy had convinced him to back her ideas financially. <#\><quote>Maybe I was ignorant or naive or overconfident or all of those things, but I just couldn't imagine it <it>not</it> being a success.</quote></p>

<p><#\>After deferring university, Poppy threw herself into building a business from scratch. <#\><quote>Everyone warned me that a recession was the worst possible time to start something, but in my case the opposite was true. <#\>When times are tough, manufacturers are forced to become more competitive and that made it easier for me to get a good deal.</quote> And Poppy's research also showed her that a recession meant a boom in the sale of small luxury items. <#\><quote>Women still want to treat themselves occasionally, they just have to do it on a smaller scale. </quote> <#\><quote>A new dress or pair of shoes is too expensive, so they buy a magazine or a lipstick instead. </quote> <#\><quote>The reces<l>sion was an advantage for me in every way.</quote></p>

<p><#\>After finding a lipstick manufacturer who was open to her ideas, Poppy began months of painstaking trial-and-error in the lab. <#\>Creating the texture was the first and most important step: <quote>I said to my manufacturer, <quote>Whatever amount of pigment you're used to putting in lipsticks, double it.</quote> <#\>No one had done that before.</quote> <#\>The result was a totally matt texture, designed to withstand endless cups of coffee and hours of social kissing.</p>

<p><#\>The second part of Poppy's lipstick vision concerned colour <longdash> and she managed to produce shades unlike any others on the market. <#\><quote>The first seven were colours I'd always looked for but could never find. </quote> <#\><quote>If I saw someone wearing a colour I liked <longdash> even if they were just walking down the street <longdash> I'd ask them what it was. </quote> <#\><quote>Every time, they'd say they had to blend to get the shade they wanted. </quote> <#\><quote>For me, that was further proof of a demand for lipstick colours that didn't yet exist.</quote></p>

<p><#\>She began to collect petals, pieces of material, coloured paper, anything that matched the colours she wanted to recreate. <#\><quote>I spent many afternoons mixing colours with my manufacturer, running back and forth to the mirror and applying different lipsticks while they were still warm.</quote></p>

<p><#\>In January 1992, Poppy was finally happy with her seven colours. <#\>The next step was to name them. <#\><quote>I didn't want to give them boring names like Poppy No.3 or whimsical, wimpy names like Tangerine Dream. </quote> <#\><quote>I wanted to give them strong names that would show how far women have come and what we stand for in the <w>'90s</w>: Ambition, Courage, In<l>tegrity, Virtue, Inspiration, Liberty, Unity.</quote></p>

<p><#\>March saw the first production batch ready for collection and, as Poppy loaded 7,000 lipsticks into her car, she was thinking, <quote>Oh well, even if it's a total failure, at least I'll have enough lipsticks to last the rest of my life!</quote>.</p>

<p><#\>Soon after, Poppy convinced two of Melbourne's leading fashion boutiques to stock her range and made a "wish-list" of 25 other stores she wanted to approach. <#\>But nothing could have prepared her for the flood of calls she received after a small magazine article on Poppy lipsticks appeared later that month. <#\><quote>I was fielding around 300 inquiries a day from people across Australia. </quote> <#\><quote>That's when I realised my market was much broader that I'd originally thought.</quote> <#\>From teenage country girls to 65-year-old grand<l>mothers, it seemed that all kinds of women wanted a lipstick that would last. <#\>Within three weeks, Poppy's first production run was sold out and 90 per cent of the stores on her "wish-list" had contacted her. <#\>But all this was overshadowed by a call from the head buyer at Myer/Grace Bros, who wanted to meet her as soon as possible. <#\><quote>I went into that meeting as an ambitious 19-year-old with a few thousand lipsticks and came out a nationwide operation.</quote></p>

<p><#\>So staggering was Poppy's success, that by June she was able to buy out her financial backer and appoint her older brother as co-director. <#\>Poppy spent the remainder of 1992 packing boxes, taking orders, meeting accountants, making in-store appearances and developing her second range, The Seven Deadly Sins. <#\>Any spare time was devoted to renovating her huge studio apartment in central Mel<l>bourne, catching up with friends over a quick coffee or riding her bike. <#\><quote>I let my gym membership lapse long ago so my bike is both relaxation and exercise.</quote></p>

<p><#\>Not surprisingly, by Christmas Poppy was exhausted and decided to treat herself to a week's break in New York after visiting a cosmetics trade fair in Paris. <#\>But her passion for business took hold, and she hadn't been in New York more than a few days when she began ringing department stores to gauge interest in her lipsticks. <#\>The brush-offs came one after another until she spoke to the head buyer at Barneys (one of New York's most prestigious department stores), who agreed to meet her. <#\>Undeterred by the fact she had left all her promotional material in Australia, Poppy arrived at Barneys the following morning with nothing  but her own half-used lipsticks. <#\>What followed was remarkable. <#\><quote>This woman was blown-away. </quote> <#\><quote>She adored the concept, loved the lipsticks and cancelled all her morning appointments so we could talk business. </quote> <#\><quote>I was so over<l>whelmed I hailed a taxi and burst into tears.</quote></p>

<p><#\>But Poppy King's appetite for success is far from satisfied. <#\>She's currently promoting her Seven Deadly Sins range and finalising the colours for Innocence, a range that will feature paler colours. <#\>Plans for an eye range <longdash> Vision <longdash> are well under way, with foundations, powders and a Poppy fragrance in the pipeline.</p>

<p><#\>Because of their thickness, heat resistance and rich colours, Poppy lipsticks are ideal for dark skin and hot climates. <#\>A Sri Lankan firm has already expressed interest, and expansion into the huge cosmetics markets of Sri Lanka and Pakistan seems just a matter of time.</p>

<p><#\>Meanwhile, in preparation for <w>Barneys'</w> August launch, Poppy is flying to New York for a two-week publicity blitz and Barneys is sending her lipsticks to some of the most famous lips in America, including those of Julia Roberts, Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell and Madonna.</p>

<p><#\>And instead of letting herself get swept away in this whirlwind of success, Poppy is proving she has a business instinct as acute as the Material Girl herself. <#\><quote>I'm giving myself one more year to stand up and be the front person for Poppy Industries. </quote> <#\><quote>For long-term profitability, it's vital that I step back and let the product speak for itself. </quote> <#\><quote>Besides, there's only so long I can maintain goodwill in this country before people decide I'm doing too well and it's time to cut me down.</quote> <#\>But jealousy and bitterness aside, right now, at the age of 20, everything's coming up roses for Poppy King.</p>

<#\><h><bold>N<smallcaps>ATALIE'S 
STORY</smallcaps></bold></h>

<p><#\><bold>W</bold>ithin a fortnight of receiving the letter, we had Natalie on a plane to Sydney. <#\>(<quote>Given the precarious nature of Natalie's condition,</quote> the letter had said, <quote>you understand we have to act quickly.</quote>) <#\>Wearing a black hat and a white ruffled blouse, she strode into the airport lounge. <#\>We had expected an invalid. <#\>What we got was someone brave, intelligent and funny. <#\>The flight from Mel<l>bourne to Sydney had been draining, the black hat covered a head bald from chemotherapy and the ruffled blouse hid a body thin from fighting illness. <#\>Yet she was exuberant. <#\><quote>I can't believe I'm actually doing this. </quote> <#\><quote>For years I've looked at the models and celebrities in Cleo, but I never thought I'd be one of them,</quote> said Natalie, high on the excitement of being our star for a day.</p>

<p><#\>And a star is exactly what she was. <#\>More adept at dealing with reactions to her illness than we were, she put us all at ease. <#\><quote>Will she be OK about being photographed bald?</quote> asked the photog<l>rapher. <#\><quote>Perhaps we'd better lead up to things gently until we know how she feels.</quote> As soon as we were in the studio, Natalie solved the problem. <#\><quote>You won't be needing this in the way. </quote> <#\><quote>Sinead O'Connor, eat your heart out,</quote> she said, whipping off her hat.</p>

<p><#\><quote>I used to be the kind of girl who was in the hairdresser once a month, always interested in the latest style. </quote> <#\><quote>Now<*>dotted line</*>well, it doesn't help to be too sensitive. </quote> <#\><quote>It's usually other people who feel more embarrassed than I do. </quote> <#\><quote>Some stare, even call out things. </quote> <#\><quote>I've learnt to ignore them.</quote> <#\>Other people's reaction to her illness had been an education all round. <#\><quote>When it first happened, I received loads of cards and letters, but then everyone but my closest friends got on with their lives again. </quote> <#\><quote>They started to forget. </quote> <#\><quote>It was like time was moving on for them and just standing still for me,</quote> she said. <#\>Some friends just couldn't cope at all. <#\><quote>One friend's boyfriend couldn't even bear to come and see me because the thought that I might die was just too much for him. </quote> <#\><quote>At 20, you don't think about death. </quote> <#\><quote>Death is something that happens to other people, when they are old, years from now.</quote></p>

<p><#\>When leukaemia struck Natalie, it came like a bolt from the blue. <#\>Her life was on a roll. <#\>Always keen on fashion, she'd taken a two-year-fashion-design and business course. <#\>Then, after a holiday job at Sportsgirl, she impressed the fashion chain so much that she was taken on permanently as a window dresser. <#\>It was job she adored. <#\><quote>I just couldn't be at work long enough.</quote> <#\>Within three years, she'd been promoted and transferred to a high-profile store in WA. <#\><quote>My life had never been better. </quote> <#\><quote>I had my new job, was sharing a house on the beach with two friends I loved, the future looked great, and then suddenly<*>dotted line</*> pow.</quote></p></I>
