<p><#\>Hi,</p>

<p><#\>Many thanks <@>familiarname1</@> for your thank you letter. I do hope the land <&>an airfield</&> "takes off" so that you two are not "out of pocket" for very long. <#\>The trouble with getting older is that if you invest in something financially it isn't much use if you have to wait 25 years for your return. <#\><ul>So</ul> may you soon be the winners of <?>latter</?> or have your money back from the land <longdash> or both.</p>

<p><#\>Even without work retirement is busy. <#\>Today we didn't even find time to go to the beach. <#\>I had to drive to the dentist this morning for a lengthy appointment followed by a small amount of <del><?>shopping</?></del> shopping <*>plus-like ampersand</*> photocopying. I wasn't home for very long before we had to leave again for our Spanish lesson. When we arrived home I prepared tomorrow night's dessert (one of those 24 hour arrangements) <*>plus-like ampersand</*> then it was time to leave for a lecture on cancer, mainly skin cancer, given by the local G.P. expert <*>plus-like ampersand</*> a Cancer Council representative. <#\>It looks like I'll find myself doing some volunteerwork for the Cancer Council <longdash> presenting certificates to schools which hold their swimming carnivals at night for example. <#\>We have just arrived home and it's 9.30. <#\>Incidentally the lecture was magnificent <*>plus-like ampersand</*> accompanied by horrendous but fascinating slides.</p>

<p><#\>Actually I visited the lecturer 2 weeks ago <*>plus-like ampersand</*> had my skin checked. <#\>He said <X><quote>What a magnificent skin.</quote> </X> <#\>What he really meant was <quote>I know you're face is sporting many crow's feet <*>plus-like ampersand</*> your skin is like leather but you, you lucky devil, have a skin that can withstand the harmful effect of U.V. rays.</quote> <#\>Naturally the only words I quoted when I returned to <@>forename1</@> were <quote>He said I have a <X><quote>magnificent skin</quote>.</X></quote> <#\>I still recall that when I attended a June Dally Watkins Course at the age of 19 the beautician said <X><quote>How old are you?</quote> </X> <#\>When I replied <quote>19</quote> she said <X><quote>You have the skin of a 25 year-old at least!</quote> </X> <#\>It really is grim to think that I have more crow's feet than my sister-in-law who is about to enter her 70th year <longdash> well on July 14th that is. Sorry <@>forename2</@> I think it's the 11th.</p>

<p><#\>Our Spanish teacher is a delightful lady <*>plus-like ampersand</*> we <ul>love</ul> our Spanish lessons.<#\><@>forename3</@> <@>surname2</@>, our teacher, lived in Spain for 15 years. <#\>Recently the Spanish Govt. changed the regulations for Canadians <*>plus-like ampersand</*> Australians insisting that they lodge many thousands of dollars in a Govt. trust fund (or something like that) <longdash> dollars <@>forename3</@> didn't have. <#\>She sold her cottage <*>plus-like ampersand</*> returned to Australia. <#\>She is an artist <*>plus-like ampersand</*> a writer. <#\>She has had children's stories published <*>plus-like ampersand</*> stories published in women's magazines. <#\>I've decided there are a lot of multi-talented people in <@>placename2</@>. <#\><@>forename3</@> will be coming here because she wants to come to astronomy lessons <*>plus-like ampersand</*> I am the astronomy co-ordinator for the University of the 3rd Age, or U.3.A. <#\>I'm sure if we had remained in <@>placename3</@> we would not have become involved in the same way as we have here. <#\>Of course there would be other activities.</p>

<p><#\>The thing you miss most when you change your domicile is the friendship. <#\>Old friends which include your brother <*>plus-like ampersand</*> sister-in-law can never be replaced. <#\>They have known you so long that there is no point in "putting on an act" to impress. <#\>You feel very comfortable with old friends knowing that they have realistic expectations. <#\>Because you have been rubbing shoulders for a long time you rarely misunderstand them <*>plus-like ampersand</*> they rarely misunderstand you. <#\>I don't think you can ever find this with new friends. <#\>Well perhaps you can but it is rare.</p>

<p><#\>Don't faint but I have written to a publisher about my proposed limerick book <*>plus-like ampersand</*> about my Yr 2 spelling worksheets <*>plus-like ampersand</*> he has replied saying he would like to see some samples. <#\>I became quite excited when his letter arrived. <#\>Of course I am no nearer to publication now than I was <ul>before</ul> I received the letter, but I couldn't help kidding myself just a little bit. <#\>When we climbed into bed last night I said to <@>forename1</@>, <quote><#\>You know, there is one thing we have completely overlooked as an addition to our pension.</quote> <X><quote><#\>What's that?</quote> </X> said <@>forename1</@>. <quote><#\>The royalties I'll receive from my publications,</quote> I said, which caused us both to laugh. <#\>I'll keep you posted. <#\>Did I tell you about my limerick book? <#\>Forgive me if I'm boring you with this a second time. <#\>When I wrote to the publisher I stated, <quote><#\>The brilliance is not in the limericks I have written but in the idea I have devised which means that each limerick can be applied to 20 or 30 different names</quote> <longdash> or something like that<space>. <#\>I have written them (<*>plus-like ampersand</*> am still writing them) 
with the name inserted within the line <*>plus-like ampersand</*> not at the end of it, which means you slot any name into the space without altering the rhyme. <#\>They are written for young children <longdash> Yrs 2 <*>plus-like ampersand</*> 3 basically <*>plus-like ampersand</*> the index will probably say One syllable <w>boys'</w> namestwo syllable <w>boys'</w> namesthree syllable <w>boys'</w> namesOne syllable <w>girls'</w> names <&>ditto marks for 2 lines under last 3 words</&>

<*>plus-like ampersand</*> perhaps
Limericks appropriate to a girl or a boy by slotting in the name <*>plus-like ampersand</*> changing his to hers (changing the pronoun)</p>

<p><#\>Any ideas for the index would be appreciated<space>. <#\>Any limericks would be appreciated too. <#\>With your permission <@>familiarname1</@> I'll include the limerick you wrote about me -<X><quote>There was a young girl called Frances
Who was very fond of going to dances
One night in the dark, she slipped in the park
And came home with mud on her pantses</quote> .</X> <marginalia><#\>Can you believe that the pet name for Francesca in Spanish is Parke <#\>Don't ask me how to spell it)</marginalia></p>

<p><#\>The limericks I have written are on scraps of paper at the moment<space>. Tomorrow <*>plus-like ampersand</*> Sunday I will type a few out <*>plus-like ampersand</*> send them off to the publisher<space>. <#\>I went to the Community Centre today <*>plus-like ampersand</*> photocopied some of my spelling work sheets ready to post away. <#\>I have such a gia<del><O>one letter</O></del>t/giant sized ego that I am afraid someone will steal my limerick idea<space>. <#\>When I wrote the S.O.S<space>,book the brilliance on that occasion was not in the content but in the <ul>idea</ul>. <#\>Anyone could have written the book. <#\>It became the best seller for Met West. Infants' Mistresses Publications at that time <*>plus-like ampersand</*> do you know that someone stole my idea <*>plus-like ampersand</*> produced it commercially. <#\>I guess this is why I'm wary. <#\><@>forename2</@> how is your book progressing? <#\>Are you any nearer publication? <#\>Would one of the model aircraft magazines publish it? <#\>They have the audience <*>plus-like ampersand</*> the printing facilities<space>. <#\>Have you approached them?</p>

<p><#\>Tomorrow night <@>forename4</@> <*>plus-like ampersand</*> <@>forename5</@> are coming for dinner with their 10 year-old son. <#\>I think I told you <@>forename5</@>'s grandparents lived in <@>placename3</@> <*>plus-like ampersand</*> were Christadelphians<space>. <#\><@>forename5</@> went to <@>placename4</@> Sunday School. <#\><@>forename4</@> is a Psychiatrist <*>plus-like ampersand</*> is involved with <@>organisationname1</@>. <#\><@>forename5</@> is a barrel of dynamite. <#\>She has been running an anti-smoking seminar for the past 4 days <*>plus-like ampersand</*> was there to-night running the skin cancer lecture. <#\>She was interviewed on T.V.last night. <#\>On that occasion she was speaking about the anti-smoking seminar but that wasn't the first time we had seen her on "tele".</p>

<p><#\>The snakes continue to be conspicuous by their absence <*>plus-like ampersand</*> I for one am <ul>not</ul> complaining. <#\>The goannas <*>plus-like ampersand</*> water dragons (great swimmers) continue to visit. <#\>We have one goanna with a stumpy tail. <#\>Do such creatures exist or would he have had it bitten off? <#\>Mother duck has one duckling at the moment <*>plus-like ampersand</*> as it is not a tiny creature I have hopes that this one will survive. <#\>The duck population varies. <#\>For several weeks there were about 10 on the lagoon. <#\>This week there have been between 20 <*>plus-like ampersand</*> 30. We haven't seen Johnny Raper the drake, a large white domestic type drake) for some months. <#\>He was named "Johnny Raper" by <@>forename1</@> after we were told that he had drowned a goose on the next lagoon when he tried to mate with her. <#\>Someone should give him a pair of spectacles <*>plus-like ampersand</*> then perhaps he wouldn't make such ridiculous mistakes.</p>

<p><#\>Our library here has videos so I borrowed "Pride <*>plus-like ampersand</*> Prejudice" <longdash> the Olivier / Greer <?>Garcon</?> (excuse spelling) version <*>plus-like ampersand</*> I <ul>loved</ul> it. <#\>I read "Sarum" last week <*>plus-like ampersand</*> enjoyed it. <#\>It's a novel about the history of Salisbury in England. Sarum is the original name. <#\>I am appalled at how little reading I fit in. <#\>However I try to read the weekly guardian <*>plus-like ampersand</*> segments from the daily local paper. <#\>We watch the daily news from Britain's ITN. news. <#\>It's on at 6.30 AM. <#\>No, we aren't up at that time. <#\><@>forename1</@> puts it on video <*>plus-like ampersand</*> we watch it while we're eating our muesli.</p>

<p><#\>It is now March 5th. <#\>I'll post this tomorrow. <#\>The total amount of interest on the account was $1400. Enclosed is a cheque for $700. <#\>I tried to get details of the account but without paying a search fee of $50 + they could only go back 12 months. <#\>Amazing isn't it. <#\>Not that it makes any difference to the total interest or the amount of tax I had to pay.</p>

<p><#\>The reason for my trip to the dentist <longdash> well for a "check-up" but I had brushed the enamel off one of my eye teeth <*>plus-like ampersand</*> the tooth next to it. <#\>The whole top section on both teeth was <ul>brown</ul> <longdash> Yuk. <#\>The teeth have now been treated<space>.</p>

<p><#\>I will now start letter 2. <#\>Suggest you keep the $700 in your own account for a while until you see how things develop in the "Lands Department" but please cash it soon or I'll be thinking I have $700 that I <ul>don't</ul> have
<#\>Love, <sg><@>forename6</@></sg>.</p>

<sh>5<sp>th</sp>March</sh>

<#\>Hi, <space><p><#\>The notes above are to remind me of items I wish to mention.<*>large Z-like symbol</*><&>new paragraph marker</&> <#\>The astronomy lessons will begin shortly. <#\>I have <del>2</del>3 interested pupils so far <*>plus-like ampersand</*> tomorrow there is a meeting of all the members of U3A so I may acquire a couple more. <#\>I am happy to run monthly viewings for 3. <#\>In fact the smaller the group the better.</p>

<p><*>large Z-like symbol</*><&>new paragraph marker</&> <#\><sh>Lump sum or pension<space>.</sh> <#\>Looks like we'll definitely take the full pension. <#\>The financial experts fascinate me. <#\>Here am I with my dumb maths brain, but thanks be to Dad I am sometimes able to see through their rubbishy logic <*>plus-like ampersand</*> their half truths<space>. <#\>Naturally they are interested only in pushing the lump sum option. <#\>At one meeting they put up a list of advantages of the lump sum over the pension <*>plus-like ampersand</*> listed one such advantage as <quote><X>Assets<space><del>"</del>to be passed on to your children Under pensions" <longdash> no assets to be passed on to children<l><space>as pension ceases on death.</X></quote> <#\>So cheeky me jumped up <*>plus-like ampersand</*> said, <quote>Do you consider a house an asset?</quote> <quote>Yes</quote> said the lecturer.<quote><#\>Well</quote> I said, <quote>Most people have a house to pass on to their children <longdash> quite a substantial asset I would suggest.</quote> <#\>Then there is the argument which I haven't "jumped up <*>plus-like ampersand</*> down" about at a meeting but which occurred to me when I was reading the <del>prospectus</del> suggested plan for my retirement. <#\>They are always saying, <quote>And of course even though you do have the pension adjusted according to the CPI you should keep in mind that you will gain only 61% of the increase owing to the tax rate.</quote> <#\>Sounds good<space>? <#\>Makes you think the lump sum might be better? <#\>And then it "hit<space>"me<longdash> <quote><#\>So what's new? <#\>Every time I've had a salary increase for the past 20 years I've ended up with only 50%. <#\>With the pension I'll be 12% better of than formerly.</quote> </p>

<p><#\>I sent, no, I <ul>have</ul> my limericks <*>plus-like ampersand</*> the spelling/reading word family scheme <ul>ready to send</ul> to the publisher <longdash> addressed, samples completed <*>plus-like ampersand</*> in the envelope. <#\>I'll post it tomorrow. <#\>Wish me luck. <#\>There is a Writers group in the town which I'll consider joining. <#\>They meet once a month.</p>

<p><*>large Z-like symbol</*><&>new paragraph marker</&> <#\>At Toastmasters we have a "joke master". <#\>Occasionally we are given definitions of words. <#\>I liked this one <l> <longdash> Being drunk <longdash> <quote><X>when you feel sophisticated but you can't pronounce it.</X></quote></p>

<p><#\>At the skin cancer lecture the Doctor said we should never have migrated to this region of the world. <#\>It's made for the dark people. <#\>He said there was a theory that the mutants (whites) moved away to the colder climates to survive. <#\>He also said that black people living in cold climates with not much sun suffer from rickets because their skin can't absorb the vitamin D.</p>

<p><#\>My next Toastmasters speech(in a week <*>plus-like ampersand</*> half) is "At the end of the road, eternal silence". <#\>I'll talk about the experience in China when I saw men being led to their execution<space>.</p></I>
