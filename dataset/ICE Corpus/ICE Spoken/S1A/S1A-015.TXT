<I><$A> <#\>What's your plan what's your plan um <,> after
Oxford <#\>What where are you going to go <#\>Go straight to
Edinburgh
<$B> <#\>Yeah what we thought we'd do is Oxford ends on I
think the tenth and um Edinburgh usually starts about two days
after Oxford so what I thought we'd do is travel up and see if
maybe stay maybe in one place on the way up to Edinburgh and
then take about three days to come back and look at a couple
of <{><[>places</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Is that</[></{> by train
<$B> <#\>No bus <#\>Bus is a lot cheaper or by coach is a lot
cheaper and also if you go by train you really have to go
direct and if you go by coach you can stop <,,> and do it in
sections
<$A> <#\>You don't know where you're staying
<$B> <#\>Oh they billet it <{><[>the whole</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Do they</[></{> 
<$B> <#\>tournament
<$A> <#\>Do they know you're <{><[>coming</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> <#\>Well they don't really mind but
<$A> <#\>Are you registered
<$B> <#\>It it doesn't work like that they just invite
everybody to come at<,,> at Oxford and they assume that
they're gonna have a certain number because that's how many
turn up every year <#\>Umm 
<$A> <#\>They probably have <{><[><O>inaudible 1 word</O></[> 
<$B> <#\><[>but I might</[></{> I might write to <@>Forename1</@> and
<@>Forename1</@> <@>Surname1</@> is the guy that runs it <#\>I might write
to <@>Forename1</@> and um tell him that we're probably gonna come
in
<$A> <#\>It'd be a very good idea to um let him know
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>'Cause this year they'll have many more people going
to England than they did <{><[>last year</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> <#\>Actually I hadn't<,>
<$A> <#\>With the extra number they'll probably be snowed
under
<$B> <#\>Yeah well I mightn't even go but but it's a very
informal sort of a thing <#\>There's also a a huge youth hostel
in Edinburgh that nobody stays in in winter
<$A> <#\>Nobody stays in ah Edinburgh
<$B> <#\>Well I liked Edinburgh in winter in some <{><[>ways it
was nicer than London</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Lovely city lovely</[></{> 
<$B> <#\>In some ways it was nicer than London because um it
wasn't so miserable <#\>You know London was just damp the whole
time <#\>At least Edinburgh was really
<$A> <#\>Raining and cold
<$B> <#\>Um yeah it was a bit <#\>I had a nice day though
<#\>Apparently it'd been raining non-stop for a month <,,+>
<$A> <#\>You can get um <O>inaudible 1 word</O> I mean most of
England in summer it's raining every day <#\>Often often a shower
every morning and it fines up in the afternoon<,> <O>inaudible 8
syll</O> <#\>So you'll be go to Oxford what straight away
<$B> <#\>Um well we don't have to be in Oxford till the third
so we'll probably spend a couple of nights in London first or
maybe we'll spend what say one night in London and then
<@>Forename1</@> might want to go and stay with his friends in
Oxford before the tournament
<$A> <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\>He's got um two ex flatmates that are um living in
Oxford<,,>
<$A> <#\><O>inaudible 10 words</O> your English guide thing is
sure<?> to have that won't it</?>
<$B> <#\>I've got the really good maps yeah
<$A> <#\>Stratford's not far from it
<$B> <#\>No we know that we we'll probably stay in Oxford
another time as well <,>
<$A> <#\>Stratford's not far <#\>There's um and of course
Reading's not far either
<$B> <#\>What's in Reading
<$A> <#\>Oh Reading's just a big railway terminus <#\>It's um
<O>inaudible 4 words</O> but you're getting well across to well
across towards um<,,> Shakespeare's country<,,> <O>inaudible 2
words</O> Banbury Cross
<$B> <#\>I've heard of Banbury Cross <#\>Where have I heard of
that
<$A> <#\>Ride a cock horse
<$B> <#\><O>laugh</O> Of course <{><[>of course</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>To Banbury Cross</[></{> 
<$B> <#\>That's right
<$A> <#\>Banbury Cross
<$B> <#\>To see a fine lady um
<$A> <#\>Ride a cock horse to Banbury Cross it ought to be to
see a fine lady <{><[>upon a white horse</[> 
<$B> <#\><[>Upon a white horse</[> </{><O>inaudible 6 words</O><,>
<$A> <#\>Yes it's gonna be a very interesting time <#\>Well you
want
<$B> <#\>We're um we're going to stay in Salisbury and go to
Bath and Stonehenge and look around Salisbury as well because
they're all places we want to go <#\>And we're going to go to
Fishbourne
<$A> <#\>Oh Fishbourne's nice 
<$B> <#\>We're both really interested in that <#\>'Cause me from
Latin and <@>forename1</@> from uh history and stuff
<$A> <#\>If you get good weather
<$B> <#\>Yeah 
<$A> <#\>England England's not not too bad in the winter but
it's I mean it can be snowbound for months on end <#\>I I can
remember oh ah London England being snowbound for the entire
whole of Jan the whole of January <#\>In fact the Thames rose
<#\>That was the winter of nineteen sixty-three
<$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>We'll we'll be alright because we can go to
the British Museum all day if necessary <O>laugh</O> every day
<$A> <#\>January January nineteen sixty-two it was
<$B> <#\>Yeah <O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\>No January nineteen sixty-three <#\>Sorry January
nineteen sixty-three
<$B> <#\>Exactly thirty years ago
<$A> <#\>It um<,,> it started snowing<,> about Christmas time
and it snowed right through January <#\>Half of Europe was snowed
under <#\>There were birds were fre freezing on the birds were
freezing and dropping dead on the on to the footpath <#\>And the
buildings in London <#\>Walk along and there'd be dead pigeons
it
on the on the sidewalk frozen 
<$B> <#\>That's right
<$A> <#\>That's when the water pipes in the houses froze
<#\>Amazing
<$B> <#\>That's right <#\>Was that when you were telling me you
had to take the kids home in the middle of <{><[>the day</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>I had</[></{> to take the kids home <#\>That was the fog
<#\>That was the year before though
<$B> <#\>Oh <{><[>that's fog that's right</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>It was</[></{> before that smokeless fuel thing really
took over in England 
<$B> <#\>The smog
<$A> <#\>And the fog the smog was so bad<,> that we actually
had to take the children home from school <#\>You couldn't see
you could not see your hand you could not put you could not
see your hands at arm's length in front of your face 
<$B> <#\>Gosh
<$A> <#\>And people had to wear bandages around their faces to
stop the smog from getting into their chests <#\>If you put a
handkerchief across your face in about half an hour it was it
was totally black on the outside from where you were breathing
through
<$B> <#\><O>laugh</O> 
<$A> <#\>Oh it was really serious people were I mean many
many people died <#\>There was I think in that particular fog in
that particular fog about eighty people eighty old people
died <#\>Um they asphyx they asphyxiated themselves<,,> <#\>We
went I
went to a concert I went to hear Victoria d'Los Angeles in
Festival Hall and the the fog was coming through you could
hardly see her on the stage 'cause it was already pene
penetrated the wall on the inside as well as outside
<#\>Frightening it was <#\>I I'd heard of London smogs and
everyone
said to me <quote>Oh that's that's not as bad as it used to
be </quote><{><[><O>laugh</O></[>
<$B>  <[><#\><O>laugh</O></[></{>
<$A> <#\>It lasted two days and when the when it was over all
the trees had frost on them and the fog where the fog had
landed and there was all these long strands of frost that had
soot in the um in the frost <#\>The tree that the trees weren't
white at all they were sort of like grey with frosted fog all
over this  <#\>Ah it was amazing <#\>It wasn't very impressive
I can
tell you<,,> <#\>But um actually I loved London <O>inaudible 4
words</O> <#\>I spent two or virtually almost two years in
England<,> and um<,> the weather never stopped me doing
anything <#\>It's um<,> you know be an interesting place
<#\>Expensive nowadays<,,>

<&>Break in recording</&>

<$A> <#\>What time you going to university tomorrow <@>forenameB</@> 
<$B> <#\>Oh I've got to be there at eleven o'clock
<$A> <#\>Got to sign this register
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>They must have trouble getting everybody to sign
wouldn't they
<$B> <#\>Mm well what what she said is there's a default um
like um default assessment which is fifty-fifty and everybody
er and if you only have to you only have to sign it if it's
seventy-five twenty-five but she wants everyone to sign it to
make sure because apparently it's really complicated having
different systems of assessment for the same course and she
has to get the administration worked out for it
<$A> <#\>What do most people do <#\>Do they
<$B> <#\>I don't know <#\>I think I think a lot of people do
seventy-five twenty-five because <{><[>predominantly <O>inaudible 2
words</O></[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Seventy-five twenty-five what's</[></{> that mean
<#\>Seventy-five
<$B> <#\>Seventy-five for the exam and twenty-five for the
essays because a lot of people have done really badly in the
essays and they think they're gonna do better in the exam
<$A> <#\>Do you think that's likely
<$B> <#\>Well I don't think they're gonna do better in the
exam no <#\>Because they they didn't seem to know what they were
talking about in the tuts half of the time<,,> <#\>See the thing
is
<$A> <#\><{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$B> <#\><[>the thing is</[></{> most people do the same in assessment
as
they do in the exam <#\>But people don't usually get <{><[>better at
it</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>They well they should</[></{> but 
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>You you would expect some kind of um comparison
favourable comparison
<$B> <#\>Yeah especially when it's the same person marking it
<O>laugh</O>
<$A> <#\>Yes
<$B> <#\>exactly
<$A> <#\>And and the exam is a prepared question
<$B> <#\>No ahh it's three parts <#\>The first part is we have
to write about the theory of of literary discourse and stuff
and that's straight out of the text book so that that's really
the easiest one in some ways <#\>And then the second part is um
writing about set passages <#\>It's a comparison of two passages
<#\>And then the third part which only the third year people have
to do the second year people don't have to do it um is writing
about a set passage <#\>You don't get any choice in it you just
have to write about that passage<,> <#\>That's right we've had
effectively we've had an assessment on each of those three
<$A> <#\>Right
<$B> <#\>So it should be quite interesting
<$A> <#\>How many candidates doing it altogether <#\>Less than
fifty
<$B> <#\>Well it's really hard to tell <#\>I thought there were
about um about fifty or sixty day students and about fifty
evening students but there've only been about twenty people at
the lectures so I don't I don't know how many people <{><[>are
doing it</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>So it's hard to</[></{> tell
<$B> <#\>I'm not sure if people have dropped out or they're
just not coming to the lectures <O>inaudible 4 words</O>
<$A> <#\>Yeah you always get moths at this time of the year
<#\>A lot of those are hatching on the plants in the garden
actually
<$B> <#\>I got one in the car today and it was hitting me <#\>It
was flying around inside the car 
<$A> <#\><{><[><O>inaudible</O></[> 
<$B> <#\><[>And I</[></{> couldn't even go out because it was
raining <#\>I just couldn't get it to go out
<$A> <#\>Causes accidents <#\>Bees in cars cause accidents
<$B> <#\><O>laugh</O> It wasn't a bee <#\>It was just a moth<,,>
<#\>Actually I like the literary discourse thing because almost
everybody doing it are literature students<,> completely
literature 
<$A> <#\>Right
<$B> <#\>So they don't know about the um,
<$A> <#\>Oh so that's 
<$B> <#\>Know that the um
<$A> <#\>The the linguistic people
<$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>Well it's not not that linguistics is really
that helpful but they're not used to writing about language
they're only used to writing about stories<,> <#\>So<,,> might
be
useful
<$A> <#\>Do you know enough about stories 
<$B> <#\>Mm
<$A> <#\>to write about them
<$B> <#\>Oh yeah because I did um a complete second year of
literature <#\>Like I've got my eight credit points of second
year literature which is all they have
<$A> <#\>Do you count that as a sequence in in literature
<$B> <#\>Yeah<,> <#\>Ah yeah I can count it <O>inaudible 2 words</O>
if I want to
<$A> <#\>So how many what's your sequence of literature then
<$B> <#\>Well ah see it doesn't work like that because I
don't have any other third year literature <#\>So it would only
count if I was doing a coherent major in literature which
would mean I'd have to have three subjects in literature at
third year level
<$A> <#\>So if you want to do a sequence in literature what
else would you have to do
<$B> <#\>Well I'd have to do another two subjects basically
in literature but the thing is<,> someone said that you can't
add subjects to your arts degree after you've graduated so um
if I choose to graduate
<$A> <#\>You're not going to graduate till you've done your
law
<$B> <#\>No you see if I chose to graduate after doing
honours then I wouldn't be able to do it but the thing is I'm
not going to graduate until I finish law anyway because that's
what everybody does</I>
