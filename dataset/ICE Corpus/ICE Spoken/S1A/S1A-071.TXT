<I><$A> <#\>A lot of women do housework
<$B> <#\>Oh that's the hardest job in the world
<{><[><,></[> to be a mother and
<$A> <#\><[>The hardest</[></{> 
     <#\>A mother<,> <{><[>plagued with children</[>
<$B> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O> housework <#\>That is so hard</[>
<$C> <#\><[>But what what's housework<,> <#\>What's housework</[></{> <#\>You were talking about this earlier
<$A> <#\>Housework
<$C> <#\>Yeah <#\>What's housework
<$A> <#\>It's something that takes me about an hour and a half
a week <#\>I dunno what all the fuss is about to be quite
honest <#\><{><[>I manage to do all the cleaning all the ironing</[> all the washing
<$C> <#\><[>Well what is it what do you do</[></{>
     <#\>What what <{><[>do you clean</[> <#\>How do you
clean
<$B> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O></[></{>
<$A> <#\>Very superficially <O>Claughs</O>
<$D> <#\><{><[><O>inaudible</O></[>
<$B> <#\><[>To really</[></{><,> to really um<,> run a
house you should really go and do um <{1><[1><,> a home
management</[1> <{2><[2>course and then you'd</[2> really run
it well or<,> the hosp the hospitality course that they do at
Ryde <{3><[3>you know</[3>
<$A> <#\><[1>Home management or something</[1></{1>
<$C> <#\><[2>Yes<,> <#\>I agree</[2></{2>
     <[3><O>Claughs</O></[3>
<$A> <#\><[3><O>Alaughs</O></[3></{3> <#\>What's that old saying
<#\>One man's work is another man's poison <O>Blaughs</O>
<#\>I think it's all to do with attitude
<$D> <#\>One man's meat is another man's poison
<O>Claughs</O>
<$A> <#\>If that turns you on, sure<,> <#\>Croissant
<O>Claughs</O> or<,> poissant <O>Dlaughs</O> <#\>What word's
that
<$D> <#\>Er<,> fish<,> in French <,,> <#\><{><[>It's a
joke</[>
<$A> <#\><[>I I remember that</[></{> wonderful statistic
that 85 per cent of the people in Australia<,,> hate the work
they're doing<,> but<,> they haven't got the<,> intestinal
fortitude to change and go and do something else
<$B> <#\>Yeah but the thing is you see you either go to work
because you want to do that work or else you work so that you
then have the money to do what you want to do so I think you
have to decide you either work<,,> to achieve something else
or else you work<,> at what you really love to do 
<$A> <#\>Yeah <{1><[1><,></[1> <#\>In other words you either
work because you've got to<,> <{2><[2>or you work because you
want to</[2>
<$B> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Yeah<,> yeah</[2></{2> <#\>Some peop  
<$A> <#\>I work because I want to<,> <{><[>so I</[>
<$B> <#\><[>Some people</[></{> just want to make the money
so that on on their days off, their recreation time they can
do what they want to do <#\><{1><[1>Some</[1> some want to<,,>
want to go<,> snow skiing or flying planes or<,> doing those
sort of things<,> <{2><[2>and they need the money<,,> to do that</[2><,> or else you want<,> if if you want to just be
um<,,> fill in your day being<,,> something that really
doesn't pay but it's you've got a mad passion to be<,> like
the famous artists and
<$A> <#\><[1>Sure</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>That's right <#\>And they go off to work to get
the money</[2></{2>
     <#\>Sure<,> <#\><{><[>They love <O>inaudible</O></[>
<$B> <#\><[>They've just got an</[></{> absolute passion to
do music or painting or<,> whatever it is and they don't care
about <,> the financial rewards but it's just a passion that's
in them and it's they just have to do it it's just in their
blood and it's their whole life and their whole being just
wants to do that<,,> 
<$D> <#\>Some people work to live and others live to work
<$B> <#\>Yeah
<$C> <#\>What sort of <{><[>work</[> do you do
<@>forenameA</@> <,> 
<$D> <#\><[>Attitude</[></{>
<$A> <#\>A variety<,> because having<,> found out with work
that if you put all your eggs in one basket <O>Alaughs</O> you
crack one egg that's the end of the basket <#\>All the eggs
are gone <#\>So now I write<,> and I thoroughly enjoy what I
write
<$C> <#\>So it's not <{><[>really working</[>
<$A> <#\><[><O>inaudible</O></[></{> <#\>I don't regard
it
as work <#\>I regard it as uh a vocation that I enjoy
doing<,> <#\>To earn the money<,> I do something else because
there's you don't earn a lot as an author <#\>Very few er
there are very few Thornbirds er written er and sold for one
point seven million dollars film rights and if you only write
<,,> non-fiction books there's not too many non-fiction books
that have been serialised and so er<,> to write is really a
hobby<,> that also brings in<,> um<,> money <#\>I'm a stock
and station agent for three days of the week<,> where I sell
hobby farms and bush retreats to people that hate what they're
doing in their work in the city and they want to escape<,> so
I actually provide them with an escape<,> and I find you know
good escapes <{><[>for them</[>
<$C> <#\><[>So your work</[></{> becomes their pleasure<,>
and their leisure
<$A> <#\>That's exactly right <#\>And yet it's not my work<,>
because every property that I find for somebody you know I've
really researched it <#\>I've asked them a lot of personal
questions <#\>I've probably seen them<,> a dozen times
<$C> <#\>That's it you actually go out and find a property
<{><[><,> for specific people and what</[>
<$A> <#\><[>Oh yes<,> <#\>My word<,> and ah<,> you see</[></{> a lot of people don't really know what they're
looking for <#\>They want a hobby farm<,> and then you say
<quote>well what sort of a hobby farm</quote> and they've
never really crystallised their thinking to know what they want
because they've never even put the criteria down on paper
<#\>So the first thing I get them to do<,> is to write down a
description of the property that they're looking for<,,>
<#\>Sometimes I see them three months later<,> and they still
haven't got it down on paper<,>  <w>'cos</w> they really don't
know <{1><[1><,></[1> but that I enjoy doing that because then
I crystallise their thinking or help them do it<,,> and
then<,> we go and<,> <{2><[2>find the property</[2>
<$C> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>It's interesting</[2></{2> <#\>I think it's like
living a<,> a little fantasy <#\><{><[>Sort of you get to go on</[> a little dream and 
<$A> <#\><[>It's not a fantasy</[></{>
     <#\>The last lady by<,> well<,> the last lady wanted an
ostrich farm<,> so I had to go off and first learn about
ostriches <{><[><,></[> to find out where ostriches live
and what they eat and then<,> when I found out what ostriches
where they survive best<,> I had to find where that particular
terrain of the land was<,> and then I took her to three blocks
and she bought one
<$C> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{>
     <#\>Wow
<$B> <#\>And has she got the ostriches on it
<$A> <#\>The whole one hundred and twenty thousand dollars
worth
<$C> <#\><{><[>Wow</[>
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> because that's one of the best
um<,> financially rewarding businesses<,> at the moment <#\>I
read I read an article <{><[>about it</[>
<$A> <#\><[>At the moment</[></{> <#\>At the moment
<$C> <#\><{><[><O>inaudible</O></[>
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah <#\>And just the</[></{> price of the eggs
are a fortune <{><[><,></[> because ev every single part of
the ostrich can be used
<$A> <#\><[>Oh they are</[></{>
     <#\>Yes<,> everything <#\><{><[>It's like an ass</[>
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah<,> <#\>Every single thing</[></{>
<#\><{><[>Yeah</[>
<$C> <#\><[>Really</[>
<$A> <#\><[>Eve eve</[></{> even the the beak
<{><[>and</[> the feathers the flesh <#\>The oil under the
skin is an aphrodisiac and<,,> you know<,> it's mind boggling
actually to know what all the part actually all the parts of
ostriches are used for
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{>
     <#\>There was an article in the Australian about that
<$A> <#\>Yes<,> <#\>It was ah this lady and now
<{><[>there's another lady whose <O>inaudible</O></[>
<$C> <#\><[>She must've read the same article</[></{>
<$A> <#\>It's interesting because uh there's there's uh
there's two blocks side by side<,,> and this other lady that's
come along I'm trying to get her to buy the block next to the
first lady that I sold the ostrich farm to <#\>Then there'll
be two ostrich farmers together <#\>I've just put two
horticulturalists together<,> uh on both sides of a of a river
<{><[><,></[> so that they can go and talk to each other
about their their trees and I try and do this <,> because I
think it's more than just selling a block of land
<$C> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{>
     <#\>Yeah <#\><{><[>It's a community thing</[>
<$A> <#\><[>And I think that's</[></{> that's were the work
situation comes in <#\>If I was a real estate agent and
<quote>I've gotta sell another six houses today
<{1><[1><,></[1> and how boring</quote><,> <#\>And to be
quite honest if I had to sell six houses a day I'd be bored
stiff<,> <#\>And so I like<,> because I like the outdoors
<{2><[2><,></[2> this is really turning a love that I've
always had<,> into a money making concern<,,> but I love doing
it and I'm helping other people<,> get their<,> fantasy their
dream <#\>I used to love that tee vee show<,> um<,> on the
island where the people went to work out their fantasy 
Fantasy Island 
<$C> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2>    
     <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>And everyone had their fantasy<,> <#\>And one of my
fantasies is that I'll start a fantasy<,> island and do just
that and help people live out <{><[>their fantasies</[>
<$C> <#\><[>Oh wow</[></{>
<$A> <#\>Ah well probably it's a crazy idea because it takes
but it's come from<,> you know working through what I would
like to do <{1><[1><,></[1> ah because of what I'm interested
in<,,> and what I was interested in at school<,> as a young
person and then through my twenties and thirties<,,> <#\>And
then I also run a little tourist resort<,,>
<{2><[2><O>inaudible</O></[2>
<$C> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>Sorry <#\>How did you start this</[2></{2>
other business <#\>How did you <{><[><,,> become involvedin this</[>
<$A> <#\><[>Well I<,> the first one one that <@>forename1</@> and I were</[></{> involved in for a few years collapsing around
our ears because of the number of terrible financial
constraints that were put on<,> from government er<,,>
etcetera <#\>But we won't go into that will we <O>Alaughs</O>

<#\><@>forename1</@> and I both loved our work at that stage but the work
was curtailed because of er economic circumstances <#\>That's
probably the best way of putting it <#\>And then I found
myself having lost everything <{1><[1><,></[1> and you start
again<,> <#\>And when you start again and you're forced to
look inwardly<,> and say <quote>now hold on <#\>What am<,>
what am I gonna do</quote> <#\>You know <quote>how am I going
to<,> build up what I've lost <#\>It's taken me twenty five
years<,> of work to get where I am now <#\>How do I now get
that back again<,> without taking another twenty five
years</quote><,> <#\>And so you've gotta work<,> smarter<,>
not harder<,,> and so three years of bankruptcy<,> has now
taught me to look at about a hundred different opportunities
and decide what the three or four different opportunities are
going to be that I enjoy doing <#\>And it its really come as
a<,,> trial and error <{2><[2><,></[2> and it's uh it's great

<#\>Er the last little seg segment the fourth<,,> piece of the
jigsaw puzzle came<,> with a bag load of nickels also<,,>
through ah <#\>It was long distant cousin <#\>We both
originally came from Cornwall<,>  so we found out
<$C> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2>    
     <#\>Really
<$A> <#\>Yeah yeah <#\>So it it's quite staggering
<O>inaudible</O> sort of both of us<,> both of the same name 
<#\>It confuses everybody<,> <#\>And uh he's got this<,,> two
storey<,> log cabin on the Colo River that he now<,> rents
out<,> as farmstyle holidays to Japanese to<,> inbound
tourists and whoever wants to use it <,> <{><[>at enormous</[>
<$C> <#\><[><O>laughs + inaudible</O></[></{> I couldn't
imagine them a family of Japanese sitting on the Colo River<,>
<{><[><O>inaudible</O></[>
<$A> <#\><[>Well then</[></{> of course I started with a
little<,> company taking people on bush walks<,> canoes<,> 
horseriding<,,> and so now I've combined that <,> with uh
renting them the place to use as a base and then we go and do
all these fun things <{1><[1><,></[1> and I've got nine guides
nine casual guides <{2><[2>to help with the work</[2>
<$C> <#\><[1>Wow</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Do do you advertise</[2></{2>
<$A> <#\>No
<$C> <#\>They just come to you<,> find you
<$A> <#\>They came <#\>Well when when I say we don't advertise
um<,> other people've advertised for me and I've piggy-
backed<,> from their advertising <#\>Though I refuse to spend
all the money on the advertising<,> I get the people in the
long <O>inaudible</O> and there's a big notice up in the farm
you know <#\><quote>Here are the list of activities you can
do</quote> and the cost of all the activities<,> and they ring
me up and say <quote>I'd like to do this this this and
this</quote>
<$C> <#\>Great
<$A> <#\>And it's fabulous<,> <#\>So that's that's to me work
has gotta be enjoyable <,> <#\>It's gotta be something that
you can put your whole heart and soul into<,,> and you've
gotta have that attitude when you get up in the morning<,,>
<quote>fantastic have a great day</quote> and you look you
look at your diary and think <quote>ooh you know this is this
gonna is be real like a real memorable day</quote>
<,> <#\>And if every day can be memorable one
after the other<,> you know so<,,></I>
