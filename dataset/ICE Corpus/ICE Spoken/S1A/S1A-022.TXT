<@>Forename11</@> came and got you<,,>
<$B><#\><[>uhuh</[></{><,,><#\>We were having lunch at the
studio <{><[>and</[> normally if you have lunch and then you
go back after lunch everyone finds this I think you
<$A><#\><[>mmm</[></{> that you're sleepy
<$B><#\>Yeah you can't concentrate and I thought I don't
want this cause I was almost falling asleep anyway cos
<$A><#\>a full stomach's not good for working
<$B><#\>Yeah and it was pitch dark in there and
<{><[>so</[> I thought I'll ride my bike around at lunch and
I was riding it and now I mean I ride my bike <@>Forename10</@> 's
bike with no hands but now I can stand up on the pedals 
<$A><#\><O>laugh</O>

amusing <O>laugh</O>
<$B><#\>well I wasn't go oh yeah<,>  yeah but that's not
when I fell off my bike
<$A><#\>Oh when did you fall off it
<$B><#\>When I went to turn a corner
<$A><#\>Oh right
<$B><#\>Cause it just slipped out from under me and I just
went skidding and everyone came running and I said
<quote>don't run just go away cos</quote> I didn't want all
that attention I felt so <{><[>ashamed</[> 
<$A><#\><[>especially</[></{> if you're going to cry
<$B><#\>And ah so yeah and then <@>Forename11</@> gave me a lift
and then I got to the studio and<,,> you know did did the
show and then as soon as the show ended I felt this incredible
pain in my leg from falling over <{><[>I</[> didn't feel the
pain until after the show and in my elbow and I suddenly felt
the flu take over me 
<$A><#\><[><O>inaudible</O></[></{> and you felt like crying
<$B><#\>Yeah I was wandering around with tears in my eyes
and I was just and if anyone asked I was just going to say
<quote>oh I just put my eyedrops in it's just eyedrops right
</quote>and I was in a bad mood and I <{1><[1>wanted</[1> to
get of there and the pub was closed and everything and someone
was going back to <@>Forename11</@> 's place for coffee and I
thought I don't want to drink coffee and I was in such a bad
mood so I just came home and for the first time in years I had
instant sleep <{2><[2>I lay</[2> down and fell asleep
<$A><#\><[1>yeah</[1></{1><[2>wow</[2></{2> So do you have
trouble getting to sleep normally
<$B><#\>Well this week I haven't touch wood I'm so
<@>Forename7</@> has and I haven't and usually <@>Forename7</@> gets to
sleep straight away and I don't
<$A><#\>wow
<$B><#\>But normally I lay awake for hours and hours and
hours but I think I'm finding the secret to getting to sleep
<$A><#\>Mmm must being so exhausted that when you get there
you can't think about not sleeping
<$B><#\>Mmm
<$A><#\>Wow so you managed so suppress all that misery and
agony until <{><[>you finished performing</[> 
<$B><#\><[>yeah and I didn't even know I was</[></{> and I
feel like I feel like I did real shit work you know I feel
like I let everyone down again I feel
<$A><#\><@>forenameB</@> you feel like that every time you perform
<$B><#\>I know I feel totally <{><[>hopeless</[> 
<$A><#\><[>I wish</[></{> I'd gone so that I could have had
could've given you an opinion <{1><[1>cause</[1> you can
safely ask me whereas I know you feel self conscious asking
