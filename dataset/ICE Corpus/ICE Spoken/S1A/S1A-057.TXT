apparently<,> the<,,> what do they call that<,> that ox<,,>
oxywelding<,> caught fire <{1><[1><,></[1> and<,> they went for the fire
extinguishers and when they got the fire extinguishers there
was nothing in the fire extinguishers <{2><[2><,> so</[2> they couldn't
put out the fire <O>Blaughs</O>
<$A> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>Oh really</[2></{2>

up on
the top
<$B> <#\><[>No</[></{> <#\>Up on the top <{><[>I think</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>On the very</[></{> top
<$B> <#\>Somewhere up on the top I think <#\>I don't know <#\>I
didn't
hear much about it but<,,> anyway<,> that was the harbour
bridge

did
they get that get the fire <{><[>out</[>

probably would've been in peak hour<,,> but<,,> it was on
the<,,> actually is was<,> it wasn't on the news I don't
think <#\>It was a news flash between the news reports <{><[><,></[>

<$B> <#\>No <#\>He didn't have the drip <#\><{1><[1><,></[1> <#\>Well I
don't think
so <#\>I didn't see any drip<,> <{2><[2>but I</[2> didn't stay <#\>I just
went
sort of in and out and when they were all there<,> I took the
flowers and put them in water for them<,>

     <#\>Did you get in contact with the doctor<,>
<$B> <#\>No <#\>I haven't seen the doctor
<$A> <#\>Oh<,>
<$B> <#\>It's hard to see the doctor unless you're there<,> right

talk to doctor ah <@>surname8</@> is it <@>surname8</@> <,,>

<$B> <#\><[1>Yes</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>Yes</[2></{2> 
     <#\>Yes<,,> <#\>But it hard to get<,> to see the doctors
'cos
they're so busy<,,> and getting around to being busy<,>
they're building another hospital <{1><[1><,,></[1> <#\>In the<,,>
southwest I <{2><[2>think<,></[2> In the southwest

another couple of hospitals I think<,> to service<,> the<,>
<{><[>area</[> <O>inaudible</O>
<$A> <#\><[>Really</[></{> 
     <#\>'Cos it's a long way
<$B> <#\>That's<,,> when you go out the Hume highway you go
through Gordon don't you
<$A> <#\>Yeah<,> <#\>Oh no <#\>You don't have to go that way
<#\>You can go
the back way
<$B> <#\>Yes<,,> <#\>It's still a long way<,,> when they've got
hospitals already here <{><[><,,></[> for convenience
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{>

really good and exciting and everything<,> and um<,,> and he
said that I'd be really good for the position<,,> for the

have to be interviewed by the people who are<,> the actual
legal company <{><[><,> the</[> firm<,> and um<,,> yeah so I I was I

<$A> <#\>Here's the window cleaner <{><[><,></[> <#\>He comes to Newtown
as
well but he charges more at Newtown<,,>
<$B> <#\><[>Yes</[></{> 
     <#\>What <#\>'Cos he's gotta go across there

<$A> <#\>Forty two dollars
<$B> <#\>Forty two dollars <#\>Yeah
<$A> <#\>For the whole lot<,>
<$B> <#\>Yes<,> <#\>It's nice <@>forename1</@> has got a set
like
that<,,> that she got when we were down<,> going through
Goulbourn one oh well trip down to Canberra
<$A> <#\>Oh<,,>
<$B> <#\>And she found this<,,> ah <{><[><,,> shop</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>Oh I remember <#\>You were</[></{> <#\>Yeah <#\>And you were
going to
buy a coffee set
<$B> <#\>Yes <#\><{1><[1>I go I</[1> got the coffee set <#\>Yeah <#\>It's
quite nice
but it's a bit useless 'cos it's only the<,,> the coffee<,>
jug<,> and<,> there's a<,,> I think a<,,> sugar and milk<,>
little sugar and milk <{2><[2><,></[2> jug <{3><[3><,> to go with it</[3> <#\>No cups
with it <#\><{4><[4>Mmm</[4> <,,> <#\>So you really need cups to drink
coffee
<$A> <#\><[1>Oh you got it</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>Oh</[2></{2> 
     <#\><[3>Oh so there's no cups</[3></{3> 
     <#\><[4>Mmm</[4></{4> 
     <#\>Well I would've thought so
<$B> <#\>Yes<,,>
<$A> <#\>I wish he'd clean the inside window as well
<$B> <#\>Oh well that's a bit difficult
<$A> <#\>Yeah<,,>
<$B> <#\>You'd only do that when you'd<,> cleared the whole
window
area and <{><[><,,></[> and that'd be a long job<,,>
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> 
     <#\>Mmhmm<,> <#\>Anyway<,,>
<$B> <#\>Well I'd better get going now <@>forename1</@> <,> so

<S1A-057b> <359>
<I><$A> <#\>Where are you going to <#\>Which part
<$B> <#\>Um<,,> well I thought we'd better go and do the touristy
bit<,> because no one'll believe her unless she's taken a
photograph of the three <{><[>sisters</[> <O>Blaughs</O> <#\>And then I
thought we could either do<,> a walk called the<,> castle rock
walk but that might be a bit long 'cos it's about eight hours
<$A> <#\><[>Exactly mmm</[></{> 
     <#\>Is that the one where you go down the scenic railway to
start off
<$B> <#\>No<,> no <#\>The castle rock's along a ridge<,> actually
<{><[>it</[> doesn't start at Katoomba<,> but I thought Wentworth
Falls might be nice<,> <#\>Straight down to the falls and<,>
wander around and then<,> straight up again
<$A> <#\><[>Right</[></{> 
     <#\>That's<,> that Valley of the Waters <{><[>isn't it </[><#\>Yeah
<#\>Mmm<,,> <#\>Yes <#\>I I think that's a really lovely one
<$B> <#\><[>Yes<,,> Yeah</[></{> 
     <#\>Yeah<,> yeah <{1><[1><,></[1> I thought that might be the
nicest<,> especially now with spring <#\>Hopefully they'll be
flowers <{2><[2>and<,></[2> beautiful things
<$A> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>Yeah yeah</[2></{2> 
     <#\>Plenty of leeches <#\>Better take a thing of salt with you
<O>Blaughs</O> 
<$B> <#\>Yeah <#\>I wonder if they have leeches in Holland<,,>
<$A> <#\>Prob'ly not<,,> <#\>It's <{1><[1>not</[1> <,> sort of warm enough is
it <{2><[2><,></[2> <#\>Leeches are sort of tropical<,> type things aren't
they
<$B> <#\><[1>Mmm</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>No</[2></{2> 
     <#\>Yeah<,,> <#\><{><[>How</[> weird
<$A> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{> 
     <#\>Oh well
<$B> <#\>Oh I hope we meet some then <#\>I'd like to see how some one
who's never met them reacts <O>ABlaugh</O>
<$A> <#\>Delightful<,>
<$B> <#\>Mmm<,> well<,,> <#\>Mmm<,,> <#\>Do you<,> you live in Sydney
don't you <#\><{><[>Not out here</[> 
<$A> <#\><[>No <#\>I live in</[></{> the mountains <#\><{><[><,> <#\>In Springwood</[> 
<#\>Yeah
