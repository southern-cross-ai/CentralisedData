so everything she advocates is just so um utopian and and
idealistic and she doesn't like she says all this stuff and
then like you you happen to bring up a point about how you
want to put it into practice like you happen to say <quote>Oh
that's all very well and good but you know what do you want us
to do</quote> and she's like <quote> well um um we we really
don't know but tha tha that's that doesn't stop us from um you

<$C> <#\><[><O>inaudible 2/3 words</O></[></{> 
<$A> <#\>She's talking about <@>Forename6</@> being Socialist

<$B> <#\>of my a lot most of my friends are extremely left
wing <{><[>at university</[>

she doesn't want to be labelled <#\>I remember<,> last year when
they wanted her to stand the Left Alliance ticket<,,> and of
course she ended up getting the chair but<,,> she was very
concerned about that <#\>She said <quote>Mum I don't want to be
labelled anything aligned with anybody</quote> <#\>She said
<quote>This is what I believe</quote> you know 
<$B> <#\>Mmm

this Left Alliance business</quote> <#\>Well now of course after
her twelve months' experience she's going to carry on as part
of the um Student's Council <#\>They're only twenty-one in number
and 
<$B> <#\>Mmm
<$C> <#\>She wouldn't let the let the side down like she said
<quote>No I have to put in a lot of work because what will
happen to the Left Alliance if I don't you know it's up to
me</quote> So you know
<$B> <#\>Mmm
<$C> <#\>It's happened now but she originally didn't um want
to be affiliated strongly with any<,,>
<$B> <#\>Mmm 
<$C> <#\>particular area <#\>But there you go<,,>
<$B> <#\>Mmm <#\>It's um <,,>
