<S1A-042> <2001>
<I><$A>   <#\>I'm more interested in girls than language
<O>laughter</O>
<$B> <#\>Girls<,> <#\>Oh okay<,> fair enough
<$A> <#\>Will language help me get laid <O>laughter</O>
<#\>Will my new found communication skills <O>laughter</O>
<$B> <#\>Well what well you're on the
wrong track really aren't you because if it was going to help
you there you would've been doing<,> this particular speech
experiment with one of those people over there
<$A> <#\>Well I was hoping to <O>laughter</O>I'll just check
it out before we go<,,> <#\>No not seriously<,> <#\>I just
have a fertile imagination
<$B> <#\>Mmm<,> <#\>So how long've you been studying for<,,>
<$A> <#\>Um<,> this time<,> um<,,>
<$B> <#\>This time <#\>That sounds familiar
<$A> <#\>Yeah <{><[><,> ah</[> <#\>Since this
is my second<,> year
<$B> <#\><[>Rings a bell</[></{>
     <#\>Is it
<$A> <#\>Yeah <#\>So Second semester second year<,> part
time<,> <{1><[1><,></[1> <#\>Before that I when I
left school I went to law school for two years but I just
hated it <{2><[2>really badly</[2> <#\>Yeah<,> <#\>Yeah <#\>So
I ended up failing<,> and they kicked me out
<$B> <#\><[1>Right</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2><O>inaudible</O></[2></{2>
     <#\>Mmm<,> <#\>Well if you didn't wanna be there then
it's not like it's not surprising is it 
<$A> <#\>Oh yeah and like you're seventeen and stuff and
<{1><[1>you just wanna</[1> <#\>Yeah <{2><[2>and you
just<,></[2> but you just wanna um<,,> <#\>I
dunno <#\>I just wanted to drink a lot of beer<,> and smoke a
lot of pot<,> and you know<,> hump a lot a girls<,> and just
you know generally have a lot of fun and<,> you know<,> <#\>I
just wasn't ready to go to school anymore <#\>I'd had enough
of it you know<,> <{3><[3><,></[3> <#\>I prob'ly would've<,,> <#\>I
dunno <#\>When you're seventeen or sixteen or whatever you don't um<,> you have no real idea of what what what your course is gonna be about<,>
so you <{4><[4>blast into</[4>
<$B> <#\><[1>You get bored</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>There's that word again</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Mmm</[3></{3>
     <#\><[4>What<,></[4></{4> what life's
gonna be <{><[>about</[>
<$A> <#\><[>Oh yeah</[></{><,> yeah<,> <#\>So I saw like<,>
doing law as<,,> a possibility of like becoming a social
crusader and that sort of thing which was all highly
idealistic but it had nothing to do <{1><[1>with with doing a law</[1> <#\>Yeah <#\>But it had
nothing to do with doing a law degree<,> <{2><[2><,></[2> so<,>
<{3><[3><,></[3> <#\>But I was just too naive and too<,,> I guess
immature to to<,> rationalise that at the
time so I just um<,,> um<,,> sort of thought that I was
hanging in there but in the end I just wasn't putting the
effort in and<,> that was the end of that so<,,> <#\>Yeah
what about you <#\>Is this your second time around too
<$B> <#\><[1>Totally unrealistic</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Mmm</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Yeah</[3></{3>
     <#\>oh second<,> third <{><[>something like that</[>
fourth <#\>God I don't know how many times it is now<,,> but
this it's different this time<,,> <#\>Like
like you I went off to college after school<,,> and I was
just<,,> pretty restless pretty fucked up 
<$A> <#\><[>Third<,> yeah</[></{>
     <#\>There's that word again 
<$B> <#\><O>laughs</O> And um deferred for a while and<,>and um<,,> yeah
<$A> <#\>How many different sorts of courses did you try 
<$B> <#\>Well I actually haven't done that many <#\>I started
actually doing communication about ten years ago<,>
<{1><[1><,></[1><,> <#\>And um<,> did about a year of that
<#\>deferred<,> <#\>And the next time I went back I
went I did business<,,> and um batch<,>
started<,> a degree in bachelor of business<,,> you know<,>
<#\>I wasn't very happy with that <#\>I was studying in in Toowoomba<,> where I was working<,>
<{2><[2><,></[2> <#\>Oh where I've been working<,,> <#\>And<,> you
know finally I've come back to the same course I started ten
years ago<,> just with a totally different attitude and and totally<,,> <#\>I guess I've grown a
lot now and<,> doing it for different reasons<,,> and I'm
getting a lot out of it now <#\>It's good<,>
<$A> <#\><[1>Right</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Right</[2></{2>
     <#\>Yeah<,> yeah <#\>I'm I'm<,>to me
it's just a good thing um<,,> to have ah<,,> a different kind
of<,,> stimulation or input coming into your head<,,> other
than what you would normally pick up either around your
friends or around your work environment <#\>You know what I
mean<,> <#\>Like you just um<,,> <#\>Like I mean obviously
you you want<,,> your your brain to be stimulated in some way or other
<{1><[1>or</[1> you wanna learn about things <#\>I mean<,,>
when<,>it becomes more<,,>more than just coming here to get a degree
and <{2><[2>and</[2> so that you can go
somewhere else and get a job<,> <#\><{3><[3>You</[3> know I
mean obviously<,> like<,> both of us have had jobs and we've
both got jobs you know<,> <{4><[4><,></[4> so a and I I suppose<,> behind it
to a point<,> it's like um<,,> you hope that that that the degree or what you learn will either help
you in the job you do or give you an opportunity to get a new
one<,> <{5><[5><,></[5> but but mainly
for<,> well mainly for me it's just um<,,> yeah
having<,> my brain get bigger and being able to talk to<,>
interesting people<,> and stuff <#\>You know so it's like a
social thing too in a way 
<$B> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Yeah</[3></{3>
     <#\><[4>Yeah</[4></{4>
     <#\><[5>Sure</[5></{5>
     <#\>It's stimulating <{><[>isn't it</[>
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> it's good
<$B> <#\>It really is stimulating <#\>I find<,> the people
here are very smart<,> both the students and the lecturers<,>
<{><[><,></[> <#\>Well okay not all the students but
they're but many of them are<,> very smart
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{>
     <#\>And do you find you also<,,> now that you're older
you have a chance of getting more out of it <#\>Like 
<$B> <#\>Oh a hell of a lot
<$A> <#\>You're not<,,>it's easier for
you to go up and ask a lecturer about stuff<,> and they know
that you're just like not<,> in their pocket to get extra
marks so they're<,> you can front them
more easily <#\>I feel more comfortable doing that
<$B> <#\>I feel a lot more comfortable with myself just
generally<,> <{1><[1><,></[1> <#\>Five hundred percent more than when
I was <{2><[2><,> here the first time</[2> <#\>I s'pose it's
just just totally different
<{3><[3>like</[3> <#\>My energy is more focused on on learning<,> than on<,> being a you
know a young adult teenager cum
young adult you know<,,> <#\>What's going on and and and ah<,,> all mixed up inside <#\>You know where
am I going <{4><[4>and</[4> what is life<,> <{5><[5><,></[5> 
<$A> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Yeah<,> yeah <#\>The same with me</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Yeah</[3></{3>
     <#\><[4>Yeah</[4></{4>
     <#\><[5>Yeah</[5></{5> <#\>Yeah<,> <#\>How'd you go with the competitive thing
because like I see <w>'cos</w> I work in the in
the student's cafe<,> right<,,> there's you
sort of<,,> you see that there's a real competitive
element amongst the younger people <#\>I don't really care
<#\><{><[>I mean about that</[>
<$B> <#\><[>I don't care<,> <#\>I'm not</[></{>I'm not competing with them
<#\>And it doesn't it doesn't seem
to've bother me in<,> what marks I get you know <#\>Like that
I don't like where they go <quote>oh I've gotta get a seven
<#\>Gotta get a seven</quote> you know it just<,>
<$A> <#\>I couldn't care less <#\>I really don't care <#\>The
only person that I'm<,> <#\>I'm not even competing with myself
but I'm stretching myself<,,> <#\>You know I'm<,,>I'm ah<,> just trying to grow so that I can
succeed<,> <{1><[1><,></[1> <#\>Just allow myself to succeed and
enjoy it<,> <{2><[2><,></[2> but for myself I<,,>if other people are getting sevens and
sixes<,> it does actually it does spur me
on <#\>I looked at the results in the paper<,> and I saw that
there were quite a few high achievers<,> and it did make me
stop and think well<,,> you know I'm going to have to work<,>
<$B> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2>
     <#\>Oh<,> yeah sure
<$A> <#\>And um<,> <@>Forename1</@> <@>Surname1</@> one of the lecturers
actually said to me<,> <#\>I I wanted to
enrol in some subjects but I couldn't make it to any of her
lectures <O>Alaughs</O> so she she had
a a few blunt words to say about
<quote>life's not like that any more</quote> you know
<#\><quote>You can't just cruise through and get a pass<,>
<{><[><,></[> and expect it to count with an employer because it
doesn't</quote><,> <#\>So that did<,,> snap me open a bit 
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{> <#\>How do you find getting<,>
time together to do<,>to do your work
<$A> <#\>I don't do much work<,> basically 
<$B> <#\>Yeah <O>ABlaugh</O>
<$A> <#\>I do the minimum<,> but um<,,>that's
required<,> but um<,,> when I do work I<,>
<$B> <#\>I mean the study work <#\>You mean are
you talking about that
<$A> <#\>Iohyeah I only do
assignments<,,> sort of basically
<$B> <#\>Yeah see now I do I chip away a
little bit all the time
<$A> <#\>That's sensible <O>Alaughs</O> you know
<#\><{><[>That's</[>
<$B> <#\><[>Well yeah</[></{> and though but see I'm lucky
because<,> I'm<,> in<,> at at my work
<{1><[1>five days</[1> a week right <#\>So I<,,> now can say to
myself well look<,> I'm either gonna go home and sit in front
of the box<,> or I'm gonna go<,> in the pub<,> and sit in
front of the bar<,> or<,,> like I can save money and and ah maybe learn something <#\>So I
just I just figure well before I go home I'll
just go and sit in the library for an hour or two hours or
however long I feel like<,> <#\>You know and so<,>so then you just look at the course outline and
the lecture and you and you look up you
know and you read a couple of things<,> or you just read the
textbook even <#\>You know it's just an opportunity to read
the text <{2><[2>and</[2> 
<$A> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Isn't it</[2></{2> isn't it
amazing<,> how just reading a textbook <O>Alaughing</O> makes
it a lot easier <#\>Yeah first time I've done it
<$B> <#\>it can get you yeah<,> <#\>Isn't it
<{><[>incredible</[>
<$A> <#\><[>First time</[></{> ever <#\>Yeah
<$B> <#\>Yeah<,> <#\>I mean<,> I know I used to think it was
that the these people who're getting good
marks must just be so incredibly smart
<$A> <#\>Yeah but nuh <#\>They'd just read the book
<{><[><O>Alaughs</O></[>
<$B> <#\><[>They'd just read the book</[></{><,,> and done
the work<,> <{1><[1><,></[1> and that's all that's to it<,> <{2><[2><,></[2>
you know
<$A> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2>
     <#\>Yeah <#\>That's it <#\>That's <{><[>the</[> same
with me
<$B> <#\><[>And if</[></{>
     <#\>Yeah and if you're a bit older I think and you have
a<,>a broader perspective of things<,,>
then when you have to do an assignment or a presentation<,>
your brain is that little bit broader<,> <{1><[1><,></[1> and it
makes it easier to do something<,> original and inventive<,>
<{2><[2><,></[2> just being older<,> <{3><[3><,></[3> <#\>So being older and
reading the book 
<$A> <#\><[1>Yeah</[1></{1>
     <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Yeah</[3></{3>
     <#\>Yeah <{><[><O>laughs</O></[>
<$B> <#\><[><O>laughs</O>Yeah<,> yeah</[></{><,> <#\><{><[>Yeah I</[>
<$A> <#\><[>It just</[></{> makes it much easier<,>
<{><[><,></[> <#\>It's a bit
<$B> <#\><[>Yeah</[></{>
     <#\>Yeah<,> <#\>It's the first time I've ever done it<,>
<#\>First time I ever actually <{1><[1><,> created  a
steady a study</[1> <O>Blaughs</O> <#\>Yeah
<#\>I think they do <O>ABlaugh</O> <#\>I don't think anybody
takes any notice<,> or some people do but<{2><[2><,></[2>
<#\>And sometimes um<,> I find when I start reading<,> I get
motivated<,> and I think<,> this is interesting <{3><[3><,></[3>
<#\>Not always <#\>I mean some of it's a bit heavy but<,,>
it's it's it's inspiring to read to read
some more <{4><[4><,></[4> <#\>and I think<,> I'm actually
learning something <{5><[5><,></[5> at my age<,> <{6><[6><,></[6>
<O>Blaughs</O> <#\>Well<,,> <#\>You know<,,> <#\>Yeah <#\>It's
good<,,>
<$A> <#\><[1>They should tell people about this</[1></{1> 
     <#\><[2>Yeah</[2></{2>
     <#\><[3>Yeah <#\>It is</[3></{3>
     <#\><[4>Yeah</[4></{4>
     <#\><[5>Yeah</[5></{5>
     <#\><[6>Yeah</[6></{6>
     <#\>So you wanna be a journalist<,> yourself<,>
<$B> <#\>Yeah um<,,> <#\>I'm still not a hundred percent sure
<#\>I<,>I kinda feel<,,> that
I've that I might like to<,> be a journalist
more now after having done with the subjects than than I did when I  started <#\>When I first<,,>
started this course up I just wanted to um<,> learn to write a
lot better than I do or did<,,> and ah that was
so<,> and I looked at it from the point of view
that<,> journalism is a<,>aha very strict
writing discipline<,> you know <#\>So<,> you must<,,>the system that you're work in like either
newspapers or ma <#\>it would depend upon the magazines but
newspapers and magazines<,> <#\>You are<,> forced to be able
to<,> rationalise your story line<,> very quickly<,> and get
it down on paper clearly and logically and in a a good linear manner <{><[><,></[> so that whoever
is reading it understands exactly what's going on <#\>Um<,,>
I've always written like a bit of<,> well I hate the word but
creative writing right <#\>So I've written short stories and and poetry and that sort of crap
<$A> <#\><[>Mmm</[></{>
     <#\>Why do you hate the word<,> <#\>Why do you say
<mention>crap</mention><,>
<$B> <#\>I just think it gets over used that sort of stuff
<#\>It puts a<,,> <#\>Maybe I'm pre-empting yours and
everybody else's um um<,> interpretation <#\>A lot of people
if you<,> <#\>I've had a I've said it to a
lot of people that I've you know I've
been writing various things right <#\>And all of a sudden they
sort of go<,> <quote>whoa weirdo weirdo</quote> <O>Blaughs</O>
<{><[>you know</[>
<$A> <#\><[>Yeah but if you</[></{> say it's crap<,> then r then right away that's the reaction
you're gonna get
<$B> <#\>No no no <#\></I>
